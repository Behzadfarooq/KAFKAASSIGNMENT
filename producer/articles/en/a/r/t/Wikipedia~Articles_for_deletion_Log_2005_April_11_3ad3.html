<ul>
<li>It depends on how notable the product is. If its a product that has entered the public conciousness, then it should be kept. If it is an obscure product or brand that no one has ever heard of, it should either be merged to the article on the company or deleted.

<ul>
<li>It is very notable. Every time people say Sprite, they think of this drink. Sprite has used many famous people to promote their product and it is very heavily influenced our culture and trying to exploit it to earn a few dollars. Plus, as I mentioned before, I still think the page is an invalid listing, since the nom. has voted keep (or merge). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 02:09, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>This article is basically a footnote to the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">Economics</a> article, and ought to be merged in (if it is in fact correct).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article as a stub after running across red wiki links to it in a few economics articles. It's a very important concept in finance/economics/accounting. After it was VfD'ed, I did a little work on the article to touch it up, but I don't want to give the impression of trying to alter the vote. There are quite a few core concepts in economics that can be described as footnotes, but they don't merit deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debit.html" title="Debit">Debit</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_%28accounting%29.html" title="Credit (accounting)">Credit (accounting)</a> are both simple accounting concepts, but they shouldn't be aggregated into <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">Accounting</a> as footnotes.<a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 02:24, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Hey, if you can make a decent article out of it, go for it. As I initially saw it, I don't think it needed its own article. On the other hand, if it can be described simply with a single line of text or two, might it better belong in Wiktionary? -- <a href="../../../d/c/f/User%7EDcfleck_50ba.html" title="User:Dcfleck">Dcfleck</a> 02:29, 2005 Apr 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>in the spirit of honest VfD, I'll refrain from doing a major touchup until after VfD is finished. I expect that most people will vote keep... it not, I'll add writing a thourough article to my to-do list. In my opinion, it's more than a dicdef, because it applies to several diff. economic frameworks w/ different effects on analysis. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a>

<li>I agree. I never saw him play much, but anyone who followed baseball in the 1990s at least heard of him. We have articles on players who are much more obscure than Mickey Morandini. I don't think we should delete those and we definitely shouldn't delete this one. I see that six articles link to it anyway, so if it were to be deleted, it would just be a matter of time before it was created again.

BTW, I'm getting a bit concerned about the way that voting breaks down in VfD. Megan1967, when was the last time you voted to keep an article on VfD? Kappa, when was the last time you voted to delete one? Are there people who go through and just answer "keep" or "delete" on everything? <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 09:49, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well if someone is significantly more liberal than the Vfd average, most of their "delete" votes on "notability" issues will be superfluous, even if they agree. I don't need to vote delete when there's obviously a consensus to do so, that just clogs up the system. (Likewise with less-liberal voters). If I'm the first person around I sometimes vote delete, e.g. Halover. The problem is that we all agree people need <i>some</i> notability, but not how much. Incidentally I've seen Megan1967 make many significant "keep" votes. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:49, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While there are occasionally people who always vote the same without any explanation (recently-banned Recycling Troll comes to mind), Kappa and Megan certainly aren't among them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:16, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. And to be fair, although I disagree with both of them much of the time, I have seen Megan1967 vote keep on a few things, and Kappa vote to merge material on occasion. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 19:33, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article as currently written does not accuse the government of his death, but rather reports others accusations: "The Nakuru Diocese claimed in the local newspaper...". The governments version is also reported. The article seems to me to be NPOV.

The relevance of Alexa rankings and Google results has been argued a hundred times before and I do not propose to repeat them; I have however already demonstrated that these criteria have not been applied to other comedy site articles. Some fans of the site have listed a few links with the mainstream media which although not compelling on their own, do build a case for inclusion. The initial reasons for deletion given by <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> are therefore not to my mind valid. The contributors who recommend a speedy delete appear to be unfamiliar with wiki policies themselves (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>) and proposing to block the article from recreation seems rather drastic given that it is not in any way offensive. The page does not conform to the criteria for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity_page</a> and I have to sincerely ask whether some of you have read the article or this encyclopaedia's policies.<b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 21:51, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to summarize, the reasons for deletion seem to be 1) Clone of SomethingAwful 2)Been deleted before 3)Not notable. All three have been thoroughly refuted. 1) It has been established PWOT is older than SA, and in any case the arbitrary comparison is hardly grounds for deletion. 2) It has also been established that the older incarnation was substubs, created by an entirely seperate entity from the current entry. 3) Of the two people who have claimed it is 'not notable', neither have exhibited any knowledge of the content of the site itself. PWOT has been mentioned by Penny Arcade, The Guardian UK and has strong ties with National Lampoon. The goal of Wikipedia is to create a compendium of knowledge, this wiki does not go against that goal, in fact actively supports it. At best it needs to be cleaned up a little, deletion is completely out of the question. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtolmazel_01ba.html" title="User:Atolmazel">Atolmazel</a></li>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b>.</s> <i>Note — user changed vote to delete.</i> This site has been online longer than most of those posting in here have. On a good day, there can upwards of approx. 30,000 hits on a popular article. An editor for a nationally recognized publication is a regular on the site. "John Dies at the End" will hopefully be released sometime in the future in a published form. The site itself has enough solid ground to support a wikipedia article (especially when something as inane as zombo.com is already a part of wikipedia). Have those that want the article deleted proved anything to the contrary? Have they even visited the site? Read the articles? If not, then how can they possibly make a claim to the validity? They cannot. Instead, they resort to childishly flinging notions of "sock puppeting" (unfounded) and the constant editing of the original article (Which was written by a "newbie" from the site, and was not approved by neither David Wong nor John Cheese, the site owners). As stated before, a quick check of each posters IP will show that we are not merely one poster trying to advertise his personal site. If any of the nay-sayers wish to continue to fling the sock puppet rant around, you can personally look me up at the Grinnell College website (<a href="http://www.grinnell.edu" class="external free" title="http://www.grinnell.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.grinnell.edu</a> - email for name) to prove my existence. And yes, this is my only edit. I felt the need to sign up and protect Pointless Waste of Time from people who, without reason, wish to delete this thread. (EDIT: Forgot name.

<ul>
<li>"Y'all are confusing ad hominem arguments with ad hominem fallacies: identifying the source --and probable unreliability thereof-- of an assertion or argument is perfectly reasonable rhetoriacl technique."</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorrect; if someone has made an error, the only correct response is to point out the error so that those who haved erred have a chance to refute the argument. Calling their experience in to question does not allow for the opponent a rebuttal, therefore it is not an acceptable debate technique. In any case, the article in question has still not been proved to have violated any of Wikipedia's regulations, ergo there is no reason for it to be removed. As for WP not being a "web guide," the precedent has been set many times before, and this new addition does not violate it. See: <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landover_Baptist_Church_f80d.html" title="Landover Baptist Church">Landover Baptist Church</a>, <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombo.com.html" title="Zombo.com">Zombo.com</a>, et cetera.

<dd>See, that falls under a different rhetorical fallacy, namely "begging the question," whereby you assume the conclusion you're arguing for.

<li>Certainly. Read <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a>. In particular, WP is not a general knowledge base.

Thus, not every webpage deserves a WP article, and the argument that <i>some</i> webpages have an article is no grounds for giving <i>all</i> of them an article.</li>
<li>Then, read <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. Votes from new or anonymous users are generally discounted to prevent exactly what people have been doing here.

Both are called sockpuppetry, and this thread is obviously being socked.</li>
<li>It has not been established that PWOT is anything special amongst the thousands of other similar forum-and-text sites.

As I've said in other places, which the new accounts would obviously have not read since they've never been to Wikipedia before the campaign to keep this article, if an article can't stand on its own merits, but must rely on the invalid votes of people who came here solely for the purpose of voting keep, then it does not deserve an article on Wikipedia.

<li>like many things in wiki, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> tries to convey both sides of something without editorial bias, thus "<i>consequently, some articles that are deleted are arguably more meritorious than others that have been kept.

I feel the information in <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is useful to both "sides" in this discussion, and was providing it for the benefit of all who cared to read.

<p>Sorry John, I already believe that it's you, but the problem is on Wiki votes, it doesn't just matter if you are who you say you are, - and not a "sock puppet" - but we don't really count votes from people who have done nothing but vote on this one thing. I'm happy to count your vote, but it's not just up to me. I'm sure it will influence a lot of votes anyway, such as mine.</p>

<li>I've been a wikipedia contributor for a pretty long time, and a PWOT regular. I don't know what a mole troll is, and it sounds unflattering, but Bakudai has been fairly non-insane regular over there; he's not just stirring up shit for the sake of it. And while of course I can't speak for anyone who's vandalized the site, I will add that most of us have no interesting in pissing on the wiki. The PWOT forums have a very large user base, but the (apparently substantial) number of vandals make up a small minority. <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> <a href="../../../t/l/o/User_talk%7ETlogmer_36b4.html" title="User talk:Tlogmer">(Talk)</a> 02:19, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>When I posted a fairly nice note to Bakudai, he immediately reposted it onto the PWOT boards, with the suggestion the he was "gaining my trust". I would have ignored it, but the fact that he referred to me as "Cockwork" suggested that his intentions were not entirely honorable. Unlike most of those that vandalized here, his block is of finite duration. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 02:24, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I missed the main (newer) thread on this whole mess on PWOT -- I'd been reading the older thread -- so I didn't see all the stuff about directed vandalism. And while I have to admit that I find PWOTers vandalizing the PWOT wiki entry kind of funny, vandalizing other pages on the wiki isn't cool. Do what you have to do; I don't have the time or energy to follow this properly (especially since it's the weekend now). <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> <a href="../../../t/l/o/User_talk%7ETlogmer_36b4.html" title="User talk:Tlogmer">(Talk)</a> 02:40, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alright, I'm changing my vote to <b>Delete</b>. John, half the PWOT writing team, has stated clearly several times that he doesn't want the article on here. The wiki doesn't have to obey his wishes, of course, but he's really fucking motivated and him and his followers will suck up a lot of your time and energy if you're determined to keep the article here. I'd say you're faced with a choice:
<ul>
<li>Delete it. Your troubles will end instantly. (Of course, you'll have appeased people you don't want to appease. They're people obsessed with this particular issue, though, not general-purpose vandals who'll give you trouble in the future.</li>
<li>If you're too worried about setting a bad precedent by caving in, you could go to war: contact John's ISP, etc. Obvisouly I don't want this to happen because I really like his writing and the more time he spends fighting silly legal battles the less writing he does. I don't think you'll get him to cave any other way, though. <a href="../../../t/l/o/User_talk%7ETlogmer_36b4.html" title="User talk:Tlogmer">(Talk)</a> 02:55, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article may need improvement but that is not grounds for deletion and I can find no other grounds (it is not vanity and it appears to be notable, albeit mildly, by association). I found the article quite (in the UK sense) interesting. Oh, and if John Cheese could refrain from suicide in the event of the article being kept, I would be grateful. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 23:43, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>After thinking about it for a while, it's pretty borderline (although the temptation to say "keep", to stick it to the twerps who hang out on that board, was one I had to work on to resist). It's just one more web-based electronic community, and on the edge as to whether it's notable enough for an article. (And it's basically irrelevant whether Cheese wants it gone or not - since when did we let the subjects of our articles tell us whether or not we could have articles on them? He gets one vote, same as everyone else.) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:15, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alright. I nominated this thing, I figure it's time I finally took a stance. Originally, I only listed this because I thought that was the proceedure for previously speedied articles. However, several point have been brought to my attention. Firstly, the speedied articles had 1-2 sentences, so these were definatly not the same article (my bad). Combined with the cited claims to notability provided above, I don't see a convincing enough case for deletion. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 03:33, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Half the writing team wants it deleted, the other half knows of the situation and has put forth no objections to the deletion request. The point is, by deleting the entry you are hardly 'giving in', the votes were <b>clearly</b> heading in the delete direction. By then voting the opposite way once John Cheese says he wants it deleted is childish and asinine. Don't bother stating that I am a new user. I am a new user, I registered to submit my desire to have this article deleted. 5 Days is up.

<li>I'm not particularly happy with it, as it's rather hard to make a song that cannot be construed to refer to (or answer to) another song, and several of the entries are wildly speculative (e.g. The main guitar riff of "Top Of The World" by Van Halen sounds like the riff heard at the end of "Jump" by the same band). Bands often refer to themselves, their fans, their predecessors, anything. And note that said list diverges widely from the definition at <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answer_songs.html" title="Answer songs">Answer songs</a> (if your point was that 'referential songs' is a better title, I fully agree). I'd prefer to have the relevant trivia covered under the articles on the bands (or albums) - e.g. "the song &lt;foo&gt; by this band is often regarded as a parody (etc) of &lt;bar&gt;." <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:23, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no significant content, unclearly defined list. Please note that "answer songs", by contrast, were a real phenomenon in recorded music, primarily in the blues and R&amp;B genres. "Answer songs" had a clear definition: not "something in the song could be construed as referring to some other song", which is unverifiable and can't form a complete list, but "song was written as a direct response to a song popular at the time, and whose lyrics make that clear." <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_answer_songs.html" title="List of answer songs">List of answer songs</a> is legitimate and belongs under its current title; nobody seems to have called them "referential songs". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_answer_songs.html" title="List of answer songs">List of answer songs</a> contained a too-broad definition which included merely referential songs, I've edited that article and its talk page. Help would be appreciated in trimming non-answer songs from that list.

<li>Question: Could someone explain me what is the difference between the terms? "Grand Master" with capital M is always a title, "grandmaster" or "grand master" can be used either as a title (when capitalized) or as a noun for person who has high level of ability in something, is this correct?

<li>It is a disambiguation page here, and different organizations use different spellings for this term. In chess "Grandmaster" is the normal term, but "Grand Master" is used at other places.

<dd>How does it subvert the meaning of the word Anarchism? Maybe you're just trying to monopolize the use of the word. Everybody knows there are two broad categories of anarchism ..left and right. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:10, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is a vast body of litterature that refers to anarchism in the sense of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. There's a historically significant movement of people that have referred to themselves as anarchists, not 'left-anarchists'. Renaming the anarchism article to 'left-anarchism' is historical revisionism, it implies that there's always been a left/right divide in anarchism. Even now, with anarcho-capitalism being a notable political theory, the left/right divide is a simplistic way of pointing out the differences. The world does not neatly divide into two categories. If the terms 'left anarchism' and 'right anarchism' are indeed notable, they should be explained in a historical context. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.203.115.12.html" title="User:80.203.115.12">80.203.115.12</a> 13:30, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>whats the real reason to delete this? It's not kevin and mike promoting, my name is chase, I'm a member of Dibbz, and I wrote this, no I'm not promoting. I'm writing an entry for a free encyclopedia. It's not self-promotion, I'm just writing about it to inform the gamers of New Orleans (where I do live) that there is more than one LAN center in the city. It's also not a year old yet. And for the specs section, I just copied it from their site, which is why it says "what games do <i><b>we</b></i> have?" and if you noticed earlier on i did say "<i><b>Here's how they list their specs:</b></i>" You people are messed up, with your copyvio and self-promos, im just writing to inform people, and besides anything that i get from their site, i have permission for it--i know Kevin and Mike personally - Chase 01:03, Apr 11, 2005</p>

<li>Wikipedia is not just for gamers in New Orleans.

<li>I have to say that the cleanup tag made me chuckle. This article has the prefix "techno-" occurring in every single sentence, sometimes more than once. Upon reading it, the phrase "high-faluting gibberish" came to mind. If there is such a thing as "technocriticism", this article does little to describe it, or even to narrow it down from "everything" to any great degree. I notice that 63.203.72.70 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.203.72.70_bc9c.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.203.72.70">contribs</a>) has edited both <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioconservatism.html" title="Bioconservatism">bioconservatism</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/c/Techno-progressivism.html" title="Techno-progressivism">techno-progressivism</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> reads like semi-random words strung together. Excerpt: "<i>The technoethical dimension of technocriticism undertakes the public deliberative engagement of multiple contending stakeholders to the problems of technological development</i>" I find it hard to imagine that anyone, anywhere, actually talks or writes like that.

<li>Gosh, I grant the language wasn't the clearest in the world, but is some of this hostility directed at what varieties of critical theory really do care about whether everybody likes it or not, or is it all really about what a terrible writer and fraud I apparently am?

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a matter of "notability" or "fancruft", but rather just bad information. I have no idea what this is supposed to refer to. There are no ship locations in the original Metroid, so the article's statement to the contrary is just plain wrong. There is a wrecked ship in Super Metroid, but the instruction manual of the game itself explicitly states that this ship is from an ancient exploratory expedition and has nothing to do with the Space Pirates. Metroid Prime has a Zebian ship in it as well, but this is some kind of research ship that is also never identified as a mothership. This article is poorly written, full of unsubstantiated speculation, and should not be kept or merged under any circumstances. If one is going to vote to keep an article on wikipedia, one should at least do enough research to know whether the subject actually exists or not. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 07:03, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do see your point, and to a certain extent, agree with it. However, how many Wikipedians have 40,000 unique page views per month and have released their own album. I understand you have to separate the wheat from the chaff here, and not every bonehead with a website can be included, but for someone who has that many pageviews and actually recorded her own CD, one would think that would take her out of the realm of "some person with a page" to "internet personality", no? Spazholio
<ul>
<li>Not really. Pageviews alone are a weak indicator of notability, and besides that 40K a month isn't really that high. <a href="http://www.starblind.com" class="external text" title="http://www.starblind.com" rel="nofollow">My website</a> had 50,484 hits last month according to WebTrends, and I certainly don't consider myself either an internet personality or worthy of an article. Having recorded a CD is nice, but as far as I can tell it seems to be self-released. Anyone with a CDR drive, some freeware, and a $3 PC microphone could technically record their own CD in a couple of hours if they really wanted to. Radiant said it best, there has to be some sort of notability before an article on an "internet personality" can be seriously considered. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:24, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just saw this in my stats. I didn't submit it myself, and the text of the entry is taken from my bio -- maybe it could be edited a bit to be less self-promo-sounding.

I'd like to correct that the 40k reference above is <i>unique monthly visitors</i>, not page views, which is roughly half a million.

<li>I would agree that school articles should be improved as much as possible, just as any article should. But he makes no mention of "notability," only verifiability. Granted, lots of these schools start out as horrendous articles by anonymous users who just want to brag about their school.

<dd>Of course we can have those things over schools <i>for completion</i>, because, unlike schools, we can actually have a complete set. Pokemon are finite. Even since they've introduced more than the 150, the number is hardly large enough to cause a problem. Albums are also finite, the <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">criteria</a> the artists have to meet take care of that - we can never have too many, because the bulk don't meet the inclusion criteria. What you idiots don't seem to realise is that, unlike Pokemon, major albums, major computer games, major characters from RPGs, railway stations, etc. without defining a much stricter set of criteria than "<i>if it's real, it can stay in</i>", schools are <b>not</b> finite. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> infinite (as those of you who have actually <i>read</i> <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINP_a8ac.html" title="WP:WINP">WP:WINP</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a> properly will know), thus we need to restrict the articles we have. We can include things "for the sake of completion", because we know we have something we can complete. We can never hope to document every school in the world ever - it's physically and logically impossible, as well as making Wikipedia unmaintainable and a print edition unfeasible.

<p>Despite a number of attempts to get this page changed from a campaigning anti-power plant page to a NPOV description of the project, the principal editor continues to use this to promote a POV opposed to the planned development. He describes himself as a "member of the resistance". This would be OK as a Personal Page but not as a Wikipedia article.</p>

<li>Update. The article has not improved during its time on VfD. I live in Toronto and haven't heard of the controversy, but that could be because I'm spending too much time on Wikipedia.

The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/499_US_340.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/499_US_340.htm" rel="nofollow">U.S. Supreme Court doesn't</a>. Facts can't be copyrighted. It is a fact that The Simpsons came in at #1 on their list, and that Aladdin came in at #17, just as it is a fact that Joe Schmoe was a subscriber to Rural Phone Company and that his phone number was X. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 00:59, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because it's coverage of a documentary. Whether the list itself is a copyvio, I don't know. In the U.S., bodies of facts when compiled a certain way are in fact defensible (for example, CDDB).

<li><b>NO VOTE</b> because I'm undecided, no wait, that's not it, because this is obviously a highly watched television special about a popular subject matter which offers a trove of interesting and informative information about the history and popularity of cartoons. Perhaps 'No vote' because this is, without a doubt, the most inane example of an attempt to trim any wikipedia content that wouldn't make it into a print version. GIVE UP ALREADY.

<li>I think it a list like this could be copyrighted as an "original selection and arrangement" of facts, especially if there were a lot of them, like weekly Billboard charts. But in this case, I think it's fair use, as the list is a small part of the program, and anyone seeing this list is going to be more likely to want to watch it. Channel 4 puts the results on their website <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, so internet surfers aren't going to be watching the program just to find out the results. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is a genuine documentary; the article has the same name as the programme; there are many similar 'top 100 poll' articles on Wikipedia, and if <i>stating the result</i> is a copyright violation, then that surely calls lots of source material used throughout Wikipedia into question.

<li><b>Keep</b> its a notable TV program. I don't think that its a copyvio as the complete lists of the results of these sorts of polls are often published in newspapers and have been since the start of C4s obsession with these sorts of list programs in the late 1990s - if C4 wanted to enforce any copyright they had on the lists they'd have done it by now.

<li>The reason it is referenced on so many pages is that the person who invented Majority Choice Approval contributed to most of those pages.

<li>Never mind about VfDing the others. After a bit of Googling, it seems that Mike Ossipoff's criteria have been quoted by numerous websites.

The book, "At the Threshold of Liquid Geology" is published by iUniverse.com, where anyone can get there book published, yet this does not require the need for mention in an encyclopedia article since the book is already being sold online. Wikipedia is being used to promote this book, see the policy on advertising and spam. The author, Eric W.Bragg has 719 google hits, his website surrealcoconut pulls in a lot of internet traffic due to the use of meta-filters and mirrors along with aggressive internet promotion. Note that the website is a free do-it-yourself site. Keep in mind that this book is a commercial product written by an unknown and non-notable author, and this is an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> as advert, spam, and not notable. I tend to be pretty liberal when it comes to including published authors and their works, even obscure ones. However, I don't feel that this extends to the vanity press, who will publish pretty much anything (for a fee, of course). Wikipedia is NOT for the promotion of vanity-press books. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:02, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Query</b>. How do you qualify a "real" author? Is an author who sells, say, 1000 books out of a major publisher given preference over one who sells twelve hundred out of a P.O.D. house, even though the non-mainstream author's sales would say he's more popular? How many books does an outsider author have to sell to warrant wikification? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Iconoclast_bf11.html" title="User:The Iconoclast">Iconoclast</a> 23:35, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't quite speak for every wikipedian, but the general consensus is that vanity-press books don't count as published books, since as I mentioned they will publish (almost) anything for money. For works with actual literary merit, there's plenty of publishers out there, from mainstream to local to tiny indies, and anything remotely decent WILL get published if the author tries hard enough. I hate to make harsh statements like "no real author would use a vanity press", but that's basically the truth. Just ask any writer or anyone in publishing what their opinion of the vanity press is. And I also don't support any arbitrary sales figure for notability of authors or books, 1000, 1200, 2000 copies, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:41, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
