<p>I could go on, but I have no more time. In all of these, the usage was consistent. If you want to delete the article (which would be inconsistent with the other two articles, and I'd bet others, the term is common enough to deserve mention in the article with the debate about Wal-Mart at the very least. I find it curious that I'm the first to weigh in as a "keep". Is there a campaign going on?==<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBeth_Wellington_f704.html" title="User:Beth Wellington">Beth Wellington</a> 00:39, 1 March 2006 (EST) (Signed manually on 3 March with information from history page.

<li><b>Keep/(transwiki + mege)</b> This makes a reasonable short article. Arguably it's more appropriate to Wiktionary, but could be refatored into a wictionary and section for Walmart. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 10:51 <a href="../../../2/_/m/2_March_72dc.html" title="2 March">2 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep &amp; Improve</b> The large part of the user who has, unfortunately, not signed has convinced me that it's important to keep the article while some improvement has to be done, probably with the inclusion of the links the unsigned user has given. I sure hope the many entrances saying "delete" aren't part of a campaign steered by WalMart (the first of them seem to have come within minutes, that looks, to me, slightly suspicious). Also, while "Walmarting" is a neologism that's how many of the words we are using today got started. The word describes a certain way to deal with suppliers which could be - and probably is already - copied by other companies. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxl_4726.html" title="User:Maxl">Maxl</a> 14:33, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I initially nominated this article for deletion when it was about two minutes old, but then I googled the term, and see that it does have varied usage. And also, to be honest, I've used the term myself. It is new, but I really feel like Walmart is becoming eponymous a la "google" and the article is worth keeping.--<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d">Esprit15d</a> 17:43, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It may not be an expression used by many right now, but I think its usage will grow when more people become aware of the supermarkets' role in the globalization. For instance, during the last few months the British newspapers (and TV) have started reporting about the growing concern in the UK for the role supermarkets have in both killing local shops and squeezing suppliers around the world - and they frequently credit WalMart for having introduced the current supplier squeezing, making the Brits very aware of WalMart (which was virtually unheard of earlier, although WalMart owns one of the big UK chains, Asda). <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 23:24, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still think this article should be deleted, because it describes an unstable neologism. However it's good that you've improved it. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:44, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a>. Do you and I differ only on whether the term is unstable? As I noted in the external links, there is at least usage going back to 1999. That's seven years. Multiple definitions do not make a word unstable. Look at <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/28/K0002800.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/28/K0002800.html" rel="nofollow">"Kafkaesque"</a>, for example. Interestingly, when I looked up Walmarting for a definition just now, here is the first reference I found <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Walmarting" class="external text" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Walmarting" rel="nofollow">"Walmart is not available in the general English dictionary and thesaurus. Try: Wikipedia encyclopedia."</a> Evidently, wikipedia is relied on by those in the online dictionary biz.--<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBeth_Wellington_f704.html" title="User:Beth Wellington">Beth Wellington</a> 19:19, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Stubble</b> is Josh Mirman's second and longest running webcomic, starting in 2000. It also had 2 spin-offs, a mini-series for Keenspot, The Misadventures of Timmy and Yin-Yang, a story about Roland Warui, the series antagonist.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Crossovers happen all the time in webcomics, they like to help each other out and crosspromote their work. Having a crossover with a piece of work does not make it any more notable. There may be other reasons why this comic is notable/non notable, but the argument you put forward isn't the most convincing. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 03:37, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>For a little exposition: This is a clear case of "argument vs. guideline". Without prejudice to the <i>quality</i> of the arguments to keep here, which are reasonalbe enough, it's more appropiate to look for broader consensus in such an event. Any one AfD draws a very small sample of interested users, but by widening the sample and running a few more days we can more accurately guage community feeling. This drew in a few of the regulars (ahem, e.g. me) but more eyballs is always better. That's all.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> actually, it is probably better to relist it now and get a clear consensus. A true Keep would be a strong argument against a future AfD whereas a No Consensus basically means we will have this exact same conversation again in a few months when someone else comes across Stubble (webcomic), sees that it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> miserably, and pops it up for AfD. I still support deletion, but if keep is the consensus, perhaps an info box in the discussion page stating that will avoid a rehash of this.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:03, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And if it <i>doesn't</i> get clear consensus now? Relist it until it does? No. It sets a bad precedent. We're not working on deadlines here, so there's absolutely no reason why we can't revisit the issue in a few months. At least that will give the article time to improve and establish notability. That typically doesn't happen under the gun of AfD, after all. And, if in a few months it <i>still</i> looks like a nn stub, then it only strengthens the case for deletion. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 15:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it doesn't get clear consensus this time then it will sit for 3 months, it will get AfD'd again, it will still not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and it will get another no consensus. Rinse and repeat. Sorry... I'm a cynic. I don't have a problem with 1 relist to break a no consensus. If this is still an obvious no consensus after that though I would refrain from a second relisting.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And a cynical perspective has what place exactly in a project that strongly encourages the assumption of good faith? It's not as if this was an article created by a redlink newcomer, after all.

Let's see how many players will play when TT introduces version 0.49, and after that, a new development cycle: release often. OH AND! I almost forgot! Darn you! Ah, yes, the mod has appeared in several gaming magazines! Oh, darn. Well, gaming magazines are for teenage slugs, so that isn't notable? Naah.. I guess you win, after all. This reminds me of some mod I'll AfD soon: <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_Territory_Fortress_7fd6.html" title="Enemy Territory Fortress">Enemy Territory Fortress</a>; only 20 players maximally play it a day. But hey. Ah, guys, don't worry, I'll code a quick perl script to AfD every game that hasn't hit the shelves or that you have never heard of. Take it as a favor from a friend. I agree with you that mainstream is full of games like SC, CS, ET, AoW, BF2, HL2, GarrysMod. By that I mean the quality shows and cool game ads that MTV plays and which 14 year old teen girls like. Wikipedia is after all mainstream! It's a good idea, indeed. Who wants un-trendy, un-hip, un-advertised subjects on Wikipedia? I don't! Wikipedia would save so much HD space and it will do only good! Anyways, guys, it's very early in the morning, so I'm going to go to bed now - school tommorow (technically today) at ten.&#160;:) (The reason why I posted slightly in socratic irony and sarcasm is because it cheers me up a bit, anyways, that wasn't meant to insult anybody, I just pointed out how narrow rationals people use to judge notability. You have research in order to even find something like a small segment from a few articles in a few magazines that I personally can't get (scans excluded), and as a good ol' fan of TCE, I provided you evidence, and I hope you that this is enough for a consensus.) <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">Wikilove</a>--<b><font color="#FF4F00">nlitement</font> <sup><a href="../../../n/l/i/User_talk%7ENlitement_5351.html" title="User talk:Nlitement"><font color="#000000">[talk]</font></a></sup></b> 02:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You say that it is really a good idea to insert the whole article into Enemy Territory, something like inserting every game article into <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">Video games</a>? You don't seem to really understand: is a mod not worth its own articles if it has so many external websites and communities, even reaching such popularity as far as in South-Korea and Japan? Talking about ET mods, ETPub is vanity, and ET Pro should be a <i>merge</i> since it is not even a full-conversion mod (like True Combat: Elite - which would be plain stupid to merge into a section) but a general gameplay enchancement mod. Does anyone of you even have an idea of what <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_Territory_94aa.html" title="Enemy Territory">Enemy Territory</a> or "video game" is? --<b><font color="#FF4F00">nlitement</font> <sup><a href="../../../n/l/i/User_talk%7ENlitement_5351.html" title="User talk:Nlitement"><font color="#000000">[talk]</font></a></sup></b> 20:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Retain. Page clearly demonstrates the importance of the individual with respect to MIT, both World Wars and the Manhattan Project.

<li>I read the article. The notability you speak of isn't self-evident, and simply asserting it doesn't make it so. I saw someone with a respectable but not distinguished career in the military, at MIT and in private industry, one of many chief engineers with one company that worked on the Manhattan project. It isn't disrespectful to say there are many like him. I understand that notability is somewhat subjective--this is just my judgment.

<li>Of course, no one "accused" anyone of bias "just because" he referred two related articles to AfD. Try giving it another read. Dozens of individuals who were distinguished vets of WWI and II, chief engineers on the Manhattan projects, authors and instructors at educational institutions as prestigious as MIT. Sure.

<li>Please don't misunderstand me--it's an interesting story, and he sounds like an incredible person. The question is whether he has any larger significance that would make him noteworthy enough to belong in an encyclopedia. I'm sure we all have people we would like to celebrate. And if I'm off-base and other editors here think he deserves an article, great. That's what consensus is all about. But you're not helping your case with your sarcasm, condescension and distortions of what other people are saying (I never implied he was "average," for instance). Look, this is a big and busy place, and it is under siege by people who are trying to get their pet idea or club or hoax or newly-minted slang term or favorite teacher here--the discourse in AfD is therefore somewhat brusque, even with worthy articles. But no one is trying to be personally disrespectful; even your adversary Arbusto. I'm sorry you feel attacked, and I appreciate your remaining relatively civil. But the question is: is the article a good article for this encyclopedia? <b><span style="color: #f33">&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #666">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>&#160;·&#160;</span></b> 05:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>User Arbusto has made numerous inconsistent edits (removing links because Wiki "is not a links page" and then adding his/her own choice of links) and seems to have a poor handle on the language (failing to see repetition in the presentation). In addition, User Arbusto objects to links to notable graduates of the institution - a standard feature of colleges and universities on Wiki. While the institution in question is not accredited (something the entry itself admits), it is mentioned on several other Wiki pages, none of which have been edited by any of the individuals User Arbusto singles out. Thus, the singling out exercise is a mere distraction, and a sily one at that. Clearly User Arbusto has not done his/her homework regarding the significance of this institution and its presence on Wiki apart from this entry. Wiki would do itself a great disservice to allow someone of this mindset to have any influence over the decision to retain an entry. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 172.152.119.232 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.152.119.232_7e4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.152.119.232">contribs</a>)].--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:22, 28 February 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>My "paranoid user routine" addresses a common -- and frankly pathetic -- tactic employed by new users who, lacking valid arguments for or feeling insecure about notability, neutrality, importance, verifiability and other such normal encyclopedic and scholarly standards for self-promotion, original unpublished research, or obsessive fancruft they try to introduce here, feel the need to resort to out of clear and apparent desperation. But, being new, you don't realize how transparent and ineffective these attempts to bully opinion are -- indeed, they often backfire -- because, being new, you don't realize how moldy and hackneyed the tactics are -- the suggestion that they be numbered is for the convenience of experienced editors who are responding to them, to save typing.

<li><b>Delete</b> since it seems that Ruckman's principal claims to fame are heading an unaccredited college (unaccredited? who'd have guessed?) and being an author; his books are published by a publisher which looks very much as if it exists primarily to publish his books. This looks like a walled garden to me. I see no credible evidence of wider coverage (zero Google News hits, for example) and though he may indeed be a figure of some note within the KJ Only movement, that is itself a minor movement. Above all, I am having serious trouble finding appropriately neutral coverage of him from reliable sources, I'd say the article is functionally unverifiable from a neutral POV, and the subject is in any case of questionable notability. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:50, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> Ruckman's statements are well-documented. He is one of the best-known polarizing figures in Christian theology. He appears to carry a lot of clout in this field. He is almost certainly notable. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 19:30, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> After doing a Google search, I found lots of articles about, referring to, opposing, supporting, villifying, and canonizing Ruckman and his teachings. There's hundreds of different sources regarding him and discussing his theological viewpoints (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is definately NOT a problem here).

<li>Of course, the notion that the person was not notable was not based on any empirical evidence. It was based on personal ignorance, animosity toward the topic, or immaturity with respect to editing. Arbusto (is that is his real name? oh it just HAS to be!) would like to frame that as a personal insult, but, really, what are the other options, given the empirical evidence. Notability should be based on information, not personal bias, ignorance or animosity.</li>

<dd>Sorry, all I'm seeing there is that some anons added some crappy POV content, which is pretty much the norm here for anons, unfortunately. What makes it <i>vanity</i>? Look, I hate Gastroturfing as much as anybody, but I think we should stick to facts and stop looking for reds under the bed, as it were. Wikipedia policy is that anyone can edit, even anons. The <i>other</i> Ruckman articles seem more clearly vanity. <b><span style="color: #f33">&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #666">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>&#160;·&#160;</span></b> 21:39, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment. I don't think the "facts" approach is useful for Arbusto/o. The individual is clearly known as "Dr. Peter S. Ruckman," but Arbusto/o would like to impose his view of how he thinks the world should be. So, he "edits" away "Dr." repeatedly. There is simply no doubt that he does not aim to inform readers of this entry, but instead desires only to impose his quirky views on everyone. Could an attitude be more damaging for wiki?</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The redlinked editors' contributions are almost entirely to this AfD, so I'm not going to weight their comments heavily. Spacelord is a major contributor to the article, so he's entitled to be heard. That said, there is a clearly dominant delete contingent with concerns over notability and reasons for creation (which may or may not be well-founded). -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I wouldn't say it was part of a publicity campaign. I honestly do feel that it is a worthwhile entry. I am acquainted with the publisher, but think about it: doesn't anyone who writes on anything have to have some connection to know about it? As far as notable, the vast majority of things on Wikipedia are virtually unknown and obscure. Is this notable: <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroy_2.html" title="Destroy 2">Destroy 2</a>? The reason I have always found Wikipedia to be interesting is that you can find reliable information on a number of things which you can't find in a standard encylopedia. If we are to delete everything that is "un-notable" then I will have a great number of proposals for the deletion pile, including the above referenced page. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacelord_d1d7.html" title="User:Spacelord">Spacelord</a> 06:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I say keep it. I went to the Alchemy press page and had myself a look see. The book comes out in February 2006.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wow, you guys are harsh -- isn't the point of WP to be more responsive and inclusive than traditional print encyclopedias? Looks like the book is legitimate, and if there isn't already an article on the term why not allow an entry in case people are looking for additional information? Seems like we should be erring on the side of inclusion if the only objection is notability, especially since the Notability essay is self-proclaimed as neither a policy nor even a guidline. - TRDriver 09:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> If anything is to be done, perhaps it should be merged into a larger article dealing with Thelemic authors. The article addresses the interesting question of whether or not Thelemites should write about the Book of the Law, a topic I find interesting. I haven't read the book personally, but aparently it is going to be out soon, and it may be of interest to Thelemites. Regardless, I don't think the info should just be chucked. Perhaps it should be enfolded into a larger article, as I said above. Kha-Sun 11:12, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Furthermore, I'm pretty sure these articles aren't even accurate. A performer is eligible 25 years after the first recording, not album. The Violent Femmes will therefore be eligible in 2007, not 2008; Weird Al may have become eligible in 2001 or 2004, but in any case, will have been eligible for some time by 2008. Cyndi Lauper became eligible last year, and David Lee Roth has been eligible for some time. The Smiths will be eligible in 2008, not 2010. Anyway, even if all these were fixed, I'd still think they should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 02:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - here we go again!. Clearly notable with his very influencial book (illustrated), particularly in the evangelical end of the church and on Messianic Judaism issues. Very quick search brings up multiple sites recommending this main title. Admitedly largely within the Messianic community but that means is is significant to them, surely that makes it notable as a text for understanding the movement. These edit wars over matters that some seem not to know anything about is beginning to get me down.

<dd>Its not clear whether this author is a notable academic. How many other books have been written in this area? How many citations for his book in a citation index? Google brings up some hits since this writer is marketing his wares. Writing a book is not necessarily notable, if it were every theologian in the world would be in wikipedia.

<li><b>I'd rather you didn't</b> seeing as it took me ages to learn how to do the code! There's lots of games from various universities that cannot be described as "notable", and furthermore if these other games can be considered encyclopedic, how is this unencyclopedic? Perhaps I understated the scale of this phenomenon by mentioning that only 16 people finished the last one. Anyway, you guys seem far more involved in the site than me and know more about acceptability so if you do decide to get rid, fair enough, but personally I can't see the harm in it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.111.42.105 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.111.42.105_7860.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.111.42.105">contribs</a>) 06:12, 28 February 2006.</small>

<li>Thanks for asking! (what follows is just me talking but I think it represents widely held views) First, a transwiki just means to move it to another wiki. <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> perhaps, or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a> might be places for it (check their guidelines first, of course). Review <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> guidelines and if this game truly meets the notability test, provide the cites from outside sources that reference the existance of the game. Interviews in national papers of the players, cites in scholarly journals of the cultural significance of this particular variant, or similar things would establish notability quickly. But if the game is truly just something you and your mates dremt up one day, it's probably not suitable for Wikipedia main article space(no offense!) Move it (or ask that it be moved) to your userspace instead. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. We'd LOVE contributions from you if they're on notable topics... the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nottingham_cfa7.html" title="University of Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a> itself, or the city of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> certainly have lots of topics you could expand and about.

<li>Dab pages are unnecessary when there's only one article called <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlaams_Belang_4b54.html" title="Vlaams Belang">Vlaams Belang</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> it's not nonsense in the wikipedia sense of that word but it is highly unnecessary to have this dab page. The other link that is currently red appears to be deserving of a mention on the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlaams_Belang_4b54.html" title="Vlaams Belang">Vlaams Belang</a> page at most as it is a reference to this political party. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is well established precedent that dab pages can legitimately have red-link content. The article should be deleted for reasons other than "it only has one live-link and one red-link", otherwise there are quite a few other pages that should be deleted on exactly the same grounds. I personally don't like this precedent, but it exists nonetheless.

<li><b>Comment</b> redlink content on a dab seems fine, it's surely not so fine when a dab exists for just one redlink item alongside one live link as that suggests there is no need at all for the dab page. Separately, I've just noticed that the only page that links here is also up for AfD. Typing Vlaams Belang does not get to this dab page. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:18, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The "ASBL vlaams belang VZW" article had a disambiguation tag on it previously, which is why I picked up on it; I believe it hadn't been edited in something like 70 weeks; if you look back at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vlaams_Belang_%28disambiguation%29&amp;oldid=20554323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vlaams_Belang_%28disambiguation%29&amp;oldid=20554323" rel="nofollow">an Aug 2005 version of Vlaams Belang (disambiguation)</a>, the notion of disambiguating this term is not new.

<p><b>Delete</b> - Non-notable - not known except by mozilla coders. Fails the "google test". In addition, the article heavily cites the unofficial "libpr0n.com" unofficial website, rather than including information from the Mozilla Foundation. While libpr0n is widely used, very few people know they are using it. It is solely (afaik) used in Gecko, and thus is non-notable in the field of programming things other than Mozilla. We don't even have an article on Necko, which is arguably more notable than libimg2. We shouldn't necessarily have an article for every component of every major computer program, unless said component is notable in of itself. Since this is arguably non-notable and since there is little to no useful content, I am nominating this for deletion. <a href="../../../z/z/x/User%7EZzxcnet_f938.html" title="User:Zzxcnet">Zzxcnet</a> 03:43, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> libimg2 is the image library for Mozilla. (Firefox) Thus, it has as many users as Firefox has. However, it is not a separate package and is only useful within gecko. It incorporates things such as libpng, which are notable - but gecko's internal code for image rendering is not notable. Just because a part of an application is given a name doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean it is notable in itself. <a href="../../../z/z/x/User%7EZzxcnet_f938.html" title="User:Zzxcnet">Zzxcnet</a> 05:01, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think I should vote since I created the page, but I created this stub after seeing the recently created <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_student_unionization.html" title="Graduate student unionization">graduate student unionization</a> page. That page links to the At What Cost? website, and it struck me that it would be better for it to link to an internal encyclopedic wikipedia page about the group. It is quite rare for a grad student union to be voted down in the USA; this vote at Cornell may have been the first time officially (or perhaps there was one other time). Plus, the "no" vote was incredibly strong. Moreover, turnouts for these sort of unionization votes are typically around 50%, but with this vote, it approached 90% (depending on what exact numbers you think you should use). I of course won't use this strong a language in the article, but it would be impossible to legitimately deny that the group had a substantial influence on both the turnout and the vote, for anyone who is aware of the events surrounding the election. I think the page will be of interest to both: People interested in things related to Cornell University. And, people generally interested in grad student unionization, for understanding an indepedent group that was able to (successfully) oppose a grad student unionization effort. It's hard for me to see how the page would not fit Wikipedia's loose standards of notability. At least give the page a little time to develop, so you can better judge whether a page about the group should necessarily not be included in wikipedia. The time that I had yesterday was only enough to barely start the page... <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfDome_cdfc.html" title="User:HalfDome">HalfDome</a> 15:31, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Does Wikipedia need an article for every curse word in different languages?

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well understood word/phrase by many, and frankly the fact that it is not an "English word" does not disqualify it. The fact that it is racist also does not disqualify it (there are entries for almost every racist word out there). In fact, as the article points out, it is no longer really racist anyway. <a href="../../../b/s/s/User%7EBssc81_d84a.html" title="User:Bssc81">Bssc81</a> 18:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> from Wikipedia. As several people said above, "it's a <i>word</i>". This is a mere dictionary definition. Furthermore, it's a definition which already exists at Wiktionary. There is nothing here other than a definition, pronunciation and usage guide. We've requested expansion several times and it remains a mere dicdef. Replace with a redirect to the Wiktionary entry. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 07:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I disagree.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless there is more cases where there's an article can also be refered to as "The Crowd". Red links or not, just having two entries in a disambig page isn't helpful at all in my opinion, and we can do without it. I do suggest starting an article with the title along the lines of Valley Parade stadium fire and then placing the content about the group of performers into the article. Strangely, I can't find any reference to The Crowd through Google. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> <sup>[ <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndylkl_776e.html" title="User talk:Andylkl">talk!</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andylkl_d01c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andylkl">c</a> ]</sup> 20:13, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Andy when I created the disambig article, I was following wiki guidelines which state that a disambig article should be created <i><b>when there are two or more articles</b></i> with the same name. Now I am reading that some people consider it counter-productive when "there are only two". I suggest that either somebody sorts the guidelines out, or we follow the guidelines. On Google, there is a link to another band called The Crowd: <i>"The Crowd is a twelve piece rhythm and blues band based in Ottawa."</i> This is obviously a potential extra disambig, if anyone ever writes an article about that group. Incidentally, I had trouble finding anything about about the 'supergroup' on Google too. I did eventually find this though: <a href="http://www.rockandpopshop.com/classic-hits.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rockandpopshop.com/classic-hits.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockandpopshop.com/classic-hits.htm</a> .. so I intend to write an article about The Crowd based on that information as a start. I do think that the disaster should have an article of its own though: it was notable as being the worst disaster in British football up until that date. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 20:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sometimes it <i>is</i> useful when there are only two. Like if there's two guys with the same name, but neither is more famous than the other and both have articles. But that's only in cases where the disambig page is the page that pops up for searches. It is never helpful to disambiguate two things at a page that says disambig in the title. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 20:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes that's true, but I only follow it when there's say, two albums with the exact same title. Now that warrants a disambig page. But now you only have two entries (actually only one, since the other hasn't been written yet), I suppose we can work this around by placing the more notable article within <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crowd_f813.html" title="The Crowd">The Crowd</a> article itself, and then just insert a link to the second article at the top of the first article, and therefore bypassing the need of an additional disambig page. Like a sixth finger on a hand, it might look interesting but it serves no additional purpose (not that I'd want to remove a hypothetical extra finger in the first place).&#160;:P Anyways, if the group is that notable, I do recommend starting an article on it pronto so that there'll be a better chance this disambig might be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b>. At Talk:Eli Oliveiro i've added a list of the 4 new registered editors and 9 IPs who've been involved, and a chronology of edits for the 18 day period of edits, counter edits, and pauses. I am still not satisfied with my mental picture of it, and i would hope at least one or two editors who think they <i>do</i> have a clear picture, would test it by inspecting these tools, then report back. I'll be checking its accuracy soon, so watch that page for corrections if you see anything that seems significant to you.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>. At Talk:Eli Oliveiro i've added a list of the 4 new registered editors and 9 IPs who've been involved, and a chronology of edits for the 18 day period of edits, counter edits, and pauses. I am still not satisfied with my mental picture of it, and i would hope at least one or two editors who think they <i>do</i> have a clear picture, would test it by inspecting these tools, then report back. I'll be checking its accuracy soon, so watch that page for corrections if you see anything that seems significant to you.<br />

<p>Gmakermaniac: Ok, I'm a wiki noob (hence I don't know the official way to reply to this) but I don't see a reason why this article should be deleted. If it exsisted, and it had a user base, it should be kept here. Just because it is unpopular doesn't mean we need to froget it ever existed</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this page and would like to point out that Roger Maris is a well known (relatively) artist in the UK. I feel this article is being put up for deletion primarily as he happens to have the same name as a famous Baseball star! This could not be avoided, sadly. Maris (the artist) is one of the few skilled craftsmen remaining in the UK who are experts in the now almost extinct art of clock-face restoration and his work at EuroDisney was and remains an attraction for many of Europe's skilled craftsmen. This article is not about self-promotion, as I doubt Maris is even aware of its existence. Sorry to go on about this, but I feel that the deletion of this article is not warranted. <font color="blue"><strong>Mgrest</strong></font> 19:10, 5 March 2006 (GMT)</li>

Since this was created by one AOL IP user three months ago and unedited at all since then, I feel it warrants either a wholescale deletion or a review by someone familiar with TLC and the network's programs and their airdates. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrschimpf_855c.html" title="User:Mrschimpf">Nate</a> 11:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. I realise this decision swims against the tide but Firsfron offers a (unsubstantiated) claim that would probably mean this was kept if it had been made about 3 or 4 days earlier, references problems notwithstanding.

<li>Google only returns 81 unique results for this alleged candy, many of which are people referring to basketball. Is this apparent nickname of a candy deserving of an entire article? At any rate it needs a "niggerball" expert. Labia Ears 13:07, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b>. I have heard of this confectionary and of another from Sweden with the same name, only this was more of a cookie/cake. The Swedes I knew while studying in England would always stop themselves just short of saying the name to Anglophonic students and call them <i>chocolate balls</i> instead.

<li><b>Keep</b>, given the precedent of the other 199 confectionery stubs. Oh, these candies exist all right, but more commonly in the plural: <i>niggerballs</i> returns 1400 results on Google.

<li>They appear to be also known as "Bull's-eyes," this search actually returns some product results. Perhaps the article could be moved to this much less offensive term? Labia Ears 05:58, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I happened across this article before and it didn't occur to be that anything should be done to it. I thought that the offensive name of the past would have been all that made this thing notable, but perhaps not. Either <b>keep</b> as is or <b>rename</b> as <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull%27s_Eye_9909.html" title="Bull's Eye">Bull's Eye</a>, a redirect to something totally different right now. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a> 07:26, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The consensus seems to be to keep the article about this candy, perhaps I should simply move its contents to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull%27s_Eye_9909.html" title="Bull's Eye">Bull's Eye</a> and redirect <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niggerball.html" title="Niggerball">Niggerball</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niggerballs.html" title="Niggerballs">Niggerballs</a> there? And possibly make a disambiguation for the star and the candy? Labia Ears 08:28, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I don't think that would be terribly helpful - bull's eyes are usually striped peppermint flavoured hard candy: niggerballs are much bigger, licorice or aniseed flavoured sweets. With the greatest respect, I don't agree that a foodstuff's offensive commercial name is enough of a reason to rename an article, particularly when - as in this case - renaming obscures the history, meaning and cultural significance of the subject. The examples of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coon_cheese.html" title="Coon cheese">Coon cheese</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir_lime.html" title="Kaffir lime">Kaffir lime</a> provide precedents. And surely nobody is suggesting that <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker_Jack_90ef.html" title="Cracker Jack">Cracker Jack</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popcorn.html" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a>...? <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 11:11, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Keep. I am a writer. This word in this usage probably falls under jargon? Wikipedia is my first source for current (unfamiliar, to me) usages, including this word. The distinctions made on this and other pages between slang, cliché, jargon, and dialect have helped me get my work done. Isn't that a good thing? I know a good climber; will ask him to expand if that helps the issue.</p>

I mean if the policy were consistently enforced then it would be easy to figure out when the policy describes an article and when it doesn't. But since there is a complete lack of consistency regarding policy here I just can't figure out when this policy applies to an article and when it doesn't. I guess I could stop figuring it out and stop bringing articles that I think may violate this policy here; however, it has almost become "academic curiosity" to see what the community does with an article. But I am beginning to think that it would be easier if Wikipedia policy were modifed to eliminate this particular policy. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 21:05, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You may be interested to know that the entire Wiktionary exists simply because a lot of early Wikipedia users felt so strongly that dicdefs didn't belong here that they built an entire project (the Wiktionary project) just to keep dicdefs out of Wikipedia. No one felt it was important to create a free dictionary that anyone could edit.

<li>Thats not an objection to having an article on the subject of laws based upon morality, just to this particular stub article as it is written. A good article should list many of the subjects of such laws, in various cultures, and should also point out that almost all cultures have had at least some "legislated morality". <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 18:41, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The term "legislating morality" is neither slang nor uncommon. Its legitimacy for reference should based on that. Albeit NPOV in usage, it is close enough to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimless_crime.html" title="Victimless crime">victimless crime</a> for a redirect to that article. So although I see the value of it as reference, I don't see how it justifies its own article. <a href="../../../z/i/n/User%7EZincOrbie_ce47.html" title="User:ZincOrbie">ZincOrbie</a> 19:09, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd buy that, its up to the articles authors to write an article which can stand on its own, if that is posssible. Redirection is fine, solong as the victimless crime article mentions "legislating morality" as a term. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 17:21, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The reason I put this page 'Ashanti Omkar' in was because many people contact the peopel I write for to find out who I am or what I do and this made it easy to tell them, as I may nto be a celebrity but in the community of readers, my name is often queried! hope this makes sense.

There is nothing here that makes me believe that this is a "notable" toy.

<li>In my opinion, "notability" shouldn't normally come into a discussion of a tool because it is too hard to define in that context. Some might think it is not notable because it is too common, others might argue that a tool is not notable because it is too obscure.

<dd>Yes, the Berkshire Eagle is in fact a community newspaper. It covers many many events. I don't recall seeing in Wikipedia's guidelines any rules about notability being determined by whether or not something has been in a newspaper. PaulIsNotDead 04:13, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is the closest guideline I can come up with for an event like this, which has allowances for "achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." Given that the typical threshold for people who write articles or books is 5000, the Berkshire Eagle more than meets that. Plus, you could call Llamacon, given the type of panelists it had this year, and event with a cult following. That's if you need to cling to some guideline to assert this event's notability, which I certainly don't. The people who attended make it notable enough for me, by far. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 05:13, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

When his Pledge of Allegiance case was ruled in his favor by the Court of Appeals, the U.S. Congress and President Bush immediately responded.

<p>I hope Im aloud to enter text here? I apologise if im not. Really Im not trying to be a smarty. I have this time around managed to folow the links for discussion and fully understand where you are coming from re the&#160;!humour and the prefered dry aspect of the wikipedia. By all means do what you like with the article I have since copied the page and placed the text on the cited page so the ingredients/method is not lost for those who are interested. Anyone who visits my pages can see that there is a mix of technical, philosophical and humor surrounding a number of aspects of camping etc.I can see now this does not fit the wikipedia format. I was not trying to bring my page more hits. Most of my pages are indeed simply reminders to myself of what transpired. However in the past I have often wished for some of this info to have been found on the web rather than me having to reinvent the wheel so to speak and so have placed it in a public area for others. I use wikipedia alot and again apologise for any upset.mds 22:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted There has been more than enough time to have the author list sources and verify the info in this article and it has not been done. I have attempted to research and find anything to support the article and have been unable to do so. At this time there is no evidence that this article contains correct information. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelthefish_ebc4.html" title="User:Nigelthefish">Nigelthefish</a> 19:25, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I randomly searched two weapons. One was the atlatl, which is in fact what the article claims it is. The second weapon I searched, the one with a 'Q', google gave me one result (i.e. the article page). However, I'm not convinced that google is exhaustive when it comes to the army of the Aztec people. This article needs an expert and a wikify tag. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 20:37, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Article is not cohesive and coherent. School section is unrelated (and info is already at <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>. Aztec Army section has a little information that is not covered at <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>, but this is not sourced. Weaponry section is of some value if it were properly sourced. Ideally, what I would like to see done here is a <b>Move</b> to something like Aztec Military as a fork off of the main <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> page with subsections for Military structure and Weaponry... all properly sourced of course. <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_army.html" title="Aztec army">Aztec army</a> could then be deleted or redirected. If consensus agrees with me I'd be willing to do the grunt work.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> as per Isotope23 - the weapon information is definitely worth keeping and moving to a Weaponry section in Aztec Military and for this I nominate Isotope23 for this grunt work&#160;:P.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Off the top of my tiny head, most of the information is accurate but it duplicates information on other pages like <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_warrior.html" title="Eagle warrior">Eagle warrior</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaguar_warrior.html" title="Jaguar warrior">Jaguar warrior</a> and definitely needs some references. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 22:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> cleanup and verify. The Aztecs had an army which makes it notable enough for mine and I'm sure that there are plenty iof verifiable sources. Given that they didn't have a navy or an air force, I don't see the need for a move but if it ensures consistency and Isotope 23 is prepared to do the work I can live with it. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is an excellent point... No F-16's in their arsenal eh? Let me do a complete rewrite when I have a chance tomorrow, with links to the other articles rather than just rehashing existing info.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I've been doing some research and started writing a draft, but other than the About.com article that half the text here is lifted from, I'm having a bit of trouble finding good, verifiable information. My rewrite ended up being a rehash of what is already at the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> article, so I didn't post it; at that point it's a useless fork. IMO, the weapon information is the only thing worth saving so a move of that info to a new Aztec Weaponry article is probably the best solution and a mention of said article could be inserted into <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> with appropriate link.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:36, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

While some students were proud to see their school's name in The Times, others were dismayed by the factual error. The New York Times was not the first to attribute the genesis of pong to Dartmouth. Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, also attributes pong to the College. It is unclear where the game was first played, some have suggested Dartmouth College in the 1950s, but there has been no definitive date or place," the encyclopedia claims under "beer pong. Unofficial College historian and history professor emeritus Jere Daniell '55 recalls playing pong in its most primitive form when he was a member of Alpha Theta fraternity between 1952 and 1955. I'm not even sure it had a name," Daniell said of playing the game over 50 years ago.

<dd>Your article has two things in it I have a problem with, well three now that I think of it. First off the editors note is&#160;:"This is the first in a three-part series looking at the evolution of beer pong as a social and cultural phenomenon at Dartmouth.". Its about it on campus, therefore not notable. Secondly, it states "While some students were proud to see their school's name in The Times, others were dismayed by the factual error. " What was the factual error?

<dd>Aren't you a nit-picky grumpy-wump! I can't explain the terrible editorial process at <i>The Dartmouth</i>, but it does have some clout as a student newspaper.

<dl>
<dd>No, Mike makes very valid points, that an article about something at Dartmouth can't really consider a Dartmouth newspaper to be a reliable, unbiased source. Yes, it's the oldest college newspaper, but it's still a newspaper that cannot naturally be expected to be unbiased about its own campus. And Wikipedia definitely cannot cite itself, even if it's citing something else that cites Wikipedia. I added a whole bunch of much more independent sources to the article, though. Mike, if you want to take a look at those, and see if they influence your vote? --<sub>└</sub> <i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 04:15, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pong is known (inter?)nationally as Beruit or 'ruit. The kind of pong from which Beruit sprang comes from Dartmouth. It is simply called "pong" at Dartmouth. Outside of Dartmouth, it is called "Dartmouth pong." --AaronS 13:15, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why the name of the article is being argued here - I don't think anyone's meant "Dartmouth pong" to be a proper name, but rather just a descriptive name for a specific drinking game. Articles can be renamed without an AfD if that's an issue, anyways. On-campus, students are picky about it being called "pong" and not "Beirut", but that's only on-campus. The notability of the article is that it's the first version of beer pong (see sources in the article), and remains a major part of the Dartmouth College culture. I believe the sources that I added qualify as 'verifiable sources'. There is still certainly an argument to be made as to the notability of the facts, and that's what this AfD should focus on. --<sub>└</sub> <i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 18:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was delete and merge. The current page is a fork, and not a likely search term, so it is not appropiate to retain it even as a redirect. The material <i>may</i> have a place in the parent article. To avoid any GFDL issues, this will be moved to a subpage Amin al-Husseini/anti-semitism (temporary). If and when the editors at Amin al-Husseini decide to incorporate this material, then decisions can be made regarding how to preserve the licence. If the consensus there is <i>not</i> to merge this material, the page can be deleted by leaving a note on my (or probably any other) adminstrator's talk.<br />

<p><b>Delete</b>. This page is a content fork from <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amin_al-Husseini_aa02.html" title="Amin al-Husseini">Amin al-Husseini</a>. The material (if determined to be NPOV in the ongoing moderation on the source page) belongs on the source page, and not on this fork. <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 20:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)~</p>
<p>Hello. {s}Keep{/s}. This article has been introduced less than 2 hours ago (note I never met Cmh before). I tried to discuss with him but he doesn't agree to follow process of discussion and decided to ask for the deletion of this article. Here is why it has been created&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>As explained on the talk page of the article about Haj Amin al-Husseini, this article about him is already well written and npov. Nevertheless there is one point that is not well sourced and that is debated. I chose to gather additionnal information about that in another article and only refers this clearly in the main article. I don't understand why Cmh didn't read this.</li>
<li>Please look at the article. You can see it is extremely well sourced and referenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/References_about_Haj_Amin_al-Husseini%E2%80%99s_anti-semitism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/References_about_Haj_Amin_al-Husseini%E2%80%99s_anti-semitism" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. It deals the topic with a "cold" neutral point of view. Only the title is discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:References_about_Haj_Amin_al-Husseini%E2%80%99s_anti-semitism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:References_about_Haj_Amin_al-Husseini%E2%80%99s_anti-semitism" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> and in less than 2 hours, it is hard to discuss even if I think the title is good. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristophe_Greffe_85ae.html" title="User:Christophe Greffe">Christophe Greffe</a> 20:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just another one of the mixed breed. From the first set of RfD -</p>
<p><i>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see American hybrid "registry" and Poodle hybrid and Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about mixed-breed dogs is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at Maltipoo and Schnoodle you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the dog breed project before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in Cockapoo because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and Labradoodles are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with Goldendoodles getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name</i></p>
<p>In this case, various google searches involving boggle and various other dog articles show many thousands of hits, but these hits are related to the game or being confused about the dog - not about a dog breed itself. Doing a search on "boggle boston beagle" gives 13k hits, the first page is for sale ads for the dogs - the remaining pages seem to be simply word lists for attracting search engine hits or are otherwise unrelated. There is no registry for these dogs, it's less notable than the yorkipoo which we deleted earler.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, here's a turnabout for you. I wrote the original text (above) and in very short order what I've noticed is that, e.g., <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puggle.html" title="Puggle">Puggle</a> has been removed I don't know how many times and even turned into a redirect and listed in the hybrids page with no link and then, wham, someone comes along and recreates the article anyway. I think it's going to happen with any of these that show up with hundreds or thousands of occurrences on the web. I've been very active in the dog breeds project area for eons by WP standards (Jan '04) and I think we're going to end up being better off having the articles and just making sure that they make it clear that these are invented "breed" names, they're really just mutts and you don't know what you're going to get. It pains me but I think that's a better strategy. E.g., see my edits to the Boggle article. I might still be outvoted by my dog-project pals&#160;;-) but this is how I'm starting to think about it. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 22:31, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that this is a bad precident. Simply allowing any invented breed without any notability requirements - that's asking for trouble. In this case, there are not thousands of web site hits. Besides, this has happened 5 times in the past two years. It really isn't too much trouble to rfd them away. - <a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrysha_c63a.html" title="User:Trysha">Trysha</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/r/y/User_talk%7ETrysha_3f4c.html" title="User talk:Trysha">talk</a>)</sup> 22:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm inclined to agree. 150 years ago, some crazy German tried mixing mastiffs, bulldogs and Great Danes. I have a pair: they're called boxers now. Some hybrids will catch on, and become quite popular; many have already. Most of them will never even reach the status of passing fad, and are not worth recognizing. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
