<p>You can't really characterise a decade that has yet to pass. Even if you could, the page is currently redundant, because a) we already have very good "year in music" pages - eg, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_music.html" title="2000 in music">2000 in music</a>, and b) we already have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bands.html" title="List of bands">List of bands</a>. This article really just combines information from those two articles, and adds some inherent POV. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 10:59, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>, perhaps POV is a bad word choice on my part. I think what I mean to say is that in its current form the article presents a rather one sided view of music from 2000 onwards. It mentions little of rap / hiphop, which IMO is far more dominant now than trance/techno, but the article seems to state otherwise. Similarly, it treats localalised music trends as global - "There was a notable return to raw garage rock'n'roll with groups such as The Strokes, The White Stripes and The Kings of Leon"...except that in many other countries, these bands have not been heard of at all. Ditto for "the charts are full of". If it is kept as an article, then it needs to be worked on the regional aspects. I agree that a catagory would be better, although on the other hand it would still overlap a lot with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bands.html" title="List of bands">List of bands</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 15:42, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Folks can always add names. I'm not into the rap/hiphop scene so I can't do so myself, and it could be argued that electronica, noise, and other forms of music are even more dominant than rap and hiphop (without getting all the headlines), so there's probably plenty of expansion to be done here. That's sort of why a category might make more sense than trying to just make a straight list, since some bands (say, Rolling Stones as a good example) would need to be listed multiple times. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:52, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Part of the problem is that it's a list of music <i>groups</i>; while there are exceptions, hip hop tends more toward solo artists. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:50, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "current" tag isn't really meant for that purpose. That tag is meant for rapidly developing stories where edit conflicts are very likely.

<li>Okay. Still, the issue here appears to be the editorial content at the top of the page, which <i>possibly</i> lacks historical perspective. The list should still be valid, and provides a suitable place to register notable groups over the course of the decade.

<li><b>Delete</b> as Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. You can't write a historical article about the current decade. Article can be recreated in 2010. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:22, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> ... the decade may not be over, but there are slews of new artists coming out in the decade. I don't see why we would have to wait for the decade to be over at all. It's not like we are predicting what artists existed in 2009, and the article is not made to say what artists were significant within the decade (that would be a personal opinion anyway, and would sure to be controversial). The article is made to say what artists emerged within the decade, and that information is pretty clear and easy to obtain. HOWEVER, this article probably needs clean-up. There are certain flaws with this article... it does ignore the other genres aside from rock and pop at the moment. The intro paragraph at the beginning should be altered or deleted, because that is where it is trying to predict things. It would be good to get this article out somehow to garner a bit more attention... probably included as a "See also" link within various artists of this decade (especially of the genres outside of rock/pop). But of course, we should keep in mind that this article states "groups" and not individual artists per se (so it may be suggested to change the "groups" to "artists" to make it more broad as well?). An "incomplete list" stub thingy (or something similar and more appropriate) should probably be added as well. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 06:05, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this is to be a list of <i>all</i> (or even <i>all notable</i>) music groups for the decade, then it should still be deleted, as a decade is a very arbitrary distinction when grouping bands. Rather, they should be grouped by genre (as they are), or possibly country. If it's about <i>influences</i>, then it's a predictory article, as you cannot verify that something has been an influence until some time has passed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:27, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, then I guess it can be renamed to rock/pop groups of 2000 or something along those lines then, if we're taking on a genre distinction. That'd mean the other decades would have to go through such change as well. But influence is of course not the emphasis here at all, but rather what groups have come out and reached a level of significant fame within the decade, I believe. I don't find it too arbitrary at all. If an artist has a label, and are a fairly large topic of discussion among fans, they should be listed. You could say the same thing about bands of other decades - anyone could debate about the importance of any band even to this day ... but the main fact remains as to what decade they broke through to garner some attention. Even a one-hit wonder has some significance. If I were to say "this band was quite majorly popular only within a three year period", I think that's quite enough to keep them in. Of course, some bands might be complicated to group specifically...especially those of that come out within the late 90's but broke through in the 2000s. For those, there might be some debate as to where they should belong (or maybe they could go under both decades). Or we could set some rules to this... either to list the artists based on when they were formed, or by when their first album was released, or so on. But I find no real individual judgements in listing a band that emerged from a certain decade... the fact is that they existed within those times. If we were to wait until 2010... we would still be listing these very artists here as to have emerged within this decade, because they simply just did. It's not like the list is comprised of local bands that are still trying to find a label or anything, after all. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 09:53, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the list of the band at least, bearing in mind that some drastic expansion is needed, to cover all genres. However, I think the introductory paragraph should be deleted, since it is biased, is written ungracefully, and would be best written with hindsight. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 22:46, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But the "xxxx's in music" are events and releases for the most part. People like to refer to bands as from a certain decade (ie, "they're an 80's band"), and this keeps it organized. Making a list of bands emerging within a very specific year WOULD be controversial, because the founding of a band, first album, and breakthrough album/song are all ... point of view-ish, and can really be unnecessary information if say, a band had 5 albums but their 4th one was the one that garnered national attention away from the local scene. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 00:04, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Fatally flawed. Text at top should be removed entirely. Article has major bias towards white, guitar-based rock groups. The criteria for inclusion are extremely unclear - is the article to include acts which merely formed in the 00s, or which became popular in the 00s, or what? <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modest_Mouse_5a84.html" title="Modest Mouse">Modest Mouse</a> formed in 1993, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a> formed in 1997, and both are in the article; underachievers such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Distillers_5fe1.html" title="The Distillers">The Distillers</a> and <a href="../../../z/w/a/Zwan.html" title="Zwan">Zwan</a> who nonetheless formed in the 00s are in the article; whereas <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a href="../../../r/2E/e/R.E.M._%28band%29_efbe.html" title="R.E.M.

<ul>
<li>I don't think we should delete it though, mostly because there are the previous decades. But I do think, as you mention, that we should clean up these articles to be more based on certain conditions. This is probably my proposal to this article: <b>(1)</b> I think basing these articles (meaning every decade that is included) on the release of an artists first album or so would be good. Doing it based on when they are formed isn't a good idea IMHO, 'cause there are years ahead after formation where they were unknown and without a record deal, obviously leaving them quite trivial and unimportant for those years. And doing it based on influence and importance would be PoV-ish (others might disagree that the Distillers and Zwan are significant and not "underachievers") <b>(2)</b> Delete first paragraph, and replace it with a note on what conditions the groups in the list shall be based on (being by release of their first album or whatever) <b>(3)</b> Move some of the artists to where they belong (like Modest Mouse), and do so for the others as well (that are in other decades, because there are a couple I noticed suffer the same problem of being in the "wrong" decade. (Still, there are some artists that are hard to categorize, since they come in the late decade...since for example, White Stripes released their first album in 1999... I personally feel it's fine to keep them in the 2000's, although we should mention this criteria in the note as well if we do this). I don't believe it is necessary to keep artists from another decade that are still doing well now (like U2, Cure, etc), within here. People refer to them as a band by the decade they started in, and it would keep the list to a minimal as well. <b>(4-?)</b> The only thing I'm not sure of is if we should keep it as rock/pop/metal/etc specifically (and thus, rename the article titles). Or if we should have other genres like rap and techno in here as well. We could definately divide them up into their respectful genres. <b>(5-?)</b> Also, unsure, since you mention Madonna and Kylie Minogue - should we rename this to "music <i>artists</i>" so as to include solo artists? Especially among rap and R&amp;B, there are A LOT of solo artists (at least among the mainstream), which I think might be a reason for the lack of such artists included. /// Anyway, if this article stays, I think we should set such guidelines to this article. If we are to keep the articles of the other decades, this one will most certainly be revived in the future anyway (and will probably cause the same controversies it does now), so I think it would be good to set everything straight now instead. That's my idea anyway. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 03:08, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see why the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a> need to be treated differently than any prior decade.
