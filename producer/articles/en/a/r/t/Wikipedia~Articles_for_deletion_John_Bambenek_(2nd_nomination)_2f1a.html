He did excellent work breaking key stories such as the CNN X story in late 2005, working on the image recovery that helped prove it to be a technical glitch.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. First, this is a renomination from less than 3 months ago, nothing has changed except perhaps even more notable has been achieved by the subject being in the New York Times and other newspapers. Lexis-Nexis showed he's been quoted also in the LA Times and he shows up in dozens of articles. The opinions above that we should make exceptions to what normally constitute notablity notwithstanding, it's clear he is notable. The irony of citing that his blog is ranking at or near the top 100 of 23 some odd million blogs is thick. Second, this was created by an anon and is clearly a bad faith nomination as noted above by someone who was barely familiar enough with the process to even start it correctly. This article stood on its own two feet a few months ago, nothing has changed. -- 130.126.139.14 18:17, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are also all the arguments made in the first AfD.

Even if the incredible undocumented claim that during the first year after his graduation from college in 2001 "he led several development teams and became the resident expert in information security and Sun Microsystems products" at Ernst &amp; Young (now Capgemini, which employs over 61,000 people) is true, that doesn't make him notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. He is a columnist in a local college newspaper for which the editor-in-chief didn't even warrant an article until a recent scandal.

To put his accomplishments in perspective, an average PhD graduate in computer science may write dozens of papers for peer-reviewed conferences and journals over their lifetime and have hundreds of references to their work from other scholarly works (a measure of impact). John's publications do not appear to be peer-reviewed, do not appear to be scholarly in nature, and do not appear to have a high level of impact. So his accomplishments are less than that of the average PhD graduate and unless half the PhD graduates should have entries, I don't see why John should have one. 67.171.73.202 06:57, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'll not vote for or against this, but why do all these users crop up to vote <i>keep</i> (their first, or among 2/3 edits), whenever this is put on an afd? A m:checkuser seems to be needed to root out the hoard of socks. No, I'm not accusing anyone, but the three votes I marked are quite suspect (and the accounts created after the afd listing are invalid anyway).

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, John, I wasn't accusing you. The whole thing with anon users' doing fly-by tagging, afd listing is quite frustrating. This afd listing, in the first place, was inappropriately made by the anon. There is also the possiblity of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html#Characteristics_of_sock_puppets" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">"straw man sockpuppets"</a>. So, whoever ends up closing this afd, needs to disregard the single-edit user's, voting either for or against the afd, as clearly most of these users are socks.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Again, I am *not* accusing you in any way. (replied in your talk page on that). The 3 users I marked are so clearly made up, that I somewhat think those votes are here for the opposite affect ... to make "Keep" votes look dubious. I don't have any reason to say you are running this article. The afd was inappropriately listed by an anon (from Champaign... surprise!!!), and many of the pro/against votes are motivated by personal agenda rather than the merit of the article/subject. Afd's should be taken objectively rather than personal issues. The afd listing itself shows a personal bias rather than a good faith nomination in part of the anon. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:37, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not a single one of these people has a Wikipedia page (nor does anyone at all mentioned in the article).

<li><b>Comment</b> You are welcome to refute my argument. The reality is that John Bambenek is not a famous person (like Ludacris, Roger Ebert, etc) nor does he have the accomplishments of an olympic medalist (Bonnie Blair) to warrant being listed along with those famous people in the Champaign-Urbana Metro entry. He is not famous in Champaign-Urbana nor nationally. The fact that he has a couple fans running around adding his names to lists he isn't qualified for is pathetic. Again, I challenge you to refute my argument. What is his major contribution? What peer-reviewed conferences and journals contain this contribution? How does this contribution make him any more notable than the hundreds of other PhDs from UIUC with vastly superior vitaes full of peer-reviewed publications? 67.171.73.202 17:51, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your argument needs no refutation because you are an anon attacker. However, plenty of people who aren't olympic medalists have bios. It's clear from your comments you have an axe to grind. The original anon poster was upset at a column he wrote last week, even Adrian recognized this is an attack afd. If he has enough visibility that whenever he writes a controversial column people try to delete his bio, it's clear he has more influence than people are giving him credit for. -- 130.126.147.87 21:12, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. This is the most acrominous AfD I've seen in a long time. It includes <b>sysops</b> deleting user comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohn_Bambenek_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42493570&amp;oldid=42492596" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohn_Bambenek_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=42493570&amp;oldid=42492596" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It demonstrates a complete lack of following the process. There is a crtieria for Second Nominations, this doesn't meet it. This was started by an anon unfamiliar with wikipedia because they didn't even add the AfD right, this never made the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> process, and no discussion or debate was attempted before dumping this 2nd nom in. After seeing this level of sockpuppetry, I decided to take a look in depth on this one. There seems to be two criteria of notability that is claimed here. First is as an information security professional, second is as a blogger/columnist.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In general, this user has over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+bambenek&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+bambenek&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> 277 unique Google mentions, almost a hundred more than the last time and more than most articles that do get to stay. He is mentioned in dozens of news articles which is amazingly dismissed out of hand. Since when does being in a front page article in the New York Times not mean anything? In many cases, that is ipso facto proof of notability and that ends the discussion. Why are the criteria being thrown out just to vote delete?</dd>
<dd>In information security, his material that he has authored does certainly seem to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria of 5,000 or more readers. Some mention that he doesn't have much in peer review journals, but any research that is notable enough for the New York Times certainly bypasses that threshold. Not all research in journals makes it into the mainstream media, research that does, especially if it makes the New York Times and international papers, most certainly is notable by any definition of that word. If 5000 people is the criteria, why is a readership in the millions being discarded out of hand?</dd>
<dd>In blogging, his comments have appeared in the LA Times and Seattle Times. Any blogger mentioned in the mainstream media is pretty much considered notable. In fact <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> states that multiple non-trivial media mentions is enough to establish notability. That threshold has been more than crossed here. His blog is ranked #104 in the Truth Laid Bear system out of 51,578 blogs (top .2%) <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/showdetails.php?host-http://www.pentex-net.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/showdetails.php?host-http://www.pentex-net.com" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Technorati ranks him at 1008/29.9 Million <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/jcb.pentex-net.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technorati.com/search/jcb.pentex-net.com" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> (top .003%). He is an apparent right-winger that has enough visibility that he was mentioned and criticized by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/001759.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/001759.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. His political opponents, the <i>Democratic Party</i>, see him as notable enough to respond to. His paper, an independent and self-financed corporation has a circulation of 20,000 <a href="http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. He is a featured writer on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogcritics.html" title="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a> and stoptheaclu.com which both have readerships above 50,000 a day. The 5000 person threshold is more than crossed here.</dd>
<dd>It seems that some of the votes here are not considerations of the content but those who want to vote no for the sake of voting no. This process has been horribly abused in this case and will likely, instead of reach any consensus, land this in Deletion Review. The criteria for notability has been more than crossed by any objective standard. This AfD shouldn't even be considered because it is a sham 2nd nom, independent of that, the 1st AfD came to the right conclusion. The criteria and process exists to prevent circuses like this from taking place that shamefully include sysops deleting supporting comments. That process and the criteria should be followed. This article should stay. -- 130.126.139.14 00:18, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oi vey! *Insert sound of trout hitting Mel's head* What 'cha think you're doing? And that was a really lame disclaimer, too. "Nevertheless" it is interesting to see very new contributors taking part in <i>both</i> sides of a debate.<br />

<li>More like euphemism of the weak, although that's redunadant and repetitive. But if we assume this is more than one person and think of these as potential "converts" I'll wear the shame of using insipid language.<br />
