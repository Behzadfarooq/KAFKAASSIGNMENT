<p>This article appears to be a possible hoax, and was (mostly?) the work of one editor, who is now permabanned from WP. The consensus of virtually all others on the Talk page was to start a new page of Opposition to the theory of relativity, where possibly some material can be lifted from this article. At this point in time, the only activity on this page is the repeated attempts by the permabanned editor to edit it under multiple anon socks. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. As an editor who spent some time dealing with this page (and as a PhD student in particle physics), I am quite confident that the only way to make it usable would be a complete rewrite, as Crumb375 states above. Since nobody has time to do this, I think the article should be deleted. In principle, if it turned out some material from it was useful for a rewrite in the future, undeletion is easy to do. However, to keep the article in its present form for an extended period is to misinform our readers. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This was actually KraMuc's second chance after Anti-relativity was deleted, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anti-relativity_af68.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-relativity">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-relativity</a>. For a short time there was some hope, that something encyclopedic about Relativity's critics may come out of this (e.g. in this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_Galilean_relativity&amp;oldid=56573354" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_Galilean_relativity&amp;oldid=56573354" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), but by now, I'm all for <b>Delete</b>. And I can repeat my comment from the last AfD: <i>Writing an article about reception of the theory of relativity and its opponents (besides those handled already in our article <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Physik_fe66.html" title="Deutsche Physik">Deutsche Physik</a>), perhaps taking <a href="../../../../de/k/r/i/Kritik_an_der_Relativit%C3%A4tstheorie_502a.html" class="extiw" title="de:Kritik_an_der_Relativitätstheorie">de:Kritik an der Relativitätstheorie</a> as a starting point, would benefit from starting with a blank sheet.</i> --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 21:35, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that KraMuc socks and others may be attracted just as easily to Opposition to the theory of relativity, but at least there we start off with a clean slate, include <i>all</i> viable opposition (there was a great article cited in the Talk page) in a single article, and of course we can limit the contents to the bare acceptable minimum, per WP and Jimbo's fringe science policies. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:11, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

August 2005 WikiProject GTR (now defunct, because all my time was taken up with bootless attempts to control crank-POV pushing edits; see <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_Archive_ff73.html" title="User:Hillman/Archive">User:Hillman/Archive</a> for some idea of what Wikipedia has lost because of this in terms of creation of new articles and improvement of old articles concerning a rather technical topic which is however of wide popular interest and which I happen to know well),</li>

<li>has been quietly maintaining a database tracking thousands of physics-related cranky websites, and making some effort to correlate this with problem articles in the Wikipedia,</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I could be (and have been) accused of being "biased" in favor of mainstream physics, but presumably I cannot be accused of not knowing a good deal about relativistic physics or <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/wrong.html" class="external text" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/wrong.html" rel="nofollow">fringe physics</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's get one thing out of the way right away: the article in question and other edits by KraMuc (or his many sockpuppets and IP anons) expresses a <i>tiny, tiny minority view which is about as contrary to well-established science as can be imagined</i>. Relativity is one of the best-tested scientific theories of all time; there simply is no such subject as <i>"modern Galilean relativity"</i> [sic] known to modern physics. This line of crank thought has of course a long pedigree, going right back to the 1920s, but it was cranky even then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I expect that many Wikipedia users who participate in this AfD, who have no particular axe to grind but happen not to be familiar with the problems faced by members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Physics_630e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics</a> (the membership of WikiProject Pseudoscience seems to be a small subset) in controlling cranky POV-pushing in physics-related articles in the Wikipedia, will conclude that "Wikipedia's mission includes <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> description of well-known crackpots such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>". In an ideal world, they would not be wrong (and I myself have made this argument in the past). The trouble is, <i>current practices at Wikipedia for controlling problem edits and problem editors are far too cumbersome to admit any attempt to describe Wikipedia as an ideal world!</i> While I and other editors of good faith are working hard to try to ameliorate this situation (which requires reforming the cumbersome policy creation/implementation process, so that we can emplace wise and effective policies for protecting Wikipedia articles from being traduced by those who come here to pursue some personal agenda which does not serve the interest of our readers, who come here seeking accurate information about topics of interest to them, including technical topics such as physics which require considerable background and expertise to write about knowledgeably, accurately, and well), at present it is far too easy for one disaffected crank to endlessly tie up, not one, not two, but a half dozen Ph.D. physicists/mathematicians whose time here should be spent in more useful activities than trying to "reason" with KraMuc. See User:Hillman/Dig/KraMuc (<i>look but don't touch, please!</i>) for evidence of the magnitude of the problem in trying to deal with KraMuc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the basis of my extensive experience here, I feel that until better policies are in place for enforcing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> without imposing an undue burden of time/energy upon the still too rare "physics expert" population here, it is my judgement that it is best to delete this article, because as a practical matter <i>there is currently no way to maintain it in an neutral state at an acceptable cost to the Wikipedia community</i>. I also would point contributors to this AfD to User:Hillman/Dig/Sarfatti to see the kind of abuse which can result when the community tries to maintain in neutral form an article on a controversial fringe figure. I would respectfully request that anyone planning to vote <i>keep</i> take the time to read the above cited pages and then <i>decide whether they themselves would be willing to invest a sizeable portion of their own time at Wikipedia in helping the membership of WikiProject Physics try to maintain Modern Galilean relativity in a neutral state</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a phrase, my argument in this and in similar cases is that <i>"deletion is the best part of valor"</i>. If the experiment in the German Wikipedia with various cruft control measures succeeds, and if our policymaking efforts here succeed, so that cruft patrol becomes <i>much, much less onerous</i> for Wikipedia users with a strong physics/math background, we can no doubt recreate articles such as this, in the fullness of time.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 21:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nomination and CH. The pseudotheory is not notable, and there are no reliable sources addressing (debunking) them scientifically. Much of the current content started out as a diatribe by KraMuc outlining what were essentially his personal ideas and opinions on various theories, each supported by about one crackpot. As an Einstein's Witness and cyber clown, I know a reasonable amount about both relativistic physics and the dynamics of pseudoscience coverage on Wikipedia. Deleting this article is the best thing to do now. No one has the time or inclination to make the article acceptable, and to do so would require original research to show how the ideas conflict with mainstream physics. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 22:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
