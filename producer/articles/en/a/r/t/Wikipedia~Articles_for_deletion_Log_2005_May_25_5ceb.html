<p>This article appears to be a hoax. Google brings up <i>zero</i> hits for "Fortress Blakely". Villa Tuscana in British Columbia does no better. The NASA projects that were supposedly based there don't seem to have existed. The ISBN number of one reference actually belongs to a wholely unrelated book. All in all, I see no reason to think that this place exists, despite this detailed history.

<p>The Fortress_Blakeley#World_War_II sections is especially droll. It's prefaced by, "Nothing much happened at this time." Then it goes on to say how 753 Jewish refugees from the Philippines were personally saved and housed by Howard Blakeley on his estate, who also had time to help on the construction of the atom bomb. That's not to mention the island's fortifications, including "3,000 soldiers ... under the command of the Blakeley family." One of history's most overlooked heroes or a detailed fantasy. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 09:02, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No such era exists and it's ridiculous (laughable is actually a better word) to state it's the "512-bit" era because a system has 512MB of RAM.

<dd><s>Well, I think that this deserves to be an article, but it should be <b>retitled</b> to something more appropriate, since</s> the previous "eras" such as the "16-bit" and "32-bit" eras were so named because the CPUs of the consoles of the era claimed to be as the name suggested, while none of the new consoles claim to have "512-bit processors" and all apparently run on PowerPC CPUs which are definitely not 512-bit. --<a href="../../../m/4/1/User%7EM412k_8ee1.html" title="User:M412k">M412k</a> 01:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thats what <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-generation_era.html" title="Seventh-generation era">Seventh-generation era</a> is, which is debatable too as a proper title. Actually the title of the article has gone through major discussions along with other similar articles at the corresponding Wikiproject. Since there is no name for this era (except for perhaps the Microsoft marketing "HD era"), I don't see what a proper title can be at this point -- for sure it shouldn't be "512-bit era" especially with that reasoning. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 01:59, May 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the Gigantomachy was an important element of Greek mythology, the war of the new gods against the old ones. I'm not sure if this is its accepted English name (I've only heard it in Russian), but if it is it should probably be an article. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlatypeanArchcow_1412.html" title="User:PlatypeanArchcow">PlatypeanArchcow</a> 03:58, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite. Gigantomachy is not just a part of Greek mythology but also a symbolic political motif in classical art. The Gigantomachy on the east metopes of The Parthenon, for example, uses the motif to display the power, civilization and culture of Athens over the uncultured "others" of the rest of the world - it's order versus disorder. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Fiction. It's an attempted merging of the Norse frost giants with the Titans. I understand Megan1967's point, but that's a wholesale rewrite she's talking about, and it needn't include this fiction in its history. The other objection I have to a rewrite of <i>this</i> article is that I believe it's misnamed even there.

<p>Non-notable chess program. The fact that it's Greek and written in Java are uncommon, but the stub is over a year old and although only a two sentences long, it seems to have little possibility of expansion. The provided link (<a href="http://www.digichess.gr/pyotr/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.digichess.gr/pyotr/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) seems dead tonight, although google cached it last month. The google cached Pyotr Chess Engine Frequently Asked Questions shows that the FAQ was last updated in December 2001. One highly respected partial list of chess engines provided by <a href="http://www.tim-mann.org/engines.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tim-mann.org/engines.html" rel="nofollow">Tim Mann</a> includes 176 engines. Although the list is arranged alphabetically and not by importance, Pyotr is number 132 on that list which is probably not too far away from where it ranks in notability. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 01:51, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> could this be turned into a disambiguation page? Pyotr is the Russian name for Peter.

<li>A name disambiguation page would be for people/places/things who were commonly known as "Pyotr", <i>not</i> as "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky" (who <i>is</i>, however, commonly known as <a href="../../../t/c/h/Tchaikovsky.html" title="Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, highlighting one reason for a difference between name disambiguations for <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">family names</a> and those for <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">given names</a>). <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a> is a name disambiguation page because there <i>are</i> people who are commonly known solely by that given name (1 apostle, 1 emperor, and 2 anti-popes, for starters). The lack of any additions to this page since 2004 indicates that this is probably not the case for "Pyotr". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:17, 2005 May 25 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Thanks for bringing up one of my pet peeves, Uncle G. First name disambiguations are not for "List" articles. They are for disentangling individuals known <i>only</i> by that name. There are usually enough medieval figures of any common first name to make this necessary, but Popes are an extreme case. It's common enough for even a scholar to say, "He was denied by Pope Peter" and not indicate that the reference is to Peter II or later. They're also not for etymology and variants on a name, as that's all lexicography. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:53, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand, or <b>Redirect</b> into an article on Chess Engines in general. Agree thouroughly with <b>Keep master level chess engines are notable. Klonimus 23:14, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</b>. These are nontrivial intellectual accomplishments. The press coverage in the '70's and '80's when the first such programs were able to play on par with masters and eventually grandmasters was <i>of epic proportions</i>. I'm more inclined to frown at the party suggesting this be deleted -- the entry documents some accomplishment of note, however sparse of text. 'Master Level' in tourneyment chess is a huge intellectual accomplishment on par with hitters averaging 35+ homers a year, QB's averaging 2+ TD passes a game, or (Shudder) music stars with a golden record album. Me thinks the author was succinct and concise and single <b>entries of this type should be not only condoned, but sought out</b> until they can be redirected into a comprehensive and complete article covering all such engines, and their place in history. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 22:02, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually I don't mind this one voting, I think it is in good faith. However, I would disagree that this program is notable. First, I don't have any information that the program is of master strength. Second, even if it is master level, it is not especially interesting if it is developed in the 1990s or 2000s, because master level computers are quite abundant. Had it been made in the 1970s however, it would have been a pioneering program and notable. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:00, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Pyotr's author was born in 1978 and the program was probably written in 2000-2001. From the description on its home site I suspect its play is rather weak. I also think Farbartus is voting in good faith, but many people, even good chess players, don't really understand computer chess. The problem of writing a strong chess playing program has been basically solved for the last 15 years. This raises the notability bar pretty high for me, and for modern programs only those involved in important matches (as was <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Blue_9ae9.html" title="Deep Blue">Deep Blue</a>) or those that are commercially important (as is <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_%28chess%29.html" title="Fritz (chess)">Fritz</a>) meet it. (BTW, the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_%28chess%29.html" title="Fritz (chess)">Fritz</a> article is poor.) I agree that most programs simply capable of playing a legal game of chess in the 1970s are notable. Anyone who thinks that every chess playing program is notable is invited to look at the sea of red links that is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chess_engines.html" title="List of chess engines">List of chess engines</a>. Most of them are not notable, and often they are tiny modifications of other programs. Also remember that this is just a partial list of engines. Anyone trying hard could probably increase the length of that list by 50-100%. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 18:29, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. I am the author of the article. I apologize for putting it on Wikipedia. I stumbled upon the Wikipedia website yesterday, did a search for 'Human Thermodynamics', but found nothing, and thought it would be nice for the community to have a small entry on the subject. To be clear, it is a <i>very</i> new branch of thermodynamics; not more than a dozen people around the world are presently working on it. The concept of a 'human molecule' was originated in 1977 by the Nobel Prize winner (Chemistry) Ilya Prigogine who used the term: 'dissapative structures' to define such an entity. After reading the above comments, I see that it would be wiser for such a new science to have a better reader base before it is implemented into an encyclopedia. Sorry for the trouble.

<li><b>ABSTAIN</b> leaning hard to '<i><b>Keep'</b></i> as good synopsis. <b>What Is the Harm - 'and the Wikistandard'</b> - the 'cost is but' a single record on a single track of the servers hdd. <b>The greater Question</b> is whether any book entry needs to be deemed <b>notable</b> and who decides. It seems to me that the Wikistandards about literary mentions should be more inclusionary than a printed bound encyclopedia, not limited solely because history hasn't made up it's mind about the merits of a contemporary author. Sales figures for Amazon are cited as a rationale, but I expect they exceed Amazon's sales for <i>The Art of War</i>, or indeed many other <b>notable</b> works like <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, <i>Pilgrims Progress</i>, <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, <i>Little Women</i> or the <i>Uncle Remus (Tar Baby)</i>. Since stumbling across a reference like this in say a google search, might just get someone to put the computer aside and pick up a text long enough to exercise the old grey matter in the almost lost act of reading, bring such entries on. Wiki will then become famed for it's comprehensive and egalitarian nature, vice it's stuffy exclusionary snobbery. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 22:36, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Two things to point out here:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_names_for_the_human_penis_ee4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of names for the human penis">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of names for the human penis</a>, the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Street_name_6425.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Street name">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Street name</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_street_names_of_drugs_b3c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of street names of drugs">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of street names of drugs</a> discussions are worth reading.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The same considerations apply here as in the "list of words of X" debate, namely that the list of dictionary entries is inappropriate for the encyclopaedia (especially as there's a 70,000 word dictionary right next door nearly begging to be used in ways such as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WikiSaurus:penis" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WikiSaurus:penis">Wiktionary:WikiSaurus:penis</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WikiSaurus:anus" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WikiSaurus:anus">Wiktionary:WikiSaurus:anus</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WikiSaurus:vagina" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:WikiSaurus:vagina">Wiktionary:WikiSaurus:vagina</a>, and how <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">Cannabis (drug)</a> uses <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary_Appendix:Cannabis_Slang" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary_Appendix:Cannabis_Slang">Wiktionary:Wiktionary Appendix:Cannabis Slang</a>) but there's often a sentence or two that could start an encyclopaedia article, if only people would stop trying to write a dictionary (or, as here, a thesaurus) in the same space.</li>
<li>My own opinion expressed at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_English_words_of_Greek_origin_6550.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of English words of Greek origin">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of English words of Greek origin</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_English_words_of_Latin_origin_3191.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of English words of Latin origin">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of English words of Latin origin</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7ELists_of_English_words_of_international_origin_89cc.html" title="Talk:Lists of English words of international origin">Talk:Lists of English words of international origin</a>, and elsewhere still stands: excise the thesaurus and <b>Keep</b> as a stub for <i>an encyclopaedia article about</i> body parts slang.

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs text modified, as such slang is certain <b>not limited</b> to adoscencents attempting to impress one another, but is in daily usage by members of both sexes in non-business level interpersonal communication. It is however very common outside the whitecollar workplace.

While I am amused at the topic extent of the coverage, I have to give kudos to the apparent completeness of the topic coverage. Such subject matter is not likely to be covered in any printed media, and Wiki strikes me as a perfect place for such outre' coverage. The article is further serious in tone, if not in impact while reading it's seemingly endless lists. If kept, I would expect writers of fiction to consult with it frequently as they struggle to personify characters and set them apart in their prose. As such, the collected wisdom therein may well be of far more social use than the dissertions of 95% of PHD candidates. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 23:13, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>this rapper is not notable and his annoying wiki edits are ruining our great encyclopedia. F White Dawg 18:01, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sup, BrowardPlaya? How does it feel to be up for deletion AGAIN? HAHAHAHAHA.... we're gonna keep putting this up until you get taken down. You have to win every time, and we only have to win once. That Bentley ain't yours. You ain't from no Westside. And you sure as hell have no right to call yourself a "nigga." Someone's gotta slap the teeth out your mouth, FOOL. I vote DELETE! Also I eat cock. TRU THUG 18:11, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would usually agree - the base policy being not to jump on new users - but looking at the comments left by "F White Dawg" and "TRU THUG" makes me fairly certain that their only purpose on wikipedia is negativity aimed at one particular user - BrowardBulldog. For a nice sample of <i>his</i> activities on Wikipedia, just look at the VfD entry for Wiked Wood. He has also been known to vandalise entries by placing an image of "White Dawg" next to a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentley.html" title="Bentley">Bentley</a> automobile in completely unrelated articles (such as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">Wealth</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich.html" title="Rich">Rich</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 15:29, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm confused: I don't think that it does.

<ul>
<li>After looking more carefully at the edits, I think what happened was that the previous VfD on White Dawg was still active; therefore, when it was nom'd again, people began adding comments to the bottom of the previous discussion. UncleG archived the previous discussion and re-posted the pertinent (current) comments all at once. I made the first edit to the freshly reposted VfD discussion. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 16:22, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>While I respect Jerzy's concerns, most of the early voters did <i>not</i> cite the copyvio as the dominant reason for deletion. They argued that this was "vanity" which, however prejudicial you consider that word, is the normal shorthand used here for an article about a person which is either <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">auto-biographical</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverifiable</a>. I find that there is concensus to delete this from the main article space on that basis.</p>
<p>Noting that there is an associated user who appears to be the same person, I am going to offer to move this to his user page. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:38, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

If he's one of the few who use the position as a rung on a political ladder, he may later become notable, but he's not now. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#People still alive</a> seems to establish non-notability. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a>~<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">t</a> 07:30, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I nom'ed this bio for n-n, and i'm a bit embarrassed to see "vanity" being tossed in, by the only three other del voters, as a reason. IMO we have here an honest misunderstanding (in fact, maybe only a <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> edited-in speculataion, rather than a disagreement) about notability here. We have here an apparently responsible professional, who realizes that stating the role of his personal leadership in innovation is part of the advancement of professionalism within his field. IMO there is such a difference in degree, between that and a student using WP for self assertion, as to constitute a difference in kind. We might be wise in general to consider including the word "vanity" (which presumes to determine a contributor's state of mind) a term of abuse worth mentioning as a form of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. In any case, vanity does not mean "n-n and autobio", and i am heartily sorry that the word is that popular, and that closely associated with "del", in this VfD. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a>·<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">t</a> 14:35, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is boilerplate, probably to protect from mischevious use by less than admirable people (suspects angry at the sheriff, for example) The Sheriff wouldn't take copyright on a city site, but he can maintain practical control.

Police chiefs of cities of this size are not generally notable.

<li><b>Information</b>. Thank you for your feedback on the entry. The copywright on the Police Department website was requested by me in order to control distribution of material. The government code in CA views Police Chiefs differently from other governmental appointees in that the Chief is soley responsible for all aspects of the department until they resign, retire or are removed from office. While it's rare, the PD holds the copywrite for the website and its contents, much the same as the Los Angeles Police Department retains control over various use of its name and/or symbols. Such authority is vested in the chief. The Yuba City Police Department is recognized as one of the most technologically advanced agencies of its size in the U.S. We often host visitors from agencies throughout the U.S. and abroad. We are the only municipal police agency in the nation to have gained clearance from the U.S. National Security Agency to act as an area hub for the receipt and dissemination of classified Homeland Security data. While listing in Wikipedia assists significantly in allowing a resource for interested parties to gain detailed background data prior to interviews on techknology and/or Homeland Security topics, I am very willing to be guided by your decisions. If the article is delated, I appreciate the venue as it has helped our agency since its initial posting. Thank you for allowing me to clarify some details. <a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdoscherca_f20f.html" title="User:Rdoscherca">Rdoscherca</a> 02:29, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Especially since Xoloz's "probably" is not good enuf, this is a valuable clarification, answering Rick's "why would they need a copyright claim...?" To flesh it out slightly, "in order to control distribution of material" refers in part to what is quite explicit in the statute:
<ul>
<li>the copyright protections everyone knows about apply (contrary to popular belief) even without any copyright notice.</li>
<li>the right to have your lawyers paid by the copyright violator when you sue the violator exists only when there is a copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The YCPD lost virtually all its copyright protection (with respect to the bio only) when the chief put the bio under GDFL by his submission, since GDFL gives such broad permission. IMO the mayor or council, and the city attorney, would at most grumble about whether other city officials might infer an unwisely broader precedent from this pretty special case.</dd>
<dd>The chief's language about "copywright ... requested" is a little confusing, but i assume he is refering to <i>asserting</i> (or legally, giving notice of) the copyright.</dd>

Those who are following this page without following the article have been left without what would seem to be the required notice that the VfD notice has been removed there, and a CopyVio notice put in its place. While my judgement is that the Chief's claim to exercise the copyright holder's power to put this text under VfD should be assumed valid in the absence of contrary evidence that has not been offered, there is IMO no reason not to let this play out on the Copyright problems page; AFAIK it will just come back here in due time, if Rick turns out to be mistaken.<br />

<p>A new article has been created, by the name of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_in_Norway_f558.html" title="List of airports in Norway">List of airports in Norway</a>. This new article:<br />
1) has the standard namespace (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a>)<br />
2) is better structured, and more extensive<br />
There is no need for two articles on the same subject. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Norwegian_airports_302e.html" title="List of Norwegian airports">List of Norwegian airports</a> contains no information missing on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_in_Norway_f558.html" title="List of airports in Norway">List of airports in Norway</a>, so no merge will be necessary, it should simply be made into a <b>redirect</b>. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 08:29, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The idea behind this is to have a system similar to <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, to determine when an article is 'half-decent' and label it as such. This system has not been advertised, discussed or even used, and frankly I fail to see the point. Is it by itself half-decent?

<li>I don't see the point at present. The only thing that comes to mind is a space for articles that would be useful for Wikipedia 1.0 but are not quite up to standard. However, I think the FAC and collaboration mechanisms would be better suited to these (although I'm not active in either, so I might be wrong). My first preference is to <b>archive</b>, but I'll vote <b>delete</b> as I wouldn't want to stand in the way of a consensus on either option. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Policy gets archived, not deleted. But there's no evidence that this was mentioned, much less discussed, anywhere before its inception.

<li>Actually the remit for VfD was orginally anything on WP. Since the Templates, Images, Categories etc have been spun off those deletion tools have defined remits.

<li><i>extended discussion in complete sentences</i> — If your argument is based upon the thinking that dictionaries are required to speak in telegraphese and so cannot contain articles with complete sentences, then it is ill-founded, since you are thinking of paper dictionaries. Not all dictionaries are paper. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:What_Wiktionary_is_not" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:What_Wiktionary_is_not">Wiktionary is not paper</a>, for one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:59, 2005 May 25 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FWIW, I oppose "dictionary definition" as grounds for deletion as a matter of course; on its own, all this does is raise needless controversy about valid stubs that begin at the beginning. Since that beginning, the concept has metastasized to articles that are "about a word." This is not a valid reason for deletion; ultimately every article in a written language is "about a word." The original "dictionary definition" ground was predicated on the notion that an article had no chance to ever become anything more than a list of synonyms; in which "dicdef" would be better stated as "unencyclopedic," and there are a host of math articles that ought to be deleted then, since they too contain naught but definition and tautology, and are far less intelligible than this. The instant article obviously goes far beyond that. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:26, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Seems notable enough. Doing a "merge and delete" is always a loss, because we lose edit histories. "Merge and redirect" is almost as bad. In this case it is especially not adequate to merge, because some of these articles contain explicit person metadata (eg, the birth/death categories). Plus, the SLA article doesn't need this much info about each of it's members, when the info is already well represented in these articles. I don't see how wikipedia would be improved by merging these articles. It certainly isn't harmed by keeping them. <tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <sub>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</sub> 23:47, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><small><b>Comment:</b> If you had even looked at the history, I removed the tag FIFTEEN DAYS after it was nominated, as it was evident there was either a consensus to keep or no consensus at all (I lean toward keep, as the only two votes were votes to keep it). The thing I'm probably most guilty of is not realizing, at that time, how to properly close a VFD.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 8 clear "delete" votes, 5 "keep" votes (one probable sockpuppet discounted) and 2 votes that were too ambiguous to call. The debate became very heated and appears to have focused on the content of the article overlooking the original reason for nomination - that the content is more dictionary-ish than encyclopedic.</p>
<p>I do note that an introduction to the article was created late in the discussion period. Votes continued to be mixed after the addition of the introduction. In my judgment, the introduction was insuffient to convince the majority to change their votes and retain the list as an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>In general, "list of ABC slang" articles have been deemed necessary evils - ways of discouraging the endless re-creation of dictionary entries. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">Military slang</a> is a good example. The topics were deleted, moved to Wiktionary and deleted again. The community concensus was clearly and repeatedly expressed that these terms belonged in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. Yet they were being constantly re-created by new users in ignorance of prior decisions. By centralizing the terms in a single list, we believed that we were containing the policy violations somewhat and providing a way for new users to gently learn that Wiktionary is a better recipient for these contributions.</p>
<p>So far, no evidence has been presented that the topic of Singapore sexual slang will receive the same volume of editors nor that this topic will be endlessly re-created by new users if it is moved to Wiktionary. In fact, the evidence presented makes the opposite case very convincingly. Accordingly, I am going to exercise my discretion and call this decision as a "move to Wiktionary".</p>
<p>I'll further note that based on a spot check of the terms listed, they appear to already have been moved into Wiktionary. Since there appears to be nothing left to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a>, I will execute the last step of the process and delete this left-over. Warning: I have not checked every term listed. If someone needs or wants a copy of the list in order to do that verification, please contact any admin. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:23, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Wikipedia is not) A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide. Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., are used. We aren't teaching people how to talk like a leet cracker or a Cockney chimney-sweep. However, it may be important in the context of an encyclopedia article to describe just how a word is used in order to distinguish among similar, easily-confused ideas, as at Nation or Freedom. In some special cases an article about an essential piece of slang may be appropriate.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is obviously one Wikipedia policy that needs to be reviewed. Why should Wikipedia unnecessarily restrict itself by excluding dictionary entries, especially when the information provided here cannot be found anywhere else on the World Wide Web, or even in print form for that matter. If you don't believe me, try searching for such info yourself! Starting a category of dictionaries, slang included, would be a wonderful growth opportunity in this uncharted territory.<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroyn88_fb24.html" title="User:Groyn88">Groyn88</a> 19:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

I point out that for the very reason that Wikipedia is not a dictionary we <i>started</i> a category of dictionaries (actually a single dictionary of all languages) <i>back in 2002</i>. It's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Main_Page">over there</a>. The problem is not Wikipedia unnecessarily restricting itself. It's <i>you</i> unnecessarily restricting <i>yourself</i>. There are many WikiMedia projects (which complement one another in all sorts of interesting ways).

<li><b>Keep</b> if it can be converted and expanded to include a linguistic discussion of the evolution of this sort of slang in the different languages, how it is used in popular culture, etc. Should be more than just a list. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 09:24, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Blackcats has offered a wonderful solution! I shall convert this list into a full-fledged article which discusses the use of sexual slang in Singapore.
<p>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that these words and phrases are NOT <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologism.html" title="Protologism">protologisms</a> (as defined by Wikipedia), which Uncle G has implied. The traditional slang words have been in use for centuries (if not millenia in the case of the Chinese dialects) and the ones coined in the new entity called <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> have been around for decades.</p>
<p>An analogous case in point: take the English slang words 'fuck', 'shit' and 'cunt'. Before the 1950's, say, one would be hard put to find such entries in any respectable English dictionary, comprehensive or otherwise. This does not mean that these words were '<a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologisms.html" title="Protologisms">protologisms</a>'. They had been in use for over a century if not more. The same applies to the words I have listed. The fact that you cannot find some of this information anywhere in the virtual or real world demonstrates a salient aspect of Asian culture. We put on a smiling obsequious face while locking our dirty linen firmly in the closet. My aim is to bring out that dirty linen and subject it to academic scrutiny...and let outsiders have a sniff too.</p>
<p>Let me quote from Wikipedia's <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> policy: 'In some cases, where an article makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_pie.html" title="Apple pie">apple pie</a> or <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a>).' The latter description fits my list to a T.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate as Uncle G suggested to update the 'steam' entry in the English dictionary because <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> is just not English. Moreover, there is no entry called 'burung' at the moment, and to create one out of the blue with no categorisation or context would be meaningless.<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroyn88_fb24.html" title="User:Groyn88">Groyn88</a> 15:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong on nearly every single count:
<ul>
<li><i>It is not appropriate as Uncle G suggested to update the 'steam' entry in the English dictionary because <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> is just not English.</i> — Wrong. One doesn't even need to read any more of the English Wiktionary than its <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Main_Page">Main Page</a> to know that it takes Singlish. The main page clearly says "all words of all languages".</li>
<li><i>these words and phrases are NOT protologisms (as defined by Wikipedia), which Uncle G has implied</i> — Wrong. I didn't imply it. <i>You</i> did. Your very words were that this information "cannot be found anywhere else on the World Wide Web, or even in print form for that matter". If someone has not used these words with these meanings in print, then these are definitions that someone <i>wants</i> to be the case, not what actually is. If someone has used these words with these meanings in print, then the information <i>can</i> be "found anywhere else, or in print form". I suggest that you work out which of your two mutually contradictory assertions is the true one.</li>
<li><i>An analogous case in point: take the English slang words "fuck", "shit" and "cunt".</i> — Wrong. It's not analogous, because those words <i>were</i> "found in print form" (and notably so) before they entered the dictionaries, contrary to your claim above that <i>these</i> words cannot be. As such, the whole of that argument is ill-founded.</li>
<li><i>Moreover, there is no entry called 'burung' at the moment, and to create one out of the blue with no categorisation or context would be meaningless.</i> — Wrong. That's just an excuse and a rationalization for doing the work in the wrong project. In reality it's just as simple to edit <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burung" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:burung">burung</a>, with the same definition as here and an indication that the word is Singapore slang noun, as it is to make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_sexual_slang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13898308" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_sexual_slang&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13898308" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>; and, unlike the latter, the former is productive, useful, the first step along the way to a full Wiktionary article, and another word that people can then look up the meaning of. Wiktionarians would certainly <i>prefer</i> a properly formatted article, as it would save the New Page Patrol the work, but a good faith attempt at an article on an attested word is certainly not rejected. Please lift your self-imposed restriction and come and write your dictionary entries <i>in the dictionary</i>.</li>

<li>Comment: At one point somebody (in favor of keeping) said that there was no documentation of Singapore's sexual slang in print or online (and that this article was therefore important to keep), and since then several people (in favor of deletion) have argued against this straw-man on the basis of orignial research. But I don't think the original assertion is actually true. Singapore is a populous enough country that there's gotta be books and websites elsewhere which could be cited that doccument this sort of slang and its evolution, use today, society's reaction to it, etc. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 05:35, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My vote is <b>Keep</b>, as it is no less WikiFriendly than many other language pages. I also include the comment below which I found on the talk page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is a page of important academic linguistic information. It is difficult to locate such topics on the internet. Please do not try to prudishly censor or deface it, or try to get it removed.Groyn88 13:55, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> Can you please define the significance and importance of such crude language? Crude, sexual slangs are always despised by the average person. And it is very easy to find on the net for many Singaporeans have their own blogs, and adding in vulgarities is no rare phnomenon. I did not say that I will vandalise the article at all, Groyn88.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And Wikipedia is a place that is not meant for such crude terms. If all the sexual slangs from every language in the world are to be listed, I feel that wikipedia will become a cheap-skit encyclopedia if this goes on. Wikipedia knows it well: Writing such obscene terms are banned from Wikipedia; and even the official wikipedia policy agrees to my viewpoint.</p>
<p>Let's come down to the social factor; does the world leaders ever use such obscene terms? I believe that they never do such sinful things that go against the will of god. And wikipedia is a high-class encyclopedia that will and always defend itself against such sins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hello, Mr Tan. I would like to express my disagreement with some of the points you have raised:</li>
<li>"<i>Can you please define the significance and importance of such crude language?</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From an academic linguistic point of view, every word has a rightful place and context in any language. Calling them 'crude' is making a sociological value judgement. Linguists document <b>all</b> elements of a language, and do not try to whitewash or censor aspects of a tongue which offend their subjective personal sensibilities.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Crude, sexual slangs are always despised by the average person.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You must either be living in an ivory tower or have earplugs permanently stuffed in your ears. Sexual slang is used frequently in everyday life by average people. Can you truthfully declare that you have not heard a person whose mother tongue is Hokkien often use the expletives I have listed in the 'Hokkien' section? And have you, your family, your friends and fellow Singaporeans not occasionally uttered them yourselves? Let's not be hypocritical, naive and narrow-minded. Or try to paint a rose-tinted view of reality.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"<i>And it is very easy to find on the net for many Singaporeans have their own blogs, and adding in vulgarities is no rare phnomenon.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Vulgarities in English and Singlish, yes, but can you point me to a single blog that uses Hokkien, Cantonese or Tamil expletives? And wouldn't it be helpful for a foreign sociologist researching local linguistic culture and evolution to have a guide to these phrases, one that is so difficult to locate anywhere else?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"<i>If all the sexual slangs from every language in the world are to be listed, I feel that wikipedia will become a cheap-skit encyclopedia if this goes on. Wikipedia knows it well: Writing such obscene terms are banned from Wikipedia; and even the official wikipedia policy agrees to my viewpoint.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You obviously have not read the lengthy Wiki article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a>, or any of the numerous articles in the Sexual slang category like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pussy.html" title="Pussy">Pussy</a>, List of sexual slurs, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_names_for_the_human_penis.html" title="List of names for the human penis">List of names for the human penis</a>, etc. Or any of the even more numerous articles in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a> category like <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunt.html" title="Cunt">Cunt</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cock.html" title="Cock">Cock</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick.html" title="Dick">Dick</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crap.html" title="Crap">Crap</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arse.html" title="Arse">Arse</a>. etc., etc. Please check them out yourself before making such totally inaccurate statements.</dd>

<ul>
<li>"<i>does the world leaders ever use such obscene terms? I believe that they never do such sinful things that go against the will of god.</i>"</li>

How do you know that world leaders do not cuss in private? The Bible or other religious canons have never expressly labelled vulgarity not directed against religious figures as a 'sin'. That sexual slang is a 'sin' is your personal opinion. Moreover, Buddhists, Daoists and atheists do not believe in the existence of an absolute God.</dd>

<li>"<i>And wikipedia is a high-class encyclopedia that will and always defend itself against such sins.</i>"</li>

<p>A violation of just about all conventions. The beginning makes it clear that it's just a soapbox for a relatively little-known advocacy group: "On March 6, 1996, David R. Morgan, the National President of Veterans Against Nuclear Arms presented The Sixteen Known Nuclear Crises of the Cold War, 1946 - 1985 to enumerate those world events wherein the imminent use of nuclear weapons was either threatened or implied." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:58, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You people seem to be missing the point. The article will not make a basis for a list of Cold War-era "nuclear crises." As it stands, it is just a random sample of topics that really have nothing to do with each other aside from being listed in the same speech by an anti-nuclear activist. The only place for this list is the article on the individual making the speech. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:44, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The basis of the article is that on the listed occasions "the imminent use of nuclear weapons was either threatened or implied". This is a fairly sensible and verifiable criterion and we can remove any items that don't reasonably qualify here. Some items may be questionable and should be removed, but this doesn't invalidate the basis of the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:44, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you are adding "implied" to the criterion, the classification is anything <i>but</i> easily verifiable and easy to qualify. This leaves way too much leeway for interpreting intent. You will never find total consensus among historians for every item that could possibly listed, barring the classic case of the Cuban Missle Crisis. Consider, e.g., the hotly debated claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were really hollow threats to the Soviet Union by Truman, who was exploiting the U.S. nuclear monopoly and knew it to be so. This interpretation has been one of the most hotly debated arguments in the historiography on the Cold War ever since the British physicist PMS Blackett first made it to wide notice in 1948, and especially after revisionist historian Gar Alperovitz supported it in 1965. Imagine the POV dispute here on Wikipedia that would occur if someone tried to add an item to the list based on it... While arguments that other events were backed by implicit treats of nuclear force might not be as emotional, they are not at all any less complicated and any more easy to interpret. As a rule, classification schemes for history are generally not as simple as they would seem at first glance, and they certainly are not in this case... Further, this list serves no useful purpose. A good survey article on the Cold War and the arms race ought to link to all of the events that would be listed on such a page. Such a list would be way too much trouble (including the likelihood of "original research") for whatever potential value it might have. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 16:47, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I take your point about "implied". I would not expect events involving such interpretation to be included. I do think the article even in its present, unverified form is useful and may stimulate further research. If it should prove to be valueless then it will languish for a year or two and then we can revisit it. If it should <b>both</b> prove valueless <b>and</b> attract controversy all the better; give the edit warriors something to do instead of arguing about <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>, or whatever.

<ul>
<li>It would generate further <i>original</i> research, as no reference authority has established a standard list of Cold War "nuclear crises." BTW, I hope this "spread the damage" mentality has not become the norm on Wikipedia since I left as an active editor a few months ago. Edit warriors should be stopped when they are spewing crap into the Castro and Pinochet articles, and they should be stopped when they are messing up more obscure topics. When I singed up for an account in 2002, the objective of Wikipedia was to develop a credible internet sourcebook. Now the objective seems to be providing people with a social outlet and babysitting difficult users. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 06:53, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>. The claims are true. This fake codec installs a Trojan in C:\Windows\System32, filename msmsgs.exe and adds a startup entry to HKLM:...Run in the Windows registry. It's detected by Microsoft Anti-Spyware and described as Messenger.Viruswarning Trojan. The program displays a pop-up message every several minutes to tell you your computer is infected with some virus. I had this Trojan infecting my system myself and killed it by just deleting this file msmsgs.exe from C:\Windows\System32 and removing the startup entry in the registry.</li>

The Stagecoach corporate article is a background and detail on the corporate firm, the subsidiary articles (of which there are several) contain, or have the potential to, far more information on the history of the local company rather than it's parent group.

<li>After much thought, I have decided I'd like to <b>keep</b> this article. We have articles on far less noteable professors. Also, a lot more than what is currently written can be verified through third-party sources, even if it admittedly isn't exactly always easy. I just hope it doesn't turn into a biased "faculty testimonial" again. (Yes, that's biased, because it is designed to convince the immigration office what a great guy he is.

<li><i>Comment:</i> The same (actually more) information is available at Wiktionary. These articles are not like the ones on Latin and Cyrillic letters: those talk about the development of the letterforms, while these are simply pronunciation and definition.
