<li><b>Keep</b> - This is no different than any other poet or writers page, I can see a couple of items that look pompous but I have edited them out. You might as well delete all the poets in all the lists because they all contain relevent information on the persons accomplishments. Who is saying it is a HOAX?? All information is true. What is unvarifiable? Where is the material used in the accusations. Are you going to delete my other articles?? I am not tooting my own horn but I am known in Canadian poetry circles, I have made a contribution to Canadian poetry and Canadian "Small Press Publishing" and No to deleting me or any other poet just cause you dont know them. I will continue to try and learn wiki principles and editing practice and I DO rework pompous or personal pages to appear more neutral.
<p>There is such a thing in both Canada and the USA calles Small Press Publishing. Not all poets start out or continue with major publishing houses. Local and regional Small Press Publishers can publish famous and not so well known poets and authors. As far as the ISBN's I rarely noticed them in other authors pages, however I have taken note and mentioned that listing a book without the publishers name is the same as just making it up and writing anything down, THAT is unverifiable. I have been endeavouring to update and add many Canadian Publishers so the wiki links are there. Personally I never think of the ISBN in verification because the name of the publisher is usually listed and I know many of them. WayneRay 00:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</p>

We all know them and the names and the editors etc, You don't, and they are classed as minor? Hardly any had ISBN numbers attached and several had no publisher at all. They are still notable in the Canadian literary scene. Are you or someone going to delete them all???

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've not written any articles on authors, but if you type out the ISBN then Wikipedia will automatically link to sources for that book like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0590353403</a>, it just makes it easier to check.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-known in Canadian small-press publishing; I agree the article needs improvement. The notability of poetry is inherently hard to judge in an age when even well-known poets sell very few copies; I would hate to think that this means poetry is inherently unencyclopedic or that a quick google equips one to judge its notability. There's also some history here: the nom's suggestion of hoax may seem bizarre, given that a quick google shows he exists. But in fact the same nominator was behind two failed AfDs for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Faiers_4f91.html" title="Chris Faiers">Chris Faiers</a> two months ago; the second was opened ten minutes after the first was closed as no consensus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> per Capitalistroadster. Writing about yourself is generally bad, but it seems a mistake to delete an article, because the writer was blatant about it.

<li><b>Reply to all</b> Thanks for the positive and negative input. I took a look at 30 other Canadian poets in the List of Canadian Poets and theirs or most of the Small to Medium press published poets, have a similar article page to mine so why not delete all of those?? I shall endeavour to do a Google search on US and Canadian poets just to see what the counts are and put them beside the poets names. ALSO in regards to Amazon.com: As a publisher I was heavily involved in listing my app. 200 paper and electronic books but after 5 years deleted them all. The Canadian Poetry Association has its own electronic bookstore as does the League of Canadian Poets. Maybe I and others are staying Canadian! You might want to also try www.abebooks.com as well. I will add the ISBN's to the book lists as well as update the List of Canadian Poets ISBN's as there are very few listed there and on many US poets pages. And put back the award after I verify a link with the CAA. <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 13:01, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused. The article was originally created about the older guy. But based on googling, everything about him is garbage. It is impossible to be an academic at that level, with published works, and a tenure as a university chancellor, and not show up on Google, but there's nothing there, not one single hit. There never was such a professor. Everything I can find that seems relevant points to a 19 or 20 year-old KC kid with autism who's active in Missouri politics. Was it a hoax and then someone else came along and repurposed the page to talk about the kid? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:27, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Possibly. It is also possible that the anon editor and the creator of the page are the same person, perhaps who created an account specifically to create the article and then edited it as an anonymous IP.

<li><b>Delete</b> She's just another nobody whos using the internet towards a weak attempt at fame and obviously just putting on an act to garner attention. The whole thing is just a phase that will die out by the summer. Overall, she doesn't deserve the attention shes getting..

Now, if the bio is to stay on wikipedia, then it should be truthful and not sugarcoated, because while she is gaining "fame" from YouTube, it's a known fact that she is disturbed and is currently in therapy for having a sexual fascination with children.</li>

<dd>I see that you are right, TBC, and I should have clicked through a few more links.

<li><b>Improve</b>. Having found some useful articles on other entities in the alphabet soup that is the British vocation qualifications industry, I created the article as a sort of placeholder, hoping that someone would add detail. I believe it is a noteworthy body, and will myself fill it out eventually, if no one better <i>qualifed</i> gets there first. Please be patient: Rome wasn't built in a day etc. The article should probably be under SFEDI's full name, with a redirect from "SFEDI", but I don't know how to do that.TobyJ 10:04, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although it is not obvious from the article, this is a company set up (and largely funded) by the UK Government to design standards for training in the small and medium enterprise sector.

<li><b>Delete w/o prejudice</b>; no doubt a neutral and encyclopedic article could be written on this subject, but there is very little here other than a collection of links with brief editorializing.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well I still think there's a double standard on Wikipedia, as I mentioned in the comparison to a non-webcomic website. We are much more likely to keep the article on the webcomic, and yet ditch the website. But I didn't vote to delete the article because of its association with Adrian Ramos and Count Your Sheep, which has won lots of awards. Take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_44_Scotland_Street_69df.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/44 Scotland Street">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/44 Scotland Street</a>, the author of that book is way more notable than Ramos, but it looks like that article will be deleted because of its lack of content. Wikipedians seem to believe that a webcomic is inherently more notable than other subjects, and that they should be treated with greater leniency. A website with an Alexa rank in the hundreds of thousands and no press outside of their own circle would be deleted, yet a webcomic probably won't be. Claiming that just by belonging to a webcomic collective like <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> or indeed the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a> as mentioned above is like claiming that all published books, all signed bands, every single TV episode is notable enough for an encyclopedia. And that's something I don't subscribe to. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:51, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: My comment regarding your incivility was based on what felt to me like an assertion in your first comment that people voting keep on this article, and webcomic inclusionists in general, are hypocrites who simply pound in "keep" on webcomic AFDs without giving any thought to arguments for deletion. Your more recent comment is completely civil and, while I don't agree with it completely, does a much better job of getting me to understand your point of view.

<p><b>Comment</b> I note that no-one has used the talk pages for either article to discuss cleanup, citation requests, or reliability concerns. So why the sudden jump to AfD? Jabrwock 18:04, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can someone point me to where the policy of noting online resources as unreliable is located? I am aware of the rulings on blogs etcet, but is there any rule in place saying that online resources are inherently less reliable then print ones? I consider this quite the oddity concerning that wikipedia itself is striving to become a reliable online resource. SanderJK 20:06, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>See the guideline page <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, which provides details about how various sources fit in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. Really, an item in an edited and peer-reviewed online publication is more authoritative for our purposes than one person's unchecked opinion that gets into a print magazine. It's just that online stuff has much more original un-fact-checked material compared to "reliable" material, so people overgeneralize. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just to note, if the articles get merged with the main one then all the Gamepolitics stuff will be removed --Shaoken 05:34, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes it would. The reason for this is that because of wikipedia's verifiability and sources rule, gamepolitics.com counts as a blog and forums. Which are not verifiable sources by wiki rules. Now i could be tempted in a debate to consider the front page of gamepolitics.com as a news source not a blog, since it's written by multiple people on a professional level, and it's hard to draw the line between what constitutes a blog or an independent source. However anything that happens on the livejournal forums is 100% unacceptable unless a secondary news source reports on it. Wether that's fair or not is personal, but such are the rules. It does make some sense though, since already in the past bans have deleted slews of source material for the original article. SanderJK 11:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>You are incorrect sir, the site is merely FOUNDED in DC, that does not mean it is limited to DC. And whoa re you to determine if it is innovative?

<p>Is there some threshold level of success Wiki requires before Exonc could be relisted.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> unless actual indications of notability appear. It's a national organisation with (apparently) active branches in most Austrian universities, and would thus make a <i>prima facie</i> case for notability. The websites (I read German) have no info on the number of members, though, and the forum (of the Vienna branch) has 24 registered users. Also, there is no indication of any real-world impact (media mentions, etc.) and it has 453 Google hits.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't believe that this is even being discussed. I am not a WoW player, however this character was mentioned in a forum by other people. I was glad I could find out about it here on wikipedia. WoW has a significant cultural identity and following, and being able to garner a bit of history on this character was enlightening to this non-player. So, deleting this would be subtracting from the knowledge about this increasingly important game, whether you play it or not. If it's burdensome to have this entry, it should be put in another article that could be redirected/found through search. This really should be a no-brainer. And this is coming from someone that doesn't play the game. anon 09:05 26 April 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>If the [[<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article is too large and this god is too minor to justify inclusion in the main article, I think it would be better (and consistent with how <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> handles characters and narrow topics in other types of fiction) to <b>merge</b> all WoWcruft articles to sub-articles such as Gods of World of Warcraft and Dungeons of World of Warcraft.

<li><b>Question</b> Would any packaged drink you could buy at a single bar be suitably notable? (Probably not) 100 bars? 100,000? (almost certainly yes) I honestly don't know about this one. Do we have any sales figures for it? Do we have articles on every microbrewery for example? I'm convinced this is not a hoax. Any proof that it's influenced anything though? The articles given verify that it exists, but not that it's notable "enough". Hence my question.

<li>I think my view is fairly pragmatic, and I'm not at all anxious about it. But I'd like to ask you perhaps to consider being a bit less cryptic if you can (your comment was right below mine, after all so it certainly seemed like it possibly was directed at me) and perhaps not quite as sarcastic. "It's not dreamt of in Hahnchen's philosophy so out it goes!" as you said elsewhere just does not seem like it's adding a lot to this search for consensus, which turns on notability (I feel verifiability is satisified)... it's a legitimate question being asked. Show us how notable. How well does it sell? If it doesn't sell well, how much impact has it had in other ways? I'm coming around to "it's notable enough to merit a keep" but it's not because of your comments. I have found in the past that comments that might be perceived as combative undermine the case. People ask because they care. Even deletionists care. Hope that helps. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:34, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you feel verifiability is satisfied, only you know why you're still arguing about it with me. You must surely know that I, and many others, simply will never agree that a thing needs to be your or Hahnchen's idea of "notable" before it gets an article written on it here. Given that, it comes down to whether you are able to muster up sufficient votes for deletion to convince an admin to delete it. The notion that a good argument wins over many, many votes is laughable. Anyone who has made a good argument for keeping an article that was subsequently deleted knows that. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>By virtue of the band's web presence, I think it can be considered a web meme in addition to a band. Therefore, not having a full length album isn't necessarily a limitation. Moremoire 03:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is linked from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_content_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of content management systems">Comparison of content management systems</a>. We deleted Canadian CMS Products a while back because there was no evidence of market specificity; I think the same applies here (as per the Countries column, which clearly shows that many of these are not US-specific). In software, for English-language users anyway, it is more remarkable if a product does <i>not</i> originate in the US than if it does. Most of these are redlinks. I don't see what this adds to the parent article other than additional miantenance overhead and lots of weblinks to products without articles. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:48, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guys- I'm really sorry I created all of this. When I sat down and followed links to video art (as I explained to roger) I found all the usual subjects listed. There's a hundred unlisted artists who should be on this list and sorry, yes roger, vain or no, I should be in there. It's a matter of history really. We didn't all do this work for no reason. It was amatter of comittment. Anyway, the list is the list and I sat down and thought right I'm going to write the bio and put in info about myself and some of the people I knew doing this stuff. What's nice about Wikipedia is that histories can be written NOW - and also by those that were making that history. This is fundamentally different from his story as written in normal encyclopedias - this is a digital change. I completely understand the issue about all and sundry writing themselves as heroes in their own lunchtime and maybe I do fit that category - dunno, I shall make the work anyway and my day job pays for the art. I've talked to a few other people in the area and at this moment other histories are being written (the Rewind Project at DUncan of Jordanstone in Dundee) but wether they can outweigh the official histories time will tell. Hang in there and of course whatever you choose so be it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the creator has tried to introduce many articles on Filipino films and actors which are not easily found on Google and poorly represented on IMDB. If you look up the words individually on IMDB (eg, "Apat") you can see that there are a few Filipino films listed. I'm neutral on the decision, because the articles he writes are full of typos, badly organized, and basically unverifiable by the current editorship on WP, but I do think he's acting in good faith. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 16:04, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Gnosticism_0f56.html" title="Modern Gnosticism">Modern Gnosticism</a> describes the personal theories of the article's author, synthesized from a motley collection of philosophers, novelists and films. It thus constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It began as a "modern mysticism" section which (s)he first added to the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">Demon</a> article, but then removed and expanded to form the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Gnosticism_0f56.html" title="Modern Gnosticism">Modern Gnosticism</a> article after its verifiability was questioned by other editors. After much debate and coaching (sorry, there's a huge amount to read there) the article reads (at first) a little more like a bona-fide article, however I'm fairly convinced that almost nothing in the article is representative of anyone's theories but the author's. The name of the article itself, "modern gnosticism" is somewhat arbitrary (the author also suggested "modern mysticism"), and is not an established technical term that would distinguish it from <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism_in_modern_times.html" title="Gnosticism in modern times">Gnosticism in modern times</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> as it stands now. In law, a variety of "dead hand problems" arise. The phrase is more familiar to me in matters of wills and trusts: to what extent do we want the dead to be able to direct the lives of the living by putting various conditions on inherited money. The law of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortmain.html" title="Mortmain">mortmain</a> sought to restrict tying up land indefinitely by giving it to churches and other corporations. (Might make a good redirect.) This sense is rather minor. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think I may have stumbled over a debate that's grumbled on for a long time - whether comparisons can be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">Some users</a> have even left the project agonizing over this question. Personally, I'm with that guy - unless there's a large amount of non-comparison context for it, such as the 7th gen game console article, or the comparative lists of weapons used on either side of the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven-Year_War_075e.html#Weapons_Used_During_the_Seven-Year_War" title="Seven-Year War">Seven-Year War</a>. Comparisons are somewhere in the grey area between encyclopedic knowledge, original research, and how-to guide. In this case, I think it's pretty clear that, whether intentional or not, this article reads like a buyer's guide (which is implicitly verboten in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as a form of how-to) and contains the author's original research (his definitions of an "economical car" or "hybrid body design"). <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> 21:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I honestly can't decide either way about this article. Under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it fails, but it has a popularity greater than that of many other sites on Wikipedia. So it seems very possible that someone might visit that site, then look here to find out more information on it. But because it seems not to have any references outside of its own domain, the article cannot be sourced, so only things that are self-evident from visiting UGOplayer itself can really be included. And that means this article will provide no new information that couldn't be discovered from just visiting the site, rendering it fairly pointless.

It has high alexi ratings, it has many google hits, and it is probably one of the 5 largest non-centered forums on the web (EbaumsWorld, YTMND, Newgrounds, SomethingAwful, and Flashplayer. All are based on user submitted work, and have no direct focus on any topics). If that is not notable, then I do not know what is. It has 60,000 members, unless you for some reason believe the site lies regularly. I disagree with the notabiltiy "Requirements" for a website, and this is the most obvious case.

<li><b>Comment</b> The question should not be one of notability here, it should be that there are no sources from which to build an encyclopedic article. Wikipedia is, quite clearly, <b>not</b> a web directory; therefore we require independent sources from which to document a given topic. In this instance they do not currently exist, and thus an article which does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> cannot be written.

<p>Tagged as a speedy with the reason "Non notable airman. Wikipedia is not a genealogical database nor a collection of obituaries. Why is Willie Lee notable compared to the thousands of other airman slaughtered in WWII?". Nonetheless, at the bottom of the article we have "His name is on the Roll of Honour in the Hall of Memory at Auckland Museum.". This is in my view an assertion of notability, although I am not at all sure that it is sufficient for inclusion.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>; no assertion of notability -- I wouldn't consider the standard listing given to every NZ soldier who died in WWII such an assertion. It's a well-written article (and is the original editor's sole contribution, so I don't think anyone would mind Rchan writing more noteworthy articles), but from what I'm seeing this is just an average joe who signed up in time of war, like everyone else, and died in training before ever seeing combat, as many did. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a memorial.</a> <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b>; The reason that I wrote the article is that that Willie Lee is <b>the only Chinese Spitfire pilot in WWII</b> (how many of them did you think there were?). How can this be non notable? Where I come from, his story has inspired generations of Chinese New Zealanders (I should know, I'm one of them).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other "average joes", Willie wasn't just another volanteer, he literally forced his way in. And all this for a country that disliked him and where he was a second class citizen. In his shoes I would have left them to it. If any of us achieve half as much in our lives then we'll be lucky. I'm sure the article about <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> says where he was born and when, where and how he died. By your definition sounds like an obituary to me but I don't see anyone trying to delete that article.</p>
<p>To say Willie Lee is non notable is an insult to a unique individual and thousands of Asians that "stood up to be counted" in a war that quite frankly was none of their business (Does "defending your way of life" include getting spat on in the street and getting the cr*p kicked out of you regularly? Don't even get me started on this topic.).</p>
<p>As I'm still trying to write the article (and probably will be for the next several weeks), I'm highly disappointed that you all are so set on shouting me down and deleting my work before I've even finished. Your response will dictate whether I continue to contribute or write off Wikipedia as just one big joke. Rchan</p>
<dl>
<dd>If Willie Lee has inspired generations of Chinese New Zealanders, there must be some articles or a book written about him. If there is no such written material, then the article becomes unverifiable. Even if the written material is only available in Chinese, please provide a reference to it. It doesn't have to be online. I vote reluctantly to delete the article, but I'll change my vote if such a reference can be given.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 00:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No notability has been demonstrated, especially since the article not only lacks sources, it's mostly speculative.

<li><b>Delete</b> I am disappointed that the editor has chosen to be so upset about this AfD. As someone who has suffered serveral AfDs and continued to write, I think he should gird his loins. I put this article up for a speedy on the grounds that there was no notability indicated in the article. The editor makes a range of assertions but has not backed them up with verifiable evidence which is what WP requires. The editor says that deletion of this article shows WP to be a joke. I suggest otherwise - that it shows a willingness of fellow editors to make sure that articles that appear demonstrate notability. There are 120,000 dead Australian soldiers, sailors, airmen and nurses listed at the Australian War Memorial. Nearly all were volunteers. Many were 'foreigners' and yet we do not write articles for all of them. I am happy to change my vote if you can show he was notable and the information you present is verifiable.

<p>An extended-length POV rant, including section titles such as "False ideas about the Jonangpa Origin of the Kalachakra" and "Why is this (making the ban known) very important to the world&#160;?". Interestingly, this article as written is not primarily about Taranatha, but about the banning of the Jonang school of which he was the leader, a topic which is the subject of its <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_on_Jonang_2015.html" title="Ban on Jonang">own article</a>, written in much the same style.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It wasn't clear to me from the responses above whether people have understood me as endorsing the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_on_Jonang_2015.html" title="Ban on Jonang">Ban on Jonang</a> article, which is not what I intended. I have removed the sarcasm from my statement above. After reading through it, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_on_Jonang_2015.html" title="Ban on Jonang">Ban on Jonang</a> is, if anything, worse than <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranatha.html" title="Taranatha">Taranatha</a> is, containing statements such as "The present article is written under the auspices of the Ngorpa school which is furthering the cause of peace and also that of the Sakyapa school despite several Sakya followers having sided with the Gelugpas" and "Now, it is the Ngorpa school that is cleaning up the mess they've made. And the prophecied return of Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo, the Second Buddha .... is here indeed, to save world-Buddhism against the meddling and disastrous situation ...", etc., etc.</li>

<dd>I'm not really sure what the best way to proceed with these articles, and I would appreciate opinions. I started this AfD this morning after I started trying to clean-up <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranatha.html" title="Taranatha">Taranatha</a>; when I realised that most of the text would have to be removed altogether, I decided it would be better just to AfD it and start over. The tricky thing about these articles is that they are explicitly POV, and they cite websites as sources, which makes it hard for a non-expert to separate fact from opinion. However, they contain such a large amount of editorialising relative to factual claims, that it might not really be practical for an expert to go through and clean it up, rather than just writing a new article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, I don't think that <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranatha.html" title="Taranatha">Taranatha</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_on_Jonang_2015.html" title="Ban on Jonang">Ban on Jonang</a>. Taranatha is an interesting historical person who is certainly not significant only in connection to the ban on Jonang. There's no reason he shouldn't have his own article, and I intend to write one. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 00:37, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> if you plan on a rewrite, no real need for AfD. Remove the text of Tarantha and start a new article there with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> information and sources listed. AfD of the article followed by a recreation of a different article with the same name just makes more work for the admins. If you run into content/edit wars with the party who has created the current version there are all kinds of other resources you can use (help from other editors, RFC, or arbitration if it gets really heated).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm the first poster above - I'm not sure how you put your name on this, hence the anonymity, but I can categorically state that I did not place the second post up. I also think that there is something scary and very wrong with your answer - are you seriously saying that the veracity of Wikipedia is based on whether posts on a debate make established editors angry? Is that the proper way to go about things? I apologise if my post was "combatively-phrased" I was merely noting the irony of one of the prodelete posts virtually proving the case of blogger fanniness!</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I actually left the second of the two "Don't Delete" votes above, and just forgot to sign. I know people who have had perfectly good Wiki articles deleted without even a vote taking place - therefore the whim of one particular admin decided the fate of an article. I already had this 'Fanniness' article removed within 1 minute of being posted -with no vote - a couple of weeks ago, and decided to try the community once again. It looks like I'll lose this particular vote but at least the due process is being carried out on this occasion. --Gashdot</li>

<li>It is indeed negative, but especially in an area of Wikipedia where we decide whether articles are worth keeping, few of us would buy into the inference that Negative = Evil. As to whether it is correct, hm. Can you name us a few globally significant vloggers? As in "recognized by the mass media" or by the populace at large?

Blanket statements are often perceived as an attack and rarely add any valuable argument to a debate.<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPdelongchamp_f199.html" title="User:Pdelongchamp">Pdelongchamp</a> 19:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Mm, I think you're missing the thrust of our discussion in tying your thesis together, although if this was the proper venue for a debate on its merits, I wouldn't compare podcasts to radio stations, but to the number of <i>programs</i> on radio stations, which is far less of a superficially impressive ratio. Be that as it may, none of the above addresses in which fashion <i>Cooking Kitty Corner</i> satisfies the criteria under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. An argument based around why we should find Rocketboom notable, and therefore CKC must be notable because its content is linked on Rocketboom, is circular at best. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:21, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree and understand that radio stations aren’t easily compared to podcasts. I was thinking the same thing as I read the article (stations vs programs). Can you please, however, address the fact that I responded to your question? I find it confusing that in response to my answer, you question the appropriateness of the venue. As for Rocketboom, I’m not arguing its notability. Rocketboom <i>is</i> notable. Therefore, Cooking Kitty Corner having been the subject of Rocketboom, whose source is independent of CKC, reveals notability. <a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPdelongchamp_f199.html" title="User:Pdelongchamp">Pdelongchamp</a> 21:24, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested PROD. The article's subject is a Department of Defense internship; it is, it should be said, broader in scope that a traditional internship, inasmuch as the program seems designed to produce career employees. Nevertheless, the program is non-notable and the level of information in the article unencyclopedic.

<p>Article is exclusively POV and unreferenced claims about size: "The website is probably one of the most influential gay community sites (certainly in the UK where it has most of its members)" " The main differentiator of the site is the organization of events that take place in the real world and the emphasis on friendship."

<p>I can track down a reference for the membership numbers, but this can't be <i>checked</i> without access to some very sensitive information from the site owners I would imagine. It isn't exclusively POV, the feature list is factual, the date of inception is factual. As another member has stated, the Alexa ratings are factual. The info about SING is factual. None of this is POV. I would also draw your attention to the article <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_%28magazine%29.html" title="Out (magazine)">Out (magazine)</a> that is written in an almost identical style, with more hype! I'n not suggesting that a bad article is kept because there are similar ones on wikipedia, but a consitant approach is needed. The website site is a genuinely important one with a history (especially) in the UK which is pretty much unique. Many of the 50,000 members would vote for the entry to stay I'm confident.David scholefield 13:47, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fantastic, if they vote then it stays, that's the idea! And while I agree that its Alexa rank of 35,000 is respectable, as it is the article reads like a PR release or commercial... All it talks about are its free services, boasts its membership and even its charitable contributions! Maybe a rewrite is in order.. remember this is an ongoing process, if you improve the article then everyone's happy&#160;:) - <b><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">Gl</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">n</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStollery_0895.html" title="User talk:Stollery">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stollery_ef7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stollery">C</a></sub> 13:52, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are also misunderstanding POV - if I wrote an article about me that just talked about how much money I had, how big my house is, how many BMW's I own and my Black Amex card - it could all be factual (no in my case it's not but you know what I mean) but only shows MY POV.

<p>The term 'POV and unreferenced claims' is emotive and suggests that my article is not substantiated. The point I'm making is that the membership figures can not be completely substantiated beyond the owner's claims and common sense arbitration through personal experience. The remainder <i>is</i> my POV, but is also factual (as is the case with most scientific theories if you want to get philosophical about the nature of fact). In some ways the comments about it being a bit like an advertisement I agree with, and a re-write is probably a good idea. This is a <b>long</b> way from immediate deletion though isn't it?David scholefield 14:10, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Explain why it is a linkspam to list a site of support, information and education? I see there are other sites as such, also who promote and sell things, so I am unclear on what is acceptable. I was followng what others have done. Elovesme99</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The spaming is the process of linking to a site/book/article/organisation that one is personally involved in or of providing a link that promotes a site, not whether or not the item is worthy in its own right. The support group would be appropriate to refer to if reliable 3rd parties have indicated its notability, and one can thus cite that source to verify the assertion of a site being notable and thus worthy of inclusion. A link to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> is pemitted because the company is notable and one can cite newspapers announcing their first construction of cars using assembly line techniques, dominance in car sales etc to verify this claim. My local garage might be unusally cheep and efficient, but having no sources to cite that this is the case, it will never have an article about it, nor a link to its welcoming website. I'm sure the boundaries of wikipolicies are hard to define and judgement needs be used on a case-by case basis. Equally I'm sure some articles have been less well checked for adhering to policies than others - hopefully in time all articles will be of consistant standards. If you encounter obvious breaches, then just as any user, you may edit that part of an article, raise a discussion on its talk page or nominate the whole article as failling to meet wikipedia criteria for inclusion. I agree there are quite a lot of polices to become familiar with, so observe how other discussions discuss these or related topics and feel free to continue asking questions&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 15:41, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will concede as it's obvious I've made some mistakes. I hope judgement on the part of the Wiki-ers improves over time and that people who make suggestions about deleting something might be credentialled, or at the very least, would have experienced something to know about it. I would never write about having a vasectomy because it's not something I have or can experience. I appreciate Dr. Rubens and the administrators remarks on how to do things and how to improve the article/website etc for inclusion on Wiki, but some of the other people really shouldn't preach what they cannot practice.

<li><b>Comment</b> As is discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves" rel="nofollow">here</a>, "merge and delete" is a theoretical possibility, inasmuch as contribution history can be preserved, as is required by the GFDL; the process is, though, it seems, time- and patience-consuming, and so it is looked upon with disfavor. I do agree that a redirect wouldn't serve much purpose, but that's likely the way we'll have to go in the event that "merge" is supported (I would have suggested a "merge", but I think that most of the information on the band page is unencyclopedic; if the article is deleted, relevant information can surely be gleaned from the school's webpage and inserted into the article about the school writ large). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a mixture of biography and likely slander. It might possibly be saved, but the subject may not be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. It was put up for speedy deletion, but this was contested on the discussion page. No vote. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 22:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I definitely think D'Agata should be considered "notable." He's simply a brilliant writer, and has made important contributions to creative nonfiction. At best, he's often credited with inventing the "lyric essay" (this isn't true; it's a form with a long tradition, but the fact that the misattribution is so prevalent [read a profile of him that <i>doesn't</i> mention it] is testament to his role in renewing the essay as literature. At worst, he's won major awards (a PEN) and regularly travels the country because he's in demand as a lecturer, workshopper, and general bright young thing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.56.250.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.56.250.181_3f60.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.56.250.181">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Caveman book is self-published by an online vanity press. His column does not 'appear' in the US metro- ONE of his columns HAS appeared, not in the print version, but on rather what seems to be the online repository for reader's contributions (<a href="http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/entry/Women_are_from_Venus_and_men_are_from_bars_/1701.html" class="external text" title="http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/entry/Women_are_from_Venus_and_men_are_from_bars_/1701.html" rel="nofollow">see here</a>) the 'Metroblog'. A google search for "Woman magazine" "roger mccartney" returns 3 hits- all of them self-contributed to the vanity press website. The above contributor- User: David Janes - is the author of the article and sole material contributor. His only edits are to Roger McCartney.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I thought that the whole purpose of Wikipedia was that of an encyclopaedia. So that if someone was interested in finding out who Roger McCartney is - and judging by the news articles quoted above - he has some notability, then they could use Wikipedia to look him up and find out more about him. The question is is this person notable? The facts are he writes for "Woman" Magazine, readership 1.2 million. He writes for Metro newspaper - IN THE PRINT EDITION! He has a book out, self-published or not and he broadcasts on radio and TV in the UK. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> David Janes - 17:21, 22 April 2006: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> They claim to be the inventor of the technology, so that's a claim of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>. Being a competitor of the inventor of a technology is not a claim of notability. Also, the article is written as an encyclopedic entry about the company and its processes, rather than a huge free advertisement. Finally, the article is in one place and not dotted all over our encyclopedia, something that puts peoples' collective backs up as it is spamming, pure and simple.

<p><b>I am quite puzzled by this extraordinary level of uptightness from what I USED to regard as an easy-going, well run online resource. This small page can hardly be doing any damage to the massive, global servers of the almighty Wikipedia. Since its inception, the page has generated a lot of interest from fans of Max Payne and is a useful source of publicity for the film, so I am genuinely disappointed that it has been "nominated for deletion" - I mean, how anally-retentive can a website be that they would deny a small, independent film (which will be available in the US!) the tremendous benefits of a mere page on this resource. So go ahead, you sad, petty, arrogant, self-righteous, stuck-up faggots - delete the page - prove to the world once again that you can 'stick it to the little guy', that there is no help out there for up-and-coming film makers, for independent films. Well done, you've won and I hope it feels great - now go home and boil some babies or something.</b> Oh, and seeing as you're supposed to be an encyclopaedia, you should appreciate the need for correct grammar - <i>"and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Max+Payne%3A+Payne+%26+Redemption%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Max+Payne%3A+Payne+%26+Redemption%22" rel="nofollow">131 Google results</a>, coupled with <a href="http://www.payneandredemption.com/blog/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060408-150255" class="external text" title="http://www.payneandredemption.com/blog/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060408-150255" rel="nofollow">being rejected 5 times from IMDb</a> don't really help the case"</i> - "doesn't really help the case.", thank you very much.</p>

Comment on the page deletion by James Hampstine&#160;:</p>
<p>Personaly, as a Fan of the Max Payne universe I am exited at the prospect of it being brought to life in this indipendant movie. I think its a shame to delete the page. You talk about notability. Well this is the first serios independant film based in the Max Payne universe. And since Max Payne has quite a large following around the world I think that is a pretty notable thing. As well as having people who are working on the film who are already featured on the IMDB database like Justin R. Durban &amp; Michael Johns.I beleive the director was using a certain amount of sarcasm in his blog post on the P&amp;R site concirning the number of times the film was submitted to IMDB. Indeed the IMDB rules state that for an independant movie it has to be finished or for there to be good proof that it will be finished before they will allow it onto the database.</p>

<dd>Hey there, James! Note that I've got nothing against this movie (save for the fact that it won't be out in the States -_- ), but in order to keep Wikipedia from being overrun with descriptions of non-notable Star Wars and Star Trek fan films, Geocities sites or other things that haven't had a big impact on culture aren't really allowed here. What Saberwyn was talking about was that a reliable source would be the Chicago Sun or some other paper, or a seriously notable website like Aint It Cool News, and not someone's blog or a small-time (albeit useful) site like Paynereactor.com. This isn't in offense to you, and once the movie comes out and it has an IMDb page and all that good stuff, the article may be re-created. As an <a href="../../../s/y/s/WP%7ESYSOP_9bfc.html" title="WP:SYSOP">administrator</a>, I have the ability to view deleted pages, and would be more than willing to help you re-write this.

<p>Comment on this page deletion by Cap Lorien.</p>
<p>The producers of this movie have already done a lot of work and I'm convinced it's going to eventually be released. As such, it belongs here like other such movies. The whole point of this site is to provide information and this is valid information. Please don't delete it.</p>
<p><br />
Comment on this page deletion by Luke Morgan-Rowe, Executive Producer of Max Payne: Payne &amp; Redemption.</p>
<p>OK, I now have a compelling reason, as well as my well justified moral ones, why this site should not be removed. Two seperate French websites, discovered whilst scrolling through our mere 131 google results, confuse our independent film with being the official Max Payne one - a level to which we do not wish to be lowered. We need a page on a well exposed, well respected site (or even online information resource, such as an encyclopaedia), as well as our website, to provide the general public with information about our film, so as not to create irritation and potentially serious confusion, such as the one suffered by our Gallic friends. Now I wonder where we could put a page like that?...</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, Mr. Morgan-Rowe, a section of one of Wikipedia's main policies states that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host.2C_blog.2C_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a free webspace provider</a>.

If such information from such sources can be provided, now or at a point in the future, I will be more than happy to stand by its inclusion, but at this point in time, I'm going to have to disagree with its inclusion. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 02:28, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - yeah, yet another such note from a fan of Max Payne - per crystalballistic fanfilmatious existence. I won't step this up to strong delete for that "You All Suck" rant up there, now matter how tempted I am. This said, I don't mind seeing a <i>short</i> mention of the thing in an appropriate <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Payne_dc8c.html" title="Max Payne">Max Payne</a> article. After all, game articles (in my opinion) can have brief information on upcoming, as-of-yet unreleased mods that are far along their way, while (I think) making full articles on the aforementioned mods may be pretty ridiculous unless they're actually released. A fan movie is in this regard no different from a game mod. So I suggest condensing this thing to a mention in an article, and welcome back with a full article when the thing is actually released in any <i>viable</i> scale. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:58, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm with wwwwolf. I would also like to add that once the movie's actually out, it may very well become a phenomenon that justifies its inclusion in Wikipedia -- it <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops_%28fan_film%29.html" title="Troops (fan film)">wouldn't</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_Edit_7eac.html" title="The Phantom Edit">be</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lucas_in_Love_e779.html" title="George Lucas in Love">the</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wreck_2e2e.html" title="Star Wreck">first</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Star_Trek%7E_New_Voyages_25d2.html" title="Star Trek: New Voyages">one</a>. As it is, this is an article about a project that may or may not ever actually realize itself. Is the movie even going to be released? It may be, and I wish the best for the creators, but it's also possible that it never actually gets finished. We don't know, and we can't know, but we certainly know that if every single announced independent fan film project out there was actually made, there'd be a lot more fan films out there than there are right now. We are a not a crystal ball or an advertising platform. (Also, this is beside the point, but being called a sad, petty, arrogant, self-righteous, stuck-up faggot doesn't exactly make me full of sympathy. I only hope that the guy who wrote that rant isn't actually involved in the production of the movie itself. I like independent movies on principle, but I kind of have a problem with jackasses.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article appeared and I posted a DB-bio, then the article creator deleted it without disputing the claim (always suspicious). Now that I see its still around, I still don't see notability. Google search and Yahoo search turn up different people under the same name. this appears to be using Wikipedia's great ties to search engines to get some free publicity. With the protection of the AfD process, I put it to Wikipedians.<br />
