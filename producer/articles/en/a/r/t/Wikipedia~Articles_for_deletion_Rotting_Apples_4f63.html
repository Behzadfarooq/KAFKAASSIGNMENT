However, since those who want to delete it are not from the band's town, it is hard for them to know who they are. Notability has been established already, as the band is the leading figure in the early 90's alternative rock resurgence in Bakersfield. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well then one should not presume that merely because you have not heard of Rotting Apples means that they should be deleted. A fair number of articles are on Wikipedia which I have had no previous knowledge of. That is why they are put on Wikipedia, for the spread of knowledge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> But those articles have validity behind them. The only proof of this band's existance is a myspace page. You have been asked to prove notability, but fail each time. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And yet that proves that the band exists, and if you happened to live in Bakersfield, and go to their shows, you would know their position in the music scene. I've happened to watch the development of this band for some time. I do not know what other validity I can provide for this article, other than my own testimony and the proof of the existence of the band. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> However, existance is not enough. To understand the true policy of Wikipedia in terms of this article read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. This is to prevent anyone whom has just created a band by flogging Wikipedia down. I am in a band myself, but I don't post a page about us since we are not notable under that code. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 23:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> WELL IF YOU WOULD ACTUALLY STOP AND LISTEN, as I have stated before, you do not live in Bakersfield. Hence, YOU would not know. If someone were to just "flog Wikipedia down" once the band was created, that would have been done when they were first formed in 2003. However, this article was not created until AFTER they made a name for themselves in their town. Which is a term of notability in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, being the most prominent member of a musical movement in their home town. And that's what they are. Period. I don't know why you guys are making such a big deal out of this, clearly you have priority issues. And if you delete the page for that crack, then you've got even more problems. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I know that none of you care about this band from Bakersfield, but people from Bakersfield do. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is nothing wrong with Bakersfield, however your logic is drastically flawed and skewed. If everyone in my town (Boston) suddenly just looked dirt and called it "adsaffasf," I don't think it warrants it's own page. That was the situation with the word Redonkulas. Just because something is popular in a concentrated area, doesn't make it noteworthy. Also, I fail to understand why Wikipedia is such a popular medium to generate buzz. Use Blogspot, geocities or stop posting here and just rock out. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 23:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Holy crap just leave the damn thing alone. I want these guys to have a damn entry, I don't know why you're making such a damn big deal about the whole thing. I don't know why you have to pick apart every single little thing, if you just left it alone, all would be well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would a nice little groupshot photo of them suffice for whatever it is is bugging the hell out of you? Do they not look important or something that gets to you? They're an indie band in Bakersfield. That's how Korn started for christsake. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GoodvsEvil (<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoodvsEvil_ca7a.html" title="User talk:GoodvsEvil">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GoodvsEvil_3a8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/GoodvsEvil">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korn.html" title="Korn">Korn</a> is NOW notable, this band isn't. Give them props by talking to some friends. Besides, having a wiki page means people have to search for it. It doesn't mean people will find it. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 00:02, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The leading figure in the early 90's alternative rock resurgence in Bakersfield??

<li><b>Comment</b> HOLY FLYING FUCK. You know what, fine. I don't care. It's not my fuckin band, I don't know why I kept fighting you dicks on this. All I have to say is that you guys have got waaaay too much fuckin time on your hands. Just delete the fuckin thing now and get it over with.
