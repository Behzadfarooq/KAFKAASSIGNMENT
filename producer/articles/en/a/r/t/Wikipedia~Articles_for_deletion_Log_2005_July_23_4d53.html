<li>Is there any good reason not to <b>merge and redirect</b>? Or at least merge? I think the article as it stands is decent, and as a section in the HBP book article might be good. Yes, the HBP article is getting long, but I think coverage of one of the book's most crucial mysteries is the sort of thing we do for more "classic" literature. I don't see why it would be inappropriate here.

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has been improved, but this only shows that it needs to go away. There's very little in there and little hope of expansion unless we go back to lots of speculation.

<li><b>Merge</b> -- R.A.B. by itself can mean manythings and nothing in particular from an encyclopeadia point of vue.

<li><b>Keep, possibly merge</b> R.A.B. is likely to become a well-known and much-debated mystery figure as we wait for the seventh book, and so there should be a reference about him/her, however basic or seemingly trivial the information within the article may be. What's more, this is a definitive character whose identity will eventually be revealed, and when that happens, the R.A.B. article can then be merged appropriately. <a href="../../../s/o/v/User%7ESoVerySpiffy_5bb3.html" title="User:SoVerySpiffy">SoVerySpiffy</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/v/User_talk%7ESoVerySpiffy_fe8d.html" title="User talk:SoVerySpiffy">Talk</a> 07:06, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I rather think the inverse of that is true. Until there is enough content for an article it should be merged (it is already mentioned in no fewer then 4 other articles with essentially all the information here).

<li>I find it hard to imagine a way that book 7 could make this article grow beyone confirmation of the name of the charicter in question. If it is very significat to the plot then the content belong in the pag on book 7. If it is not that significant then it adds perhaps 2 sentences to this article. This is at best a <i>partial</i> sub-plot of a book that is unpublished. A book that already has a large number of articles where this information belongs.

<li>Ah, but you're taking it out of context by not telling what the registration-required article really says. "Digital media often play a major role in the establishment of nascent nations.

The duke has graciously granted all scientific research operations within the realm four years to register their presence with his government." That's like me stating I'm the Great king of Brettland.

<li>I agree. And if the article's claim that it's 'Canada's largest pharmacy providing world-wide prescription services' and 'caters to over 30,000,000 Americans who are under-insured for prescription medications' are true, then it's certainly notable and I don't see why it should be deleted. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 00:56, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I created this article originally, as part of the early general elections of the Northwest Territories. There was no actual general election on this year, and it was based on some misleading sources, the election result listed was Federal in nature.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Gcapp1959. I created the stubs for 1897, for which I have read a historical remark many years ago, and for 1901. 1896 is unfamiliar to me. I will say that I've noticed repeated shuffling of Wikipedia articles for the years through the 1896-1905 period, and I don't know why. It just doesn't seem likely that there was more than the elections of 1897 and 1901, and since it was non-partisan before 1897, I doubt that federal authorities would have allowed elections at short intervals in such a sparsely-populated area before 1897. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 15:08, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Has it crossed your mind Ulayiti that maybe word of this Vfd has gotten around and supporters of the Atheists of Silicon Valley have come here to vote for it? What is up with persistent claims of "sock puppets" made without any attempt to verify if usernames are coming from the same IP or not. You will find that they are different IPs, different people.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually what has happend is that the word has gotten around in the Atheist community about the twin attacks on both this entry and The God Movie that was shut down twice by a false copyright violation claim. So there are a lot of enraged Atheists who are here for the first time and they don't yet have accounts. That's why only IP addresses show. But they aren't Sock Puppets because people who do sock puppets are regular users who have a number of fake identities. What you are seeing here is outrage.

<li>A perverted process indeed. Whether or not all edits are by the same person makes no difference, as it is Wikipedia policy not to count VfD votes by users with no previous contributions.

The Universists have been in the New York Times, BBC, major papers across the country, on the cover of a local magazine, and are cited in US News &amp; World Report this week, among other media such as national radio shows. Oh yeah, and you know the documentary that cites the Atheists of Silicon Valley in the credits?

<li>Fake encylopedia? Well, that would be an "encyclopedia" that anybody on earth can edit. That's not an encyclopedia, and it's highly unfortunate that people think it is. This site is entertainment for its participants and it's popular because people of its google rankings (which result from its constant updating and masses of information of unjudged value) and the fact that millions of internet surfers don't realize a 10 year old just edited the article on terrorism they're reading. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 05:18, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> People have ALREADY voted, and would like their votes to count. A revote would just send the message that on Wikipedia, we vote again and again, as many times as it takes until certain people like the results. Also, a vote to merge would result in ASV being entirely deleted from Wikipedia, since the information here is superfluous elsewhere. For example, if this topic were merged into <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Atheists_1bb3.html" title="American Atheists">American Atheists</a> then it would eventually be deleted from that page because it doesn't have anything to do with that organization.</li>

<li>Nobody's claimed it it's anything more than a local radio show. And BTW, being a regional issue/concern/group is not sufficient justification for deleting an informative article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> ASV's entry needs to be expanded, not, deleted. They are very active both on the internet and in the Bay Area. They were a strong presence at the 9th circuit court of appeals protest for Michael Newdow. Their coordinator Mark Thomas has appeared on national televison, radio and in newspapers several times, most recently he debated Oliver North on Hannity &amp; Colmes. The party making this complaint is simply trying to squelch entries having to do with anything that offends him. It is sickening to see such a clumsy attempt at censorship for no legitimate reason.

<li><b>Comment</b> With all due respect to the rules of Wikipedia, this may be one of the most imporatnt topics that can be covered here. Maybe not as it is written, but, imagine some worker some where (probably Europe) and they need to know if some work related thing is covered by safety regulations. If they're lucky they get to fire up the computer, and there it is! In bold electrons the answer they need! And Wikipedia helps someone in a very real and tangible way. Maybe even saves someones life...woah, heavy, eh? I dunno, I vote <b>Keep</b> with some <b>massive</b> editting this article could be THAT useful.

<p><b>Comment</b> For the record, there has been some stacking going on in this VdF. It used to be that what was above my below post was a previous VdF against Boddah (or was here when I made the VdF page, anyway). These previous votes now begin with <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a>'s and end with <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>'s, as best I can tell. Now multiple votes have been moved, making figuring out who did them more difficult, but I've listed their authors as best as I could.--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 08:32, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> by jab (209.221.45.145) There is no stacking, but whoever added their vote just put it on top instead of putting them on bottom.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Boddah is a prominent channel of a very large IRC server. I'm surprised that articles such as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a> containing such popular phrases as <b>Bourneville Boulevardier</b> (a homosexual man from Birmingham) and <b>Kosher Klansman</b> (a Hassidic or Orthodox Jew) are more notable and less offensive than this article. <small>(posted w/out signing by <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Ables_cc1c.html" title="User:Mr. Ables">Mr. Ables</a>--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 08:25, 24 July 2005 (UTC))</small></li>

<li><small><b>KEEP</b> There's much more offensive material on here (for example, the above) than on this page. It's just detailing the culture and history of the chat. CaptaintravelB</small></li>
<li><small><b>KEEP</b> This is a very prominent chatroom on IRC, and socially important.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I really, really don't like most lists, and I'm not crazy about this one.

<li>Comment: I am about to try my Amazon test. I am going to search for books published by this publisher on Amazon.com. If they have published any books with an Amazon sales rank number less than 200,000, then I consider them a publisher of real interest to English-speakers and will vote to keep. Here goes. 167 books listed. Sort by: bestselling. Top is: Minjung's Pocket English-Korean &amp; Korean-English Dictioanry [sic], ISBN: 0930878027, Amazon.com Sales Rank: #154,297 in Books. Next listed is: Korea: Tradition and Transformation&#160;: A History of the Korean People by Andrew C. Nahm, ISBN: 0930878566, Amazon.com Sales Rank: #606,866 in Books. The fact that 167 books are listed should somehow count for something. I conclude that they pass my test and they are a "real" publisher and of legitimate interest to English-speakers with an interest in Korea. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:31, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Keep-- I've worked through Roadmap.., which is due out 7/2005 in its second edition. I've done foreign language courses in a half dozen languages and what his book does for Korean is something I wish for in all other languages: sociolinguistic detail, learner "in hindsight" commentary, overall schema for approaching various parts of the language/society. About the basis for Wiki presence/absence, I can't say, but weighed in terms of significance of Roadmap to Korean for English-language native speakers taking up the Category IV language like Korean, this book is valuable.</li>

<li>KEEP -Roadmap to Korean is the most complete and thorough introduction to the Korean language of its kind. It provides a unique look into the 70 million people who speak the language around the world today. I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We celebrate the cultural diversity of our country. I am constantly asked by colleagues why bookstores like Indigo do not carry more books, authored by Canadians, living abroad. In the past month alone I know that this book has been requested by a British author, 4 Canadian authors from Japan (living in Canada), the University of Toronto, George Brown College, York University and McGill University.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The show was actually started in mid 2004 and has a moderately small but growing following. The article was written by a fan, and not by the creators, and therefore was not created with the intent to promote the site. Google returns more hits when you don't type in the actor's name, (although they are harder to find due to the phrase being used in a lot of Easter egg and video game sites) since most mentions of the site are quotes from the show and not about the actual performers.

No attempt is made to sway the reader to visiting the creators' website (ie. advertising) and it takes a neutral stance on the content. If the article had proclaimed: "Insert Disc Two is a hilarious, brilliant take on comedy", yes, that would be biased and grounds for deletion. But this article is not simply a commercial. In all fairness, the article briefly explains what the show is and simply tells of its history and influences. In short, it provides those curious about the show information to better understand it, which is what a good encyclopedia entry is supposed to do. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 15:04, 23 July 2005 (CDT)

Saying that the votes of people with a so called "vendetta" against your site is not too terribly different than how the owners are more likely than not furiously messaging all their friends on AIM to support the entry. Like it or not, insert disc two is nothing more than a website visited by the owners and their immediate friends - the guestbook only has six entries to it since april. If the site was even remotely popular it would certainly have more than this. Additionally, I might add that my own site (the one referenced in the Amendemnt above) is FAR MORE POPULAR than Insert Disc Two (avg 500-1k visitors a day when i sit around and do nothing), but an article made totally without my knowledge was deleted in accordance with Wikipedia policy, and, well, I agree that it should have been deleted.

<li>I didn't realize that was your special code. I just copied the sig of the first person I saw and changed the relavent information. My apologies again. I promise I have not been up to any foul play, I was just trying to organize the page. My OCD I guess. I have not forged any votes, and whatever vandalism happened here, I was not involved in it. If the page is deleted, so be it, I respect the whatever decision Wikipedia makes. However please know that the site has been dealing with vandals for months and they have posted an entire thread on their forums dedicated to vandalizing our Wikipedia page. This has gotten much messier than it should have. I promise not to make any other alterations in formatting. Hopefully the voting can continue in a mature, civilized, and TRUTHFUL manner. Thank you.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "just that the page exists is advertising." Then by that logic, with all due respect, so is every other article on this website. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be funny, I'm just having trouble seeing the argument there. Merely documenting something, ie. this show, isn't advertising. The only argument that seems to be sproating here is that because the show isn't well known, any sort of referencing of it here would be a means to increase attention, and thus its advertising. In that case, their only crime is not being well-known enough, which is no grounds for deletion in my opinion. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 15:04, 23 July 2005 (CDT)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Your site recently deleted an entry for another online television series, one that had a rapidly growing following. When that series originally came out, Scott Kurtz of PVP put the link on his site causing a massive increase in popularity. That series had not only Kurtz as a fan, but also a prolific Hollywood producer. In the case of that series, the creators did not make the page, nor did they modify it ever. The fact is the Internet is the new big entertainment medium. An article written by someone who has never met the creators but merely talked to them online is the same as an article written by someone who has never met a celebrity; merely had their fan mail answered. If this is advertising, any page on very minor celebrities can probably also be considered advertising.

<dd>I did not say they were celebrities.

Maybe O'Brien is much more prolific than the folks at ID2, but it doesn't make the page his fan started any less of advertising than the page ID2's fan started.

<p>The idea that the site is visited only by people who "talk to the creators online" is completely made up. The creators of the show have, yes, talked to people online who have visited the forums on the site. However, only ONE PERSON knew them PRIOR TO viewing the show. Commenting is fine, but please at least assure that your comments are truthful.</p>
<p>Also, I have not forged any votes. I noticed that one person did not sign his vote. He didn't know the format to use, so I said I could just fix it for him, and I guess I got the username he gave me (JohnnyLawRoutine) wrong.

Ian was simply saying there's a lot of stuff on Wikipedia that very few people care about to look up, so that shouldn't be grounds for deletion. I believe Ian's point was that Wikipedia should contain information on anything that is in the public eye, just in case people want to look it up, and the statement that "nobody cares about this" is not a strong argument.

<li>But is is difficult, however, to consider this show "not-notable" when there is obviously a strong following supporting it. Granted, it may not be a large or widespread community, but this show obviously has a niche following which its creators received as a result of performing both live as well as online. The fact that many of the show's fans, including the one who authored the page, have come out so strongly to support this article seems to indicate that it is notable, at least in the eyes of its growing fanbase.<tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 18:34, 25 July 2005 (CDT)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I already voted, and I don't want to start a fight, and I hope what I'm saying isn't misinterpreted at all, but I don't see how votes that simply say "delete, advertising" can be considered valid when there have been many points listed as to why the entry is <i>not</i> advertising.

"Besides, if it's that popular. How come the website only has 1905 hits?" I think I should probably clarify an earlier comment of mine before it causes further confusion. I defended the show as having a "strong" following. By that, I meant "devoted," as opposed to "large" or "widely popular." My mistake. On a seperate note, perhaps a possible solution would be a compromise. That is, to have the article's author/authors edit the site so it feels more in line with Wikipedia policy and less as a vanity or advertising page, since so many people here seem to feel that it is. Just a thought. <tt>arthur42</tt><tt>(talk)</tt> 13:04, 26 July 2005 (CDT)</p>

<dd>I've watched some of the videos and I actually think it's quite funny. You may well have a strong cult following. BUT, I'm sorry, it (IMO) is not currently notable enough for an entry in an encyclopedia. Try again when ID2 has gained wider recognition.</dd>
<dd>Also, I took a look around and I can't see any votes that just say "Advertising". Some say "nn advertising" or "vanity, advertising". This doesn't mean the article is written in a POV way. It means that the voter doesn't consider the subject notable enough for an article. Thus the existence of the article itself may be considered advertising or ego-stroking.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable. Show is very new and does not appear to have had any influence outside of its extremely limited fanbase. At the moment, the number one result for a Google search on "Insert Disc Two" (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Insert+Disc+Two%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Insert+Disc+Two%22" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>) is this vote for deletion page--beating out the official website. While that is probably only the result of fans and foes of the show link-spamming to attract votes, the fact that a VFD page was able to exceed the Google ranking of the show's official website in such a short time is, in my view, a fairly clear indicator of its lack of notability. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:50, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form and has already got a quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, even though at least one of them ìs "notable" per these <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">criteria</a>, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated.

Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not an absolutist about keeping every possible piece of knowledge on Wikipedia, but in this instance it is not clear to me how to make an objective decision about which conlangs to include and which to exclude. I mean, just look at the following three things I discovered with the randomizing function: <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohtas_Fort_6a52.html" title="Rohtas Fort">Rohtas Fort</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Arms_3dd2.html" title="King of Arms">King of Arms</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellsville%2C_Ohio_6185.html" title="Wellsville, Ohio">Wellsville, Ohio</a> (population: 4,133). Should every fort in Pakistan, every member of the hierarchy of heralds, or every city in Ohio, no matter how small, have an entry? Well, maybe. The decision is ultimately about counts as important, and nobody can predetermine what will count as important before it actually becomes so. Brithenig is a small conlang, but one developed by a number of people, and has drawn some attention in the online conlanging community; it is equivalent to a town slightly more important than Wellsville, Ohio. But Wellsville has an entry. Why not Brithenig? <a href="../../../t/r/w/User%7ETrwier_773c.html" title="User:Trwier">Trwier</a> 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heresiarch, you are making me very angry! Where did you get the godforsaken <b>arrogance</b> to state these things? I have been in contact with Andrew Smith at numerous occasions, and I can testify that he is an extraordinarily gentle and modest person. I hate to see him accused of "vanity" by someone who obviously doesn't know him, doesn't know his creations and doesn't know anything about conlangs in general. For the record, he did not create the article himself, nor did he contribute anything to it. Likewise, your accusation that this is an "advert" is ridiculous! I've nothing against a little healthy polemising, but ad hominem attacks like this one, so deeply under the belt, are really out of line. By all means be ashamed of yourself! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 22:45, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>And so are yours! Why otherwise would you be counting the edits of everybody who votes "keep" and complain about the fact that someone made a note of these VfDs at ZBB? What counts is that people are wikipedia users. There's nothing wrong with notifying other wikipedians that a VfD has been made in a field of their interest. Since you are so interested in the personal background of the voters, consider this (from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_Deletion_fa1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion</a>): <i>You don't have to vote on every nomination; even consider not participating if: a nomination involves a topic of which you are ignorant; [...]</i>. For the record, I have no problem with the status quo. It's you who want to delete these articles, so if anybody were supposed to come up with good arguments its you! Frankly, I haven't seen any yet. All you could come up with is: non-notability (not a real criterium anyway, see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html#Notability_not_a_criterion_for_deletion.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">here</a>); vanity; and advertising (both evidently are complete nonsense). I must say, in related discussions in other wikis I've heard much better arguments! Now I'd love to give you a whole list of arguments in favour of all those articles that are currently under attack, but I wonder if it wouldn't be worth the effort to have all these discussions in one place. So for now I'll limit myself to this: language construction is a serious, full-fledged artform, and most of the languages that have attracted your wrath are excellent, important and representative examples of this artform. Therefore, their lemmata are warranted. For the record, I'm nót proposing that every conlang have its own entry in the wikipedia. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 07:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

What is it that sets <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a> apart from <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a>, where you voted delete, IIRC? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 13:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC) <small>actually from earlier this morning, forgot to sign</small>

<li>I think it was the fact that "Brithenig is respected among the conlang community, being the <b>best-known example of the altlang genre</b>. It is the <b>first known</b> conlang to extrapolate a real Earth language through an alternate evolution, and as such can be considered the <b>grandfather of the genre</b>."

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. It's sooo tiring: every once in a while someone pops up who claims that all conlangs are non-notable and who want to limit the pages about it to Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua. Why can't those people accept that language construction is a form of art like any other? That the audience is smaller doesn't make it insignificant IMO. Now I agree that it is important to distinguish between notable and non-notable conlangs. But being a conlanger myself and knowing my way in conlangland, I assure you guys that Brithenig is an extremely notable language: it has been an immense source of inspiration for many other conlangs, it is the first known and most notable language of its kind (the "altlang" genre). It's a true masterpiece! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 22:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>...someone pops up who claims that all conlangs are non-notable and who want to limit the pages about it to Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua</i>: Sorry Jan, but I think there is a huge distance between languages seriously designed for real-life international communication, and languages that form part of some work of fiction someone pursues as a hobby without any evident audience. "Klingon" or Tolkien's invented languages are special cases as they have established a huge audience. Further, see mine and others' comments on <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a>'s <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Wenedyk_2610.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wenedyk">VfD</a>.

<ul>
<li>There ís such a distinction, Thorsten. Brithenig and other artlangs have not been created with the purpose of building up a community of speakers. So, you can't judge them by that criterium. That's my entire point here! As for the hobby element: yes, that is at least an argument. But if you ask me, virtually every form of art starts out as a hobby and in many cases never ceases to be one. Admittedly, the audience for artistic languages is a rather small one. But that conlanging is not the kind of artform people make a lot of money with does IMO not render it insignificant. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 11:14, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>NB if you insist on using the number of speakers as a criterium, we might as well delete at least two third of the auxlangs listed in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_auxiliary_language.html#Auxiliary_languages" title="International auxiliary language">International auxiliary language#Auxiliary languages</a>. In fact, their case is even worse since they serve no other purpose than being used by "the world", while in reality they never gathered a community with more than a neglectable number of speakers. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 11:14, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jan, I do not at all insist on the number of speakers, but I do agree that a significant proportion of auxiliary languages on Wikipedia probably are, at best, of borderline interest to anybody but their creators or smallish fan communities. But as I tried to explain on Wenedyk's parallel VfD, two wrongs don't make a right, and neither do two thirds of wrongs. <i>"every form of art starts out as a hobby and in many cases never ceases to be one</i>" - that is true enough. But for me, the decisive question is not what something starts out as, but what it ends up as - and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a> has yet to transcend the status of a private hobby, at least I see no evidence that it has already accomplished that. Once it has, I'll be glad to renegotiate my vote. To use a Dutch example, had Van Gogh not posthumously received the recognition he was denied during his lifetime, we would rather not have immortalised him here, either, even if the paintings were the same. <i>"conlanging is not the kind of artform people make a lot of money with does IMO not render it insignificant"</i>. Not by itself, no. But, like it or not, the way our society is structured, making a lot of money with something usually proves that it is of significance. Of course, if something isn't making lots of money, this does not mean (yet) it is insignificant by definiton. But then there have to be other, objective signals to indicate significance. Even though I might subjectively agree with your opinion, I still fail to see what the objective indications might be in this case. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 13:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I'd disagree that Brithenig hasn't transcended the status of a private hobby. It did, after all, spawn a highly active community developing the world around it (Disclosure: I participate in <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>, and handle Ireland and a few other small sections). It's also notable amongst conlangs as one of the prototypical examples of the <i>altlang</i> genre. While there's few reasons I'd add an article on a conlang to the wiki, Brithenig and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdurian.html" title="Verdurian">Verdurian</a> are, because of their influence upon the art and their completeness, some of those I'd deem notable enough to keep. (And Wile E., don't post up the number of edits I've made. If anybody's interested, they can find them out for themselves. It's childish and demeaning to your fellow Wikipedians.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not an absolutist about keeping every possible piece of knowledge on Wikipedia, but in this instance it is not clear to me how to make an objective decision about which conlangs to include and which to exclude. I mean, just look at the following three things I discovered with the randomizing function: <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohtas_Fort_6a52.html" title="Rohtas Fort">Rohtas Fort</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Arms_3dd2.html" title="King of Arms">King of Arms</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellsville%2C_Ohio_6185.html" title="Wellsville, Ohio">Wellsville, Ohio</a> (population: 4,133). Should every fort in Pakistan, every member of the hierarchy of heralds, or every city in Ohio, no matter how small, have an entry? Well, maybe. The decision is ultimately about counts as important, and nobody can predetermine what will count as important before it actually becomes so. Brithenig is a small conlang, but one developed by a number of people, and has drawn some attention in the online conlanging community; it is equivalent to a town slightly more important than Wellsville, Ohio. But Wellsville has an entry. Why not Brithenig? Incidentally, I find the argument that conlangs are ipso facto unworthy of an entry, as <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> does, a little bizarre. Does <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Super Mario Brothers</a> deserve an entry?

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form and has already got a quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, even though at least one of them ìs "notable" per these <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">criteria</a>, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated. Elemtilas</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a> or <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>.

<ul>
<li>A point raised here though is what distinguishes the article on the Verdurian language from those other two, other than it concerns a conlang? Personally, given that the language is the most widely-reported feature of the Zompist.com website, this entry should take precedence over both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rosenfelder_4041.html" title="Mark Rosenfelder">Mark Rosenfelder</a> and <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zompist.com.html" title="Zompist.com">Zompist.com</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a>, calling in your pals from the zompist.com bboard <a href="http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=11032&amp;highlight=wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=11032&amp;highlight=wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> is less than cool. I'm sure they're great folks, but if they are hanging out there, they don't have an interest in Wikipedia and they do have an interest in promoting conlangs. I'm sorry, but Wikipedia is not your soapbox. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 19:58, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me? "Hanging Out" in one forum or another precludes an interest in Wikipedia? While I may only have been editing for a short time, I have certainly had a far longer acquaintance with and admiration for Wikipedia than the ZBB- whenever I want brief information on something I search Wikipedia first, not Google. And I would hardly refer to Circeus's stance as a "soapbox". <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a> 00:10, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what's the word for using Wikipedia as the vehicle for the promotion of some concept, if not "soapbox"&#160;?? Of course participating in one forum or another does not preclude participation in Wikipedia -- <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> apparently participates in both -- the point is that you only need advertise elsewhere to get someone's attention when you know you won't find them here. For example, <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarmaster_fa18.html" title="User:Warmaster">Warmaster</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurlyjimsam_032d.html" title="User:Curlyjimsam">Curlyjimsam</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 00:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As we're all registered users, I think it's not fair to say that you "wouldn't find us here". And what's wrong with letting us know about a VfD going on? Were, say, Star Trek up for deletion, I'm sure word would get around Star Trek forums fairly quickly. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewrad_5dc4.html" title="User:Dewrad">Dewrad</a> 00:53, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Since you seem to be so interested in the personal background of the people who vote here, I just noticed a few things: that the person who submitted this VfD has been pretty active gathering no-voters himself; and that your own favourite passtime seems to be reverting and deleting other people's work much rather than contributing anything substantial yourself.

<li>hi. perhaps the above is a little misleading. i notified two users. one user is a linguist whose name i had seen on the deletion pages often concerning conlangs - so i invited him to vote. he has not voted <i>delete</i> on all candidates. the other invitee was invited because i saw this user's name on the page history where this user had previously put a VfD but then recanted with the note "too much trouble". so invited the user to participate if he was interested now. i only invited her/him to vote for this one article. i am not trying to rally support for a certain outcome. i really leave that to all of you. thank you. – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 15:51, 2005 July 24 (UTC)

<li>Correction - i have made many edits to Wikipedia thank you very much, mostly about my city and different Anime pages, but it still stands. i personally think this article should stay, and saying that 'i was dragged from the board' is a blatant lie. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarmaster_fa18.html" title="User:Warmaster">Warmaster</a></li>

<dd>hi. i dont hate conlangs (or conslags - what is this?). i have no opinion except that i wish that more conlangers would be interested in learning more about endangered minority languages and make word lists of those (it would probably be beneficial). but, creating an artificial language is probably a nice, fun pastime for many people. i encourage people to enjoy life. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 19:55, 2005 July 23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ishwar: what does that have to do with anything? It's not as if conlanging is destroying minority languages! And for the record, I know many conlangers who are learning several different languages, not all of which are the major European ones. Most conlangers aren't mindless hobbyists, but educated people enjoying language and experimenting with it-- just like many poets and writers do. In any case, I think any activity that increases interest in language and languages is well worth it, and since conlanging is of growing interest to many, I believe that they should be included in the Wikipedia. Also, I happen to agree with the person above me-- if you are indifferent, why are you actively fighting for the deletion of so many conlangs? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrisheye_ac98.html" title="User:Irisheye">Irisheye</a> 17:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hi. it doesnt have anything to do anything. i was responding to user Renate3's speculation about my feelings involving conlangs. i see no need for speculation when i can just write it here. i didnt say that conlanging was destroying minority languages. their loss is part of a very large &amp; complex interaction between political dominant cultures and smaller local cultures. i did not mean to suggest that conlangers are learning or not learning any language of particular geographic region, or mindless and/or uneducated, or dissimilar from poets or writers. (i also dont think that uneducated people are mindless either.) and i dont think that hobbies are mindless. information about conlanging and specific conlangs is included in Wikipedia. the reason why i acted as i did is stated at the top of this page, namely the inclusion of inappropriate material in this encyclopedia. although i am indifferent to the creation of conlangs or their creators, i am not indifferent to the editorial decisions of Wikipedia authors. additionally, i disagree with your fight metaphor: i am not looking for a fight but rather an election which is what i understand this to be. i hope this addresses your concerns. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 18:29, 2005 August 1 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, Ishwar, but for someone who issues a whole series of VfDs in a row, I find your argumentation pretty weak! You were just "responding to someone's speculation about your feelings involving conlangs"? Now come on! If I ask you about your feelings regarding <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, are you going to do the same in that field too? The only legitimate reason for issuing a VfD (not just voting in it, but starting it, mind) is that you strongly feel an article múst be deleted, and you must have some pretty good reasons for that. As I can see in this case, you were just shooting at random. You mention something about <i>editorial decisions of Wikipedia authors</i>? Sorry, but I don't buy that! There are thousands of articles of far worse quality than the conlang articles in question. You must have had a reason for picking this field. Besides, you picked your conlangs pretty badly: there are conlang articles here that should have been deleted long ago (for example the article about Nalona, an insignificant conlang with no web presence at all: just one sentence and two broken links). Strange you didn't pick those. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 19:11, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>perhaps i was unclear. the response i was referring to above is my response to Renata3 @ 19:55. i was not referring to my deletion voting action &amp; comment @ 15:59. i guess my referent was not that clear.</dd>
<dd>i felt strongly enough &amp; i gave my reason as mentioned directly above &amp; at the top of the page. i was not shooting at random as i have stated on other vfd pages. my choice of conlangs was in a couple of lists of user Assdl (again this i have written on other pages). if the choice of conlangs is pretty bad, it is only because Assdl's lists did not contain the conlangs you would have liked for me to act on. the reason for picking this field is because Assdl added a list of numbers from his conlang into the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numbers_in_various_languages.html" title="Numbers in various languages">Numbers in various languages</a> article. a short exchange between me &amp; <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> led to my vfd actions. it is not so strange, i think: i just looked at what someone put before me.</dd>
<dd>i did mention editorial decisions of authors, yes. this was &amp; is my concern &amp; that is what i wrote. i dont know why you question/disbelieve, but if you do, i guess i simply have no response to that. i am not trying to sell anything, so, no, you need not buy.</dd>
<dd>yes, there are thousands of articles that entered Wikipedia without any kind of editorial policy used to determine their inclusion. again, my concern here is not of the quality of an article, but rather of its appropriate inclusion. i think that my contribution to this project will be more valuable in the coverage of languages &amp; linguistics (since not so many people seem to be interested in this) rather than in the form of regulating content. i get the impression that there are people who enjoy regulating content, voting for deletion, etc. in short, my time is better spent doing research and not decision making. this is the reason why i have not considered the coverage of Star Wars and other fields.</dd>
<dd>i didnt know my reasons for action would be so interesting to so many. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 23:28, 2005 August 1 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, you were indeed a little unclear, but that's clarified now. Nobody is attacking you personally, and nobody is accusing you of dishonesty. That's not the point. The reason some people are a little touchy about these things is that there are a lot of people who carry some personal grudge against conlanging and conlangers, God knows why (remember why Tolkien spoke about "the Secret Vice"), and a VfD like this one is enough to trigger them. If some of us overreacted a bit, it's because we are tired of those unfounded attacks. If you issue a VfD just because someone shows you a few links and you have a hunch that they might be unnotable, that's a little thin for a motivation, if you ask me. But I must give you this: you díd succeed in provoking a discussion, and without your VfDs the current discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConlangs_9d9c.html" title="Wikipedia:Conlangs">Wikipedia:Conlangs</a> about the criteria for objectively establishing the notability of a conlang probably wouldn't have taken place. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 08:13, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, yes it is. A comprehensively developed conlang with learning materials etc. online is more notable than one that is not (though a legitimate discussion can take place on where exactly the boundary can be set, the point to recognise is that this particular conlang is <i>more notable</i> than some others). <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In conlangs, yes it is. You can whip up a grammar and a few hundred words of vocabulary at the rate of about one language per day if you're talented, especially if you just transform Esperanto, Interlingua (like my own Idido and Faux Romantique, respectively), or some natlang; Verdurian is notable because, instead of these quickly whipped-up conlangs, it has a full <i>and naturalistic</i> grammer and vocabulary, which evolved from a previous mother language, which itself evolved from a 'proto-language', including sound changes over time and borrowings from distantly related languages. In conlang terms, this is the difference between a band like <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Garden_2fc8.html" title="Savage Garden">Savage Garden</a> and a band like ToxicMercury (although neither can touch the Britteny Spears of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>). <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 02:45, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> As I indicated on the article's talk page, I think there are arguments for both sides and I'm not too fussed either way. Unfortunately, however, Ishwar hasn't put out anything in the way of notability criteria as applies to conlangs (something that would be useful, imho). I respectfully disagree with Wile's assesment that this is a "personal project looking for advertising". As far as I'm aware, Rosenfelder himself hasn't had anything to do with the article.

<li>It's obvious: people like this simply go on autopilot with this kind of arguments once they encounter something they are ignorant about and therefore dislike. In another VfD I got angry about a similar unwarranted accusation at the address of Andrew Smith. By now I've understood that it's simply background music here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm a conlanger. Ishwar, what have conlangs done to you that justify you going on a vendetta against all articles about them? I don't see a good reason for not having someone go to all conlang VFDs and voting keep if you basically did the same thing with the same VFD reason for most conlang articles out there. I'll agree that not all conlangs need an article (mine most certainly doesn't), but Mark Rosenfelder is a big name on the online conlang scene, as is Almea and Verdurian, his most developed conlang. Also, I question whoever said that conlangs are "a goofy way to spend your life" about the "goofiness" of knowing so much about a videogame. <a href="../../../c/c/t/User%7ECctoide_7bfb.html" title="User:Cctoide">Cctoide</a> 15:56, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>hi Cctoide. i am not a conlanger, but i am a langer (&amp; also a linger). conlangs have not done anything harmful to me, i dont think. i do not have a vendetta against articles about every conlang, but i do question the inclusion of the articles that i have acted on. the main source of my actions here is results from a conlanger's question about the inclusion of certain conlangs. the articles that i have acted upon are those that appear in this conlanger's list. i additionally, voted on another conlang because i happened to see it in that day's viewing of the deletion pages. i have not acted on any other conlangs and i dont anticipate any further action (because i want to work on Wikipedia's documentation of American languages). i see a good reason for not acting as you suggest: i carefully considered each article and acted accordingly, i (gently) encourage us all to do the same. if my evaluation of the article is uninformed and in bad perspective, hopefully this will be remedied by wiser voters. i also wish that "goofy"-ness was not mentioned as this could perhaps be viewed as negative by some readers. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 00:09, 2005 July 27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Besides the official site, there seem to be several fan sites by people other than Mr. Rosenfelder, so it's clearly not a one-man/vanity project. It's fairly well-known and influential as a thoroughly-developed conlang. If it really has 50 speakers, it's certainly notable, and I would argue that, as a naturalistic artlang (not designed for easiness like an auxlang), it probably would be notable enough with considerably fewer fluent speakers than that. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Henry_39b3.html" title="User:Jim Henry">Jim Henry</a> | <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Henry_6fb9.html" title="User talk:Jim Henry">Talk</a> 03:47, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I conlang myself, and I generally feel that only clearly notable conlangs should be included on Wikipedia (the trouble, of course, is how one definres "clearly notable").

<dd>hi. i dont have any criteria and i dont see criteria proposed anywhere else. as i understand this, one person initiates a vote for an article and others simply vote delete or keep. because there is no criteria, i am asking the interested to think about such things. my question is: <i>What constraints are there for the inclusion of conlangs in an encyclopedia?</i>. a related question is: <i>Are all conlangs eligible in for inclusion?</i>.</dd>
<dd>so, my answer is a question. whatever answer there may be will a community-based answer. peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 01:25, 2005 July 24 (UTC)

<dd>With all due respect, but you use two arguments in your VfD. First that the article is about a conlang (as if that proves its irrelevance), and secondly, that you believe it is not notable. And now you don't seem to have any idea about what could make a language notable. Personally I'd only issue a VfD when I am véry seriously convinced that there is no place for a lemma in the wiki, not merely because I have some hunch. But anyway, I do not think all conlangs are eligible for inclusion, and yes, I've voted "delete" at multiple occasions. I believe IALs can be judged by their success (number of actual users, now or in the past), while artlangs by the acclaim or appreciation they receive. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 18:40, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, let me clear this up. <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a> says that it is "sufficient" to mark the edits of very new users accordingly, <i>rather</i> than to accuse them of sockpuppetry, so that allegation is not being made. It is a common practise in VfD and other places so to mark new user's votes/comments; it just makes the closing admin's life a bit easier. However, I personally would not usually mark someone with 50 edits; I reserve that for a handful of edits with a clear agenda. Just because your vote may have been marked does not mean it will be discounted. That is for the closing admin to judge. Generally speaking however, if a new (or fairly new) user comes along to a VfD and clearly pushes an agenda, their vote will be discounted. I'm not making any judgement of whether that is happening here, just clarifying usual procedure. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Jan, as I said above, personally I think your idea is interesting and intellectually intriguing for anyone interested in Indoeuropean languages and history, I really admire the effort you put into this, and the last thing I want is to offend you. However, if you are honest with yourself, you will have to agree that this is essentially a private hobby of yours and very few others, with no relevance to the "real world". I assume that the number of people who learned about Wenedyk from Wikipedia in the first place (like me) is infinitely higher than the number of people who have heard about it somewhere else and then turn to Wikipedia to learn more. In the end, this just isn't what an encyclopedia is about, paper or no paper. The language belongs to a fictional universe <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> - entertained, according to the article, by some 30 people. We have got our hands full with writing an encyclopedia on the <i>non-fictional</i> universe - we really should stick to that, rather than absorbing the minutiae of <i>fictional</i> ones. "Ill Bethisad" already has its own, very nice <a href="http://ib.frath.net/w/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://ib.frath.net/w/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia counterpart</a> - why not maintain this division of labour? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 00:55, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I must disagree móst strongly in part: conlanging is not so much a "private hobby" as it is an artistic form. While poets take existing words from an existing language (usally) to create something of artistic beauty and even if no one understands what they mean by it; conlangers simply take of the foundational material of Language itself to create something of artistic beauty. Even if no one understands what they mean by it. As for "relevance to the real world", I can easily name two dozen artists who wasted their time on things that were not at all "relevant to the real world". We can start with JS Bach, work our way through Michaelangelo and end up near Zamfir. Art ìs irrelevant to the "real world" -- you can't eat it, can't sleep under it, it won't keep you warm in Winter (usually) and won't alleviate your arthritis. That doesn't mean art is without its own merit. That said, while I will later vote for the article's deletion, it should be noted that Wenedyk has as much relation to the "real world" as any other work of art. Elemtilas</li>
<li><b>Answer</b> - Thanks for your kind words, Thorsten, I take no offense whatsoever from what you wrote. And I understand your point, too. Even better, I agree with you that <i>we</i> (wikipedians) should not be absorbing the minutiae of fictional worlds or of any other works of art. For that purpose I maintain a website, which contains all there is to know about Wenedyk. But we are not talking minutiae here, we are talking about an encyclopedic (or perhaps rather, wikipedic) entry. And this entry should nót contain a descriptive grammar of any kind, only something along the line of: <i>Wenedyk is a language constructed by ... for purpose of ... with ... as its distinguishing characteristics ... and its significance is ...</i>. The same goes for Ill Bethisad: the details are in the IB wiki (with currently more than 1,200 articles), a number of websites and a mailing list; while the wikipedia entry consists of nothing but a short encyclopedic description of what IB is. From this point of view, I think the articles in question are far more justified than biographies of individual <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> characters and the like. But if lemmata on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> are acceptable, I don't see why a lemma on <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> wouldn't be.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I'd like to note that I have learnt about a lot of things through Wikipedia, things I'd never have known about without it. That's what I like about Wikipedia in the first place. But FWIW: most reactions I got about Wenedyk were not from people who knew it through Wikipedia, but from people who had read an article about it in a Polish magazine.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, mainly to Jan and Splash. - <i>"it's about the human universe, including things like <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botchan.html" title="Botchan">Botchan</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>"</i>. Nobody disputed that the world of fiction has a place in Wikipedia. Fiction is a part of the human world. But that does not make <i>any</i> peace of fiction eligible for its own article. To use your examples, according to the article <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botchan.html" title="Botchan">Botchan</a> is <i>"one of the most popular novels in Japan"</i> which <i>"[m]ost Japanese read [...] during their childhood"</i>; and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> <i>"became one of the most popular and well-known comic book icons of all time.</i>". I do not think quite the same can be said about "Ill Bethisad".</dd>
<dd><i>"From this point of view, I think the articles in question are far more justified than biographies of individual <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> characters and the like."</i> I couldn't possibly agree more; but two wrongs don't make a right, and one can only deal with deletion candidates one at a time. Also, it would be very difficult to convince trekkies that they should learn to live without an article on the x-language spoken by the y-species in the z-galaxy - although its "existence" may have been brought to the attention of millions of square-eyed couch potatoes - when at the same time we decide to keep hobbyhorses like these.</dd>
<dd><i>"if lemmata on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a> are acceptable, I don't see why a lemma on <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>"</i>. Frankly, if I had the choice between watching an episode of Star Trek or Babylon 5, or reading a spin-off book, and reading a book about or watching an episode of <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> (in that universe's languages with subtitles...) I would almost <i>definitely</i> go for the latter. The fact remains, though, I simply do not have that choice. And since you mention it, the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> article is already borderline for me. The best case that can be made for is that it's one example of the intellectual standard an internet-based counter-culture to mainstream entertainment can achieve, so I'd vote a weak keep. If so, the article should naturally give due mention to Wenedyk and the other languages contained within the universe. But to outhouse its countries, their languages etc. - that is what I meant by "minutiae" - to separate articles is definitely over the top for me. By the way, in spite of what you said about the division of labour between Wikipedia and the IB Wiki, the fact is that <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a> contains way more (although not the same) information than <a href="http://ib.frath.net/w/Wenedyk" class="external text" title="http://ib.frath.net/w/Wenedyk" rel="nofollow">Wenedyk</a> does.</dd>
<dd>On a final note, it is hardly surprising that the idea of Wenedyk appeals more to Polish speakers with a knowledge of Romance languages (or vice versa) than to others; but this does not really disprove my point. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 11:12, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form and has already got a quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, even though at least one of them ìs "notable" per these <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">criteria</a>, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated. Elemtilas</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a> or <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Only 875 Google hits, and most of the top 50 are Wikipedia mirrors or pages within a handful of conlang-specialized sites (the Wenedyk official site, Langmaker, FrathWiki and the CONLANG-L archives). If someone can point out more evidence of influence on other conlangers, etc., I may consider changing my vote. (Maybe we should consider discussing and voting on a Wikipedia policy on criteria for inclusion of conlangs, rather than arguing about what constitutes notability every time...? Almafeta's <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">conlang notability criteria</a> might be a good starting point.

<li><b>Delete.</b> "God complex" is not a psychological term; it is a slang expression. Unlike (say) <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>, it is not a linguistically notable slang expression. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This article is likely to mislead readers into believing that "God complex" is a psychological term, or refers to some actual mental process that has been studied.

<p>These were kept during the last VfD, which is nothing more than an affront to the whole process. A month later, and these films stil get minimal google hits. IF these were ever shown on Brazilian television, then it would be the equivalent of public-access, since as far as I'm aware Brazil does in fact have internet access, so a film of any note would scrape more than a few google hits. The actor also gets just 18 google hits.</p>

<p>Due to "various accounts of spontaneous human combustion occurring in her vicinity" I might regret listing this article here, but I'll take my chances. An article about a witch-princess, who seems to have taken to using Wikipedia at the age of 203 (since the author has the same text on <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUndream_f306.html" title="User:Undream">her user page</a>). Notable for her proficiency at weaving offal into gold, and for working as a part-time celestial spy and full-time in abecedarian espionage.

<dd>Sorry, but this is the worst argument I've seen in these discussions. If the article might suggest the Fyksland and its language are really existing entities, that should obviously be fixed.

<dd>I'm crushed. But I was arguing less against this specific article there and more against alt.history=any fiction. In this context, it's probably out of line, and I should have let it slide. Either way, there's still notability and verifiability, both of which do pertain to this article, and seem to stack against it. 500 Google hits and a curiosity article do not an encyclopedic entry make. --<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 07:14, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Glad you admit to your error. Regarding verifiability: isn't even a single google hit sufficient, provided that it directs you to the right place? Regarding notability: it has long been established that this is too subjective to be useful as a criterion. To a person interested in the field (and unless I'm mistaken, WP is there for people interested in all kind of fields), this is definitely an interesting article. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 07:24, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, a single Google hit is not enough to verify anything. Low verifiability is a serious problem, as is low notability, and risks turning WP into both an indiscriminate and incorrect collection of personal web pages.--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 18:37, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Unless I am very mistaken about the meaning of the word "verifiable" in English (it's not my L1, not even my L2), it means that proof can be found that something actually exists. If one link directs you to a description, a grammar and a dictionary, that makes the language verifiable enough for me. Same goes for the Fyksian conculture. Notability, like I said elsewhere, is an entirely different can of worms. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 21:14, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Neologism, oxymoron, non-notable. Its only advocates are a few trolls who seem to spend most of their time trying to tick off the various anarchists on wikipedia. It was already nominated for deletion with a consensus to delete, but I don't know what happened there. Do not be fooled by the apparent fullness of the article - the "movement" is confined to a few individuals and websites and the existence of this page adds nothing but ammunition for the trolls. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 19:06, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Then, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a> of this year, a new version of the page was created. <i>If</i> that recreated page was more-or-less identical to the deleted one, then it should have been speedy-deleted at that time.

<p>I certainly don't see how anyone could consider "national anarchists" anarchists, and it makes about as much sense to file this under anarchism as it does to file national socialism under socialism. I tried to place this article under the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> template, but one of the national anarchists deleted the template.... I say, don't delete it, file it under fascism. Humanitarian</p>

<dd>Fascism isn't just a term to beat people over the head with, and not every group of racist jerks is fascist. The definition of fascism involves totalitarianism and a hand-in-glove relationship between the state and capital; the people who call themselves national anarchists don't seem to advocate either of those things. You're incorrect when you say that "one of the national anarchists deleted the template."

<p><b>Keep</b> This deletion attempt is a POV attempt to keep certain anarchist philosophies out of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. The so-called "traditional" anarchists have been trying to censor out anything that's not in keeping with their communist version of anarchism. They're now resorting to try to certify this movement as non-notable (when in fact it is notable), as a desperate attempt to keep national anarchism of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. Also, they have been claiming that since it's for racial seperatism it's not anarchism, which is faulty reasoning. Regardless, nowhere do I see national anarchists advocate "exterminating" the Jews, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> does, and nowhere do I see them calling Jews an "collective organic parasite" as <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> does, yet those individuals are presented as anarchists in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. This picking and choosing of who is or who isn't an "official" anarchist, and censoring or ostracizing them, is not only inconsistent with the NPOV policy of Wikipedia, it's downright Archist.

<p><b>Delete</b> Non-notable. RJ has been running around creating anarchism articles for any two words he can slap together, regardless of the presence or lack of evidence to found the movement. There is no evidence at all that this phenomena exists anywhere outside of the internet, and there are only 3 identifiable individuals associated with it, all of whom reject the claims of the others and call their own version the only one. This is just a series of webpages designed to make the white supremacists look like they have ideological links to movements which they clearly do not. It is also interesting to note that though Proudhon was in fact an anti-semite, RJ have been completely unable to dig up a single primary source indicating him as such, yet another indication of his tendency to create articles and fill them out based on heresay rather than actual facts. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 09:34, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that it's bizarre and racist, but I'm not convinced it's non-notable. A quick survey of Google hits shows the following for some of the varieties of anarchism listed in the anarchism template:
<dl>
<dd>Christian anarchism, 5700</dd>
<dd>green anarchism, 5100</dd>
<dd>anarcho-primitivism, 4100</dd>
<dd>national anarchism, 1900</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>IMO, all four of these are probably too inconsequential to be listed in the anarchism template, but I don't see any evidence that national anarchism is a complete fraud compared to the others. (And Christian anarchism strikes me as being every bit as much of a bizarre combo as national anarchism -- yeesh, Emma Goldman must be rolling over in her grave&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 04:26, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

It's not an oxymoron unless you buy into the anarchist ideology that racism and nationalism will automatically dry up and blow away once state coercion is gone; national identity is not the same as the nation-state. It's unfortunate, however, that <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> has been trying to inflate these articles' appearance of significance by adding spammish links from unrelated articles like <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, and has used redundant external links from the articles to do the same thing. Another issue is that people have been adding links to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anarchism.html" title="National anarchism">National anarchism</a> in templates such as Fascism, which is clearly inappropriate, both because the national anarchists don't seem to consider themselves fascists, and because they're not important enough to be included in the template. The "what links here" for national anarchism includes tons of articles which, AFAICT, no longer actually link to it, but may have in the recent past because of templates. (E.g., I just deleted national anarchism from the fascism template, but Nazism still shows up in national anachism's "what links here" page.)--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 15:42, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep the article, but delete much of its present content</b> The article <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson_e829.html" title="Peter Lamborn Wilson">Peter Lamborn Wilson</a> identifies Gabrielle D'Annunzio as a "proto-nationalist anarchist", linking here. Whether or not Hakim Bey's interpretations of D'Annunizio are accurate, D'Annunzio as presented by Bey is indeed a kind of "proto-nationalist anarchist", adopting an intermediate position between anarchism and Italian proto-fascism. However, in Bey's account (and I must say I believe in real life as well), his views are not primarily racist. What I mean is this. The real D'Annunzio, and/or the Wilsonian D'Annunzio, may or may not have been racists, but racism was not the focus of their philosophy. They were nationalists, yes, but they did not view nationalism in such a biological sense as more explicitly racist philosophies (Nazism, white supremacy) do. And indeed, this article from its very beginning identifies "nationalist anarchism" with 'white nationalism', i.e. white supremacy. I have never ever heard of anarchist white supremacists. But some of the work of Hakim Bey, explores (without adopting) some ideas of "nationalist anarchism", without being racist (although Bey at other places certaintly seems to endorse "racialism", i.e. blacks are superior; white people are all inferior; but any white person we like isn't really a "white" person, they're actually a celt or persian, which makes them a "black" person, and hence superior... go figure...) In any case, I think the article should be maintained, but its contents modified to remove (or at least de-emphasise) the white supremacy, but discuss Wilson's interpretations of D'Annunzio. -- SamuelKatinsky</p>

<li>From an essay called "The Fate of Black Anarchism": "We now call ourselves Anarchists. We say we want the end of all chains and the extermination of all oppression.

<li>No, because the color of the skin of the proponents of most other kinds of anarchism isn't an element of their philosophy --they just happen to be white.

The website linked to from this page is almost entirely blank, nearly every section is empty, and the only evidence describing "black anarchism" also refers to is as "panther anarchism" and a movement of the "anarchist people of color" interchangably. APOC is notable, more recognizable, and from what I can tell the statements made in each and every one of the pages brought up by RJ's google both refer directly to APOC and indicate that the two philosophies are identical in methods and goals. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 09:06, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I think the above article, which appears to have a narrower focus— that of a particular "movement"— should be incorporated into <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_anarchism.html" title="Black anarchism">Black anarchism</a>, which, it seems to me, is very likely the broader, related subject.

<li>It is far more exclusive than the term APOC, and it is far less refered to APOC or prominent than APOC. Many people of APOC do not refer to themselves as black anarchists, but as anarchist people of color. Black is one color, anarchist people of color denotes many colors. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 01:43, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I realized after I clicked "submit" that "people of color" means something broader than is my common frame of reference as an African American. However, your argument still doesn't hold water. APOC is a specific movement; whereas, this article addresses anarchism as a philosophy among black people, generally, regardless of their involvement, if any, in a particular movement. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 09:17, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>. If the term is in use by some people (let's say more than 1000 people - you wouldn't remove an article on a village just because it's too small, right?) then it deserves an article or at least a redirect. Which of those two depends largely on how much information is in the article which is separate from the article it is to be merged with. And that seems enough (although I haven't really studied it), so ultimately I'd say <i>keep</i>. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 10:22, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

And that it shouldn't be listed on the template? The problem is that RJII does anything he can to defame other users, so he'll add these marginal movements to the template and then call us racists or fascists when we remove them for being not quite notable enough for template attention. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 19:11, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never called you a racist. I am saying that the attempt to delete this is racially motivated. It appears to me that you think that since blacks are a minority that they shouldn't be represented ..they're not notable ..which is B.S. Just because black anarchism less google hits than a philosophy proposed by a majority race means nothing. By, the way, you were the first to bring the dispute between you and me to a personal level in another article. Reap what you sow, buddy.

<li><b>Merge</b> The information is relevent, but would better be placed in articles like APOC (as Kev has already mentioned) or in articles about the various people refered to in the article. I think the fact that the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_Black_Cross_fdb3.html" title="Anarchist Black Cross">Anarchist Black Cross</a> was listed as a black anarchist group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_anarchism&amp;diff=19526961&amp;oldid=19526691" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_anarchism&amp;diff=19526961&amp;oldid=19526691" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> shows how little some of the editors around here really care about getting factual information correct in their POV pushing. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 22:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well that may be true, but that's not what I said. I said merge the relevent info into the relevent articles. The APOC is not just black anarchists as you seem to contend. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 22:07, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm not affiliated with the group (I doubt you are either), so I can't say who their most active or most outspoken members are, but a cursory look at their websites show just as many latino and hispanic contributers as black (<a href="http://www.illegalvoices.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.illegalvoices.org/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>,<a href="http://www.sfbayapoc.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfbayapoc.org/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>,<a href="http://sfbayapoc.org/docs/Zine1.scrn.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://sfbayapoc.org/docs/Zine1.scrn.pdf" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>). And from what I can tell, their membership is open to all people of color; the only exclusion is white people. All evidence I see is that the term "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_anarchism.html" title="Black anarchism">black anarchism</a>" is associated with the people listed on that wikipedia page. Since they are the ones using the term, it makes more sense that the respective articles on those anarchists can contain all relevent info. I don't think any good info. should be deleted; I just think there's a better place for it. Maybe if you give some evidence for its wider usage, rather than just ranting, I would be willing to change my mind. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 04:01, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>keep</b> - The author makes strong points on the discussion page. The accomplishments of this group are many and the members of the group were, and are, active in major performance organizations. The group commissioned works from many innovative composers. Since I was an undergrauate music student I have seen their name on the scores of works which they commissioned. I don't understand how this entry could possibly be deleted. The group is important, their innovations paved the way for others (both performers and composers), and they worked closely with many great composers of the 20th century. Keep this article!</p>

<p>According to "What Wikipedia is not," Wikipedia is not "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons," unless the entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to a topic. This list is just an indiscriminate listing of gay porn actors. The vast majority of them did very few films and do not meet this criteria, and better and more relevant lists are found elsewhere. Many of these stage names are not associated with gay porn and wouldn't be readily recognized, and most did not contribute anything significant to the industry. They do not meet the standard for fame set by Wikipedia, and most industry experts would agree.</p>
<p>Lastly, much of the information in the listing is incorrect and incomplete, specifically that information regarding the actors' real names. Having reported on that industry, I can tell you that many of the "real names" listed have no factual link to the actor and the information is obviously not verified. I will submit this article for verifyability, but considering that there are people in the world who coincidentally possess these incorrect real names, I thought I should mention it here as well. This article should be deleted, and if not, the information verified. 24.11.99.60 20:29, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I looked at the history for this article. It looks as if it was started by just grabbing names off the internet. Some of the information apparently is only verified through Google. I started editing for non-notable names but there are just so many. There aren't nearly as many porn stars who had a real impact on the industry or are associated with it as are listed here. For comparison, Jenna Jameson would obviously have a place on a straight porn star list, but Random Porn Actress #5 does not. Many of these people are just random gay porn actors in that same vein. And again, from what I understand, Wikipedia isn't supposed to be lists of random people, but those who are notable. I think the article should be deleted. It's just a random list and it isn't a legitimate list of any thing but names. Poiboi25 22:10, 23 July 2005 (UTC) Poiboi25</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Alternatively, <b>Delete And Replace With Category</b> and let the category be named something that appropriately conveys the information "Gay Porn Star". Thus there's still a way people who want it can get a list of gay porn stars, but it's limited to ones important enough to get articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both ideas sound fair to me. Whether its blanking or deleting, I don't think the current list can be saved, though. Someone would have to cut it down, and there are just so many names thrown on. It would probably be easier to start over with new guidelines. I think its important that whatever replaces it stresses notability. I like the guideline that Wikipedia sets up: the name is strongly associated with the field itself, or the person contributed significantly to the field. With that guideline, it keeps the information relevant, I believe. Poiboi25 09:28, 24 July 2005 (UTC) PoiBoi25</p>

<p>Why is this not a section in 'List of porn stars'. I don't see a good reason that gay porn stars should be sequestered into their own separate place.

<p>In six Harry Potter books, Celestina Warbeck, "the singing sorceress" has only been mentioned in passing, so as to flesh out the wizarding world a bit more by giving it its own entertainers. Beyond her profession, nothing else is known about this bit character, and I doubt there will ever be. Just a mention in a list of characters is more than enough. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinistro_1894.html" title="User:Sinistro">Sinistro</a> 20:50, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BEFORE we dash out there and delete this page we should resolve the issue that got it placed here in the first place; otherwise, we are going to create bad feelings here. Admittedly, listing every member of the crew of the enterprise may be a little outlandish, but listing members who serve aboard in the form of companies or battlions or something of that nature could have encyclopedic value. Additionally, if he wishes to list them by department that should be permisable, after all we do allow lists of military units and there members. By allowing military pages to list members but not navy pages aren't we setting a double standard?<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 23:27, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have nearly 500 former members of the Reactor and Engineering Dept who are interested in the already existing <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Enterprise_%28CVN-65%29_23c2.html" title="USS Enterprise (CVN-65)">USS Enterprise (CVN-65)</a> Wikipedia page. All we are interested in doing is <i>adding</i> some more information ... ie ... those of us *people* who actually made it possible for this ship to operate. I have people from the 60's up to the present who have served in this capacity and who have a great deal of information to share, including many pictures and first-hand accounts of the fire in 1969 that took the lives of many of our shipmates.<br />
All we are attempting to do here is put a human face on this. I thought how wonderful if we could do this as an example of what could be done with all of the other ships you currently have featured in the pages of Wikipedia. We only wish to compliment all of the information you already have.<br />
Ex-servicemen are always interested in locating one another ... and what better place to do so than here on these wonderful pages that have already been established here on Wikipedia?<br /></p>
<p>Sorry lads ... but these ships wouldn't have done a thing without the crews who manned them.<br />
I just think you are missing out on an opportunity to actually tap into information that only we who actually worked and sailed abord these vessels have to offer.<br />
But if we aren't welcome here ... that's fine.<br />
We will do it elsewhere.<br />

<dd>Well Tom ... I don't think i have much to say about it.<br /></dd>
<dd>If it's a question of how to link the pages ... or of catagories ... fine ... that is why I wrote to you asking for some assistance in doing it the <i><b>Wikipedia Way</b></i>.&#160;;)<br /></dd>
<dd>All I want to do is use the existing <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Enterprise_%28CVN-65%29_23c2.html" title="USS Enterprise (CVN-65)">USS Enterprise (CVN-65)</a> page to link to The Crew. And then into subcatagories such as the Rx and Engineering Dept ... where I hope to convince nearly 500 former Reactor and steam plant operators to get interested in how Wiki's work so they can contribute!<br /></dd>
<dd>I was hoping to come up with a Template of sorts ... that other crews could use with many of the other ships here. I'd like to put a bit of a human face on the pages ... rather than just facts and figures, dates and stats.<br /></dd>
<dd>Ah well ... I'm afraid I have wasted a lot of time today ... and had only begun to list the people I know who are already in touch with me. It's been quite something to have found many shipmates from more then 30 years ago ... and it was the Enterprise that brought us back together.<br /></dd>
<dd>But I guess that unless one was actually part of such a crew ... it doens't hold much importance.<br /></dd>
<dd>So it goes.<br /></dd>
<dd>I've notified many of them of the *welcome* we have received here ...<br /></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: discussion on the vfd for List of Airports in Canada clearly shows that people want to maintain the lists manually, and it doesn't make sense to have national lists without an international list, so I withdraw my nomination for deletion. I would like to include a pointer to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirports_2dde.html" title="Category:Airports">Category:Airports</a> at the top of the page (i.e. not as a see-also at the bottom). <a href="../../../d/p/m/User%7EDpm64_5105.html" title="User:Dpm64">David</a> 16:42, 2005 Jun 13 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Though I initially wanted to keep the page at first glance, I do have to admit the Category does a better job of handling things. While I also understand that "commercial airport" is a euphemism for "industrial and/or commercial use (only) airport", I do agree with David that the term is misleading. Don't know about the infobox, but admittedly, this page has served its purpose and is ready for retirement.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 14:18, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note: normally, in a situation like this we'd want to redirect rather than delete; unfortunately, redirecting from a regular page to a category does not seem to work properly. Another solution might be to blank the page and then include some text pointing the user to the category. <a href="../../../d/p/m/User%7EDpm64_5105.html" title="User:Dpm64">David</a> 13:29, 2005 Jun 11 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are very few "commercial use <i>only</i>" airports. Even the busiest airports usually allow general aviation operations (although often requiring heavy fees). Indeed the only airports that usually <i>don't</i> allow G.A. operations are, AFAIK, military fields. The commercial/noncommercial distinction is definitely flawed and should be removed even if this page stays. The closest you could get is "airports with air carrier operations" vs. not, but even that can be a gray area, and besides, it changes all the time. Danorris 30 June 2005 14:58 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, just because I believe "List of Airports" does better job than the Categories. Categories normally provides references for various things related to a certain thing, however in this case airports in the world are all airports; theoretically "Lists" should exist rather than "Categories" handling this type of the lists. --Buckstars 07:02, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree as far as short, thematic lists go, but in this case we're talking about creating manual lists containing tens or hundreds of thousands of entries, and then trying to keep them current. <a href="../../../d/p/m/User%7EDpm64_5105.html" title="User:Dpm64">David</a> 16:40, 2005 Jun 13 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with the part about "trying to keep them current". Once an airport is on the list with its IATA code, then nothing more ever needs to be done to the list as far as that airport is concerned. You add an aiport, and that's it. It's not like it includes any information on an airport which could change. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tompw</a> 17:36, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: As I said, I used the term very, very loosely... Perhaps even incorrectly. She doesn't even qualify as a one hit wonder, as far as I can discern.

Also, just because she is "bound to make a comeback once she starts to fall on hard times" (which is an assumption of the grandest kind, given that pornography <i>isn't</i> the only career choice out there) doesn't mean she <i>will</i>. Plus "all young porn starlets" is a very generic term; there are so many of them that they a great majority of them are severely unnotable. When she does something striking and notable, <i>then</i> Wikipedia should have an entry on her.

<li>This is a common claim made on VfD: that, because Wikipedia has an article or articles of a certain type, it must have other articles of that type. Generally, the question of whether an article merits inclusion is answered based on community-determined <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policy</a>. When that policy is unclear or non-existant in regards to the article being questioned, it is up to the community to determine the appropriate action. When several similar articles are handled in the same way, it sets a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">precedent</a>, which effectively becomes a new policy. From what I can see, there is no policy or precedent concerning what makes a porn actor notable. This means that the articles you mentioned exist only because no one has questioned their right to exist. Only when one of those articles is sent to VfD and survives will your argument have any weight. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley"></a>-- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley">Scott</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott_Burley_3755.html" title="User talk:Scott Burley"><font color="black"><small><i>e<sup>iπ</sup></i></small></font></a> 08:41, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no such thing as the "Ginsburg standard". Ruth Bader Ginsburg, during the hearings regarding her nomination as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, refused to answer questions regarding her personal philosphy except as it related to matters on which she had been an advocate in the past. (In that vein, she was no less forthwright (perhaps more) than Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings, when he claimed never to have had an opinion on <i>Roe v Wade' or to have discussed the case with anyone (so far as I can recall)'.)</i></p>
<p>I assume this entry is being added because of the nomination of John G. Roberts to the Supreme Court. It is part of an advance effort to legitimize any lack of responsivenss by Roberts during his nomination hearings. That is clearly evidenced by the fact that the contributer who added this entry and who added similar text to Justice Ginsburg's own entry provided no detail of the nature of her refusals, just making the blanket assertion that she "refuse[d] to answer questions posed to her by Senators" and that it the phrase "still used by some today." However, until just now there has never been such a thing as the "Ginsburg standard," and its inclusion here (and its recent adoption by a conservative pundit or two) is clearly a partisan effort that violates Wikipedia's NPOV rules. Moreover, a Google search (not definitive, but instructive) finds only five references to "Ginsburg standard," all from the last week or two. Because this entry is inaccurate and biased, I vote that it be <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff.green_338d.html" title="User:Geoff.green">Geoff.green</a> 22:15, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ask Sen. Schumer To Apply The Same Standard To Supreme Court Nominee Roberts As Was Applied To Justice Ginsburg Dear Steven,</p>
<p>Sen. Charles Schumer of New York has gone on record as saying he would question John Roberts, President Bush’s nominee to the Supreme Court, about his views on abortion and a host of other issues.</p>
<p>When asked questions concerning abortion in her Senate confirmation hearings, now Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (then the nominee of President Clinton) responded by saying that the abortion issue could possibly come before her. Therefore, she said, it would be inappropriate for her to give an opinion on the question of abortion. (Incidentally, she had previously served as general counsel for the ACLU.)</p>
<p>Her refusal to answer questions concerning abortion has become known as the "Ginsburg Standard."</p>
<p>Ask Sen. Schumer to apply the same standard to nominee Roberts as was applied to nominee Ginsburg. It is the only fair thing to do.</p>
<p>Click Here To Send Your Email To Senator Schumer Now!</p>
<p><br /></p>

<li>Fuck Donald Wildmon. This is all false anyway, because Ginsburg <i>did</i> represent her views on abortion during her confirmation hearings: "[The right to an abortion] is something central to a woman's life, to her dignity. It's a decision that she must make for herself. And when government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices." That sounds pretty clear. If anything, it should be the Clarence "I've never thought about abortion" Thomas standard.

<li><b>Comment</b> I really don't like advertising in Wikipedia. This article is an advertisement written by the company, unless the user's name and the articles name being the same is a coincidence (vanity?). The entirety of the article, with the exception of first sentence of the first and third paragraphs is "ad-langugae". The million hits on google are from other similar adverts (in various languages).

<p>Not really. In Malta, Ing Montebello is somewhat of a personality so the page is value adding</p>
<p>This is untrue. The article is nothing but an adversitement appart from being listed twice under Louis montebello. - <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a>] 21:16, 16 June 2005 (GTM +2)</p>
