<p>Samuel Joeseph Fath was born November 18, 1987. He was born in the wild and was going to be raised by wolves, but when they attempted to feed him he executed the wolf pups and fed on their corpses. The bitches and alpha male were so impressed they bowed before him and begged for mercy. He showed none. Since this time, Samuel unleashed holy hell wherever he went. He was adopted into a household where he slept only an hour a week and the rest of the time was so on edge that the weakest amongst the population tended to explode by mere proximity to his intensity. Others either fell into coma due to shock of these seemingly spontaneous explosions, while others still just sort of learned to tune the violence out. The community was purged of stupidity and actually prospered due to this seemingly unrelenting death. Sam was sent to Vermont where the majority of his peers had some level of coherence. Here, he could not cause as much damage as he did in Alabama where the sheer level of ineptitude was almost sickening. Vermont's highschools refused to challenge Sam enough so he relied on complex mental training while out in the rigors of the Vermont wild. The constant fluxuating weather, dangerous animals, rugged terrain, and simultaneous tranquility brought the all consuming chaos of Samuel together. The wilderness almost reflected the creation of the universe in all its calamity and chaos. Therein, Sam found, that he was almost like a universe. His mind stretched beyond that of normal and he realized things that we cannot comprehend. He almost exploded and created a universe (much like how ours was actually made), but in his sheer power of Will, Sam managed to contain the explosion in hiself and grew a beard. This was truly manly. Truly. Manliness was reborn in Sam. However, like before, its sheer intensity managed to leak out into other people. Like a paladin, his mere presence emboldened people and made men manly. But it leaked out over time. His friends, such as Jay Towne, became truly powerful, while Sam became a bit of a puss. Blowing his money on expensive trips on a girl that would probably never really work out in the end like all college relationships. The amount of money/time equation works out as such:</p>
<p>lim ((Money+time)-(time wasted))/Life life -&gt; 0</p>
<p>Bottom line being... Samuel was selling his existance. He was abandoning parties early, leaving his friends and working all the time to pay off for trips that were wrecking his college life. College, being a source for future employment was thusly taking a backseat in his life. He lost his humor and was no longer as awesome. It was a tragic story. He was a bright star that shone brighter than most but ended quickly. He was buried at the woods where we would like to believe he was at the epitome of all that was Sam and Man. On the very spot furthest from Japan and the woman that destroyed him.</p>

<p>Renal sex is literally the act of having sex with your partner or partners' kidneys. It has little acceptance outside of alternative subcultures.</p>
<p>The consensus of the medical community is that renal sex can cause kidney stones, diminished renal activity or in extreme cases renal failure.</p>

<p>While many learned professors have abandoned hope of ever discovering the truth behind honsbrix, I for one feel that it is still a worthy cause for examination. I really, really like honsbrix. While it has been acknowledged that it has an important part to play in the development of man, honsbrix is featuring more and more in the ideals of the young and upwardly mobile. Inevitably honsbrix is often misunderstood by the over 50, who are likely to form a major stronghold in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. Keeping all of this in mind, in this essay I will examine the major issues.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is a human product. Upon Peter Pinkleton-PishPosh's return to Britain he remarked 'class will refelect the inner hero' [1], he borrowed much from honsbrix. Spanning divides such as class, race and uglyness, honsbrix demonstrates a coherent approach, something so lacking in our culture, that it is not recognised by all.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken when analysing such a delicate subject. On the other hand anyone that disagrees with me is an idiot. It has been said that the one thing in society which could survive a nuclear attack is honsbrix. This is incorrect, actually cockroaches are the only thing which can survive a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Increasingly economic growth and innovation are being attributed to honsbrix. We will primarily be focusing on the Inter-Spam model of economics. Annual Military Budget</p>
<p>honsbrix</p>
<p>When displayed this way it becomes very clear that honsbrix is of great importance. In spite of the best efforts of The World Bank the annual military budget looms over honsbrix this cannot be a coincidence. In the light of this free trade must be examined.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics has in some areas been seen to embrace an increasing ananiathesis of intergovernmentalism leading to neo-functionalism. Comparing the general view of politics held by the poor of the west with those of the east can be like comparing the two sides of honsbrix.</p>
<p>In the words of award winning journalist Noah Rock 'political change changes politics, but where does it go?' [2] Amazingly, he new nothing of honsbrix until he was well into his thirties. To paraphrase, the quote is saying 'honsbrix wins votes.' Simple as that. Where do we go from here? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, honsbrix is both a need and a want. It enlightens our daily lives, provides financial security, though honsbrix brings with it obvious difficulties, it is truly honsbrix.</p>
<p>As a parting shot here are the words of super-star Beyonce Zeta-Jones 'I love honsbrix? Yes! Hurray for honsbrix!' [3]</p>

<p>The Demimondes, essentially a collaboration between noted English poet Michael Lahiffe (who's publications include Iota magazine, Ambit and the BBC) and artist John Townsend (graphic design for little white lies magazine), along with bass player Darren Gillick, formed in late 2005 with the intention of creating a series of film soundtracks, influenced by French chanson, folk, surf instrumentals and English pop music. The initial release in June 2006 of a four song EP 'John's Pets' was followed by a fourteen-track recording two months later, with the title track recieving airplay on Virgin Radio, as well as increasing underground popularity in America. The band remain committed to recording and releasing music on the internet rather than gigging, and are currently in talks with independant record labels about future releases, while the Demimondes continue to operate as a broad creative musical, literary and artistic outlet for both Townsend and Lahiffe.</p>

<p>Amiene Rev known in Malaysia and Indonesia as the first person who found the idea of becoming blog reviewer. Through this idea, Amiene Rev spread the words about the important of using national language in Malaysian blog. This action has created a new phenomenon where people start to change, start to look back at their blog. Amiene Rev motivated Malaysians to appreciate their mother tongue language - Malay Language for blogging. Since there are many blogger use wrong phrase and spells for Malay language in the blog, Amiene Rev start to critize and teach them about it.</p>
<p>Most people like this idea, since Amiene Rev review, critized and rated their personal blog, give suggestion on how blogger can improve their blog contents.

<p><b>THE BRAIN BEHIND THE ORGANIZATION</b></p>
<p>Miss Adenike Akinsemolu, a young, bright student and a prize-winning, budding playwright, has just started a non-profit organization called The Black Intellects International. The web site for the organization, BlackIntellect.net, draws on African tradition and mythology, while employing current Western idiom. Born in Akure, Ondo State, to Yoruba parents, Adenike is fluent in Yoruba (Ondo dialect) and English, and has a smattering of French. She went to school in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, where she is currently pursuing a course of studies in Biochemistry/pre-Medicine at Kutztown University of PA. Adenike hopes to establish a hospital in Nigeria when she finishes Medical school. She believes that what is important about a person is the character, not the outward appearance. She would describe herself, and those who know her say she is, diligent.</p>
<p><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b></p>
<p>The Black Intellects International has as its goals: • To restore confidence, hope, and unity among all the Black people of the world; • To encourage the investment in the motherland; • To make scholarships and grants available to deserving Black students; • To relentlessly fight racism, corruption, and terrorism; • To educate our people on the dangers of the AIDS scourge; • To empower in myriad ways the helpless and hopeless; • To hunt for talents and nurture them.</p>

<p>The story of Moahni Moahna</p>
<p><br />
The band was formed 1992 by Henrik Flyman and Tommy Rehn as the two only permanent members. It all began when they decided to record three newly composed songs as a test to hear how they would sound with a proper performance. The other musicians asked to join Henrik and Tommy in the studio were Martin (vocals), Magnus Byström (drums), Marcus Winberg (bass). In addition to the rock orchestra, there were also a classical orchestra and a choir brought in to spice things up. The session turned out very well and a decision was made to finance a mini CD. And to go with that, a video was shot for the song "The Quest For the Unholy Sword". The CD and the video were sent out to lots of influential people. It resulted in surprisingly many good reviews in magazines and the daily press. The video was aired on MTV Headbangers Ball and the CD was played several times at Swedish national and local radio shows. All this probably helped a lot in making the decision to transform Moahni Moahna into something more of a real band.</p>
<p>A keyboard player was added in form of Kai Backlund. Henrik and Tommy had already several new songs ready and the rehearsals began. Within soon the band was out performing gigs at clubs and festivals. Now the time had come to record a full length album and to go for a record deal. Johan Bobäck was brought in to take over the keys together with Fredrik Sahlander as the new bass player. The new line up started with doing a small Sweden tour to try the new songs on stage in front of an audience. The last gig of the tour was held at the rock club Pipeline in Sundsvall, where national radio P3 met up with their mobile studio bus and recorded the complete show. The full concert was aired twice.</p>
<p>Moahni Moahna entered the studio and started recording their first full length album. The songs would be new versions of the three songs from the mini CD ("Face the Light") and five new compositions. On top of the touring band, several extra instruments were added to give the songs that extra authentic feel. Just like they had done on the mini CD. The idea was to use accoustic instruments instead of simulating them with keyboards. Keyboards were only used to reproduce syntheziser sounds. Other key instruments were hammond organ and grand piano. The additional instruments used would include accordion, flute, military marching drums, harmonica, a horn section, a string section, a choir and a full chamber orchestra. When the recordings were finished, it wasn´t long before a record deal was signed with a Swedish label. It meant that the album would be released in Asia and Sweden. The year is now 1994.</p>
<p>The first gig after the completion of the debut album "Temple of Life" was held at a sold out Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm. The line up had once again been modified. Keyboards were now handeled by Richard Andersson and drums by Jaime Salazar. On stage were also Fredrik Burstedt on violin and Åsa Arvidsson playing the accordion. The gig was a total success and it wasn´t long before lots of great album reviews were piling up. The band did some more gigs with this line up. The next modification came when they welcomed new drummer Björn Hagberg. This line up performed about some handful concerts. Then Henrik and Tommy started writing for the second album.</p>
<p>At this stage the band realized that the record label was run by criminals and all royalties were gone. This left the band in a very difficult situation. The only chance to record album number two was to lend equipment from friends and build a temporary studio in an empty house accessible through Henrik. It was located in the northern parts of Sweden, where the winter was extra cold this early 1996. Even though the studio gear weren´t built to fit together, the studio room was a partly furnished living room and the water pipings were frozen, the recording sessions were highly creative and everything went smooth in its own strange way. Soon the album "Why" was ready. Moahni Moahna got a new record deal with a German label. They released the new album and re-released the first album, since it still wasn´t released in the whole of Europe. In Asia a separat deal was made with another company. The band did some more festivals and one gig as support for Deep Purple. Now it comes clear that the German label has stolen the royalties from Moahni Moahna. Bit by bit joy fades away and band activity decreases. Nothing is ever officially said about ending the band.</p>

<p>Oflag XVII-A was a prisoner of war camp for officers (oflag) situated in Austria near Doellersheim.</p>
<p>The camp was located at Edelbach, between Allensteig and Doellersheim.</p>
<p>Oflag XVII-A functioned between 1940 and April of 1945, the date of its liberation by Soviet troops. It primarily held french officers. Approximately 6000 were held there during its functioning.</p>
<p>The prison guards were often Austrian veterans and the detention conditions were, for the most part, less draconian than other camps.</p>
<p>These lax conditions partially explain several notable characteristics of the camp:</p>
<p>It holds the record for largest successful group escape: 130 persons. -A documentary film was shot there during the 1950's -"Sous le manteau" (Beneath the Cloak) was later copied onto 24 image/sec 16 mm film -Twenty former inmates were involved in the project; they aided as producers, camera crew, technicians and, of course, actors -Several hundred photos were taken during the course of the filming. They constitute a unique insiders view of the living conditions the inmates endured.</p>
<p>(photo title) Of these photos, the most ironic may be this sign, which reads "photographs prohibited"</p>

The Whitehall Theatre in London's Whitehall, opened on on the 29th of September 1930 with a play called 'The Way To Treat A Woman' by Walter Hackett. The Theatre was designed by Edward A. Stone with an Art Deco interior by Marc-Henri and Laverdet. The Whitehall Theatre is well known for being the home, in the 50s and 60s, of Brian Rix's 'Whitehall Farces'.</p>
<p>The Theatre was converted in 2003 into two Studio Spaces, and renamed the Trafalgar Studios which opened with the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of 'Othello' on the 3rd of June 2004.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) is a staple food in the dry areas of Nigeria and parts of West Africa and Asia. It possesses desirable agronomic attributes that are associated with its total grain yield. Determination of the gene actions controlling these agronomic yields attributes the level of heterosis and the associations among the parental lines and the crosses would be useful in developing appropriate selection strategies. A nursery experiment was conducted during the dry season of 2003 to March, 2004 at the Lake Chad Research Institute Maiduguri, Nigeria under irrigation with 10 (ten) pearl millet inbred lines to form an F1 population, by crossing in all possible combinations excluding reciprocals through diallel (Griffing’s Method 2 Model 1). The 45 crosses and the 10 parental lines were evaluated during the cropping seasons of 2004 and 2005 at two locations, Maiduguri and Yola, Nigeria in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there were significant differences among the entries for most of the traits evaluated. Both additive and non-additive genetic effects were involved in the control of the characters, but non-additive genetic effect was the most important in that regard. This study identified ACC-1022-1-2SPT and SOSAT- C88 as the best parents in total grain yield considering there per se performance. The parents, BONKOK-SHORT, DMR 43, DMR22 and LCIC9702 were identified as the best general combiners in terms of GCA effects. The crosses DMR22 x LCIC9702, DMR43 x LCIC9702, DMR22 x LCIC9703-27, D2P29 x EX-BORNO were observed to have recorded the highest SCA effects. Similarly, the crosses D2P29 x DMR43, DMR22 x LCIC9702, DMR43 x LCIC9702, BONKOK- SHORT x SOSAT-C88 and D2P29 x EX-BORNO were the highest in terms of per se performance. It has been observed however, that some crosses with high SCA effects were also high in per se performance. A fair general parallelism existed in most cases between GCA effects and the performance of the parental lines per se. Similar parallelism also existed between SCA effects and per se performance of crosses and between SCA effects of crosses and levels of higher parent heterosis. Considerable higher parent heterosis was exhibited among the crosses in almost all the characters. Higher parent heterosis of 85.13 % and 114.05 % for yield per plant and total grain yield per hectare respectively, were obtained in this study. There is great potential therefore for the production of hybrid pearl millet varieties. The preponderance of non-additive genetic effect, and the tremendous levels of higher parent heterosis observed among the characters in the parents and the crosses studied would be great assets in choosing pearl millet cultivars for inter crossing and development of varieties and hybrids for commercial production. Key words: Per se performance, additive genetic effect, non additive genetic effect, and high parent heterosis</p>

<p><br />
INTRODUCTION Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) is a staple food crop in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and Asia (Khairwal et al. 1999) Beside as the principal food cereal in arid and semi-arid regions and as forage in Australia, South Africa, South America and the USA, pearl millet has a potential as an early-maturing summer grain crop in temperate regions (Anand Kumar and Andrews, 1993, Yoshida and Sumida, 1996). Pearl millet has high yield potential and responds well to water and soil fertility (Poehlman, 1994). However, several pearl millet varieties exist in West Africa, but they have low grain yields when grown under harsh conditions characterized by poor, eroded soils and low uneven rainfall (Ouendeba et al. 1993). Since the pearl millet varieties grown in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and Asia have insignificant yield gains, information on the combining abilities and heterosis of diverse breeding population are needed for efficient choice of breeding methods and parental materials to use in developing productive base population. The knowledge on the relative magnitude of genetic variability of the desired agronomic characters within the population is also important. At present information on genetic variability in pearl millet are available (Izge et al. 2005), but information on the combining abilities and heterotic patterns among the pearl millet cultivars that are grown in the Sahel and the Sudan savanna agricultural zones of Nigeria are limited. This information if available would be helpful in the development of a successful breeding program, because mass selection within the pearl millet populations have not increased grain yield significantly. Jauhar, (1981) reported that most breeding procedures in the USA and India in pearl millet are aimed at maximum exploitation of hybrid vigor for both grain and forage yields. Nwasike et al. (1992) and Ouendeba et al. (1993) working independently each on five different cultivars reported significant level of heterosis in pearl millet. Gardener and Eberhart, (1966) and Barker (1978), however, expressed reservation on such results and reported that any diallel involving less than ten parental lines may not give accurate results. The objectives of this study therefore were to determine the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) variances that will indicate the type of gene action controlling the various agronomic yield traits. The study was also aimed at estimating the GCA effect of parents and the SCA effects of crosses and to identify the level of heterosis among the crosses in all the traits evaluated.</p>
<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten (10) pearl millet inbred lines chosen based on their geographical and genetic diversity were randomly selected and crossed in all possible combinations (diallel) without reciprocals during the dry season of 2003 to March 2004 under irrigation applied to soil field capacity every two three days till maturity, at the Lake Chad Research Institute (LCRI), Maiduguri, Nigeria. The genetic materials were procured from LCRI, Maiduguri and ICRISAT India viz, ACC-1022-1-2SPT, BONKOK-SHORT, DMR43, DMR22, LCIC9702, LCIC9703-27, D2P29, EX-BORNO, SOSAT- C88 and IMV11-3-3SPT. All the 45 crosses (F1) and the ten parental lines were grown for evaluation at two locations, Yola (90 8I N, 120 16I E), in northern guinea savanna and Maiduguri (110 53I 130 16I E), in Sudan savanna agricultural zones of Nigeria. The two locations provide difference in soil type and rainfall representing the two main pearl millet growing areas in Nigeria and indeed West Africa and Asia. The Maiduguri soils are characteristically sandy with a low moisture holding capacity Rayar (1986), while Yola soils are sandy loams with relatively high moisture holding capacity. The weather during the research is characterized by low temperature and dry air that is typical of the harmttan period. The materials were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD), with three replications both at Yola and Maiduguri locations during the 2004 and 2005 cropping seasons. The genetic seed materials were planted on 22nd and on 29th of June in 2004 and 2005 respectively at Maiduguri location, while it was planted on 04th and 11th July in 2004 and 2005 respectively at Yola location. The plot size was made up of four rows each 5 m long and spaced 75 cm between rows and 50 cm within stands. Seeds sun dried to 10 % moisture content were sown by hand as a pinch after treatment with Apron-Star WS (Metalaxyl active ingredient) at the rate of 15 g kg -1 of pearl millet seeds. Seeds after germination were thinned to 2 plants per stand at 3 weeks after sowing. Compound fertilizer (N.P.K 27:10:10) at the rate of 60 kg ha-1 was applied in two split doses, one at planting and the other at 5 weeks after sowing. Weed control was done by hoe at three weeks and seven weeks after sowing, according to Onwueme and Sinha (1991). Harvesting was done manually using hoe and knife after the plants have matured. Data collections were done on the following parameters, following the procedure of Nwasike et al. (1992) and Izge et al. (2005). The parameters were; Days to 50 % flowering, number of tillers/plant, number of leaves/plant, downy mildew incidence, plant height, panicle length, number of seeds/panicle, 1000-grain weight, threshing %, grain yield/plant, and grain yield/ha. The statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed based on plot mean values for all the parameters combined across locations and years. The combining ability analysis was done according to Griffing (1956) Method 2 Model 1 using SAS 2005 package from Zhang et al. (2005), based on the following linear additive model: Yijkl =  + Li + Yj + (LY) ij + R (ij) k + El + (LE) il + (YE) jl + (LYE) ijl + є (ijkl). Where Yijkl = observation of any variable in the ith location, jth year, kth replication, of the lth entry;  = over all mean; Li = effect of the ith location, i = 1, 2; Yj = effect of the jth year, j = 1, 2; (LY) ij = location x year interaction; R (ij) k = random error effect of the kth replication nested in locations and years; El = effect of the lth entry, l = 1…55; (LE) il = location x entry interaction; (YE) jl = year x entry interactions; є (ijkl) = random error effect of the ijklth plot observations. The estimation of heterosis as an increase in F1 means over high parent means were expressed as percentage and computed using the formula of Liang et al. (1972) as follows: H = F1 – Hp / Hp x 100, where H = high parent heterosis, F1 = mean performance of crosses (hybrids) and Hp = mean performance of the high parent. RESULTS The mean squares of entries and analysis of variance for combining ability in a 10 x 10 diallel cross of pearl millet combined across locations and years are presented in Table1. The results indicated that highly significant or significant variance difference occurred in most of the characters studied. However, there was no significant difference among crosses, parents, and GCA variance in total grain yield/ha. There was also no significant difference among parents, crosses, and in GCA, SCA, GCA x Location, SCA x Location in grain yield/plant. Similarly, there was no significant difference observed in SCA, GCA x Location, GCA x year, SCA x year, and GCA x year x location in downy mildew incidence. The GCA x location, year x location, year x location x entry and parents x crosses variance interactions were highly significant for days to 50 % flowering. However, SCA x location variance interaction was significant for downy mildew incidence and threshing %. The ratio of GCA to SCA variance however, indicated that the major part of the total genetic variability was due in part by additive genetic effect, but mostly by non-additive genetic effect where ratios were less than unity. The estimates of general combining ability effects for yield and yield components in parental lines of pearl millet combined across locations and years are presented in Table 2. None of he parental lines exhibited any significant GCA effect for total grain yields. None of the parental lines also exhibited significant difference in GCA effects in number of tillers per plant, number of leaves/plant, threshing % and grain yield/plant. The parental line BONKOK-SHORT, exhibited the highest and significant negative GCA effects in days to 50 % flowering, plant height, panicle length and in number of seeds/panicle. Similarly, DMR22 exhibited the highest and significant positive GCA effects in days to 50 % flowering and plant height. The results revealed that BONKOK-SHORT, and LCIC9702 were the best general combiners for earliness, because both the parental lines exhibited highly significant and negative GCA effects for days to 50 % flowering. The result also indicated that DMR43, and DMR22 together are good general combiners for plant height, while DMR43 is a good general combiner for panicle length and number of seeds/panicle. Similarly BONKOK-SHORT is a good general combiner for 1000-grain weight. The result indicated that there is a significant and positive correlations existing between GCA effects and the parental performance per se in all the characters, except number of tillers/plant, grain yield/plant and total grain yield/ha. The estimates of specific combining ability effects for yield and yield components among crosses of pearl millet combined across locations and years are presented in Table 3. The results indicated that ACC-1022-1-2SPT x BONKOK-SHORT exhibited the highest, positive and significant SCA effect only in panicle length. In contrast however, BONKOK-SHORT x D2P29, exhibited the highest and significant negative SCA effect in the same character. The crosses BONKOK-SHORT x SOSAT-C88 and BONKOK-SHORT x EX-BORNO exhibited the highest significant positive SCA effect and the highest significant negative SCA effect respectively in days to 50 % flowering (Table 3). Similarly, highest and negative significant SCA effect for total grain yield was recorded by D2P29 x SOSAT-C88. No positive and significant SCA effects were observed among all the crosses in total grain yield and in yield/plant. The best performing parents and the crosses on the basis of per se performance and their combining abilities for certain characters are presented in Table 4. The result revealed that the best crosses in SCA effects did not always involved one or both of the best general combiners. The crosses with high SCA effects in most cases involved at least one or two of the good general combiners as parents, namely BONKOK-SHORT, DMR43, DMR22, LCIC9702 and D2P29. The result also reveals a good general parallelism between GCA effects and per se performance of parents for most of the characters. A similar trend of good parallelism was also observed between SCA effects and the per se performance of crosses (Table 4). The heterosis of crosses over higher parents for yield and yield components of pearl millet combined across locations and years are presented in Table 5. Positive high parent heterosis ranging between 1.69 to 114.05 % for total grain yield was recorded in forty-two out of the forty-five crosses. The result also revealed high level of high parent heterosis in grain yield/plant. The high parent heterosis of 85.13, 82.46, and 64.83 in the crosses IMV11-3-3SPT x LCIC9702, DMR22 x LCIC9702 and D2P29 x LCIC9702 in yield/plant was recorded. The result also showed that crosses, DMR22 x LCIC9702, EX-BORNO x IMV11-3-3SPT, D2P29 x DMR43, EX-BORNO x LCIC9702, BONKOK-SHORT x IMV11-3-3SPT, and D2P29 x EX-BORNO as had the best high parent heterosis for total grin yield. Of all the crosses, D2P29 x EX-BORNO, BONKOK-SHORT x D2P29, BONKOK-SHORT x IMV11-3-3SPT, DMR22 x IMV11-3-3SPT and EX-BORNO x IMV11-3-3SPT exhibited the highest high parent heterosis in tiller number. The result also revealed, LCIC9703-27 x SOSAT-C88, DMR43 x IMV11-3-3SPT, LCIC9702 x SOSAT-C88, ACC-1022-1-2SPT x BONKOK-SHORT and BONKOK-SHORT x SOSAT-C88 as having the highest and negative levels of high parent heterosis for downy mildew incidence. A positive high parent heterosis of up to 221.8 % of downy mildew incidence was recorded in the cross BONKOK-SHORT x LCIC9702. Generally, tremendous level of high parent heterosis was observed among the population, except in days to 50 % flowering, plant height and 1000-grain weight. The result also indicated significant and positive correlations between high parent heterosis and SCA effects for all the characters, except in number of tillers/plant, plant height, panicle length, and 1000-grain weight (Table 5).</p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS The presence of significant difference among the parental lines and the crosses of pearl millet population studied have been observed in all the characters. The presence of these differences therefore, indicated that an appreciable level of genetic variability existed in the pearl millet population. Falconer (1989) reported that the genetic improvements that can be obtained by selection among a number of parental lines and or crosses are dependent on the amount of variation existing between the population and the amount of selection applied. This therefore implies that the population generated would most likely respond to selection. The combining ability analysis of variance revealed the presence of additive and non-additive genetic effects as important in the control of the characters investigated. However, the ratio of GCA to SCA indicated that the major part of the total genetic variability for most of the characters were mainly due to non-additive genetic effects except for panicle length, number of seeds per/panicle and 1000-grain weight, suggesting that those characters were predominantly under the control of additive genetic effects. Contrasting results were reported by Nwasike et al. (1992), Chawdhary and Singh (1978) and Rao and Joshi (1979). The over all breeding implication of these results suggest that few of the characters of the pearl millet population could be improved through selection schemes like hybridization programs such as recurrent selection, which would necessitate the maintenance of heterozygosity in the population. Dogget and Eberhart (1968), Ahmad et al. (1979) and Kadams, (2000) also made similar recommendation in other self-pollinated crops. Panicle length, number of seeds/panicle and 1000-grain weight were at variance with this conclusion as they were under an additive genetic control. These characters could therefore, be improved through selection schemes such as the pedigree method or single seed descent method or any other modified selection capable of exploiting the fixable genetic variance. Under such a situation, the simultaneous exploitation of additive and non-additive components of genetic effects is advocated. Nwasike and Oyejola (1989) recommended the use of recurrent selection for population improvement in that respect. Since the variance due to GCA was lower than that due to SCA, it also means that non-additive genetic effects were more stable than additive genetic effects over the environments suggesting that more than one test environment is not necessary to get any reliable information on the characters involved among these populations. Similar results were reported by Nwasike et al. (1992). The general combining ability effects helps in identifying desirable parents in order to isolate desirable homozygotes from a segregating population. The highly significant and negative GCA effects displayed by BONKOK-SHORT and LCIC9702 in days to 50 % flowering, implies that these two parents when crossed together would most likely produce early or extra-early maturing crosses. Kimbeng and Nwasike (1994) and Kukadia et al. (1983) reported similar results. The parent D2P29 that was a good general combiner for downy mildew tolerance, because of its negative and significant GCA effect for downy mildew incidence could be suitable for incorporation into a breeding program for downy mildew disease tolerance. The parental line EX-BORNO that was reported by Ouendeba et al. (1993) to be tolerant to downy mildew disease however did not appear to show any significant and negative GCA effect for downy mildew incidence. This could be due in part to difference in the environments in which the two different studies were carried out. It could also be because; downy mildew disease strain in Nigeria has been reported to be the most virulent (Anaso et al. 1998). High level of correlations existing between GCA effects of parents and the parental line per se performance for most of the characters has a serious implication on crop improvement. Singh et al. (1982) reported that crossing two parents having a high general combining ability effects produced best performing crosses. Some authors have however expressed reservation and reported that the performance of a variety per se is not always a good indicator of their superior general combining abilities. Therefore in most cases parents could not be selected easily based on their GCA effects purely on the basis of their performance as varieties. Specific combining ability effects can be used to identify the best cross-combinations for hybrid production. The means (per se performances) of the best eleven crosses as well as the correlation coefficients between the per se performance and the SCA effects shows that the best crosses in terms of SCA effects, involved one or both of the best general combiners, namely BONKOK-SHORT, EX-BORNO, DMR43, DMR22, and D2P29. However, other poor general combiners frequently gave good cross-combinations, when they were crossed with best general combiners. Srivastava et al. (1978) and Kadams (2000), have suggested that when parents with high and low GCA effects are crossed, the poor parent could throw up desirable transgressive segregates giving rise to a new population. However, they added that, this is only possible if the additive genetic system present in the good combiner and the complimentary epistasis present in the crosses act in a complimentary fashion to maximize the desirable plant attributes which could be further exploited in further breeding programs. The corresponding means of the best crosses as well as the existence of high levels of correlation between means and SCA effects for all the characters except, number of tillers/plant, and 1000-grain weight connotes that the per se performance could be used to predict the best crosses, eliminating the cumbersome calculations of SCA effects. The presence of heterosis for different traits of pearl millet has been reported in a number of studies. Virk (1988) and Presterl and Weltzien (2003) gave a detailed review. Most estimates of heterosis were obtained by using diallel with inbred parents as in this study and therefore comparable. Ouendeba et al. (1993) investigated heterosis and combining ability among five African pearl millet landraces in contrast to this study where heterosis were investigated among ten parental lines. Barker (1978) reported that estimate of heterosis and combining ability becomes effective only when the parental lines are not less than ten in a diallel. Negative heterosis for downy mildew incidence in pearl millet is very desirable, implying a possibility of breeding downy mildew tolerant cultivars. Crosses producing higher and negative heterosis in downy mildew incidence were among those that recorded higher negative SCA effects. Chawdhry and Singh (1978) reported similar results where higher SCA effects were reflected in higher heterotic responses among crosses. SCA effects could therefore be used in some cases to predict or identify high level of heterosis among crosses. However, in some instances high heterotic response of a cross does not always mean high performance of the cross as well. This is because high heterosis of a cross may be due to relatively poor performance of one of the parents. Plant height and panicle length are characteristics that are considered by local farmers in choosing pearl millet cultivars in northern Nigeria. Longer plants are useful, since the straws can be used for bedding, building and thatching. Shorter plants on the other hand are also desirable in this particular environment because of their tolerance to strong windy conditions that could cause lodging. The present study identified the crosses, EX-BORNO x SOSAT-C88 and IMV11-3-3SPT x LCIC9702, as having the longest plant height with high levels of high parent heterosis, while ACC-1022-1-2SPT x BONKOK-SHORT as having the shortest plant height. However, DMR43 x IMV11-3-3SPT, IMV11-3-3SPT x LCIC9702 and IMV11-3-3SPT x SOSAT-C88 could be the most desired cross combinations for developing varieties with longer panicle length, because they exhibited high level of high parent heterosis in panicle length. The crosses ACC-1022-1-2SPT x BONKOK-SHORT, D2P29 x LCIC9703-27 and LCIC9702 x LCIC9703-27, recorded high levels of high parent heterosis in 1000-grain weight and could be recommended for increased total grain yield. Significant and positive level of heterosis for 1000-grain weight was reported by Nwasike et al. (1992) in pearl millet. This study concludes that the SCA variance was greater than the GCA variance for most of the characters among the pearl millet population, indicating non-additive genetic effects as the most important in the control of the characters studied. Since non-additive gene action was more important for grain yield, simple recurrent selection that emphasizes selection for SCA could be employed in the breeding program. The study also concludes that an astounding level of variability existed in the population because of the enormous level of high parent heterosis among the crosses, indicating a possibility for the production of pearl millet hybrid varieties.</p>

<p>PotterPlay was first founded on April 1st, 2003. Its main site was located in Geocities. Since then, the format of roleplaying in PotterPlay has changed vastly from message boards to the current forum in Invisionfree. It is the longest running Harry Potter RPG.</p>

<p>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MCDC) is a form of software testing or verification. In MCDC testing, every line of source code is executed at least once, and every condition is executed in every possible state.</p>
<p>Consider for example the following code:</p>
<p>if (A and B and C) then</p>
<pre>
 process1();
</pre>
<p>else</p>
<pre>
 process2();
</pre>
<p>end if;</p>
<p>First all variables in the condition are set to true and the code is executed. Process1 should be called (Note that MCDC is intrinsically a form of unit test, so the actual procedure process1 will not be called, but a stub will that will verity execution got to the correct place).</p>
<p>Then on the next code run, A will be set to false, causing the whole condition to be false and process2 to be called. On the third run, A will be reset to true, but B will be set to false, and on the final run, C will be set to false with A and B being set to true. This verifies that all values can be set and have the desired effect on code execution.</p>
<p>The FAA requires safety critical code in aircraft to be tested to the MCDC level.</p>

<p>Million Dollar Murder was Wilson Middle School's first ever play. With the small cast of only 12 and 2 young directors who co-wrote the play, they made it a success. With only 2 months of short rehersal, the cast had some struggles but prevailed in the end. Allthough they were only allowed to put the play on for one night because of <i>certain people</i>, they did an amazing job.</p>

<p>The Collaborative Crop Research Program (CCRP) is a competitive grants program funded by The McKnight Foundation for the purpose of increasing food security for resource-poor people in developing countries. Our vision is "a world in which all people have access to the food they need on the terms they can afford, and produced in ways that can be sustained by the wise management of local resources and are consistent with cultural values and nutritional requirements for a healthy and productive life" (&lt;a href="<a href="http://mcknight.ccrp.cornell.edu/about/vision.html" class="external free" title="http://mcknight.ccrp.cornell.edu/about/vision.html" rel="nofollow">http://mcknight.ccrp.cornell.edu/about/vision.html</a>" target="_blank"&gt;Vision page&lt;/a&gt;).</p>
<p>The program began in 1993 as a $12 million, six-year effort to support agricultural research aimed at helping developing countries. It has since evolved through three phases. In 1995, nine collaborative projects received grants (Phase I). These projects were in Brazil, Chile, China, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Peru, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. In 2000, the Foundation committed another $41.5 million over nine years (Phase II). During the first funding cycle of Phase II, 16 projects received funds. Beginning in 2002, the CCRP began a cycle of grant-making aimed at funding clusters of projects in geographic regions where food insecurity is both pronounced and likely to benefit from crop research investment (Phase III). In 2005-2006, sets of grants were initiated in the Andes, Eastern and Southern Africa, and the Sahel region of West Africa. An important component of this new strategy is providing financial and logistical support for regional CoPs made up of the CCRP-funded project teams. The project teams are composed of members/representatives from a variety of professions and institutions, and they have complementary insights and perspectives that can boost the group's collective understanding of regionally important agro-ecosystems and the complex socio-economic, cultural, and biophysical conditions that influence them. By providing support for annual CoP meetings and exchange visits for the projects in each region, the CCRP hopes to foster synergies and to encourage the teams to improve their project's effectiveness. CoP interactions allow participants to engage in open and constructive discussions of how to best manage the common research and development challenges they face as they attempt to improve food and nutritional security in the region.</p>

<p>Milton Rogovin was born in New York City in 1909. After graduating from Columbia University, Milton moved to Buffalo in 1938, setting up his own optometry business. In 1942, he married a woman by the name of Anne Snetsky. In that same year, he was inducted into the army, working as an optometrist. After being discharged from the army, Milton and his wife Anne had three children: two daughters (Ellen and Paula), and one son (Mark). He was called before the House un-American Activities Committee in 1952. Along with many other Americans, Milton was subject and victim of the Communist witch-hunts. The incident inspired Milton to turn to photography as a means of expression. For Milton, photography was a means to, above all else, keep his voice from being silenced. In his life, Milton has traveled throughout the world, taking numerous photographs, and earning highly-accredited awards. Still, out of all his work, his most impressive feat was in the development of “The Forgotten One’s.” In the work, Milton captured over a hundred families from Buffalo’s lower west side. Milton’s started the project in 1972, completing it more than thirty years later (in 2003), at the age of 92. In 1999, the Library of Congress collected more than one thousand of Rogovin’s prints. Today, Rogovin is acknowledged not only as an exceptional artist, but as a hero of working class people.</p>

<p>Catholicos Aboon Mor Baselios Thomas I is the spiritual head of the 15 million Syrian Christians of India, a Christian community believed to have been established by Apostle St. Thomas in a place called Maliyankara, near Paravur in South India in AD. 52. His Beatitude was enthroned as the Catholicos and the head of the Church of India on 26th July 2002 in a solemn function officiated by the Patriarch of Antioch and all the East and the Supreme head of the Universal Syrian Church, H.H. Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, at the St. Peter &amp; St. Paul Cathedral in Mor Ephrem Monastery, Ma`arat Sayyidnaya, near Damascus, Syria. He is also the President of the regional Episcopal Synod since 1999 and the Metropolitan Trustee of Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Association. Late lamented Aboon Mor Baselios Paulose II of blessed memory was his immediate predecessor in the seat of the holy Catholicos.</p>
<p>Mor Baselios Thomas I was born in the Cheruvillil family of Vadayambadi, Puthenkuriz to Mathai and Kunjamma on 22nd July 1929. Early part of his life was full of sufferings. Though he belonged to an aristocratic family, by the time he was born the family had seen bad days. As a child he had frequent bouts of illness which affected his education. His mother used to take the young boy frequently to the nearby Malecuriz Dayro where the relics of late Patriarch St. Ignatius Elias III and Saint Gregorios Geevarghese (Parumala Thirumeni) had been interred. One night, as his mother prayed with the young boy on her lap, she had a vision which prompted her to dedicate the boy to the service of the church. Within days, the boy's illness was entirely cured. God was with him, guiding him and shaping him.</p>
<p>His priestly formation was under the guidance of Mor Philoxenos Paulose (late Catholicos Mor Baselios Paulose II) who ordained him 'Korooyo' in 1952 and 'Shamshono' at Kadamattom Church in 1957. In August 1958, C M Thomas was ordained 'Kassisso' (full priest) by Mor Yulius Elias at the Majanikkara Dayro. In 1959 he was appointed as the vicar of St.Peter's church, Puthencuriz. Later he served the churches at Vellathooval, Keezhumuri, Fort Cochin, Valamboor, Calcutta and Thrissur. For a period of seven years from 1967, he was the organizing secretary of Kolenchery Medical Mission Hospital. He also served as the Chief organizer of the North Indian mission at Bhilai in 1970's and as the secretary of the 'Pourasthaya Suvishesha Samajam' in 1974. He was well known as a great revivalist preacher and was also recognized as an excellent organizer.</p>
<p>In January 1974, Fr. C M Thomas was elected to the episcopate by the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Association convened at the Karingachira St. George Church and was consecrated Metropolitan with the title 'Mor Dionysius' by H.H. Mor Ignatius Ya`qub III on 24th February 1974 at Damascus, Syria. He was entrusted with the charge of Angamali diocese, the largest of all the Syrian Orthodox dioceses which has a membership of more than half a million. The untiring efforts of Mor Dionysius in those days had helped a lot to revive the confidence of not merely the faithful of the diocese, but the entire Malankara Church. Metropolitans Mor Dionysius, Mor Gregorios Geevarghese (late) and Mor Koorilos Kuriakose (late) together were a great support to the (late) Catholicos Aboon Mor Baselios Paulose II, the then Chief of the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church. As the Metropolitan of Angamali Mor Dionysius had successfully initiated many welfare programs and also reorganized the diocesan administration. In 1978 Mor Baselios Medical Mission Hospital at Kothamangalam was started under his patron-ship.</p>
<p><br />
Catholicos-designate</p>
<p>Following the demise of Mor Baselios Paulose II in 1996, Mor Gregorios Geevarghese (Perumpally Thirumeni) become the President of the Episcopal Synod of the Church in India. After the passing away of Mor Gregorios Geevarghese in February 1999, Mor Dionysius assumed the Presidency of the Malankara Church Synod. On 27th December 2000, His Excellency was chosen as the Catholicos-designate by the Holy Episcopal Synod. The Church delegates meeting held at Puthencuriz on the same day, unanimously approved this decision. H.H the Patriarch, however, waited for two more years in expectation of a peaceful settlement to the longstanding dispute between the two factions of Malankara Church. But as it became clearer that the chances for reconciliation is remote because of the insincerity on the part of the opposite faction; a crucial convention was convened at Puthencuriz, Kerala on 6th July 2002 in which delegates from all the parishes participated and they approved a new constitution for the effective administration of the Indian Church, with the consent of the supreme head, the Patriarch of Antioch &amp; all the East. H.E. Mor Dionysius Thomas was elected as the Catholicos and the Metropolitan Trustee of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church at this historic Church Association. The election was later ratified by the Holy Episcopal Synod of the Universal Syrian Orthodox Church on 22nd July 2002.</p>
<p><br />
Catholicos Enthronement</p>
<p>On Friday the 26th July 2002, His Holiness Moran Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas the Patriarch of Antioch &amp; all the East, consecrated the 73-year old Mor Dionysius Thomas as the CATHOLICOS with the title 'BASELIOS THOMAS I' at a solemn function held at the St. Peter &amp; St. Paul Cathedral in Mor Ephrem Monastery, Ma`arat Sayyidnaya, near Damascus. Thus, fulfilling the wishes of multitude of faithful, the Malankara Church received a Catholicos after a gap of six years (Catholicos Mor Baselios Paulose II died in 1996). In the Syrian Orthodox Church hierarchy, the Catholicos is second in rank to the supreme spiritual head, the Patriarch of Antioch.</p>
<p>Fourteen Syrian Orthodox Bishops, from India, Syria, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany, Lebanon, Jerusalem, Turkey and Australia attended the enthronement ceremony as the co-celebrants. Thirty five Rambans, many Nuns of the Church and lay people were also present on the occasion to participate in the historical ceremony. Representatives from Government of Syria &amp; India attended the consecration ceremony as special guests. The consecration ceremony started with the celebration of Holy Qurbono at 8 AM by His Holiness the Patriarch, followed by enthronement ceremony, signing of 'SUSTHATHIKON' (Agreement) and 'OKSIOS' (Rising and Declaration). The ceremonial Services ended with the completion of the Holy Qurbono by the newly consecrated Catholicos.</p>
<p>On 31st July 2002, the Sunthroniso of Catholicos Aboon Mor Baselios Thomas I Bava was held at the Kothamangalam Marthoma Cheriapally where the sacred tomb of Maphryono Mor Baselios Yeldho is situated. H.E. Mor Julius Kuriakose, the first secretary to the Patriarch of Antioch read the Susthathicon, the Patriarchal Bull, proclaiming the enthronement of the new Catholicos for the Church in India. The function was attended by all the Metropolitans of the Malankara Church, hundreds of priests and very large number of laymen who came from all parts of Malankara.</p>
<p>As the head of the Church in India the Catholicos presides over the Holy Episcopal Synod of Malankara Church which includes all the Metropolitans of the Syrian Orthodox Church in India. His Beatitude is also the Metropolitan Trustee of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Association.</p>
<p><br />
Catholicate Office</p>
<p>The Catholicate office of His Beatitude Baselios Thomas I functions at the Mor Ignatius Zakka I centre in Puthencuriz near Kochi, which is also the headquarters of the Syrian Orthodox Church in India. His Beatitude resides at Mor Ignatius Seminary at Kothamangalam in Kochi district.</p>

<p>A. S. Cobb is a freelance journalist, publicist, marketing manager and more.</p>
<p>A. S. Cobb founded Brown Recluse Entertainment Ventures in 1997 before leaving the rural outskirts of Houston, TX for Sunny Los Angeles, CA. While in Los Angeles, he attended the Art Institute of Los Angeles in Santa Monica, where he learned video production. Simultaneously, Cobb, worked on his own public access cable show called Hip Hop Non Stop (Phaze I).</p>
<p>His cable shows featured mainly local Los Angeles talent found from various locations. The very first show was a premonition of big things to come. Word spread up to the Bay Area where Misbehavin', an up and coming rap duo, heard the news and after a short plane ride, landed in LA for the Pilot episode. Sharing the spotlight was local LA rapper Devious, a young lady who made opponents cower when battling freestyle. G-Style aka Gary, one of Cobb's Co-workers at the Crowne Plaza hotel, showed up to put his stank on the show.</p>
<p>Brown Recluse Entertainment Ventures also produced shows such as TKO (Talent Knock Out) in Inglewood, CA at Coley's Caribbean. The shows included the like of Miss Nina Renee Frances and up and coming actress and model, members of the Beverly Hills Trio, Omega 7 and Rob Lee and Greg Scott, who make up Beyond Quality Entertainment.</p>
<p>This event paved the way for Cobb to be summoned to other projects. The African Diaspora Foundation hired him to produce a string of fundraisers for their organization. It was at that time, old Art Institute classmate Alex Cortez came aboard to help with logistics and talent.</p>
<p>Cobb hosted the shows he produced most times. This garnered him attention from local producers who asked him to be a part of their comedy showcases. So, he took a break from being the boss and served an adoring public with laughter as her regaled them with truthful, yet humorous tales of his past at places such as the Comedy Union in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Not completely fulfilled, he stumbled upon Poet's Jazz House (PJH), a beatnik style poetry house with so much more. After a few months of observing and performing, Cobb was asked by the producer, the lovely Ms. Tuesday Conner, fashion designer to Chaka Khan and other celebs, to host the show. He did until he moved to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Cobb has teamed up with LA Fashion Icons, Kimiko Whitted of Kimiko by Design and Niche (Nikki) Martin of Niche Designs for the 2005 hit Bubble Up for Spring '06 Fashion Show &amp; Bazaar. This event featured a talent show, live entertainment and vendor booths, which included the works of designer Kevin James, Charlene aka Cookies by Me, Dawn Knight, CEO of Knightlife Entertainment and publishing. Knight is also author of the critically acclaimed fiction novel Kismet...available on Amazon, and others.</p>
<p>Currently Cobb services the Bay Area of California as well as Los Angeles with his boutique marketing firm called ASC Me PR. ASC Me PR was born from the many previous undertakings that required a great deal of PR, logistics and eventually culminated in him being on stage. Having many friends involved in similar industries and activities, Cobb found himself swimming in assignments he cordially accepted to help someone out. Most of these "favors" required him doing what he does best...communicate, promote, and create. Cobb helped design and implement marketing strategies for friends and family in entertainment, food service and real estate.</p>
<p>Now in Hayward, California Cobb has found himself back in school pursuing a degree in Business Administration and Marketing. Meanwhile, with a proven track record for success, he keeps busy building websites, marketing research, publicity and other related tasks.</p>
<p>Among Cobb and ASC Me PR's clients are: Charles Drew Realty, Overdue Exposure Magazine, Artisan Tatin Catering, recording artists Candis, Scipio, LBS Design and planning, Ephesians COGIC, Kimiko by Design, Niche Designs, NOIZ Imaging, Blu Leaf Clothing and Blu Foundation (deadbeats), to name a few.

<p>Esio (pronounced Ĕs-ē-ō) is a consumer hot and cold beverage system that prepares single serve, any size, coffee, tea, juice, vitamin fitness water beverages for the home or office. The Esio utilizes a patented technology in the system that works with the special proprietary “pump” on one end of each beverage package called an Esio-Pak. The system also allows you to select the strength and choice of your hot or cold beverage and each Esio-Pak will dispense 14-18 servings of each product selected. The Esio Beverage System was developed by Esio Beverage Company LLC., and can be used with bottled water or “plumbed” directly into your waterline or existing R/O system. The Esio will be available in the United States from local home and office delivery companies in the first quarter of 2007. www.esiobev.com</p>
<p><i><b>Technology</b></i> The Esio utilizes exclusive beverage paks called Esio-Paks which are produced and distributed by Esio Beverage Company. Each has a special “pump” on one end and allows the end user to easily drop it into the Esio. Once inserted into the system, the user presses either the hot or cold button, and the beverage is dispensed instantly. There is zero brewing or mixing time, because the water and beverage product are actually mixed in mid-air as the cup or glass is filled. The “interchangeable” Esio-Paks are as easy to change as a CD. There is NO cross-contamination when changing between Esio-Paks because it seals airtight between uses and it is completely disposable and eco-friendly. A unique feature of the Esio is the Strength Selector Dial. At the top of the Esio is a dial that allows the user to select the strength of his/her beverage. This feature provides ultimate convenience as each user can select the strength of his/her individual beverage. In the center of the strength selector is a child protection “lock-out” button to prevent injury to small children.</p>

<p>David Gazarov (Biography) Born May 19th 1965 in Baku (Capital City of Azerbaijan), David started his classical piano lessons when he was four. Besides classical music, American jazz was always taking a very important place in David’s life. A significant influence on his early musical taste and education in jazz field had been made by his Father, Eduard Gazarov, who's Jazz Big-Band rehearsals David attended almost every day while investing much of his time into perfecting his classical piano skills and taking lessons from his classical piano professor Elmira Nazirova. After graduating from Music College and entering Conservatory of Music in Baku, David moves to Moscow (1989), continues his studies and graduates from Moscow Music Academy of Gnesins. While he was still a student he had become the laureate of Trans-Caucasian competition for classical music as well as of The First All-Russian Jazz-Musicians’ Competition and The International Competition of Jazz-Pianists in Poland. In 1991 Gazarov signs his first international recording contract with “Anima Records” German recording company. David moves to Munich, the city that has become his second home. Between the beginning of the nineties and today, David was living an active life of a performing artist, being engaged as a soloist, but also very often as a sidemen in various formations. Today David Gazarov can proudly count among the colleagues he played with, celebrated musicians like N.H.ø.P., Bobby Durham, Chuck Israels, Roberta Gambarini, Ryo Kawasaki, Johnny Griffin, Keith Copeland, Charly Antolini, Buddy De Franco, William Galison, Martin Drew, Bill Goodwin, Jimmy Woode, and many others. Solo performances on a number of big stages - Semper Opera in Dresden (Germany), Congress Hall in Graz (Austria), Hercules Sal &amp; Gasteig in Munich (Germany), Chajkovski Concert Hall in Moscow (Russia), Montreux Jazz Festival (Switzerland), Jazz-Open in Stuttgart (Germany) – have greatly contributed to David Gazarov’s career development. During the past few years David has been working on a number of crossover projects with some outstanding classical musicians and orchestras. He was composing, arranging, recording and performing live with Bamberg Symphonic Big-Band, Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra, The Great Orchestra Of The City Of Graz, Symphonic Orchestra Of Bavarian Radio (BR), as well as with Karl-Heinz Steffens and Stefan Vladar. Working in crossover field has resulted in David Gazarov’s concert performing at highly regarded international classical music festivals such as: Mozart Music Fest in Wuerzburg (1997,1998,2000), International Chamber Music Fest in Jerusalem (2004), Wagner Music Fest in Bayreuth (1998, 2000) and Schleswig-Holstein Music Fest (2004, 2005). Besides all that, in the past years David Gazarov has recorded a number of CD’s under his own name, not to mention a frequent participation in the recording sessions of his colleagues. David’s albums were recorded and published, among other labels by: “ANIMA”(Germany), “DENON”(International), E-M-S (International), TUXEDO RECORDS – “Episode”(U.S.), TUDOR (Switzerland), SKIP RECORDS (Germany). Today David Gazarov is frequently touring with “mixed concert-program”, playing music of great classical composers, like Beethoven and Chopin, in the first half of his concert, and jazz and crossover compositions of his own, as well as paraphrases of jazz-standards, in the second part of the performance. <a href="http://www.davidgazarov.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.davidgazarov.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p><b>Ordinary Peoples</b> continues to evolve into one of the most distinctive <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> voices to originate from the mid-west scene. On their 4th LP, "Cause and Effect", the band refines the styles absorbed from time spent in their centric location to take the listener through a series of musical foundations. Northern-underground, east coast grit, west coast g-funk, and southern gospel are all represented, giving the album variety while still remaining cohesive. OP produces in the studio the same blend between live instruments and rhymes that they've generated for years on stage, but couldn't fully capture on tape.</p>
<p>Following 2003's "Urban Sprawl", "Cause and Effect" is more mature and personal; many of the songs depict experiences, thoughts, and occurrences that are obviously part of the band's daily lives. The group is not afraid to reveal their inner thoughts and struggles, ranging from the state of the world and <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> to girl trouble. On "How It's Goin' Down" and "Cause and Effect", <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scraps.html" title="Scraps">Scraps</a> shows off his ability for creative wordplay by rattling off scenarios that unfold the song's overall concept. "Brainwashed" and "Gas for Free" are more thought-provoking politically charged tracks which inspect and magnify current events.</p>
<p>The album features several guest appearances: guitar work by long-time collaborator <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_DePizzo_32bb.html" title="Jerry DePizzo">Jerry DePizzo</a> <a href="../../../o/2E/a/O.A.R._0cbd.html" title="O.A.R.">O.A.R.</a> provides depth while layers of turntables and horns spice up the beats further. The band passes the mic to acoustic baritone rhymer "Toothpick" (formerly of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Ronald_7910.html" title="Bad Ronald">Bad Ronald</a>) on the radio-friendly "Change My Luck", a song about hitting the reset button on a relationship. On "Nasty Girl" OP details sexcapade fantasies, passing the mic on a verse to the playful flow of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus.html" title="Columbus">Columbus</a><a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> emcee B. Yonest.</p>
<p>Breaking down from a 7-piece organic funk outfit to an electronically driven trio in 2002, "...really helped focus our songwriting and let us get into other areas we wanted to explore like sampling and loops," says drummer/producer Gerard Garrelts. Another result of the change was to bring Ben Levels to the forefront, highlighting his talents on the keyboard (playing bass and Rhodes/piano lines simultaneously) as well as his soulful vocal style. The band's successful live show has put them on stage with <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> notables <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanye_West_f668.html" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talib_Kweli_3b0e.html" title="Talib Kweli">Talib Kweli</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pharcyde_b814.html" title="The Pharcyde">The Pharcyde</a>, <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wyclef_Jean_ef13.html" title="Wyclef Jean">Wyclef Jean</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Roots_5b20.html" title="The Roots">The Roots</a>.</p>

<p>Instrumentation Eugene Wong (electric guitar &amp; vocals) Juan Cirilli (bass guitar) Sepehr Noroozi (drums)</p>
<p>Biography Boochika's somewhat minimalistic approach to making music has allowed them to gain an above average feel for their instruments. There are literally no outside effects in their music except for one guitar distortion pedal. So, you may be asking "What sets them apart from other bands?" Check out one of their live shows and you will know. The band's natural sound offers the listener something completely different from the mainstream music we all hear today. Boochika jams obsessively to ensure the quality of their music is on a constant rise.</p>
<p>Boochika is fairly new to the Toronto music scene, but have already performed at notable venues like Horseshoe Tavern, Lee's Palace and Kathedral. The band is looking to expand their resume, getting as many gigs as possible in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>

<p>In the MMORPG Eve Online, Titans are behemoths designed to wipe out entire fleets. Armed with either capital turrets, launchers, or both, their most deadly weapons is not these fearsome powers, but it's a gargantuan Doomsday weapon capable of dishing out enough damage to destroy an entire fleet of battleships - a dreadnought of a weapon, to be concise. Their thick armor and extremely powerful armnament make them a very, very cherished ship in the Eve Universe.</p>
<p>The only titan known to be created is from Ascendant Frontier, an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amarr.html" title="Amarr">Amarrian</a> Avatar. It has 6 capital turret hardpoints and can fit the Doomsday weapon "Judgement," although its primary purpose is to serve as a massive support platform for massive-scale battles.</p>
<p>The Judgement doomsday device was activated during a skirmish with the Band of Brothers Alliance.</p>

<p>THANKS INTERNET TRUTH FACTS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LIES FRAUD DISINFORMATION EXPOSED TO WORLDS NATIONS (Prove it ) . . . HAWAIIAN ENENKIO NATIONS</p>
<p>From: enenkio@webtv.net (ROBERT MOORE M P) Robert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission DO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands <a href="http://www.enenkio.org" class="external free" title="http://www.enenkio.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.enenkio.org</a> From: enenkio@webtv.net (ROBERT MOORE M P) WWW.ENENKIO.ORG ENENKIO BY STATE DEPT. OVER&#160;??/ posted by ROBERT MOORE M P: - Present Status - EnenKio is a sovereign state The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio was established in 1994 under authority and by direction of Head of State and the hereditary Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands. The Constitution of EnenKio established and set forth the authority and responsibility of the government and established duties and succession protocol of the Monarch and Royal Family. EnenKio is a Limited Constitutional Monarchy. Representative citizens, acting as Founding Fathers, ratified the Constitution, recognized His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as Head of State, affirmed their resolve in the Declaration of Sovereignty and determined the boundaries of the new Kingdom of EnenKio. Notice that EnenKio was a new sovereign state was sent to representatives of the Republic of the Marshall islands, United States, United Nations General Assembly, UN Security Council, South Pacific Commission, NATO, world media, Pacific Island nations and other nations. Legal action was then taken to set forth the claim against the foreign occupational forces of the United States, which failed to ever answer any actions and now stands in default with respect to demands for compensation and for illegally occupying of the king's ancestral lands. The effect of legal demands filed in U.S. federal court, unanswered complaints and failure to reply now have the force of law in commerce, under national and international laws and conventions. EnenKio is an "offshore haven for criminals and money launderers" Actually, the United States did reply — not directly to EnenKio, but with an insidious merciless campaign of disinformation broadly dispersed across the Internet and to its trading partners. One glaring example is a U.S. Department of State Report which compares EnenKio to the likes of Thailand, Colombia and Russia under the topic of "Money Laundering and Financial Crimes". This official report — International Narcotics Control Strategy, 1998 — categorizes EnenKio as an Offshore Financial Center. This is a curious label as EnenKio has no bank, no financial center and no money to launder. It goes on to refer to another state and "Enenkio" (sic) as "...mere figments of fertile imaginations...", and as "...entirely fraudulent in intent and practice." The United States offers NO proof nor is it known to have ever found any. In fact, in February 2001, the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, together with other federal agencies of the United States, concluded an exhaustive investigation that failed to turn up even one shred (or hanging chad) of evidence of impropriety — in intent or practice. EnenKio exists "only in cyberspace" Such a claim might be made for Yahoo™, Windows Magazine™ or any number of "dot.coms". Why, the United States itself claims over 25,000 web sites hosting millions of pages. Is this not a criteria for existence in cyberspace? EnenKio as a state has its roots in a 1987 document, but really, it is founded upon more than 2000 years of historical lineage preceding the ascendancy of the Hermios Marshallese family to their rightful, recognized traditional post. The EnenKio web site did not appear until 1998. It is a mystery how any reasonable person could examine the few dozens of posted documents, laws and letters — thousands of pages are not posted — and then say: EnenKio exists only in cyberspace. Today's Challenge for Tomorrow's Future Every avenue is being explored to raise capital for projects described in the development plan. Bond, stamp and shipbuilding programs have commenced. Applications are invited for passports, business licenses and ship registration. For those qualified individuals who wish to join this effort or encourage us to gain recognition among states of the first order, we have a need for Consuls and Diplomatic representatives in foreign offices, Trade Missions and other diplomatic posts. Additional human resources and people knowledgeable in international policy, diplomatic protocol, spaceport and aircraft operations, telecommunications, shipping, manufacturing, chemical engineering and a host of other disciplines will be required to design and attract development projects and implement envisioned programs. Contractual arrangements for professional consultation and services in law, finance, commerce, economics and others are being actively sought. All who have an interest and are so moved, you are encouraged to submit a Personal Involvement form. By submitting the form, you will be advised of the latest developments, provided an outline of needs and may at some point be invited to actively participate in development and promotion of EnenKio and to become a citizen of the fledgling nation. Salutation On behalf of the Second Monarch, His Majesty King Remios Hermios, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios and all representatives and citizens of EnenKio, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sincerely acknowledges your involvement, interest, prayers and support. See also: Political Status Under Illegal Occupation by the United States STOP BUSH CREWS LIES, FRAUD and DISINFORMATION WORLD WIDE www.enenkio.org (HAWAII &amp; ENENKIO NATION KINGDOMS) - Government Bond Program - The EnenKio Gold Bond Program Overview The Kingdom of EnenKio has implemented distribution of government development bonds, as bearer's instruments in friendly nations, backed by gold reserves, guarantees, real property or other assets. Use of bond capital, US$200 million per atoll, is to begin developing each of 5 King's atolls in the Marshall Islands, by way of joint ventures with the Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust (RHET), which will provide free or subsidized services to both residents and consumers, as briefly outlined below: Atoll Infrastructure Land – Atolls to be developed are subdivided into wetos or segments radiating from a central point in the lagoon and further into plots. Each plot sold or leased is delivered with title and title insurance. Landowners receive proportional compensation for use of land developed within their weto. (Based on 10,000 units) Systems - All systems will employ affordable innovative technologies for simplicity, environmental sustainability and efficiency. The utmost care is exercised to preserve the current pristine nature of the landscape. Building systems shall make use of custom prefab wall systems, recycled materials and coconut lumber laminates made on site. Water retrieval involves numerous drilled wells and pumps linked on all islands to a circular underground distribution and processing system. Sewage systems are buried in the lagoon, have access to every island and terminate in 4 deep ocean out falls. Selective management on the basis of ocean currents and tides controls discharge of residue. Treatment is minimal accomplished primarily at points of origination using "dry" toilets and subsequent pulverization. Gray water is treated and used in agriculture. Power systems incorporate electricity, cable and phone lines bundled and accessible to every island. (Based on 20,000 units) Transportation –100 electric trucks mobilize land transport without a fee. Both high-speed surface watercraft and amphibian Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft are employed for passengers and cargo; larger craft serve inter-atoll and international needs. 5 ocean tugs and barges provide service and support, such as container off-loading and towing duties. Medical – Professional services, remedial care, emergency medical services, paramedic training and search and rescue are provided by 5 hospital ships and 5 air ambulances (VTOL aircraft). Projects Floating Hotel – A turnkey 200-suite hotel ("Embassy Suites" quality) is moored in the lagoon of the atoll where the King resides. Services include restaurants, casino, ballrooms, shopping and craft shops. The lower level provides for parking, storage, mechanical and maintenance spaces. A dock system accommodating 200 boats and yachts to 100 feet is attached. Visiting yachts receive use of an electric car, power, TV, phone cable and security for a respectable well-below-market price. The whole structure rides on the tides. Fishing Fleet – A fleet of 100 fishing boats will offload their catch at 5 shore-based processing plants, each with a different end product. Fuel Oil Production – 25 portable copra gins will produce oils, fuels and other products for consumption, power, filtration and storage, such as barrels, using existing natural raw materials. Coconut Lumber – 25 semi-portable mills will produce laminate lumber, chips and wood for construction. Harvesting older non-productive trees will require planting new-variety coconut trees on a one-for-one basis. Docks – An average of 20 floating dock systems will be placed in each of 5 lagoons., residential or business units may be attached to dock for access to land and water transports. These dock systems form central distribution points for services and are linked by intra-atoll electric transports. 5 municipal centers will facilitate access to administrative services and provide chambers for local council meetings. Communications – Wherever power is supplied, cable and lines will permit electronic data and voice access to the global community. A satellite telecommunications station for each of 5 atolls will provide around-the-clock connectivity.

Bearer is advised that laws of the country in which bearer takes or negotiates possession hereof may apply to this instrument or to any subsequent transaction herewith; such laws of any said country, whether expressed or implied, shall not subject issuer to its jurisdiction thereby. All lawful exchanges hereof are considered by issuer to be "offshore transactions", as such term is generally understood in the international marketplace. Issuer does not warrant merchantability or market value hereof. Issuer does not insure this instrument or indemnify bearer hereof. Issuer keeps no record respecting identity of original purchaser. Bearer is advised to take every appropriate action necessary to protect or safeguard this instrument. Bearer is further advised that, respecting this printed instrument, the (1) actual value is negligible; (2) market value is not set or determined by issuer and may fluctuate without notice; (3) face (par) value is set as a fixed denomination of the prescribed precious metal bullion, in the measure inscribed, whereupon bearer assumes all risk as to trading or merchantable value, if any. Other conditions or terms may apply hereto without notice; bearer hereby acknowledges the responsibility to contact issuer for the most current information respecting obligations and duties of issuer, any authorized distributor or trustee of this instrument or the particulars of any program or project for which proceeds of this issue are designated. Interest – the nominal yield of this zero-coupon instrument is fixed at TEN PERCENT per annum, non-prorated, compounded and computed upon face (par) value. The Periodic Net Value (PNV) is determined only at each respective anniversary date subsequent to date of issuance affixed hereto. The chart below shows computed yield of Periodic Net Value per 100 units of par value. Each calculation of interest is rounded to TWO decimal places prior to compounding any subsequent anniversary PNV.

<p>Gaspare Ambrosini Gaspare Ambrosini, Italian jurist and statesman, born in Girgenti on October 24, 1886. In 1909 Ambrosini became the youngest professor of constitutional law of his times. In 1918, acting as private assistant to aging Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando played a noted role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles. Ambrosini escaped having to align himself with the ideology of fascism first by teaching colonial law and then by conducting extensive milestone studies on foreign federalism and abstract electoral systems. After the end of WWII, Ambrosini becomes a member of the Constitutional Assembly and a key participant of the 18-member committee credited with the actual drafting of the Italian Constitution He invented and introduced into the Italian Constitution the “regional state”, as an intermediary figure between the federal and the unitary states in which regions have autonomy under the constitution rather than limited original sovereign power. This type of arrangement was foreshadowed in the 1924 Cadige constitution and was fallowed in a number of subsequent constitutions including the 1978 Spanish Constitution. In 1946 Ambrosini was elected to the Italian House of Representatives where became the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. In this capacity he played a key role in advocating Italy’s participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and providing political and academic leadership in the creation of the European Community for Steal and Coal and the European Community for Atomic Energy. With his academic assistance, these two entities were conceived along the until then unknown figure of a “super-national” international entity with limited but own sovereign powers. This idea was at the foundation of the subsequent process of integration leading first to the European Economic Communities and then to the European Union. He also championed and justified the Italian international protectorate over Ethiopia which ended at the end of 1959. In 1955 Ambrosini was elected by Parliament as a Justice of the Constitutional Court of which he became the Chief Justice in 1962 holding that position until the end of 1967. He is credited with watershed constitutional decisions which asserted the primacy of the Italian Constitution not only over the laws adopted by the democratic Parliament but also in respect of those passed during the preceding fascist period; as well as the primacy of European law over Italian law. In this latter respect the Italian Constitutional Court opened a paved the path soon followed by the German Constitutional Court and many years later by other European member of the EEC leading to primacy of European law over the law of any member states. Until his death Ambrosini chaired a government institution which meticulously documented all Italian activities in Africa. He died in Rome in 1986, less than three months away from his 100th birthday leaving behind a rich legacy of more than 50 treaties and books on Italian and comparative constitutional law, international law, history of institutions of government and African studies. At the age of 96, he wrote and published his last treaty comparing the Italian constitution to the principles of the French revolution and the American independence. Having maintained his university tenure for over half a century, he shaped the thinking of three generations of Italian jurists. One of Rome’s square has been dedicated to him.</p>

<p>About ULTRAM ER ULTRAM ER is an effective treatment approved by the FDA for the management of moderate to moderately severe chronic pain in adults who need around-the-clock treatment of their pain for an extended period of time. Here's why ULTRAM ER is different: Once-a-day dosing. The once-daily formulation of ULTRAM ER means you only need to take it once every 24 hours. Just take it at the same time every day. Made with SmartcoatTM. The ULTRAM ER extended-release tablets use SmartcoatTM technology for convenient, once-daily dosing. This technology releases tramadol at a steady rate, which allows you to benefit from sustained drug delivery throughout your day. Can be taken with or without food. ULTRAM ER can be taken on a full or empty stomach, as instructed by a doctor. Contains a widely prescribed pain medicine. ULTRAM ER contains a pain medicine called tramadol, which has been prescribed for a variety of pain conditions for over 10 years. Indication ULTRAM ER Extended-Release Tablets are used for the management of moderate to moderately severe chronic pain in adults who require around-the-clock treatment of pain for an extended period of time. Important Safety Information Tell your healthcare professional if you have had an allergic reaction to tramadol or other opioids in the past. ULTRAM ER must be swallowed whole, and must not be chewed, crushed or split. Seizures have been reported in people taking tramadol, the medicine in ULTRAM ER. The risk of seizures is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Use of tramadol increases the risk of seizures in people taking antidepressants, other opioids, or other drugs that can cause seizures. Risk of convulsions may also increase in people with epilepsy or a history of seizures. Talk to your doctor if you are suicidal, or have a history of drug addiction. Also talk to your doctor if you are pregnant. ULTRAM ER should be used with caution in people taking medications such as tranquilizers, hypnotics or other opioids, or alcohol. ULTRAM ER may impair your ability to perform potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. The most common side effects reported with ULTRAM ER were dizziness, nausea, constipation, sleepiness and feeling flushed.</p>

<p>The Shops at Mission Viejo is a regional mall that includes anchors Nordstrom, Macy's (2), and Sak's Fifth Avenue. Previously known as "Mission Viejo Mall", this collection of medium to high-end shops underwent a major transformation in the late 1990's.</p>
<p>Soon after the Simon Group took control of the mall from the DeBartolo Corp. the property underwent a $150 million transformation. Prior to the overhaul the mall was dark, dated, and plagued by a high-vacancy rate. It's major tenants at the time were Robinson's May, Macy's and Montgomery Ward. The mall's tenant-mix had lost touch with the fast-growing population and income of South Orange County; the majority of the shops and restaurants shut their doors.</p>
<p>Simon Property Group set out plans for a major overhaul, attempting to reposition the shopping center as the premier upscale shopping and dining destination in South Orange County. They added department stores Sak's Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom to the existing anchor lineup of Macy's and Robinson's May. With premier anchors in place, and hugely successful restaurants The Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang's China Bistro locked in, other high-end and popular retail stores followed.</p>
<p>In 2006, Macy's purchase of Federated's Robinson's May created two Macy's locations at The Shops at Mission Viejo. Both locations have mirrored merchandise, with little differentiation between the two. It has been printed that the original Macy's building will close after the 2006 holiday season and converted into more mall tenant space.</p>

Alex "Gutz" Gutierrez is one of the best hockey players to play the game, and yet is still relatively unknown. People have forgotten over time despite that he held many records, all of which were broken by that damn Wayne Gretzky guy, but only by a small margin. There are only a few players that one could compare him with and that is Wayne Gretzky, Pavel Bure, James Lowrey, and Brad Zimmerman.</p>
