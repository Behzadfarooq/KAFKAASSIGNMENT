<li><b>Keep</b>. The article has only just started. The premise is sound, and could be a decent article if given time to grow. Unless there is an obvious reason to delete an article there should be a period allowed for them to develop. An article exploring the history and development of Indian military fiction sounds like a good academic subject. Rather than delete, let's encourage the author and give him the means to expand his article. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 22:00, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> An essay detailing the trend of "military fiction by writers who are Indian by nationality" sounds nice, even if one anticipates subjectivity problems. I would support the effort. But the article clearly does not envisage any such structuring. The author's assertion that <i>these are the only works of military fiction ever written by Indians, and hence the article should be retained</i>, does not support the assessment that informs the last sentence of this well-meaning vote. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 23:59, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - While an item by itself may not be notable or interesting enough for an article, when grouped together with similiar items it becomes of interest. An article on one ordinary person from Portugal wouldn't be interesting, while an article on the people of Portugal would. Interestingly while just doing a quick search for Airavat Singh, one of the authors mentioned in the article, I discovered that he is used as a reference source for the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja_Dynasty_of_Bengal_201b.html" title="Kamboja Dynasty of Bengal">Kamboja Dynasty of Bengal</a> article - so he does have some credibility. Also, I am tempted to be more patient to under-represented areas on Wikipedia. The majority of Wikipedians are young American males with an interest in comics, films and music - as such we are swamped with such articles, and it is right that we examine each new comic article carefully. However, articles on Indian literature are very rare and should not, I think, be hastily deleted. This article, as it stands, does no disservice to Wikipedia, and - given time (bear in mind that it was nominated for destru ction something like 9 days after first being written) - it may blossom into something that we all can be very proud of. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 08:25, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why, the other two authors are also eminent personalities, I don't doubt that their books are good. That's not the <i>point.</i> <i><b>What is the sanctity of a listing of military fiction, where the only point is that the authors belong to a certain nationality?</b></i> I can see that you have an interest in military fiction; will you take up the task of moulding the article into something worthwhile, on the lines indicated by you above? Otherwise, saying that the article should be retained on the vague off-chance of future improvement, when the creator of the piece states definitely that no such thing is on the anvil, make no sense to me. Anyway, it matters little in the great scheme of things. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 16:48, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It seems an interesting topic to merit an article (maybe a category per MCB. But till all such books have their own article and a category, this article should remain). Hopefully, We may see an addition by other editors after the article getting attention in this forum - <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a> 12:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I feel this topic has the potential to grow into an interesting article, give some time for it. I am doing a minor research to cull out some more details on this topic. I would suggest that this article be given some time before taking a decision on its deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMail2amitabha_0ab5.html" title="User:Mail2amitabha">Jordy</a> 16:06, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Some of the authors and books may be notable, or maybe the information could be included in an article on "military fiction" or made into a category instead. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Denaar (<a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenaar_9b7b.html" title="User talk:Denaar">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denaar_9b5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denaar">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>tag for cleanup/wikification</b>. The attitudes of the Indian writers (and their reading public) regarding fantasies of war with Pakistan are are interest and notability. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 20:26, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - a difficult one this. I can readilly see the potential for a worthwhile article. What swings it for me, though, is that of the 5 works mentioned, one is by the author with a link to his own website. This seems, to me, and I readilly admit that I might be wrong, to be a loosely cloaked advert for his own views. I think it should be deleted, userfied and the author encouraged to develop it in his sandbox and come back later with an improved product. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 03:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
