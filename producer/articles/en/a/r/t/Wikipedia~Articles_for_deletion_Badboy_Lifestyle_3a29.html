<p>With the exception of Owen Cook, which should be merged in to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Social_Dynamics_8175.html" title="Real Social Dynamics">Real Social Dynamics</a>, almost all of these pages list mainstream media recognition. Further more, within the community all are exceptionally well known. You've added a bunch of erroneous AFD notices (all of which point to the same AFD notice, annoyingly enough) and copy and pasted your message on to all of these, creating a lot of trouble for other Wikipedians. Your 'vague skepticism' translates to a lot of work for a bunch of Wikipedians trying their best to keep this corner of Wikipedia non-biased and spam-free. Please try nominating just one page next time, and do your research.</p>

<dd>Is this somebody's sockpuppet for working just on these articles? This was the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_STONEDMIT_60d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/STONEDMIT">first edit</a>. --<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 02:39, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodenBuddha_2fd4.html" title="User:WoodenBuddha">User:WoodenBuddha</a>. Why is deletion being proposed on articles which cite mainstream news sources documenting notability? Furthermore, I object to the fact that the AFDs were put up without <i>any</i> warning or suggestions on how to improve the articles, and that all the AFDs were put up simultaneously, which makes them very hard to defend at the same time. This is an abuse of the deletion process. Merging <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_von_Markovik_7108.html" title="Erik von Markovik">Erik von Markovik</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Method_fa65.html" title="Mystery Method">Mystery Method</a> into <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> makes zero sense, because all three are already long. <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">User:Kchase02</a> claims that these pages are not notable, but provides no actual argument why this is the case. He claims that there is a slim likelihood that anyone will search for them, but if he had taken a brief glance at google, he would have found that:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"Mystery Method" has 74,200 results</li>
<li>"David DeAngelo" has 98,700 while his product "Double your dating" has <b>553,000</b></li>
<li>"Ross Jeffries" has 53,400 while his product "Speed Seduction" has 58,100</li>
<li>"Real Social Dynamics" has 32,700</li>
<li>(Juggler and Badboy can't get any revealing results from google because the names are too generic)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Hence, it's just not true that nobody is going to searching for these pages. Skepticism that these people are really leaders of their industry simply demonstrates a lack of research and knowledge of this subject; it's like saying, "I'm skeptical that <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Friedan_eef9.html" title="Betty Friedan">Betty Friedan</a> were leaders of the feminist movement." --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 22:23, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As Kchase02 points out, the burden of proof is on the article to assert its own notability. Yet the article does so, and it has references from <a href="http://loaded.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://loaded.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Loaded (UK) magazine</a>, and <a href="http://www.thewest.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.thewest.com.au/" rel="nofollow">The West Australian</a>. Now the burden is on those proposing deletion to show that these sources are somehow inadequate. This has not been done; Kchase02 has not even acknowledged that these citations exist. I think it passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. There are two non-trivial sources cited that are independent of the company itself. There are also more references to the company, but they tend to in European languages I don't speak, so I can't go find them. For example, there was an article in Playboy (Germany). --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 00:45, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for continuing to dialogue, SecondSight. You seem to be referencing CORP criteria one, which for both companies and services references "multiple non-trivial published works". Loaded (UK) and The West Australian might qualify for a company, but I don't think that's helpful for a company (the article actually indicates it's a trademark) run by a single "seduction guru" (as he's called at <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>). As the deletion precedent indicates, "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Companies" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Small companies are not generally notable</a>." What's more <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Badboy+Lifestyle%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Badboy+Lifestyle%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">google</a> only gives 4,100 results for someone whose <a href="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.badboylifestyle.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a> is inactive. As to WP-BIO, the only argument I could see is from the last criteria, with identical language about published works, but judging from the titles only, they don't help. Loaded's "I Can Make You A Stud!" possibly has <i>the person</i> as the "primary subject" (quoting from the WP-BIO), but "Some Secrets You Should Never Share" indicates nothing of the sort.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 02:29, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> In agreeance with GassyGuy, not every member/thing associated with a more notable entity needs a page. This can be mentioned on a more main page. --<a href="../../../s/l/y/User%7ESlyder_Pilot_f758.html" title="User:Slyder Pilot"><span style="color: blue; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Slyder Pilot</span></a><sup><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup> 12:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> GWO's argument seems to be about the seduction community as a whole - the seduction community is worth documenting, as other wikipedia pages have shown, therefore no matter how 'questionable' it is to GWO, it is notable enough to be documented. Gassyguy's argument that 'not every member/thing associated with a more notable entity needs a page', is fine, but precedent in wikipedia shows exactly that - there are 1000's of porn stars with independent pages on wikipedia, the majority of them stubs, but I see no attempt by users to delete these, as well as pages for individual band members of smaller bands, individual pages for a large majority of internet memes, etc. Badboy's products are becoming increasingly popular in the UK, as well as the US. I also agree with Secondsight, that 'the burden is on those proposing deletion to show that these sources are somehow inadequate'. So far I have not seen this.--Ooblyboo 17:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that a lot of the porn articles on here are for nn people, as well as with other examples you offer to some degree, but I draw a different conclusion. I vote delete on everything that doesn't deserve to be here (in my opinion, of course) and hope it goes away. What you're suggesting is, because some of the stuff that isn't notable on its own survives deletion nominations, we should just give up and vote to keep all of it, and with that I cannot agree.
