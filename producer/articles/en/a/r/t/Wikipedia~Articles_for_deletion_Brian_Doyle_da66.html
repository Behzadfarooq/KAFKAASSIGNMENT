<li>High level bureaucrat + high sensitivity department + high level sex offense = more than notable enough by Wikipedia's excessively weak standards.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Premature nomination; whether a newsworthy item is encyclopedic can only be judged in retrospect, and, as always, we should err on the side of keeping, as there's much less complication and bureaucracy involved in renominating an article for deletion than in undeleting it at Deletion Review. Also, from a purely practical standpoint, there's much, much more value to our readers if we have an article for this highly newsworthy topic on Wikipedia, and then provide a link to WikiNews here, rather than having a soft redirect or something confusing like that. Also, WikiNews and Wikipedia overlap in many places; there are some things on WikiNews that shouldn't be on Wikipedia, and lots of things on Wikipedia that don't belong on WikiNews, but something being important for one does not, in itself, make it off-limits for the other. Almost all articles on criminals on Wikipedia wouldn't have existed before the crime; it's just a statistical fact that more (otherwise) non-noteworthy people commit noteworthy crimes than noteworthy people commit crimes (that would have been noteworthy enough even if they themselves weren't). Rushing to judge this article as only a temporary, brief newsworthy item is both hasty and forces Wikipedia to express an original-research POV: that this news entry, unlike many others on Wikipedia currently, is only a passing, transient article of minimal interest. We aren't forced to make such a judgment call, so I don't see why we should go out of our way to do so and risk inconveniencing hundreds of users who, like myself, randomly looked this up on Wikipedia to get the scoop after seeing dozens of references to it in all sorts of noteworthy media. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:13, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Significant public figure who was the subject of extensive media coverage. Would probably qualify even without the crime, but it makes him an absolute slam-dunk keep. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 06:33, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Utter nonsense, <b>KEEP</b>. This is a high-level official in one of the most prominent, security-conscious departments of the federal administration being charged with an attempt at child molestation. It's hardly crime-blotter fare. Needs wikinews coverage by all means but deleting this would be out of line with WP's practice with regards to notability. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 03:37, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per above--<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFallout_boy_7dea.html" title="User:Fallout boy">Fallout boy</a> 13:01, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
