<li><b>Keep.</b> The "Wikipedia is not a TV guide" line is nonsense, as none of these lists purport to be a TV guide. Rather, they are simply an index of programs that have, at one time or another, been broadcast by a particular station, and provide a useful guide for people, say, interested in reading about programs by the BBC or ABC. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> On one hand I'm tempted by deleting per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and there is no need for these lists if we have proper categories. On the other hand, the categories are currently not developed enough to cover for the loss. By the way, there is no indication that this nomination is done in bad faith and I think that claim should either be retracted or carefully explained. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 04:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a>. I just read through <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> again, and reread the relevant bits to make sure I didn't miss something. The "not paper" proviso seems far more relevant here than not "TV/Radio Guide" as written. None of these are remotely about what's on tv tonight, upcoming network promotions, etc., which is clearly the gist of that heading. These lists are better organized than the categories, and therefore more useful. I've only known of their existence for a day, and already I've found them educational and a potentially good research tool. (I've been trying to piece together what was on Nick at Nite in 1985-1986 for my own use.) The ones I looked at need filling out, not deletion. On the other hand, if categories could be rigorously created and populated with everything from every deleted list, right down to the subheadings, I would be satisfied. This seems unlikely to happen, however, because many older shows have no articles to this point. Incidentally, I find Maximegalon's conduct here very much in good faith and highly ethical. This AFD proceeds logically from the Sci-Fi one, and notifying people on both sides of the previous vote is as fair as can be.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Karen and Rebecca. Really now, they're really quite referential and definately helpful as they are: lists and guides. They shed light on a history within a channel by listing what was aired and still being aired and certainly not a mere television guide as <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a>, by no means...</li>
</ul>

<dd>There are many lists and they <i>do</i> serve a purpose. Deleting them so swiftly without remarking on their potential if they're somewhat short of that would be unjust to those who have spent time compiling them (although I know effort doesn't necessarily qualify as being encyclopaedicly valueable, they knew the benefit of having these things to their corresponding channel lists)... Like the many editors of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_programs_a84e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Sci Fi Channel (United States) programs">the forementioned AfD</a>, who managed to sort things through well-enough considering.</dd>
<dd>Though, just <i>one thing to keep in mind</i>.... There should be some sources cited if there isn't already, since one can write something up for an obscure channel and the reader would not have anything to refer back onto to verify these listings. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 06:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Interesting. I'm seeing notable items (e.g., historically important tv shows), given additional notability by association with a particular network's history.

<li><b>Keep</b> Partly procedural.

None of the five bulleted examples are comparable to this situation and the bolded instruction that "if you are unsure of whether to bundle an article or not, don't" suggests not bundling these. In any case, these sixty or so pages were the result of sometimes enormous effort, with some of them having over 250 edits in the history (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programs_broadcast_by_American_Broadcasting_Company&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programs_broadcast_by_American_Broadcasting_Company&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this one</a>). If we're going to wipe out this much work, it ought to be in separate AfDs, or at the very least with more test cases. We owe that much to the people who've worked on these lists. I think they should also be kept on the merits per Karen's argument.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 08:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that while some of these have current schedules, most of them provide organized information. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Adult_Swim_6073.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim">List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim</a>, for example, which contains a notes column with useful information and grouped by theme. From WP:lists (but not <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a>), a guideline for when to create lists, <i>Lists on Wikipedia have three main purposes:</i> Information, Navigation, and Development. Number 2 doesn't really apply anymore because of Categories, but for quite a few of these, either 1 (Info) or 3 applies very well. For info: <i>The list may be a <b>valuable information source</b>. This is particularly the case for a <b>structured list</b>. Examples would include <b>lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists.</b></i> It's clear, for example, that the above mentioned Adult Swim list is a valuable information source, grouping information by theme, chronologically, and containing significant notes on the programs. Moreover, a number of these lists, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Alpha_TV_8677.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Alpha TV">List of programs broadcast by Alpha TV</a>, for example, clearly fulfill the development aspect of Lists cited by Wikipedia as just reason to create a list (<i>Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The lists of related topics give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written.</i>) All of these reasons should make it obvious why these lists should be kept. Some of them seem to be better replaced by Categories, but there are many lists proposed for deletion that clearly fulfill one or two of the above reasons to create a list as per accepted WP guidelines. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="green">(Yom)</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">contribs</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethiopia_7101.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethiopia"><font color="red">E</font></a></small> 09:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If these were all <i>simply</i> lists of programs I would have no issue saying "delete". However, as Yom notes, there is usually relevant additional information. For instance, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Global_42db.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Global">List of programs broadcast by Global</a> (a Canadian network which, like many Canadian networks, tends to buy the rights to more American shows than it can fit on) lists not only past, present, and future series, but also indicates the status of shows <i>might</i> air on that network depending on other factors. Others indicate what I consider relevant information about <i>when</i> programs aired, e.g. first-run vs. syndication. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 10:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional comment</b> - I also take issue with the application of "WP is not a TV guide" insofar as listing <i>general</i> information about a channel's <b>current base</b> schedule. I'm not saying we should have schedules for the likes of ESPN where the idea of a season schedule is essentially meaningless. But even we were to have <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_United_States_network_television_schedule_86b7.html" title="2006-07 United States network television schedule">2006-07 United States network television schedule</a>-type articles for all countries and channels covered, that's just the planned schedule as of the outset of the season. I consider the current main schedule of a channel, <i>exclusive of any specials or special airings</i>, not to be indiscriminate, and relevant to discussion of the competitive business of television. Whether or not they're relevant content in a "list" is debatable, although it seems preferable in contrast to a new "Current United States television schedules" page listing every network and cable channel known to man. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 10:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant Keep</b>. Reluctant because I don't believe lists of things actually belong on an encyclopaedia, but sadly there is enough precedent on here to keep these lists.

<li><b>Keepish</b> I don't particularly like the listyness of this and these lists will eventually become horrendously over-populated. I'm also not keen to be associated with arguments based on wikipedia not being paper.

<li><b>Keep</b>, unless some good samaritan(s) categorizes each and every one.

<li><b>Keep</b> To be honest, although having a list of television shows that have been or will be broadcast in a region is not really what a traditional Encyclopedia was meant for - wikipedia is anything but a traditional encyclopedia. If we start pulling articles such as this because we feel that it is beyond what Wikipedia was meant for, then by the same means we need to pull articles on comics, trading cards, games, even theatre - because it is not what an encyclopedia is for. In other words, once we begin to restrict the content, where do we stop? I am extensively using the resource available for a website I am building that puts all current run TV shows into a game format; wikipedia is an invaluable resource for this purpose. I no longer have to go hunting each individual studio or network - I can use the wiki to find the majority of what I need in one easy spot. So in regards to whether this is useful content or not - I vote yes, because the way I see it - if even one person finds it useful - then it has served a purpose. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonChi_66fb.html" title="User:DragonChi">DragonChi</a> 17:59, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> on all as a set but <b>Relist</b> borderline cases. In many cases it is desirable to find out which programs were broadcast on particualr networks. From an Australian point of view you can learn a lot by comapring ABC, SBS and commercial lists of TV programs. I think some <i>Individual</i> lists here may merit deletion, but the incusion of a few dozen lists/articles in one AfD makes this kind of awkward to discuss. -- <a href="../../../d/l/e/User%7EDleigh_8a27.html" title="User:Dleigh">Synapse</a> 15:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure one can make an argument for an individual list that doesn't apply to all lists. Assumming that every network is deserving of a list, such an argument would refer to the quality of the individual list, and that's not what AfD is for ideally. I'm not sure that the quality of an individual list makes the list any more or less appropriate for this encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 16:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Useful as tracking lists, to see what shows WP has/has not got articles on. Potentially useful as a finding resource, for people who know the network a show was on, but not its precise name. Useful as a guide to the kind of output the network showed. Regarding lists vs categories: there's a place for both - lists can be a lot more systematic, and show redlinks. So Keep (and re-instate the Sci-Fi channel, which appears to have been deleted on the admin's personal view, rather than the balance of the Afd). <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 07:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The lists are quite useful in finding out what any particular network is showing or has showed over its history. To say is a TV guide is incorrect as it is not acting as a TV guide as it doesn’t show actual channel/time/date stuff. They do go to show who published or created any particular television show by this thinking, oher lists would also have to be deleted as well, it is the same thing as deleting the list of products offered by Microsoft, Boeing, Ford or Adobe. The lists are quite useful in seeing who created what and for comparing genres. A TV guide would show the time, date and channel any given program will be transmitted. This is more historical and cross-referencing here. Such information is not generally in a TV guide. The lists are a nice consolidation of information which one would otherwise have to look for in many different places. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdelisle_6821.html" title="User:Bdelisle">Bdelisle</a> 01:29, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b> Being that television programming is quite ingrained in to the culture of many countries, and the at many of the programming can be comparative of other programming having such a list makes for a great index. Also like said above, keep the current lists and re-instate the Sci-Fi channel programming list. Truly encyclopedic? Probably not. Of interest to people? Seems to be. There is a lot of stuff that would not go in to a traditional encyclopedia in Wikipedia. That is what makes it so interesting. I believe that a lot of AfD is done over-aggressively, much seems to be based on opinion which often seems to be counter-neutral itself. If we are truly encyclopedic then 90% of the pages dealing with television shows, programs, and stations should be deleted; as should most books, movies, biographical stubs and company lists. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdelisle_6821.html" title="User:Bdelisle">Bdelisle</a> 20:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <i>can</i> see people wanting to consult these lists; in fact, IIRC the whole idea of them was started precisely because people <i>were</i> adding exhaustive lists of past and present shows to the network articles themselves, which started to disrupt the quality of those articles. I don't have a particularly strong opinion on them, but I do find the "Wikipedia is not TV Guide" argument unconvincing, as that's not what these lists are <i>trying</i> to do. All in all, I don't see any reason to vote anything other than <b>keep</b>, although I could be swayed by a more convincing argument against them than I've seen here so far. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - why are these pages gone when the consensus, to me a slightly newbie wikipedian seems to be on the side of keeping them? Confused as to process.
