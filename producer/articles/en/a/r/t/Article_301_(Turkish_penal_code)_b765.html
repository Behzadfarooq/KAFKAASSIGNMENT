Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk was brought to trial regarding statements about the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Article 301 has been used to bring charges against writer <a href="../../../o/r/h/Orhan_Pamuk_7deb.html" title="Orhan Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a> for stating, in an interview with a Swiss magazine, that "Thirty thousand <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurd.html" title="Kurd">Kurds</a> and a million <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_people.html" title="Armenian people">Armenians</a> were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it". The charges were later dropped.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the trial opened against five journalists charged with insulting the judicial institutions of the State, and also of aiming to prejudice a court case (Article 288 of the Turkish penal code).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> Each of the five had criticized a court order to shut down a conference in <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> about the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Armenian_casualties_f537.html" title="Ottoman Armenian casualties">Ottoman Armenian casualties</a> in the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. (The conference was nevertheless eventually held after having been transferred from a state university to a private university. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup>) The charges carried a potential penalty of a prison term of up to 10 years. Four of the journalists were acquitted on a technicality, while the fifth, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murat_Belge_74a6.html" title="Murat Belge">Murat Belge</a>, was acquitted.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another high-profile case to result from this legislation involved the writer and journalist <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perihan_Magden_54ed.html" title="Perihan Magden">Perihan Magden</a>, who was prosecuted for a December 2005 newspaper column in which she strongly defended the principle of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscientious_objection.html" title="Conscientious objection">conscientious objection</a> and the refusal to perform military service. In response to this column, the Turkish military filed a complaint against her <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup>.

<p>In July 2006 the Istanbul public prosecutor's office prepared an indictment alleging that the statements in the book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Manufacturing_Consent%7E_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media_aee9.html" title="Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media">Manufacturing Consent</a></i> by <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_S._Herman_0460.html" title="Edward S.

<p>In 2006 <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elif_%C5%9Eafak_76a4.html" title="Elif Şafak">Elif Şafak</a> also faced charges of "insulting Turkishness" because of her latest novel, <i>The Bastard of Istanbul.</i><sup id="_ref-guardian_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian" title="">[3]</a></sup> The case was thrown out by the judge after a demand by the prosecutor for the case to be dropped.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

He left behind a wife and three children. Orhan Pamuk declared, "In a sense, we are all responsible for his death. However, at the very forefront of this responsibility are those who still defend article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. Those who campaigned against him, those who portrayed this sibling of ours as an enemy of Turkey, those who painted him as a target, they are the most responsible in this."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In its short life the article has been heavily criticized, both in Turkey and outside.
