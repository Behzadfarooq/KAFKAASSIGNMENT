<li><b>Strong keep</b> I don't see why this article was proposed for deletion in the first place.

The objections raised so far are <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>. We're not interested in whether editors think something is mumbo-jumbo. We're interested in whether something is sufficiently widespread and of note to merit an encyclopedia article. This obviously is. I'm sure a lot of people consider consider that Christianity is mumbo-jumbo. That is not a reason to delete the article on Christianity. There is no wiki criterion for "mumbo jumbo". There is one on "patent nonsense" and this is already addressed on the article talk page:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just spent 3 hours trawling through numerous New Age web sites concerning the "Law of Attraction". They are fairly consistent in their use of this term and mostly refer to Hicks. There are <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+Hicks&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+Hicks&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">79,900 Ghits</a> for "Law of Attraction"+Hicks. The argument that this is "mumbo jumbo" is not grounds for deletion. It is at the moment pure <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> on behalf of editors saying it. Verifiable sources should be provided that say it is mumbo-jumbo, and this viewpoint can then be included in the article. I have been trying to find a suitable source via <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+mumbo+jumbo&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+mumbo+jumbo&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">409 Ghits</a>. Maybe someone else can do better. I have moved the page to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_Attraction_%28New_Age%29_43ab.html" title="Law of Attraction (New Age)">Law of Attraction (New Age)</a> per above comments.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Googling around some, I agree it seems that Esther Hicks et Al. are heavily promoting this concept as a money maker for them. It seems they do such a good job at promotion that notability is established, IMO.

<li><b>Keep</b>, now that it was renamed to include "(New Age)," as it seems to pass wikipedia criteria. Can someone create a disambiguation page, though?

<li>The nom based his decision on the old version. The new version has been redone from scratch, and was enough to change my vote from Delete to Keep.

<dd><b>Comment</b> According to his earlier works, it appears that this article is misleading. By lumping all of these authors into a group based solely upon the moniker, their individual opinions on the matter, specifically whether "like attracts like" or "like repels like" has become ambiguous by this article.
