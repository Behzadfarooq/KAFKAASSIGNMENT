This article appears to be a less than accurate transwiki translation from the <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E9%9A%BB%E5%B0%8F%E8%B1%AC" class="external text" title="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E9%9A%BB%E5%B0%8F%E8%B1%AC" rel="nofollow">Chinese Wikipedia article</a>. The online article cited in the English Wikipedia article appears to be covering the said issue - although a more accurate translation is needed as it is published in Chinese.

<li><b>Merge</b> per above. Someone reasonably surefooted in Chinese and English may want to reword this; as written, it's rather confusing. Questions: are there significant differences in Asian versions of the story as opposed to the Western one? Where did the story originate?

<li>It has reliable sources. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> doesn't mention language at all as a criterion. If something is notable, it's notable period, regardless of language.

<ul>
<li>As you are responding to my vote, note that the article has been expanded significantly since that time (per CaliforniaAliBaba below). It still lacks context; I've read it several times and I still have no idea what the point is. Vote changed to <b>weak keep</b>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may be missing the point because (IMO) it's a really stupid, pointless controversy in the first place. Basically, <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Chengyu.html" title="Chengyu">chengyu</a></i> are traditional phrases which reference old literature (sometimes thousands of years old), poetry, folk sayings, etc., and whose meaning isn't readily apparent unless you know the stories behind them. Hence the need for <i>chengyu</i> dictionaries. People who view dictionaries as <i>prescribing</i> correct usage rather than <i>describing</i> existing usage are thus all up in arms about the official national dictionary being polluted with popular culture that lacks time depth. Or to put it in Wiki terms, they think it's fancruft and want it AfD'd. =) (Unfortunately, the above summary qualifies as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, so I can't put it in the article) ... cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 07:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well done! I still wonder, though, whether it's going to be easier for uses of the English language Wikipedia to find this if it's merged at the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Little_Pigs_35bc.html" title="Three Little Pigs">Three Little Pigs</a> article, as opposed to appearing under the current title. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:48, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe a title like "Three Little Pigs chengyu controversy" or something. So far, the only coverage in English is from <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastsouthwestnorth.html" title="Eastsouthwestnorth">Eastsouthwestnorth</a> <a href="http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20070127_2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20070127_2.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, so it's hard to say what the English name should be. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 00:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This controversy, at its heart, is not about the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Little_Pigs_35bc.html" title="Three Little Pigs">Three Little Pigs</a>. It is about what defines the limits of a linguistics term.

Also it isn't purely a linguistic controversy, but also a political one (the dictionary was put online over a year ago, but only started getting news coverage recently, tied in with a scandal with the Ministry of Education head Tu Sheng-cheng's son). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 00:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete/merge unless article expanded with real-word context/analysis</b> There's a reasonable case that this goes against the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> section on plot summaries that says an article should provide fictional plot details with real-world context or analysis (as opposed to simply listing them). So as is, I'd favor deletion/merger with the book series' main article. However, if the article could be expanded with published material explaining some real word implications for owl words, then I'd be willing to reconsider (assuming it avoids original research issues). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But to reply, note that the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_Middle-earth_3ffd.html" title="Languages of Middle-earth">Languages of Middle-earth</a> that you linked does appear to include a fair amount of explanation and analysis of how and why Tolkein created the languages. It doesn't just list phrases, but explains why the creation of the languages has some real-world significance and value outside of the fiction itself. By contrast, the owl words article simply lists the words and doesn't go much beyond that. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> as redirect. The <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auden_Group_e86a.html" title="Auden Group">Auden Group</a> says that they were also known as the Thirties poets, so redirecting there is not unreasonable. Googling doesn't produce <i>millions</i> of hits, but those that come up refer to Spender, Auden etc. What's the harm in having this as a redirect? <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 01:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - theoretically this should be handled at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_6c7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion">Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion</a>; however it looks like there's a general consensus here that there's no reason to delete this (and go through the hassle of moving everything over there for a similar discussion). <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 02:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I won't vote because I'm the person who created the redirect page, and it's not my call whether or not to keep it. I created it because there was a "red" link to the term "Thirties poets" on a page that I was working on, and the phrase is in fairly wide use. I don't have strong feelings about keeping or deleting the page, but there are books and articles titled "The Thirties Poets" or similar terms. Googling the phrase in quotes "thirties poets" produces some standard examples. Unless there's a strong reason to delete that I haven't seen, I guess I would say it does some good to keep it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacspaunday_d071.html" title="User:Macspaunday">Macspaunday</a> 16:14, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just wanted to elaborate my reasoning on nominating the article for deletion. When I came across the re-direct I expected to be taken to a list and/or a nice summary of popular poets in the 30's. I was not aware the Auden Group was synonymous with '30's poets' and I have no problem with that. I simply nominated the article because I feel the term is inherently misleading. Perhaps the page should be disambig'ed? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESERSeanCrane_d75c.html" title="User:SERSeanCrane">SERSeanCrane</a> 20:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Perhaps the list of linked names in the first paragraph of the page that the redirect goes to is enough to serve the purpose? It's impossible to create a definitive list of "Thirties poets" beyond the obivous ones listed on the target page. It would be possible to add a few dozen other poets who wrote in the 1930s, but I think the term "thirties poets" is more or less synonymous with "Auden Group". Still, it might be an idea to have category pages of "British poets of the 1920s", "British poets of the 1930s", etc., if those categories don't exist already. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacspaunday_d071.html" title="User:Macspaunday">Macspaunday</a> 21:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>...and shouldn't this be over at <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">WP:RfD</a>? The article states that the group went under the names of "Thirties Poets", so it's valid. If there were a list of poets from the 30s, I don't think it'd be under this name. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject of this article may have seemed notable for a time of news coverage about the AMBER alert, but this individual is not notable and there is little reason to having an article for them. Whatever hype there may have been in the media has long passed and we should not set a precedent of keeping record of every single record of an AMBER alert and news story. The article also needlessly violates the privacy of the subject and her family.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Encyclopedic notability requires more than 15 minutes of fame. The only sources cited in the article are fro July 2 and 3, 2005, when she was in the news. This is not a newspaper, and not Wikinews, and not Victimpedia. Whether she is in an editor's "mind" has zero bearing on whether she meets the standard for notability, and as the article now stands, she does not. Reprintsof the same story do not add to notability.

<p>The last AFD of this closed suggesting that this be re-opened in several months, and I am of the opinion that this individual is not notable and that there is no point of having an article for them. Whatever hype there may have been in the media has long passed and we should not set a precedent of including memorial pages and keeping record of every story of someone's troubled life. This article also needlessly violates the privacy of the subject and their family.

<dd>Here's an idea how to address it: <b>read the article</b>. The subject of the article is the killings of the parents. The person doing the talking in any situation is NOT the subject of what is being said, except when the person is talking about themselves. The article is about the death of her parents. So one could argue that they are the subject of that article, and therefore notable. But the daughter is not the subject of the article, and therefore, if that article alone is used to determine notability, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, she does NOT pass. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 11:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> A couple of problems with the nomination. First, for purposes of inclusion, notability and verifiability doesn't "expire" with time. (If it did, we'd lose all manner of historical information that the public has lost interest in.) Either she appears in published articles or she doesn't. Assuming the references in the article are valid, and she has been the subject of multiple articles, she would be notable. Second, the nominator mentioned the article was previously up for afd discussion, but looking at the article history and talk page I don't see any links to the previous debate. If someone could provide a link to the previous debate for reference, that'd be great. At any rate, workign under the assumption that the references check out, I see no violation of policy here. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>{{WP:BIO|Notability is not subjective]]. I'm frankly puzzled at the people who keep arguing delete because she's non-notable. She's <i>indisputably notable</i> - she meets one or more of the notability criteria. I mean, sure, the article is of low importance, but <i>Low importance</i> is not an accepted criterion for deletion - and given that article evaluations keep it as a level of importance, I think it's fairly clear that establishing "only somewhat important" as a criterion for deletion would not be an easy task. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Further in many cases I suspect the articles will prove to be notable in the long run. Keep them all and then come bback next year when we dont have to have a crystal ball to say they are not notable. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 06:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>We may have lost track of what <i>non-trivial</i> means, lets again look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a definition: "Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail. <b>A 200-page independent biography of a person that covers that person's life in detail is non-trivial</b>" - - - She does NOT pass. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 21:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>whereas a birth certificate or a 1-line listing on an election ballot form is not.</b> is maybe the most important omission. The word <i>trivial</i> is pretty self explanitory, but the sources are not mere directory entries, nor do they only mention the subject in passing. While the coverage on her may not conglomerate to a 200 page book (and if we searched, it might - I have no idea). Why not look at the other kind of criterion in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a guide of what kind of person is notable. Anyone who's taken the field for an inning of major league baseball without touching the ball passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - and they're likely to have comparable or lesser coverage than this girl does. Whereas the sources here don't match the 200 page biography example, they're far closer to that than the example of trivial coverage. If you believe the coverage is trivial, you need to go back and review it. It's not, and it's not even mistakable for trivial coverage. Look, I recognise you must have formed your opinion earlier when the article was in worse shape, but as it stands the article is now a 100% clear cut case of passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - it's not even remote possible to plausible argue otherwise without being inconsistant with the facts. It happens that an article that looks like a delete at first glance turns into a keep, after some editing. Hell, the first article I nominated for deletion got improved during the AfD and even I have to recognise that by the ene it was a clear-cut keep. Rather tha struggle to vindicate your original conclusion, rejoice that the the encyclopaedia has been improved in the meantime. A positive thing has happened for a valuable, encyclopaedic article. Fighting about it simply makes no sense. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So I throw a little &lt;a href="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Boy_%28Restaurant_Chain%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Boy_%28Restaurant_Chain%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Boy_%28Restaurant_Chain%29</a>"&gt;stub of an article&lt;/a&gt; up on Wikipedia in the hopes it attracts someone who has actually seen the subject in question and can actually provide some facts about what the place was really like. The place has been either a parking lot or a Dunkin' Donuts for as long as I've lived here, and the locals I've talked to have no idea what it was like. But for a while, it was a living breathing piece of Americana.</p>
<p>All I have to go on is an empty soda cup and someone's comments on a Burger Chef fan page. So I figure I can harness the powers of Collaborative Information Gathering and Organization and revive this dying piece of history--I might jog the memory of someone else who can contribute something useful to those who study pop culture.</p>
<p>(Unlike the lot of you who think pedantic nonsense like "correcting" the spelling of amoung to "among" is helping out, it is those thousands who are moved to contribute their knowledge to a topic few others have heard of that give the wiki its strength.)</p>
<p>So enjoy deleting this article and continue being the bunch of petty counter-productive bureauratic tryant-knobs that you appear to be. Just don't be surprised when Wikipedia vanishes into obscurity as quickly as it flashed to the forefront, all because you thought collaborative information gathering wasn't as important as you casting a vote on what is "important" or not.--ObsequiosityFYM 02:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I just want to say that we created a <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">One Piece Wikia</a> to avoid the creatation of pages like this on wikipedia. We realised there were too many pages on Wikipedia related to One Piece and the more we got the harder it was to explain their value. After loosing several pages to deletetion for one reason or another, the Wikia was started to house the expanded version. The same who created this page did indeed create several other One Piece related pages recently, one of which was a failed delete. The creatator (although you don't <i>have</i> to do this) does not discuss the matter with the rest of the community before creating this type of page.<br />
<br />
The main concern for this page is the fact it broke several rules in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_89fb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga">Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga</a> when it was created (it was souly a German adaption thing). The creator renamed the page to open it up to other adaptions to save it however it still breaks most of the same rules it broke before. It is fancruft completely. Also the reglaur editors of the One Piece pages cannot check the info of anything that goes onto this page (their mostly English). While I normally support the saviour of the One Piece articles even when they break the rules, the workload and trouble behind this page in question just is too much for the reglaur editor to handle. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 08:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Clearly, this information is verifiable, but that doesn't mean it is encyclopedic. We don't need one of these for every popular TV series that gets translated, nor for One Piece. —<b><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><font color="#0000BB">Da<font color="#000066">rk<font color="#000022">•S</font>hik</font>ari</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari">[T]</a></sup> 14:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Merge</b> Or not even really merge, perhaps just include a quick note in the main article for the main characters. Minor characters are irrelevant and probably fancruft --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyOliver_4b95.html" title="User:TommyOliver">TommyOliver</a> 18:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Overall, there is an excess of minor details. One main page, one page each for the Straw Hats (and maybe a couple others), and a page for minor characters. Then any updates would be about characters on their respective pages instead of having 29 pages per saga of summaries (i.e. CP9 Saga - I looked at the sum of pages, and can not even imagine rewriting it). As for the One Piece-a-pedia, it is useful, but is also inaccessible to the average Joe. Actually, I did not even know it existed. Yes, I know it is under "external links," but how many people actually read those? The Piece-a-pedia is only a substitute for the main One Piece page if there is a redirect from the Wikipedia "One Piece" to it. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstoVidatu_231a.html" title="User:AstoVidatu">AstoVidatu</a> 14:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Let me just say that if this page is allowed to exist after breaking so many dam rules I'll loose faith in the judgement of everyone on Wikipedia. Even if it gets merged into another article, the info is out of place on the articles we have already to do with One Piece. Everyone is forgetting something when they say "merge" - This is the ENGLISH wikipedia. We only reference Japanese because its a Japanese show... I'm sure a German reader would want to know this info... Also this is one of the most unencyclopedic of the One Piece related pages we have, partly due to its half-thought out layout. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 22:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Salvinorin isolation is clearly an interesting and encyclopedic topic and it would be perfectly ok to write about it in a general form and give references to the respective publications or (serious) online sources.

If the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin_A_fd75.html" title="Salvinorin A">Salvinorin A</a> article is getting overly lengthy, it is completely appropriate to give Salvinorin extraction its own article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 04:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

Or because in spite of its heading "How To Extract", it's not really a how-to guide because it claims so? Or perhaps because the information is available everywhere else (just like porn) that Wikipedia needs to mirror it? Policy says that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a collection of indiscriminate information</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an instruction manual</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a mirror</a>. WP:NOT is a policy not a guideline, and I think the consensus being sought is whether or not this article violates the policy, not whether the policy should be disregarded here. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 04:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This article is proposed for deletion as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" class="extiw" title="w:NOT">W:NOT</a> violation because it is allegedly a "how to article". I (1) pointed out that it isn't a "how to article" and doesn't purport to be, (2) opinioned that it is notable and (3) said it sounds as if a merger is impractical.

<li><b>Comment</b> Shaundakulbara, renaming the section from How To Extract to Extraction Process doesn't change the fact that the bulk of the text remains a how-to guide. To stop it from being a how-to guide, you would have to reduce the entire article to a summary of a couple paragraphs. It would then be a stub which couldn't be improved on without making it a how-to guide, indicating that Salvinorin Extraction should be remerged into the main article under the new summary. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It might be helpful to point out that actually instructions for this process are <i>much</i> lengthier than this article. This article is a synopsis of the process that is appropriate for Wikipedia (but yes, this synopsis could be streamlined further). I suspect that some of the delete voters believe this article advocates or encourages hallucinagenic drug manufacture. It doesn’t. There is no POV in this article nor is there censorship on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 21:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I assure you that advocacy of drug manufacture is not the issue. I have personally extracted Salvinorin from leaves using essentially the procedure described, and used the resulting product myself. I'm hardly trying to advocate morality here. Wikipedia is just not a how-to guide. For example: "<i>Although extraction may be dangerous due to solvent toxicity and flammability, Salvinorin can easily be extracted from leaves using chilled <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetone.html" title="Acetone">acetone</a>. It can further refined by using <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naphtha.html" title="Naphtha">naphtha</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isopropanol.html" title="Isopropanol">isopropanol</a> to remove impurities, as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin.html" title="Salvinorin">salvinorin</a> is poorly soluble to these</i>" just about covers it. Being two sentences, they would fit right back in the main article, not in a new one. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 22:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Janusvulcan, I may be misinterpreting sarcasm here, but frankly, a little light-hearted humor isn't out of line every once and a while, it's just when it gets in the way of making an encyclopedia or is done in leiu of productive work that it becomes an issue. In addition, votes are virtually never 'stricken' in AfD discussions, they may be discounted when determining consensus (IE an administrator ignoring 10 "me too!" or "delete per nom." 'votes' when determining the real results of a debate) but are generally not removed. Also, I beleive that Coelacan was simply attempting sarcasm, while it's not always the best thing for consensus-building, please try to understand the comment in context. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 23:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wintermut3 your comment real made me think “Could I be missing a sense of humor.” So I began almost three hours ago to familiarize myself with Coelacan. To see if this users sense of humor was misunderstood by me. I spent time in his discussion page, user page, user contributions to articles and talk pages, looking at the other users who had contact with Coelacan, following the history back on virtually every page he edited, and one thing is for sure, Coelacan doesn’t joke around. I’ve noticed in many situations quite the opposite. Sarcasm and a little light-hearted humor toward the above mentioned user is usually met quite harshly. So what I knew before I started on this journey, but ended up verifying is that I was not misinterpreting sarcasm.</dd>
<dd>I don’t dispute your comment, but who draws that so called line? <i>a little light-hearted humor isn't out of line every once and a while, it's just when it gets in the way of making an encyclopedia or is done in lieu of productive work that it becomes an issue.</i> --<a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanusvulcan_5e0c.html" title="User:Janusvulcan">Janusvulcan</a> 05:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not assuming the nomination is in bad faith, simply suggesting that it may be. In other words, based on <i>my</i> reading of the talk page and Nirelan's contribution log, the nomination of this article to AfD does not appear to be in good faith. And, yes, I agree that Nirelan has made some valid editorial points. Like <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a>, my concern is that we've gone from "0 to AfD" without the appropriate page-based discussion. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 01:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I admit there are refrences to him, but most of them contain false information. For example, this article orignally said that ScriptingNews was one of the first blogs. However, blogging exisited long before his site was created or he became interested in it. Also, RSS was created by Netscape and Dave talked Harvard into controlling it. While he has told those refrences that he played a part in creating blogging or RSS it just isn't true no matter how many sites link to it. Dave has the power to influence the media because he worked for Harvard, but that shouldn't give him the power to influence a community site like Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please look at the top of the article. I disproved the main reasons to give Dave an article.

<li>You are addressing what you perceive as inaccuracies in the article. These are not reasons to delete the article. Please do not use AFD to address content disputes. Nirelan, has it ever occurred to you that he did not parachute into Harvard out of the clear blue sky? His notability, for better or worse, was well established before that time. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dhartung, If any of us claimed to have invented a widely used program Harvard would probably take us seriously as well. However, the truth is that he tried to sell outliners and basicly had to give his company to Symantec because his own company was so unsucessful. --<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a><a href="../../../n/i/r/User_talk%7ENirelan_bfaa.html" title="User talk:Nirelan">Talk</a></li>
<li>Nirelan, it's good that you deleted your potentially libelous comment here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dave_Winer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103169094" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dave_Winer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103169094" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I don't know where you were or what you were doing 1997-1999, but I was an early blogger (third public blog using <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger.com.html" title="Blogger.com">Blogger.com</a>, three-digit Blogger user number<a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/884" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blogger.com/profile/884" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) and I have also used Userland products. The problem with Winer has never been "lies" as even the people he has alienated -- which is a large number of people -- respect his accomplishments. The problem has always been whether he allowed others credit or control. He sold outliners back in the pre-web days, and he adapted quickly and successfully to the web, and he was an enthusiastic evangelist for blogging even before the word was coined (see <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>). This article and his claims regarding his career are necessarily contentious, but asserting that his accomplishments are non-notable misses the point of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (which is for better or worse), and your efforts to turn the article into an <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attack page</a> really demonstrate the bad faith of this nomination. The fact that you're trying to dismiss a Harvard appointment as based on lies really demonstrates how thin your argument is. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

They've received a few magazine blurbs and been the opening act on a couple of small tours. If you could tell us "This passes because of criteria X", that would help your case. I don't think meeting the criteria for you guys is too far off, so I'm changing my "protect" opinion. Give it time. If you guys are really that good, you'll make it soon enough, and someone else will write the article about you (it's very, very hard to get an article in that's about yourself, see <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.

<ul>
<li>Thanks for the info and feedback. I've read the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> criteria and improved upon the original, and will continue to try and meet what's expected.Note: The Upsidedown headlined most shows in Portland and Seattle and on tour. 2 of the members of the band were formerly from bands that are on wikipedia. the record was produced by Tony Lash who's also represented on wikipedia.The Out Crowd and The Village Green, also represented on wikipedia are friends and recommended we submit an article. The Dandy Warhols are working with us in the studio to finish our new record.</li>
</ul>
<p>there are 20 or so write-ups from press around the country, including The Boston Globe, The Nashville Scene, etc. should I reference them all? I don't see huge press detail on other band articles. I think this passes because The Upsidedown is an established working band, has released a record that has gotten good reviews and airplay in west coast markets(kexp-seattle,knrk-portland,littleradio-LA) , and been used on soundtracks to recent television shows.

<dd>If other band pages don't cite their sources, they need to be edited or deleted as well. For this article, we need <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The Boston Globe would qualify, so please add that citation. Random appearances on TV shows aren't necessarily notable. Exceptions would be if it were <i>central</i> to the episode, or became a theme througout the series. If there are any reviews of the band or their album in notable publications, that would go a long way towards resolving this. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've rewritten the article a bit for you, added a template, some categories...I'm not too good at this stuff yet (if someone wants to cleanup my cleanup, be my guest). In your zeal of adding stuff, things got a bit messy. Much of the information was either condensed down to the template, or really not needed (more than half of it was article quotes...if we really need to see them we can look up the articles). I also threw in a link to your homepage and Reverb's homepage. I believe the sources now establish notability, but I dropped the indy magazine ones, they don't carry a lot of weight (The Globe and The Oregonian do, though). Feel free to add in some history, a discography, what have you...there's more to be done.And even if it still doesn't pass AfD, don't be discouraged. As I said earlier, you'll get there eventually. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 11:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The first external link doesn't pull up anything for me. The second (Boston Globe) seems to be a collection of media mentions, but they all seem to be blurbs about upcoming shows that the band is going to be part of with other, frankly more notable, bands. I don't see anything that meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> beyond the Magnet mention. The article as you've rewritten it <i>looks</i> much better re: formatting. But I feel like the the original author is just having to stretch too much to make the case for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 19:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They're not the Stones, no. But I'd call it "multiple non-trivial published works". Just because a band just does opening acts doesn't make them non-notable. I think they're borderline, but I think it qualifies.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> After the latest updates, the article looks <i>much</i> better. The references are still somewhat weak, but the article has received a drastic improvement thanks to Upsidedown8.

<li>Changing to<b>Neutral</b> The article looks a million times better than it did when the AfD was started--in sources, clarity, and NPOV. I still have my doubts that the sources cited qualify as "non-trivial" mentions, but if the consensus seems to be going in the "keep" direction, I can certainly understand that. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 04:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Article for supposedly famous and influential University of Miami alumni group connected with <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Rosenhaus_cd95.html" title="Drew Rosenhaus">Drew Rosenhaus</a> and "dedicated to dominating the fields of business, politics, and sports by any means necessary" fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for reliable sources. Current article only has a couple blog links for references.</p>
<p>Yes, there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Miami_mafia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Miami_mafia" rel="nofollow">a previous afd in October 2006</a> but this was speedy closed as the nominator didn't actually want to delete and seemed to have confused afd for a merge debate forum.</p>
<p>Now,about those blog links:</p>
<p>1) The Fantasy Sports Trades Blog post directly references <a href="http://www.fantasysportstrades.com/drew-rosenhaus-for-presidentof-something/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fantasysportstrades.com/drew-rosenhaus-for-presidentof-something/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drew_Rosenhaus&amp;oldid=29628339" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drew_Rosenhaus&amp;oldid=29628339" rel="nofollow">this November 2005 Wikipedia article</a> which is the only apparent source for the "Miami Mafia" claim. The Wikipedia article statement is unsourced.</p>
<p>2) Yes, the second blog is on the Fox Sports website but its also a fan community blog written by some random guy who's a contestant in a Fox sportswriting competition (see the red sidebar on the right<a href="http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/absolutebest/2006/06/06/Sports_Blockbuster_Series_The_Omen" class="external autonumber" title="http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/absolutebest/2006/06/06/Sports_Blockbuster_Series_The_Omen" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>), not actually by a professional sports writer on the Fox staff. This source is referred to in the current article as if it is an official Fox sports news report.)</p>
<p>Google and Factiva searches:</p>
<p>Screening a google search to filter out "miami mafia" hits related to <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro_f149.html" title="Opposition to Fidel Castro">Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro</a> gives ~378 hits, mostly spam or wikimirror sites<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22+alumni++-castro+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com+-site:references.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22+alumni++-castro+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com+-site:references.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news and magazine database search gives zero hits for "miami mafia" + "Drew Rosenhaus". 62 hits on google<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22+alumni++-castro+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com+-site:references.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22+alumni++-castro+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com+-site:references.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> - basically just wikimirrors and spam sites.</p>
<p>Factiva gives 3 university of miami hits for "miami mafia".</p>
<p>These Factiva hits are all passing mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the Dallas Morning News (Jan 10 1991, literally just the line "<i><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Shula_c9f4.html" title="David Shula">David</a> was almost family in Johnson's Miami Mafia.</i>" i.e. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Johnson_%28American_football_coach%29_018c.html" title="Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)">Jimmy Johnson</a> - a coach at U.Miami but an alumnus of the University of Arkansas, not Miami; and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Shula_c9f4.html" title="David Shula">David Shula</a> who is an alumnus of Dartmouth College, not Miami).)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel (August 12 2001 - literally just a quick reference to the U.Miami coaching team: <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Davis_5a36.html" title="Butch Davis">Butch Davis's</a> "<i>Miami Mafia is a cast of two: secondary coach Chuck Pagano and Pete Garcia</i>. Butch Davis is another alumnus of Arkansas, not Miami. Chuck Pagano is an alumnus of the University of Wyoming, not Miami<a href="http://www.raiders.com/team/coachbio.jsp?id=18985" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.raiders.com/team/coachbio.jsp?id=18985" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. Pete Garcia <i>is</i> a Miami alumnus<a href="http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=11700&amp;ATCLID=747735" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=11700&amp;ATCLID=747735" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in the Washington Times (Nov 13, 2006) - used in headline "Miami Mafia busted" and then only again at the end: "<i>But this season it's just not happening for the Redskins' Miami Mafia</i>". The use of the term in the headline is the strongest claim so far for the term. However, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/functions/print.php?StoryID=20061113-124954-9783r" class="external text" title="http://www.washtimes.com/functions/print.php?StoryID=20061113-124954-9783r" rel="nofollow">the article</a> is about Miami University alumni who are players on the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> who were hired by Coach <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Gibbs_ee44.html" title="Joe Gibbs">Joe Gibbs</a>, a graduate of the San Diego State University, not Miami.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>1) Current article is based on unreliable sources - a fan blog entry and a blog entry based on an unsourced wikipedia article.</p>
<p>2) No indication of more reliable references from general google (nothing on google book either<a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22++&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22miami+mafia%22+%22university+of+miami%22++&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.</p>
<p>3) Factiva brings up very few uses of the term which are all different. None of them related to Drew Rosenhaus. None of them suggest a group of Miami alumni "dedicated to dominating the fields of business, politics, and sports by any means necessary".</p>
<p>4) Recommend deletion of this article's content, removal of the related content from <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Rosenhaus_cd95.html" title="Drew Rosenhaus">Drew Rosenhaus</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a>, and redirect to <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro_f149.html" title="Opposition to Fidel Castro">Opposition to Fidel Castro</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> How exactly is it "required to be on Wikipedia"? It doesn't appear to meet the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notability criteria for companies</a>. At least, the article does not assert that it does. Basically, it reads as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">promotional material</a> for the company and not as an encyclopedic article. The article does not contain <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (or citations for any sources, for that matter) and seems to be based on primary information. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 06:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think there's a "Delete" here somewhere, but I disagree with the reasons given forth so far. I don't know if it is was necessarily against guidelines to create a page about yourself or something you created if it's notable enough, and this guy does have some outside magazine sources as references. I just wish I could check them According to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, if someone else has published it, it's not original research, and there's an implication (not a statement, an implication) . The weblinks at the bottom, though, are completely useless. As for the "nonsense"...Okay, just reading the article, my eyes glaze over. Just seems like a load of business-babble. That doesn't make it nonsense, just unreadable. Now, <i>if</i> those sources check out, and <i>if</i> someone else has worked with this idea unrelated to the author, and <i>if</i> this article can be cleaned up to be actually readable, I'd throw out a Keep. As it stands, though, I'm afraid it's a <b>Delete</b>. By the way, have you proven sockpuppetry, or is it just assumed? --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:32, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> It does not read like nonsense exactly, but it does seem extremely vague. Almost all the references are from one fundamental source. The Oxford conference is the most conventionally respectable, but it does not seem clear that the papers on the agenda have any particular connection with the viewpoint in the article. This is not yet notable. If it becomes so, a more meaningful article could be written <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 21:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I strongly disagree with the proposal to delete. None of the reviewers have presented any conceptual argument or claimed any experience in future studies, scenario planning or business management. I guess it is the novelty of the concept that provokes the negative reaction. The concept has been accepted in business and futurists’ community. The article on the Balanced Scorecard is rather similar, yet the Balanced Scorecard was also new in 1993. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ann50 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ann50_33d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ann50">contribs</a>) 17:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<p>Sister article to TeachGirls.org, pretty much identical text.

<p>Main assertion of notability is creation of video "Deep House"... which was "released" on MySpace. The rest... two self-published poetry books, one self-published music album, work as a production assistant etc. is very unnotable.

Even if he had been the producer his <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability would be extremely questionable in my opinion. But consulting producer?

<li><b>Comment.</b> Long is a known media guru, and intellectual who flirts with Hollywood. He has worked with John Sculley ( founder of the term 'PDA' ). Long is a media entrepreneur &amp; information architect. Even without his relationship with Puck, he has done some incredible technology &amp; media work. I've read some of his collaborations with Noam Chomsky. I've also read conceptual healthcare concepts developed with Richard Saul Wurman on Childhood Obesity. This biography of Long, only begins to uncover Long's body of work. His speeches &amp; books represent a new type of ideal. To delete this entry is a step backwards for that which wikipedia is based upon. If Long didn't exist, I would agree with having it be deleted. However, I'm continually learning about new work, patents, stories, speeches &amp; concepts that 'Long' has created and he is operationally applying a theory known as the 'digerati principle', with a patent known as 'rotary 23' a three dimensional super imposed image for communication being developed at the Sloan Institute at M.I.T. I suggest, you permanently defer deletion &amp; begin to consider following Long's work.{{prod}} comment was added by Clashique (<a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClashique_4e55.html" title="User talk:Clashique">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clashique_bd5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clashique">contribs</a>).

<li>Ah, well, I'm glad you at least concede that if <i>Long didn't exist</i> the article should be deleted... as for the rest, why isn't any of this in the article, and sourced?

<p>Early Sunday-morning (i.e., dead time) college radio show -- a show that the station's own Web site buries deep inside its listings. PROD tag added, but removed by anon IP with the edit summary <i>This page is legit. The info seems to check out. "dead air" is an inappropriate value judgement that has no effect on the accuracy or legitimacy of this article.</i>. Actually, it's an entirely appropriate value judgment, since a 2 a.m. Sunday morning time slot helps illustrate the utter non-notability of the program. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:23, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the "anon IP" and just a recent Wikipedia user. However, I am familiar with the WNUR station and do know that the station broadcasts throughout the majority of the city of Chicago with a range comparable to commericial stations. Thus, any show that airs on the station, regardless of timeslot, can conceivably be heard by most people in the city of Chicago. This would apply to any other radio program that airs overnight. Furthermore, I'm not familiar with radio, put I'm pretty sure that the term "dead time" is incorrect in this case as the show does indeed broadcast. It's not an internet podcast or private show, but rather exists on a station, 89.3 FM, that is fully accredited by the FCC (like ANY other radio station) for the Chicago region. Lastly, because there is no way to tell how many listen to the program, I see no reason not to grant the benefit of the doubt. To do otherwise would create a "value judgement" and precedent that radio doesn't really "count" after the sun sets. Many, many people in this country would disagree. 24.12.186.181 04:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> The current argument is irrelevant, according to Wikipedia's own criterion for notability: "Notable here means "worthy of being noted"[1][2] or "attracting notice"[3]. It is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance". It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. It is not "newsworthiness"." In context, this means that "Morning Sickness With Eric And Harrison" is a valid article so long as verification of its existence can be determined. Since it is publicized as part of the WNUR lineup (however obscure this is), and since WNUR 89.3 FM is an official, FCC accredited radio station (despite what may be playing on it), the argument of lack of notability cannot be backed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Unillenium411 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Unillenium411_1bea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Unillenium411">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really understand how the time of day that the show is broadcast makes a difference as to whether or not they have a wiki page. The purpose of Wikipedia is to provide information about things to interested people and that's what their page does, especially since their official website isn't detected by search engines. What is wrong with allowing them a page? It's not hurting anyone, if anything it's just allowing them more visibility. Additionally, as a college student myself, I can say that their early Sunday morning timeslot is valuable air-time since everyone stays out late on Saturday nights. What's wrong with a little late late night (aka, early morning) radio comedy? Leave it alone, let them keep their page and promote their show.--Elysiasegal 04:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Although I don't know how to determine how many people listen to "Morning Sickness with Eric and Harrison," I have seen the radio station ratings for the Chicago area. As shown <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/feder/206348,CST-FIN-feder11.article" class="external text" title="http://www.suntimes.com/business/feder/206348,CST-FIN-feder11.article" rel="nofollow">here</a>, WNUR is not even one of the 30 highest rated stations in the area and has less than an 0.9% share of listenership. Admittedly, the Arbitron ratings cover only 6 a.m. to midnight and thus do not cover the "Morning Sickness" time slot, but there isn't any evidence that this show has a large listenership either. If it were a very popular show, one would think that WNUR would prominently feature it on its web page <a href="http://www.wnur.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wnur.org/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I can't even find any coverage of this show in the college newspaper <a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Keeping this page to allow the show more visibility and to promote the show would violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a> which says that "Wikipedia is not a soapbox or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising." Finally, if we decide to wait until Eric and Harrison attain more fame before giving them an article, that's fine with me; the question is whether they warrant an article now, not whether they will in the future. <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">Consensus can change.</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This debate seems a bit blown out of proportion. But...WNUR is, by both its own wikipedia entry and verifiable sources a popular and respected college radio station throughout the country and other shows on the station have wikis. As to the previous post about arbitron ratings, with all due respect, most people (myself included) don't know jack about how to interpret them. I'm a resident of Chicago who has telecom. experience in both tv and radio and listen to stations torward the bottom of that list--they certainly seem legit to me. See #30 105.9 WCKG. Despite having a %9 share, this station airs Opie and Anthony and the Steve Dahl show, the former being a popular nationally syndicated show and the latter being a perennial top-100 talk show host in the country according to Talkers magazine, the leading industry trade-mag. To be honest, I don't care what happens, there seems to be bias on both sides. I just can't tell the difference between this show and the COUNTLESS other talk shows that have wikis. Let us see the actual ratings. Until then, this is just guess work by people who, unlike myself, do not live in the Chicago market and have no idea of its makeup.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't want this to turn into dispute between the two of us, but, as far as I'm concerned, you originally brought the charge for deletion. I thought the page was worth it, and thought this would be a fair forum to discuss an important issue: a "value judgement" on the legitimacy of a radio program. Instead of sticking with the merits of that discussion you've swerved off into namecalling and malice. I am not a sockpuppet. 2, I don't have access to a "shred of evidence" and I don't know where anyone would get one and I didn't think I needed one for my opinion to be heard. Like I wrote above, I'm relatively new at wikipedia. I think its great how the articles are fluid and represent true "freedom of expression" on the internet you call for a "shred of evidence" . You made the charge on the article. I just can't figure how you can be this closeminded, altough a quick look at the user comments on your page show that this isn't the first time you've pulled this, and it won't be the last 24.12.186.181 12:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Important Comment</b> I was a contributer to the original Morning Sickness wiki. I made my opinion known in an earlier comment on this delation page which has since gotten out of control. Sooooo I challenge all posters to deal with the relavant issue: Essentially this debate boils down to who determines the value of a broadcast vehicle. What I hear up to now is this: 1. Morning Sickness broadcasts on a college radio station and thus is not "notable" 2. Morning Sickness broadcasts during the night and thus is not "notable" Will wikipedia now way that college radio and night radio (both viable forms of comm) are not notable. 3. The Morning Sickness wiki serves as a publicity device. The FACTs are: every wiki for every tv show, movie, radio, show, racehorse, etc. serves as publicity. This is because INFORMATION is publicity. Notice I did not say PROPAGANDA. There is nothing on the Morning Sickness wiki that is an exageration or unencyclopedic. It is verifiable fact. How is it verifiable? By listening to the show. Otherwise, I feel this attempt to delete this page is an unjustified attack on a show that for some reason the Federal Communications Commision thinks is valid even though wiki editors who are not familiar with Chicago radio nor WNUR the station (which does indeed have national notoriety) nor the Morning Sickness program. Once again, I urge all posters to address these issues without giving curt reasons that don't even appear to be thought out. JmpJckFlsh1968 18:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: Notability in the Wikipedia context is (the first line from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>): "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other.

<li>First comment, it is totally unclear for a newbie to figure out how to post a comment. This comment is to be posted as part of the discussion related to the deletion of several Hmong writers. Granted, I am one of the persons concerned. However, reading the reasons why the articles are being considered worthy of deletion, I have to make the following responses: - re: none have a published book: no writer in Bamboo Among the Oaks has published a book yet; even the most awarded ones, namely Ka Vang or Maineng Moua, are still figuring out how to get published as a single writer with a book deal; - if the above is the criterion, no Hmong writers can be listed on wikipedia: that would be to make invisible the emerging Hmong writing community; - I would caution people as to how they evaluate what is achievement for communities that are so new or so challenged: sure, you all can say we are nothing, but we are the pioneers of Hmong American literature and if not us, there is no one else.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Pacyinz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pacyinz_2320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pacyinz">contribs</a>) 07:00, January 29, 2007 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Include</b>After the 31st of January I will have more sources or at least more reliable. I also am trying to get permission of reprint an article from the Richmond Times on John Tomlin in the Flair section. I hope to get a respond from the Richmond Times later today. Also this is not an autobiography, I accidently put the title of the article when I was applying for a screename. This is also not a vanity article, it simply states fact of how John has done and also my opinion as well as Joe Lewis and Erick Easter's. If I recieve reprint from Richmond Times I will also have access to many more facts and information on John than when I wrote this article.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntomlin_c17c.html" title="User:Johntomlin">Johntomlin</a> 21:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found an entire dialouge from an anouncer at the 2006 Virginia Junior Boxing Championship commenting on all of John Tomlin's matches and am currently seeking authorization of reprint form this source as well. Until then I implore that this article not be deleted. Furthermore, as for Encyclopedic format, in case you couldn't tell I am not an experienced writer nor journalists, I give speeches and local news reports for a living, not journalism despite my high school class. If anyone desires to edit the article so that the information is sperated from my opinions and those of Erick Easter and Joe Lewis please feel free to do so, it would be much appreciated.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntomlin_c17c.html" title="User:Johntomlin">Johntomlin</a> 21:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> -I have just added another source from announcer Kevin Wilson on a play by play for John's match against Tim Haushalter in 2005 and am still seeking permission of reprint for the Richmond Time's article by Lawrence Latane III and the play by play for John's round against Sam Greene in 2006. This meets the requirement for resources and verification.

<li>I thought that you had to place your vote every time you commented on this page, Onthiday, my mistake. Also, after reading the Wp:bio page, I was curious if you could include resources or rather verifying sources that you didn't use. I merely listed all the resources I used, though there are plenty more sources that could verify the information in John's biography.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntomlin_c17c.html" title="User:Johntomlin">Johntomlin</a> 20:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah nevermind I have found why this article should be deleted, and I personally agree. John maintains notability for his entry into boxing history for being the youngest competitor ever in a Middlweights division class to win a medal, but he will not national fame for his boxing fame until he earns a gold medal in the Virginia Junior Boxing Championships and moves on to the East Coast division championships, which would in turn break another record. I would like to ask if i can resubmit this article upon it's imminent deletion (so far i'm the only one who voted keep) if or rather when John wins a gold medal and earns national recognition as well as the proper signifigance for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntomlin_c17c.html" title="User:Johntomlin">Johntomlin</a> 21:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As you are responding to my vote, note that the article has been expanded significantly since that time (per CaliforniaAliBaba below).

<li>You may be missing the point because (IMO) it's a really stupid, pointless controversy in the first place. Basically, <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Chengyu.html" title="Chengyu">chengyu</a></i> are traditional phrases which reference old literature (sometimes thousands of years old), poetry, folk sayings, etc., and whose meaning isn't readily apparent unless you know the stories behind them. Hence the need for <i>chengyu</i> dictionaries. People who view dictionaries as <i>prescribing</i> correct usage rather than <i>describing</i> existing usage are thus all up in arms about the official national dictionary being polluted with popular culture that lacks time depth. Or to put it in Wiki terms, they think it's fancruft and want it AfD'd. =) (Unfortunately, the above summary qualifies as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, so I can't put it in the article) ... cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 07:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>, <s>though <b>merge</b> useable content into other articles where appropriate</s>. This article is clearly a fork from <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_California_7ee9.html" title="Culture of California">Culture of California</a>, which is clearly revealed by looking at the edit history of the two articles. This article has no main subject, its connection to the subject stated in the title is tenuous, nor is there a valid reason for forking this article off from the main Culture of California article.

<li>Merger and deletion are mutualy incompatible.

<li><b>Response</b> When or if the article is deleted I will merge informatiion. It just caught me some weeks ago that too much of the information in this article was unneccessary or disorganized I plan this to be a longer article on California culture, but I did not know what exactly to write. All of you are write, alot of ibformation has nothing to do with the title or California culture. Ninety percent of the article is stated in other articles and there's no plot for the article. Some of the information can be merged again, but the article is a mish-mesh of facts, that explains almost nothing or nothing new so this can't be featured. One thing is that some sections in the article I think belong but their are probably other California articles for them. This article pretty much does not belong in wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupershow_7ff9.html" title="User:Supershow">Showmanship is the key</a> 01:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One thing that I find myself doing when I want to reorganize something on the Wikipedia, is that I look for something similar that was done well. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_African-Caribbean_community_6a6f.html" title="British African-Caribbean community">British African-Caribbean community</a> is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured article</a>, and about a third of the article is devoted to "African-Caribbean culture in the United Kingdom".

<li><b>Delete</b> (And this from a hardcore inclusionist.) To me, the article seems a complete pig's breakfast. Take it from public view quickly, before it harms some innocent.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>or if the consensus is not to keep, <i>Merge</i> to an article on the University. The group has been the primary subject of over 20 articles since 1990 in the campus newspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian, per <a href="http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/home/index.cfm?q=%22penn+singers%22&amp;event=displaySearchResults&amp;buttonPushed=1&amp;sa=Search&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/home/index.cfm?q=%22penn+singers%22&amp;event=displaySearchResults&amp;buttonPushed=1&amp;sa=Search&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. The<a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Pennsylvanian_e5fb.html" title="Daily Pennsylvanian">Daily Pennsylvanian</a> is a respected, award winning, independent campus newspaper, published since 1885, with an editorial review board and a policy of edittorial review of stories, which are written by identified reporters. As such, it is not excluded as a reliable source. (See ongoing discussion of campus newspapers at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.) This establishes verification if any of these articles were added to the article, and shows that they are notable at least within their local community, the university, as much as a town arts group would have verification and local attestation of notability with 20 stories in the noncampus town paper or the local TV station. For a campus arts group (there are 45 at Penn, and I certainly do not advocate articles for every one of them) I would like in addition to see 1 or 2 noncampus reliable, independent and verifiable sources showing that they have more than a local notability. the same as if they were off-campus. If they have only local notability, then per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> the key facts in the article could be greatly condensed and included in the University's article. Saying "delete because it's just a bunch of students" completely fails as an argument for deletion, because it's just the "IDONTLIKEIT" argument. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and Ssilvers. Seems to be a student club that is no different and no more notable than any other student club. As for a college club being written up numerous times in the college newspaper, I hardly find that surprising. One would expect the student paper to write about student events. While it may verify the existence of the club, I hardly think it makes the club notable. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Being surprising isn't a requirement for notability. The guidelines for notability don't exclude college publications. Is our intent here to enforce guidelines or merely opinion about who and what we do and don't consider notable?

<li><b>Delete</b> generic amateur company. Arts listings and local newspaper reviews are not non-trivial reliable sources (trust me, I've written them, even for my own choir).

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not agree that a lengthy story about a group or a review of a performance is somehow more inherently trivial, unreliable, or dependent because it is in a campus paper than if it were in a comparable small town paper, or if it were on an online site devoted to TV shows, rock music, videogames, porn, or other subjects of articles in Wikipedia. It is very fair to argue that the reliable, verifiable and independent coverage still does not show that their notability rises to the level of encyclopedic importance to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, but it is not necessary to go the the extent of casting aspersions on or mischaracterizing the source. We have thousands of articles about rock/pop/rap bands which lack even that, and rely on only online coverage and their own websites, and editors seem comfortable keeping those. I just look for the fair treatment of campus papers as a source, howbeit a local one, and a fair judgnment of the notability of campus or community performing arts groups vis a vis teen bands, videogame "athletes," videogame characters, or other entities more appealing to editors of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it is perfectly fair to use high-class, high-circulation campus papers as sources to confirm information. It would even perhaps be fair to use these campus papers as notability-supporters for matters unrelated to the university. What is not acceptable is to use these campus papers as notability-supporters for matters related to the university, for patently obvious reasons. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 20:22, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If Guy "wrote it for my own choir" it was not very independent. There is no evidence that the campus reporters (at least one of whom went on to write for the New York Times) were writing up a choir of which they were a member. I selected articles which did not appear to be reprinted press releases, but independent coverage. A campus paper with an independent editorial board is as about as independent a source for matters on campus as a town newspaper (subject to withdrawal of ad revenue by merchants or to withdrawal of city hall and police dept sources by the Mayor) is for town affairs. I see them exactly as "notability-supporters" for things on a campus, although as I said I like to see non-campus sources to confirm notability as being more than local. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not doubt that Penn Singers is a good student group and that the campus paper and its reporters are pleased to report on its activities, which are fun for the campus and community to watch. But, as Guy says, there are tens of thousands of student and community theatre groups in the English-speaking world, and, while that is a great thing, they should not each have articles in Wikipedia. However, it would be a great idea to add information about the group to the U. of P. article.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Edison. Topic appears to meet the primary notability criterion, which is "subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself."

<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems like a frivolous AFD. The article has three sources, one of which is linked to for easy access, and one of which is a New York Times bestselling book. The book establishes notability (though it may not be the best source for verifiable information on this subject), and the Times article provides verifiability (notwithstanding the personal opinion of some editors on the quality of the Times). All this being said, the article is currently not written from a neutral point of view and needs to be rewritten; it sounds too promotional. The article should have been flagged with a POV tag, not an AFD. Part of the problem is that people affiliated with the company have often engaged in vanity-type whitewashing of the article. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 07:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is difficult to establish notability of entities within the seduction community, as its existence within the World Wide Web <i>is</i> mainly blogs, commercial sites and discussion boards. It is perfectly feasible that entities are notable within their community, but little-known outside. What is more, the youth and nature of the seduction community itself, as well as the aims of its members, mean that there are few independent written publications in the same way that there are for many other such communities.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, there will be ways to measure notability. I will accept that Real Social Dynamics and its founders, Tyler Durden and Papa, are not the direct subject of The Times article cited. However, they are well-known in the seduction community, so I think this debate should have to come to some other criteria for notability in the seduction community. Do not think that I'm trying to change the rules just so that what should be a non-notable article can stay; I believe that the rules do not adequately support as distinct a sub-culture as the seduction community, and that subjects that are notable enough within this sub-culture that they should have a presence here are being knocked aside.</dd>
<dd>My first proposition would be the mention of a person or entity within Neil Strauss' book <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/The_Game%7E_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists_35d6.html" title="The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists">The Game</a></i>. I've not yet read the book myself, but from what I know of it, it appears to be an authoritative work on the English-speaking seduction community. I shall purchase a copy at my first opportunity.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neil Strauss' book is a work of fiction. Some of the characters are "composite characters" and timelines are crunched down to make the book more readable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting. I found the book in the Fiction section. I suppose I'm somewhat skeptical of Strauss' perspective as shortly after releasing his book he proceeded to start a competing business (www.only375.com) charging $3,750 for his DVD set. When I participate in the editing of a wiki, my intentions are to keep it as neutral and accurate as possible. If one business decides to write a slander piece against another, even if in a "legitimate book", it's not really what I'm looking for as far as a base for the article. If this article is to be re-written it should be based on RSD's ideas and philosophies.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't go so far as to call it a work of slander. I believe the critical aspects of them has been dealt by putting it into a seperate sub section called "Criticism". On the flip side, another point to consider is that Mystery wasn't exactly portrayed overly favourably in the book by Neil Strauss. Yet Mystery has done very well from the publishing of the book and they both still remain good friends of each other. Likewise I'd suggest that everybody who was mentioned did better of than if they hadn't been mentioned regardless of if they were portrayed favourably or not. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 03:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have been accused of targeting Turkish oriented articles, that is not true. I am against Turkey-ish propaganda machine -- Unfortunately these articles are fictitious and propagated by some individuals who are in quest for a false identity, by preying on other nations’ historical achievements as theirs – It seems this has become a habit of nationalist myth-making, like Himmler's Tibetan Aryans, French Gauls or King Fuad's Pharaonism; Ataturk’ government first laid claim over Hittite Empire as the ancient Turks, and when Germans point out to him, about their Indo-European race, they laid claim over Macedonians, Sumerians, then Scythians, Parthians, Germans, Etruscans … and now these fictitious entries. Be happy with what you are – what is the point of creating a false identity, when the truth will eventually prevail? The concept of this article is equivalent in creating an article called <b>Los-Angeles -Turkish Language</b>, since immigrant Turks live in Los-Angeles -- The entry therefore is POVs, and politically motivated.

<li>Your statement above carries much more POV and confused notions than what you are blaming the others for, I am sorry to say. "by preying on other nations’ historical achievements as theirs"? Please.. Besides, you seem to be confused with your research as well: Ataturk never said that Hitites were ancient Turks (as "Turks" of Central Asia) - he said that the "Turks" of <i>today</i> are the descendants of all those peoples that have lived in and migrated to Anatolia since the Hitites. <i>In fact,</i> that's perfectly in line with the academic studies.

<dd>No, ataturk.com is not a reliable source pr all the other reasons I already outlined, it's just a fan website of Atatürk as notable and reliable as any other random fan website of a former king or president that could be set up by anyone from anywhere in the world, the website doesn't even have a declared editorial policy or a listed author, let alone an academic expert. It's pretty obvious that ataturk.com is not a reliable source, you seem to just want to argue for the sake of arguing. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 10:16, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm doing this again after trying it last year. I'd sort of given up last year as I thought it might be significant to some characters and was going to improve.

<li><b>Comment</b>. How about deleting every character without an explanation of the significance of their left-handedness, and hence not notable even to the work of fiction itself? As pointed out on the Talk page, it may just happen that the actors themselves are left-handed.

<li><b>Delete</b> for several reasons.

Second, and more important for me, a quick glance reveals that the vast majority of the items listed here are simply anecdotal based upon the fact a left-handed actor happened to be playing the role, not that there is actual point raised that the character is left handed. (A good example being <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Doolittle_1e59.html" title="Dr. Doolittle">Dr. Doolittle</a>; was the character specifically written as a left-handed character? Is there actual reference in dialogue to his left-handedness being an issue?) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 12:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, but comment</b> As it stands, the article appears to be completely unreferenced, which on its own is reason for deletion if that isn't corrected. Assuming references can be found, the list should be limited to characters whose articles make <i>notable</i> mention of the fact they are left handed. In fact, such fictional characters probably do exist; there are cases, I think, where authors intentionally make a character left-handed to make some sort of statement or to provide a physical juxtaposition against right-handed characters. Left-handedness also has a historical stigma that might be referenced by some authors.</li>

I would develop Dugwiki's point: only a few characters are left-handed for some reason related to the plot of the story they appear in; most are left-handed because the actor playing them is left-handed.

<dd>I think we're pretty much in agreement, Sam.

The topic might make a good sub-topic of <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-handed.html" title="Left-handed">Left-handed</a>.

<p>I'm just not sure about the notability of this play and whether it deserves an entry. I've dug around on google and found very little reference to the play (other than the fact it exists) and no further information on it. For this reason, the information given in the article looks like original research and the plot summary is directly copied from the website that is linked to.

<p>From the article, <i>A virtual series is an unproduced series of teleplays, TV scripts, stories, which a screenwriter, or a group of screenwriters, post onto the internet, either as an unauthorized continuation of an ended, existing series, as fanfiction for an existing series which may still be in production, or in some cases, as a completely original creation of the writer(s) that simply hasn't found a network audience.</i> In other words, they are unproduced scripts made by screenwriters, posted onto the internet as fanfiction for a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niche_market.html" title="Niche market">niche market</a>. This article tries to demonstrate the notability of the term, yet fails to provide examples of famous virtual series. The most famous one appears to be Buffy, however the series already have an article at <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_%28fan_films%29.html" title="Buffyverse (fan films)">Buffyverse (fan films)</a>. The article mentions a site that hosts a lot of scripts, but an article about it and related topics was deleted due <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Monster_Zero_Productions_e291.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Monster Zero Productions">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Monster Zero Productions</a>. The article has had a section of "How to do it yourself" since a month ago. I suggest deleting this article due lack of notability. At worst, redirect it to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete and redirect</b> as above, as this really is nothing more than a visual form of fanfic.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There is apparently a distinction between fan fiction and a virtual series (according to the entry anyway) which is that a virtual series can be an entirely original creation.

<p>Is Wikipedia a gig guide now? The encyclopaedic content of this article is: The Cheetah Girls went on tour.

<li><b>Merge</b> the actual information about the tours to the band's main article, recounting the tours the band has done does make a certain amount of sense, I think. Recounting a band's history is something many such articles do. A general "history" section may be preferable, but that's a matter to work out on the article's talk page. <b>Delete</b> the dates /locations for the tour, though, that's not needed.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 16:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a general encyclopedia; it is a de facto collection of specialized encyclopedias (biographical, geographical, historical, music, film, television, etc.) where in each of these areas the articles typically go into far more detail than those in any general encyclopedia would. Referring to music, we already have articles on every album and often every single that recent artists have put out, so this ship has sailed. Concert tours articles are already an established practice on Wikipedia; as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConcert_tours_eacf.html" title="Category:Concert tours">Category:Concert tours</a> shows, there are some 350 of them currently. They describe the notable characteristics of particular tours, in the same manner that album and singles articles do of particular recordings. See <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoo_TV_Tour_9bdd.html" title="Zoo TV Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_Box_Tour_996b.html" title="Music Box Tour">Music Box Tour</a> or <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phish_tours.html" title="Phish tours">Phish tours</a> for some examples. Could the Cheetah Girls tours article be improved? Sure, but that by itself is no reason for deleting it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 17:42, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree with Wastsed Time. I mean, it is encylopedic. And yes, it could be improved, but hey, look at the tag at the top. The artivle is in progress. It was onced merged with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheetah_Girls_%28girl_group%29_39ad.html" title="The Cheetah Girls (girl group)">The Cheetah Girls (girl group)</a> but was then made into its own article, when the first article became to crowded. People may want to know this information, and it needs to stay. <a href="../../../j/t/e/User%7EJtervin_44fd.html" title="User:Jtervin">Jtervin</a> 20:32, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't expect to vote this way until I read the article. It isn't just list of concerts, there is considerable info that is specific to the tour rather being just general Cheetah Girls info. I am very bothered by the complete lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>, but that isn't grounds for deletion as the Cheetah Girls' <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is far beyond doubt. A merger is out of the question given the size of the articles in question. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 08:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The more info the better when it comes to notable musical configurations. The lack of sources is a problem, but not sufficient to delete - otherwise we could just have a bot that excises every article without references (roughly half the encyclopedia). We have hundreds of articles on concert tours. In fact, certain bands, such as the Rolling Stones, have their own cats with multiple articles on their tours. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_Rolling_Stones_tours_6e6e.html" title="Category:The Rolling Stones tours">Category:The Rolling Stones tours</a>. Perhaps the nom was not familiar with our coverage in that area. The nom complains that we lack an article on Status Quo tours since the "mid 19th century". I fail to see the connection with the Cheetah Girls, but my response to that type of argument is: (i) unfortunately our coverage is far from complete. This is an ongoing project; (ii) suggest that someone create a Staus Quo Tour article at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_music_Festivals_and_concerts_f50e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/music/Festivals and concerts">Wikipedia:Requested articles/music/Festivals and concerts</a> (although since the band apparently formed in 1962, it may not be necessary to look much further than the 20th century). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Despite being threatened with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_101_%28Robot%29_ef57.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/101 (Robot)">a previous deletion nomination last year</a> (which failed to reach consensus), most of these articles still have longstanding {{stub}}, {{wikify}}, {{verify}}, {{sources}}, and other cleanup templates. The prospect of any of these articles being updated grows increasingly dim. More seriously, though, none of these meet Wikipedia's principal criterion for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>—namely, multiple, independent published sources; for this reason alone they should be deleted. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 13:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into one article, 20 articles is too many, and that article will probably need a cleanup tag, but i think it can be pulled off. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoorleno_7a6c.html" title="User:Poorleno"><font color="red">→ p00rleno (lvl <i>81</i>) ←</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/o/User_talk%7EPoorleno_74c1.html" title="User talk:Poorleno"><font color="green">ROCKS</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Poorleno_1707.html" title="Special:Contributions/Poorleno"><font color="blue"><sup>C</sup></font></a><a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape"><sub>RS</sub></a> <font color="light blue">13:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>

<li><b>keep</b> on the principle ground that this is the entire section that is trying to be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> as poorly thought out mass nomination. Some of these robots are champions, others are mere also-rans.

<ul>
<li>I would suggest that there is no differing level of notability - none of them are notable. Not one of these contains any proof of the notability of the subject that meets our criteria for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> (multiple, non-trivial independant mentions) or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">►</a></small> 16:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what a given robot accomplished or which championship titles it may hold; if the accomplishments and titles aren't documented in multiple, independent sources, then the robot doesn't meet Wikipedia's notability standards. To all appearances, these robots have no documented existence outside <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Wars_788b.html" title="Robot Wars">Robot Wars</a> itself. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 17:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Three of the robots (Razer, Hypno-Disc and Chaos 2) have had <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Robot-Wars-Razer/dp/B00006BT9T" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Robot-Wars-Razer/dp/B00006BT9T" rel="nofollow">DVDs released</a> about them. That's only a single non-trivial mention, but it's a fairly hefty one. This discussion was a fudge before, it will be a fudge again, with lots of 'Keep some, merge some, delete some' comments. It'll be a nightmare for any admin to close with anything other than 'no consensus'.

<li><b>Keep all</b> and try harder. I don't know the first thing about <i>Robot Wars</i>, but a TV show such as that certainly has plenty of information about it in various publications and it shouldn't be difficult for someone who knows about the subject to fix the problems. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now since at least some of them are notable, although the articles could do a much better job asserting this. Take e.g. one of the better-known and cooler ones, Hypno-Disc: apart from appearing very regularly in the TV series and having apparently a DVD, it is also part of the Robot Wars XBox / Game Boy Advance game<a href="http://cheats.freeola.com/game-boy-advance_i/robot-wars-advanced-destruction_2659.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cheats.freeola.com/game-boy-advance_i/robot-wars-advanced-destruction_2659.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, and a construction (destruction?) toy<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ROBOT-WARS-HYPNO-DISC-ULTIMATE-CONSTRUCTION-KIT_W0QQitemZ200069400905QQihZ010QQcategoryZ65247QQcmdZViewItem" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ROBOT-WARS-HYPNO-DISC-ULTIMATE-CONSTRUCTION-KIT_W0QQitemZ200069400905QQihZ010QQcategoryZ65247QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/robotsrule/merchandise.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/robotsrule/merchandise.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. There has been some media attention as well, but I don't know if the BBC can count as independent in this case <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/features/2002/07/robot.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/features/2002/07/robot.shtml" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Perhaps the Oxford Times is a better choice? <a href="http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2001/2/23/68841.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2001/2/23/68841.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. Now, I doubt that this kind of coverage can be found for <i>all</i> these articles, but since at least some of them are not delete-worthy, and I'mnot going to do this kind of research for all these articles in four days, I think we best keep them all for now, and renominate individual minor robots after a Google seearch (or other means) have shown that for that individual robot, not enough sources are available. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> for the sources to count, there has to be independent media attention to each individual one of them. there is nothing here that a bunch of redirects wouldnt take care of. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:48, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This show has just begun being brodcasted in Sweden and there is definetly some interest being sparked here for the whole project. Seeing that we have a pretty healthy bot-building community here, there is a great chance that someone with enough knowledge will come across an article here and share his or hers knowledge. Since I´ve been involved with many of the robots listed in this deletion section I probably can supply some information, but that seems kind of obsolete if the article is going to be deleted.213.64.140.91 21:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, although I'd be amenable to persuasion otherwise.

<p>"SPURA" (the "Seward Park Urban Renewal Area") - a neologism, not used much in the context of the area it refers to other than by realtors, smacking of advertising and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.

<p>Now Proto is just being naive or mean to me personally. SPURA is not an advertisement, but a bona fide NY City issue (<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EED9123AF933A05752C1A9659C8B63" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EED9123AF933A05752C1A9659C8B63" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD103CF93BA35754C0A966958260" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD103CF93BA35754C0A966958260" rel="nofollow">New York Times again</a>) that is being weighed heavily and debated. There is no gain for any individual here, but a City debate on whether or not the City needs more low income housing, more commercial, more upscale, etc. It has been undeveloped in 35 years, that is nit normal for NYC - so something must be going on here other than your simplistic read.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<p>Entirely non-notable book. Impossible for the article to be NPOV as there are only sources which attack it. There are no impartial reviews of the book.

<li><b>comment</b> The nomination is misguided. There do exist sources that praise it. Character assassination is easily deletable, being irrelevant to the book. "Impartial reviews" are not the prerequisite of encyclopedicity. Verifiable facts about the book exist. The article must not necessarily be an in-depth analysis of the book. It did cause quite a stir, hence notable. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 19:37, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I personally don't know what to make of it really. At the end of the day, it has never been a big book. I just took a look at the notability guidelines for books <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Criteria" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Criteria" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> (note that it is still a policy in development), and I don't see it fitting into any of those criteria, even if we compensated for <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>.
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I was vague in my explanation. There are a number of comments on the book published, clearly satisfying the first criterion. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 21:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the keep voters explained in which way it fits the Wiki notability guidelines, I will vote for <b>keep</b> - but otherwise I think it must be <b>deleted</b>. I am hesitant since keep votes seem to be coming from both Turkish and Armenian editors (I kinda guess the reasons&#160;:)). I am generally pro-content, but the more I check it does seem a bit of a stretch <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:14, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

Also, it is re-published in 2006 (see recent version of the article).

<dd>I guess the Turkish side wishes to keep it because they think that the book is accurate and provides another "aspect" on Armenia and Armenians. I guess the Armenian side wishes to keep it because the book is such an ill-produced, unscholarly vanity-press joke it makes the Turkish side look like muppets. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 21:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had guessed as much&#160;:) Listen people, such an outlook is not cool, really. There is the Wikipedia guidelines on notability, and the only thing we have to decide is if it fits the criteria. I am not familiar with the subject, it can be notable, or not be notable per guidelines. That's why I didn't vote. However, let's not use dry "not-notable", "notable" as arguments. Wikipedia is not a democracy, if the notability is established either way, it can override votes no matter what. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 00:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment: I personally wish it to remain, but I guess my fun is over. The reason why the book was reedited was because it was first published with a very limited number of copy. It is a self-published work, he registered the editor to publish the book(first allegedly of a series he wanted to publish, the second work was supposed to cover about an Armenian active participating in the destruction of the European Jews in WWII), he used the equipment of his Babtist Church community if my memory doesn't fail me, Turkishforum having financed him. The book itself has not a single critic written in any peer-reviewed publication. I trully like the man, not because I suspect he threatned the hoster of the page I had on him and his book, the oage removed as a result, and this soon after I emailed him the link requesting him to report any error on my page. Anyway, if this page has to remain there, I will have to include some relevations about him which I really don't want to.&#160;:) <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC) do.&#160;:)</li>

<dd>Well, that was definitely a 'character asassination'. In any case, notable or not, and to this process's complement, I really can't make if this article serves pro-Armenian or pro-Turkish POV.

<li>I would like to contribute more here but I have to do so many other things, however I have to reply to this. I am a Turk, and why would I want to praise a book whose title is "the secrets of a Christian terrorist state"? I am all for inclusiveness and I can read any thesis as long as it follows the scientific method and is academic in its layout, but the title of any written work says a lot of what we should be expecting before we have even read one page. I am not a historian and I have no idea about the contents of this book, but I would be very hesitant to buy a book whose title is "The Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State", no matter what country it is talking about, let alone say "yeah, that's the stuff". "praises by Turks" is really stretching to the point of stereotyping you know - as I said before the only thing that matters as far as we are concerned is the Wikipedia guidelines on notability for books <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Criteria" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28books%29#Criteria" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, unfortunately I have no time to make research about it however.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't deny that this book is a prime example of anti-Armenianism, but I disagree with keeping it because by doing so we're basically giving a platform for those who espouse hatred against Armenians. In fact, I never even knew that this book existed before this article was created, so why make a big deal out of it now? -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 03:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The book satisfies the primary notability requirement by having multiple mentions in a variety of places. It obviously caused controversy; perhaps that is the reason people want it to go. But covering the topic isn't against Wikipedia's standards; in fact, it is quite in line with the encyclopedia's principles. The article shouldn't be deleted just because some people don't like the book and its views, which appears to be the reasoning behind some of the deletes here. Perhaps a "(book)" sort of mention could be added to the title so people don't freak out when they see a such a POV article title. If there is a problem with gang-like enforcement of a certain POV to the article, this can addressed in ways other than deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 05:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> By the way, for those making the research, a <b>"review"</b> is an <i>in-depth analysis of the book</i> - not just <i>mentions</i> of it.

<li>hmmm, we do have a problem with the inclusion of such work, this is widespread on Wikipedia, unfortunitly the work does pass the test. I have witnessed many similar AfD and indeed it is a problem. You are a intellectual and sure know that in university level professors have for the most part published and that many are cited and reviewed and that an insignificant number have their article here. But Weems work is indeed talked about in Turkish newspapers, by Turkish organisations, the same for Armenians, so according to the guidelines and policies here, it pass the test. I am all for a change. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:02, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> The user dimawik has been putting up wiki pages all over, they all have links to products that IPcores sells. First off, the company is not notable enough to have it's own page. Second, it's products aren't either. Third, they're not the only vendor of crypto hardware. But unless they become notable (re: famous beyond just their own press releases) they don't deserve an entry in wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tomstdenis (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomstdenis_8a1b.html" title="User talk:Tomstdenis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tomstdenis_16ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tomstdenis">contribs</a>) 2007-01-24 16:19:19 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>A lot of his contributions include stub articles with a link to a specific IPCores product. I also work for a hardware firm. Should I place links to are products all over Wikipedia too? No. So if I can't [nor shouldn't] do it, neither should Dimawik.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like just to note that the initiator of the debate Tomstdenis apparently forgot to mention that he works for Elliptic Semiconductor, one of the competitors of IP Cores. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2647" class="external free" title="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2647" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2647</a> <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimawik_9386.html" title="User:Dimawik">Dimawik</a> 19:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So what. The moment you see me putting up vanity pages for my employer you can turn around and AfD them too. This isn't about competition, it's about removing vanity pages and link-spam (hint: ipcores links in AES, GCM, Diskencryption, etc...). Given that I personally set out to have a vanity page about myself (that I did not put up myself) removed, I think I've proven my Wikiobjectivity. Tomstdenis 19:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just thought that an obvious conflict of interest in this case should be visible to the participants of the discussion. My remark would be extraneous if you would have stated the existence of the conflict upfront. And no, I would not argue for taking your company page down. As you might have noticed from my profile, I have added few articles to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimawik_9386.html" title="User:Dimawik">Dimawik</a> 19:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Flamebait</b> My AfD debate has merits regardless of who I work for. An article about my employer would be JUST AS inappropriate (for now I don't speak to possible future events) as an article about IP Cores. The fact that I voted to <b>delete</b> a vanity page about myself should be proof enough that I'm objective. By bringing up a non-existent conflict of interest argument you're just proving that there isn't anything notable about the company worth saving the page over. I suggest you read the Wiki guidelines for notability. Tomstdenis 19:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I am the author of the article) I think that the company is notable. If one looks, for example, into the latest market report issued by the professional publication in the intellectual property field, Design and Reuse (<a href="http://www.us.design-reuse.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.us.design-reuse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.design-reuse.com/</a>), (s)he can find that IP Cores is rated the third company in its specialty (the security cores area). Being third worldwide in one's area of expertise is notable, in my opinion. The interesting detail is that the top spot is occupied by Tomstdenis' employer, Elliptic Semiconductor - so his company is certainly notable. I can volunteer to put up an article about Elliptic, if this will help to resolve the dispute. I cannot link to the report (as most market research, it is actually sold by D&amp;R), but feel free to contact me if you want to verify the ranking facts. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimawik_9386.html" title="User:Dimawik">Dimawik</a> 03:44, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Not Convinced</b> First off, I'm not authorized to speak for my company. I did a google for my company and I found mostly press releases by us and our partner companies. I failed to see any in depth third party reviews of the company that were not part of a commissioned work (e.g. financial survey). I also only found 16,000 hits with Google. While I think my company is doing great things and is a player in our respective field, I have trouble finding the level of notability required to interest the readers of Wikipedia. Our company has not published any academic results, nor been cited in published reports (though we do spend quite a bit of time in algorithm research phases), therefore fails the longevity requirements for notability. By that same token, I think IP Cores is also non-notable. I think you're making the classic mistake of thinking that "non-notable == bad." IP Cores is most likely staffed by very smart people (so is my company), but so are thousands of other hardware design labs. So just because I said IP Cores is not notable (within the context of Wikipedia) doesn't mean I think the company should be shunned or held in contempt. Tomstdenis 11:23, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> Does that mean you support monopoly? Because if a company is new, it might not be notable, and if it is big it is, therefore benefiting the bigger company. Granted the articles shouldn't be just spread over like myspace accounts. but if what the other guy said is true, that the company is third in it's field and has only been around three years compared to your companies six years don't they deserve a chance? i could be wrong, but I'm just pushing out this idea.
<ul>
<li><b>Repeating...</b> Wikipedia is not geocities. It's not a place to list any company, group, person, or thing just because you feel like it. It has to actually be encyclopedic and notable. If IP Cores wants to get attention for themselves they'll have to go about it another way then posting articles about themselves [hint: Look at the name of the CTO of IP Cores and then look at the author of this article]. Suggestions: Go to conferences, give talks, write articles, do interviews in the press, get customers to do writeups, etc. Tomstdenis 22:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> But again i ask if it is a new company mabye they don't have the time to do press interviews, not enough people possibly?
<ul>
<li><b>Repeating ... again...</b> Wikipedia is not geocities. If they're too small/new to be notable that's MORE reason to delete the page, not to keep it. I won't reply again along these lines. See <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> for more information on notability requirements for Wikipedia. Tomstdenis 00:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changing my vote to <s><b>weak keep</b></s>.

<li><b>keep</b> City U Hong Kong is a major univ, ,and he's department chair. IEEE Tran. Polymer Science is a decent journal, and he's ed. in chief. <i>People do not get such positions without impressive lists of publications,</i> so I checked quickly in google scholar and found 366 hits, which normally means at least 150 papers when you sort them out. I found his publication list on the university website. Look at the article to see what I found. I just summarized the numbers, because I havent't the energy to copy and paste all of them and get them lined up properly. Pkchu is apparently a modest man indeed. <b>world expert</b> is probably exactly the right term, but I changed it to what could be objectively documented: <b>internationally known'</b> . Now I shouldn't have had to do this. Someone who knows him should have. But how did he get deleted 2X and almost a 3rd time? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As this is apparently a <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity article</a> created not once but three times in violation of Wikipedia guidelines about creating articles about yourself, this article should be judged by the harshest standards and Chu should be cut absolutely no slack. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 07:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> who may have created the article before or what it may have been like before is irrelevant.. We're looking at it now. We don't have harsh standards and relaxed standards, we have one set of standards that we try to apply fairly to every article. I have reedited it and removed anything that looked like puffery, and if you find any I missed, just remove it. That he is considered N is proven by the honors. The one item of opinion, "internationally known" is established by the multiple visiting positions. The published articles, and patents are RS and V: the list of articles is from his official site, which is a RS for the purpose, and supplemented by Google Scholar, as a 3rd party The patents link to the government site. For an academic to list his publications is not advertising, it is generally a university requirement. I am a little curious just what part you find objectionable? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:03, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Walton, hope you don't mind me repeating what I said at the other school AfD, but it would not be "unfair" to delete this article. Looking at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools_for_deletion_archive</a>, a number of school articles have been deleted due to failure of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

As far as I know there is no consensus that all secondary schools are notable. In Siglap's case, as there is what some might consider a <i>claim</i> to notability (being the first coed secondary school in Singapore) I checked some databases. Nothing non-trivial appears in Lexis-Nexis, Proquest, Infotrac.

I suppose there's no reason to doubt the school's website on that point, but it's not a convincing claim to notability if no reliable source outside of the school have, er, taken note of it. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 02:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> This complex appears to have been the subject of at least 2 non-trivial published works (in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a> newspaper) due to its development controversy. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/28/1083103549668.html?from=moreStories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/28/1083103549668.html?from=moreStories" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941726849.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941726849.html" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>.

<li><i><s>'Delete</s>'</i> - This article provides no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - References provided. They need to be Wikified but that can come later. Remember, Wikipedia is about <i>showing</i> how something is notable and how.

<li>This isn't a correct way to decide if a subject is notable or not. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> states the criteria of notability and this passes that criteria due to it being, as WP:CORP states, "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works." Deleting an article simply because the formality of inserting those published works in the article hasn't happened is a misunderstanding of notability criteria and discounting the extremely valuable discussion in an AfD. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I've framed the article inclusions in terms of controversy about the site and local area.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a> is almost certainly the most famous example of a cheat code in videogame history, to the extent that it's been included in dozens (over thirty are listed on this page) of non-Konami games as the method to unlock a cheat code or <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_egg_%28media%29.html" title="Easter egg (media)">easter egg</a>. A brief description of what the code does in the myriad games that respond to it seems only appropriate for something that's had such a broad impact on gaming. Yes, the current article is lacking sources, but they shouldn't be hard too hard to find, assuming sites like IGN count as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for this subject. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 20:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, of course sources are needed, and simply saying they're out there isn't enough. I didn't have time to hunt for them right then... <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3108751" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3108751" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> has a lot of these listed. More research is needed to find sources for games not listed there, and to verify what the code does for those games where detail isn't provided, of course. Just needing sources isn't a reason for deletion in an article like this, though; it's a reason to tag the article for cleanup and work on it. In my earlier comment I was trying to address the nominator's point, which is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an instruction manual</a> -- to clarify, I don't think this violates that rule. It's not trying to inform the reader on how to play the games, it's listing the games that use the code and its effect in those games as information about the history of the code. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 14:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I created this page so I could remove these codes permanently from the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a> article.

<li>That's a poor argument to use. Just because there are other "less important" lists, that doesn't establish this one's importance (in fact, it implies that -this- article is unimportant too). --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 15:19, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>On second thought, the less important lists do serve as a precedent to justify this list, particularly if those lists have survived an AfD.

<p>There is no such thing as a hybrid-electric bicycle. The article made this clear until some text from the deleted Series Hybrid Cycles was merged in. There is essentially no such thing as a series hybrid cycle, either, outside of the research of Andreas Fuchs, the author of that article, which is why it is deleted. There almost certainly never will be a series hybrid cycle before room temperature superconductivity comes down to consumer prices, because it would be ruinously inefficient. Shaft drives are very low maintenance, cheap, and upwards of 80% efficient and they have still made little headway against the chain because the human body puts out liimted power and efficiency is <i>everything</i> in human powered vehicles.

<dd>As the main contributor to this article being considered for deletion I disagree with all statements above:
<ul>
<li>Whether a "hybrid-electric bicycle" exists is a matter of definition. In the strict sense every electric bicycle which includes pedals is a hybrid. In a wider sense only those using a third source of power would be hybrids, e.g. solar power, wind power or fuel cells. These all exist as prototypes but not to my knowlege as manufactured items.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime I've seen that other editors also regard ordinary electric bicycles as <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">hybrid vehicles</a>, and those with additional input from other energy sources such as solar cells even as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribrid_vehicle.html" title="Tribrid vehicle">tribrid vehicles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 09:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The sentence from the original stub "A hybrid-electric bicycle is a theoretical non-existent bicycle that might allow its rider to build up charge in battery or supercapacitor when going downhill or waiting at a red light, and then add the stored power to his or her immediate power at start or for hill-climbing." is wrong because the prototypes of Andreas Fuchs and collegues do exactly that and they do exist. I've ridden on them myself and they work well. The other French vehicles also exist.</li>
<li>Superconductivity is not an issue here, but whether highly efficient generators - which do exist - can be procured at a price which customers will pay. Currently the best electric technology is about as efficient as a poor mechanical transmission, but the gains lie elsewhere, in particular the high configurability without mechanical means (meaning you can have a tailor-made load curve and don't need to change gears) leading to ideal on-road training devices, and the suitability for larger vehicles, even marine vehicles.</li>
<li>Nothing here is speculation and it is all verifiable in the literature give.</li>
<li>I did not recreate the deleted material but rather included those bits from the deleted "Series hybrid cycles" (about 30%) which I felt were up to Wikipedia standards and also improved the wording. I am a former editor of the publication "Human Power" and a current editor an author at <a href="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ" class="external text" title="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ" rel="nofollow">Human Power eJournal</a> so feel qualified to do this.</li>
<li>I do agree that there is a hodgepodge of articles all revolving around similar topics and several of these should perhaps be merged into a suitable new article. I'm not sure that <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">Motorized bicycles</a> should be the container for all these subjects as it is quite large already. I don't think that Guy's method of going and deleting all these - like recently someone did <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedelec.html" title="Pedelec">Pedelec</a> - is the optimal method. I would be happy to work in a group of us to try to bring order to this unwieldy field.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime I've seen that Wikipedia articles shouldn't be too long: somebody suggested 32kB was OK whereas 72kB was too long. Maybe this would be a criterium to decide whether an article should be split into two different articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I do agree that the name of this article (previous existing stub) isn't all that good, also because often the vehicles involved are actually tricycles or quadricycles.</li>
<li>In a nutshell: I disagree with deleting this article at this moment but might agree with a deletion in the future if we can find a suitable structure for the components in this field which might be too much for <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">Motorized bicycles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 11:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I've since come to the conclusion that the name of this article is poor, as it really should be "Human-electric hybrid bicycle" but this is cumbersome. Also, I saw that <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">Hybrid vehicles</a> already had a section on two-wheeled vehicles saying much the same. Therefore I have expanded this section and now recommend Hybrid-electric_bicycle to be <b>deleted</b> as it is redundant.

<li>So, judging by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a>'s comments, it's not talking about a hybrid <i>bicycle</i> but a gas-electric hybrid <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">Moped</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Human-battery powered bicycle conversions are for sale today, so the article covers an efficient transport mode. The article is clearly of encyclopedic notability, and has sources, so keep it. I am considering purchasing a human-battery powered bike, at <a href="http://www.electric-bikes.com/cruizers.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.electric-bikes.com/cruizers.htm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>.

<li>We really should be looking at this in a wider context. I've started a user subpage <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_Coordination_of_alternative_vehicle_articles_4497.html" title="User:Theosch/Coordination of alternative vehicle articles">User:Theosch/Coordination_of_alternative_vehicle_articles</a> in order to attempt this. Feel free to go there and contribute. However for <i>this</i> article, I'll <b>comment</b> on the new responses below the "new notice line". Hybrid-electric bicycle is about <b>parallel</b> hybrids <i>and</i> <b>series</b> hybrids. The former includes almost every manufactured moped, electric bicycle, pedelec, powerbike, power-assisted cycle, electric power-assisted tricycle and quadricycle and so on. Except for the relatively few multitrack vehicles, these are all <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and this article is in turn in the category hybrid vehicles. But because they are so widespread, nobody thinks of these vehicles as hybrids and so it is OK to have them in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a>. However <b>series</b> hybrid bicycles, tricycles, quadricycles and even marine vehicles exist only as prototypes built by a handful of researchers and hobbyists. They are all electric and most have more than two wheels. Therefore they don't fit very well in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a> and also not in Hybrid-electric bicycle. I think that <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicles.html" title="Hybrid vehicles">hybrid vehicles</a> is presently the best place for this information and it is there already. Therefore Hybrid-electric bicycle should be deleted, but not for the reasons most people here have given, but because it is redundant and because the name doesn't fit the content properly. Therefore I would ask Edison to reconsider his "keep" request and let us delete this article, even if for the wrong reasons (the info is verifiably sourced and notable), and move on to help out in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycles.html" title="Motorized bicycles">motorized bicycles</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheosch_1778.html" title="User:Theosch">Theosch</a> 16:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The other article (<a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_Stamina_6e95.html" title="MC Stamina">MC Stamina</a>) has been floting around since 2003.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as long as the list is restricted to games made/sold under the Tetris brand (so games like Columns, Dr. Mario and so on should not be eligible). Could use a little tidying to remove spammy links to ten-a-penny online Tetris clones and tangential information like easter eggs and other cruftiness, but otherwise pretty useful as lists go. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 20:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: As lists go, this one is neither better nor worse. It is usefull information, but probably too large to be merged into the <i>Tetris</i> article.

As Matticus said, if this is limited to games released officially related to Tetris, then it could become definitive and useful.

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetris.html" title="Tetris">Tetris</a>, depending on article length after cleanup. There is already a "Variations" section in Tetris detailing differences between variants, so I don't understand why there is a "Tetris variants" section as well. There do exist notable unofficial variants such as <a href="../../../t/e/t/TetriNET_05da.html" title="TetriNET">TetriNET</a> that should be included. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 23:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article resulted from everybody plugging their own version in the main <i>Tetris</i> article. People still plug their version on that page though. I believe the best solution would be to shave it down to the most interesting and important games (like the Game Boy <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetris_%28Game_Boy%29_25bc.html" title="Tetris (Game Boy)">version</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Tetris%7E_The_Grand_Master_3549.html" title="Tetris: The Grand Master">TGM</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Tetris_4375.html" title="The New Tetris">The New Tetris</a>; then merge that into a concise section within the main page with an external link to a <a href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Game" class="external text" title="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Game" rel="nofollow">full list</a>. Then, supplement that with only the absolute most notable fan interpretations like Bedter and Quinn, both of which had a run-in with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tetris_Company_348c.html" title="The Tetris Company">TTC</a>. 68.222.23.140 01:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no benefit is copying a long directory of TV repeaters out of an FCC database to make a Wikipedia article.

You're correct that there's no particularly compelling reason for this to have its own article separately from the existing article on the television station proper — but it's perfectly legitimate content to have <i>in</i> the television station's <i>main</i> article. I've already expressed my opinion on the talk page that this should be <b>merged</b> rather than deleted. I don't mean to suggest that my opinion should be prioritized over anyone else's, but <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages</a> <i>does</i> indicate that a merge proposal should be left open for at least <b>two weeks</b>, and I only just flagged this <b>five days ago</b>. Therefore, I would request that this AFD be <b>suspended</b> until January 31 so that the merge debate can run its proper procedural course.

<li>I put the merge tag back.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Thank you, <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a>, for bringing this to my attention. I am the author of all of these lists, so I will provide my defense. It has been customary to include a list of translators in each television article; however, the Salt Lake City television market is unique in that their primary stations have anywhere from 50 - 120 translator stations, as opposed to fewer than 25 translators in any other market. When I initially began adding the translators, it quickly became clear that the list was too unwieldy for inclusion in one article. I sought the advice of fellow members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Television_Stations_c595.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Television Stations">WikiProject Television Stations</a> and was advised that the best way to do this would be as a separate list that the main article would reference. I believe that it is appropriate to keep the list of translators, as is the custom for TV articles, and it is appropriate to keep it as a subarticle, as it was never meant to be a standalone article, but rather an adjunct to the main article. The data is authoritative, having come from the <a href="http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101129393&amp;formid=303&amp;fac_num=68889" class="external text" title="http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101129393&amp;formid=303&amp;fac_num=68889" rel="nofollow">FCC</a>, but is not in an easily referenced source in its original form. Also, while <a href="../../../k/t/v/KTVX_64a9.html" title="KTVX">KTVX</a> doesn't provide a list of translators on its website, the other stations do. The FCC data is self-reported, but it is not advertising; it is instead a mandatory report as part of their license renewal application. I welcome input on how to better present this information, but firmly believe that the information is relevant and notable, but too bulky for inclusion in the main article. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 05:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Also, I will not have access to an Internet connection for the next couple of days and so, will not be available to respond to questions, so although AfDs are generally resolved after five days, I request a couple of additional days so that I can answer questions before any action is taken in this matter.

<li><b>Comment</b> dhett has expressed difficulty in reaching the internet for the next couple of days, so we should wait, but here are my thoughts right now. <b>1.</b> Even if the data are kept, they should be trimmed to a format like <i>City, State (callsign)</i>, since the channel number is the same as that in the callsign, with the text linking to the corresponding FCC page. <b>2.</b> I still don't see why we can't just mention a few of the more notable translators -- if a store has only a couple of locations, then we would list all the locations, but if it has over 100, then no one would argue we should keep them all. <b>3.</b> If other stations' websites list their translators, then we should simply link to that. If they don't, see point 2 (someone could also set up a webpage or publish the info somehow). <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 15:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the rampant spirit of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, I second Bearcat's suggestion to <b>suspend AfD for at least 5 days</b>.

<ul>
<li>We have most if not all of the facts available, which are not much different from how they appeared before the nomination, and it's not clear that this discussion is going anywhere anyway. I thus would like this deletion process to take its course. We can always <i>extend</i> a discussion. I also believe the merge discussion can take place simultaneously. I just want everyone to contribute their thoughts, because before this deletion discussion no one was saying much at all, as evident in that merge discussion. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 01:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It should also be noted that one centralized deletion nomination is a better place to discuss this issue than having various separate merge discussions. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 04:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...which is why I left notes on all of the pages directing them to the centralized merge discussion that was already in progress. It's not clear to me whether this violates wikipedia policy or not, and I think discussion will be served if we remove the pressure of imminent deletion, especially since the primary contributing editor will have limited access the next few days. I would like to keep the deletion option open, but if no other editors agree, I'll have to vote keep to cement the fact that there is no consensus. Let's try a good faith effort at consensus first, eh? <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 22:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Cool Hand Luke, I've said more than once that this discussion should be extended. I'm not trying to rush this through, only saying that it's attracted more posts than the merge discussion, which had three participants I think. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 22:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There was a pageful of commentary on the notice before you nominated it (which, by the way, was before anyone thought to ask the original contributer about it). I don't mind the nomination, but in light of the good faith and effort that <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">User:Dhett</a> put into properly presenting this info (by asking the relevant wikiproject)—data which is <i>always</i> included for other stations as a matter of policy—I think that the only decent response is to ask for this nomination to be withdrawn.

<li><b>Keep with Clean-up</b>. I'd be happy to assist with the clean-up. I believe this list is useful; someone who was looking for this information should be able to find it, without having to query endlessly at a government database. People often cite <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for these types of lists, but my own encyclopedia at home (World Book) contains many lists, albeit not specifically for lists of translators. I'm not sure why there's a need to link to each query, and I think the tables can be reduced (or at least prettified by removing the ALLCAPS). Many Wikipedia TV station articles have information on translators, as this was a compromise between those who wanted no mention of translators and those who wanted full articles on each translator. In the case of Utah station translators, this information becomes huge because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tvmarkets.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tvmarkets.gif" rel="nofollow">Utah has only one market and is a rather large state</a>.

<dd>Given Dhett's source of this information, it would take an unusual view of original research to conclude that this page violates WP:OR. The fact that it's hard for a novice to navigate fcc queries shows that this tabulated data is quite useful. I don't want to dump 100 translators into all the Salt Lake TV station articles, but this information merits inclusion. The only question remaining is how to go about formatting it. The original subpage scheme seemed like a good compromise, but I think policy strongly frowns on it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 21:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I estimate that the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah_81c5.html" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> television market consists of around 2.5 million people, 2.3 million in Utah alone. Of those, only approximately 1.5 million live within range of the primary stations' broadcast signal. That means that the stations' translator network serves around a million people, or 40% of the market. That is hardly trivial. The stations' websites don't mention their history either; does that make the stations' history trivial also? No, translator information is relevant and encyclopedic; I think our challenge here is to find a better way to present it.

<dd>It is my understanding of WikiSource that this material would be quite inappropriate there, as Wikisource is dedicated to "exist to archive the free artistic and intellectual works created throughout history, and to present these publications in a faithful wiki version so that anyone may contribute added value to the collection." As these lists are neither artistic nor an "intellectual work" in most senses of the phrase, I don't think this material would last long there. Commons is supposed to be a repository of media files.

<li>That's not exactly a true statement. The translators are appropriate in the station article, as they are in almost all other articles for stations with translators. The only reason these translators are in a separate subarticle is due to the size of the list - putting the translator list in the separate subarticle keeps the main article readable and of a manageable size. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 09:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> <a href="../../../k/b/y/Talk%7EKBYU-TV_bd94.html#Merge_notice" title="Talk:KBYU-TV">KBYU</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/e/Talk%7EKUED_627a.html#Merge_notice" title="Talk:KUED">KUED</a> provide the lists on their websites. Both are PBS member stations. What should we do we those? <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 15:48, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Other stations' pages have translator info available, thpugh usually on the same page as the article itself. The reason why the Utah stations have separate pages for translators is that there are so many translators on the air within the Salt Lake market -- which consists of all of Utah, plus portions of Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona and Idaho. If they're placed on the same page, the article gers too big and cluttered. Therefore, I'm for keeping them as they are now. -- azumanga 06:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- I'm back; was away longer than I'd expected to be. Naturally, I strongly disagree with comments that TV translator information is not encyclopedic. This is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">not a paper encyclopedia</a> so there is no reason why the articles shouldn't include translators, as they are relevant. I also contend that <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a>'s <a href="../../../c/v/s/CVS_Corporation_ccff.html" title="CVS Corporation">CVS Corporation</a> analogy is not relevant here; television stations are not the same as drugstore chain (or any other corporate) franchises, as each station must be specifically licensed by the federal government and that no change can be made to any station without that change being specifically authorized and licensed. Also, these are not simply lists of locations; each station listed contains a link to the FCC website, which has further information about that translator, including its broadcast coverage area. None of the translators is any more important than the other, so listing only a handful is not feasable either. I do however appreciate Xiner's thoughtfulness in listing his ideas on how the article should be treated. His first idea, removing all information except city, state and calls could work using multiple columns in the article, thereby reducing the size of the information. As soon as I have opportunity, I will try that in my own user space. I believe it will be a reasonable compromise, and allow the lists to be merged back into the main article without making the main article unreadable. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 08:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, you should be able to fit a few translators in one row that way. As for FCC approval, CVS stores would have to abide by local zoning laws and acquire consumer agency licenses...I still don't think it's a big deal, but like I said, I think this will end up a discussion about how to merge the stuff. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 17:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I have created a KTVX proof of concept article in my user space, putting into effect a suggestion by <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">User:Xiner</a>. This should allow all translators to be listed in the main article without making it unreadable or too large for dial-up connections. It should also be an effective compromise that will resolve both this AfD and the <a href="../../../k/t/v/Talk%7EKTVX_56ae.html#Merge_notice" title="Talk:KTVX">KTVX merge notice</a>.

<li>Compressing the data into a table doesn't actually help the page's size for download over dialup. In fact, the table html makes it bigger. It does help prevent the article from getting overwhelemed though, so I like it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 17:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The comparison was actually between the example and just merging the existing table into the main article, not between the example and the main article without the translator info, but thanks for the feedback. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> (<a href="../../../d/h/e/User_talk%7EDhett_a653.html" title="User talk:Dhett">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dhett_b65e.html" title="Special:Contributions/dhett">contribs</a>) 22:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know, but rearranging the table doesn't save bandwidth. If you view source on the independant article, the table consumes about 26k, so dumping it into the article would add that much for those who care (really not a terrible amount anyway). The version you've arranged on your user space (<i>prior</i> to adding links, mind you) is 20k. Making the table wider and shorter won't save much bandwidth. Most of the savings if from abbreviating the verbose links. I wish I didn't say anything though, because your table is great—it won't overwhelm the article. I think download time is not an issue. It adds about two second to the article on dialup. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 03:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> (see further down) I've found one review for one of the trilogy on Gamespot <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/chickeninvadersthenextwave/review.html?sid=6158734" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/chickeninvadersthenextwave/review.html?sid=6158734" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>, though nothing else is forthcoming.

One thing - the first game of the trilogy is free for download on the dev's website, which of course results in a lot of scatter-shot advertising on google - why wouldn't every linkfarm link to 'PHREE GAMES!!'.

<dd>Whilst I'm satisfied that this passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> now, with respect the article isn't well designed and will need substantial rewriting and collapsing into prose. That's for the future though. Please don't use the V-wotsit review though, all text is "The software publisher's description" and the opinions of a few users who click a button is neither reviewing or reliable info. Its presence detracts-from rather than improves the article.

<p>The result was delete.</p>
<p>While there was some lack of serious deabet, the nomination called into question the notability of the subject, which is a matter of sources and interpretation of those sources. Only two have been provided, which under <b>any</b> circumstances would only satisfy the most stretched-thin definition of "multiple."</p>
<p>Consideration of these sources shows that even this very-low baseline is not satisfied:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Times article can easily be read as demonstrating the <i>lack</i> of importance of the awards: They are mentioned in a "plucked from the air" manner and the critic refutes most of the awards. This is also one of over <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=Critic%27s+Notebook&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=Critic%27s+Notebook&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" rel="nofollow">four thousand</a> such "Critic's Notebook" entires. It's firmly established that items are not "non-trivial" merely by virtue of being in the times.</li>
<li>The "Attack of the Show" episode is arguably a stronger source than the times article, but again it's a minor item in a minor show: They ran five-ish times a week at that stage, and this is only a minor episode in a minor show.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it's clear there is vocal <i>support</i> for the inclusion of the web awards, the article was not well served by the perfunctory manner in which this debate was carried out. When it's "so obvious" that something is notable that stating so (and re-stating so) is the method of argumentation rather than than providing solid evidence, it's worth looking again at the assumptions being made.</p>
<p>There have not been made sufficient refutation to the claim that this is not notable (by providing multiple non-trivial sources).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you change the google search to WCCA webcomics, you find roughly 40,000 google hits relating to the award. The problem is that it's usually abbreviated to WCCA, but WCCA is also an abbreviation for many other things; google hits are next to useless in measuring the awards notability. That said, just about anybody involved with webcomics knows that the WCCA is notable. I'm searching for print media links establishing this now. Also, if you don't consider the Web Cartoonist Choic Awards to be notable, then what DO you consider to be a notable webcomic award?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.138.44.220_b19d.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.138.44.220">129.138.44.220</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.138.44.220.html" title="User talk:129.138.44.220">talk</a>) 01:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<ul>
<li>Do you have a link to the Ontario article? In conjunction with the NYT article, I would say that establishes notability. Given the extremely credible and notable reference in the NY Times, that sounds like a good reason for inclusion. As for your other complaints... How on EARTH can you claim <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>? It's very neutral, with the possible exception of the controversy section. And, in my opinion, the controversy section maintains a neutral tone as well. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> isn't a problem, here; it doesn't make any interpretations in the main section, merely reporting the facts (thus fulfilling the stringent guidelines of primary source work). The controversy section probably constitutes original research, but when it's a subsection of an article, the procedure is to rewrite, not erase. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is fulfilled; it links to the main site as a primary source, and merely reports the facts, making no interpretations. Again, if the controversy section is the problem, rewrite, don't delete. As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, what more do you want? Once we include a link to the two news articles, that verifies both the contents of the page, and the notability of the page. To mention one other item as an aside, this award is currently being used to establish the notability of a large number of webcomics on this site. This is because the award is well-respected. A simple search of the webcomic community will reveal that just about everyone who deals with webcomics as a hobby pays attention to it, if only to gripe that it isn't fair. While I realize that this doesn't do much for this debate, it does indicate that it is notable; something with this much attention must have attracted more print sources then a pair of newspaper articles. I found a large number of podcasts referencing the WCCA; is there a policy that would allow those as sources? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.138.44.202_0901.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.138.44.202">129.138.44.202</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.138.44.202.html" title="User talk:129.138.44.202">talk</a>) 05:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>The Record article only briefly mentioned the award in a profile of a local artist. It's not an article about the award by any stretch. Here on EARTH, my NPOV concerns stem from an article based on things like "Controversy over the procedure" " Common claims" "the awards are said" "It has therefore been argued" etc with no sources. Clearly these arguments and controversies involve somebody's point of view, but they don't seem to be points of view based on reputable sources. What do these arguments and controversies represent? Disagreements on a message board somewhere? Wikipedia is not the place for such things. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I had rewritten the article to remove the uncited controversy section, but the article has since been reverted. That said, the answer to fixing the NPOV concerns, not deleting the article, especially since it is only applicable to a subsection, not the article as a whole. Sorry for the WI:CIVIL violation, I'm just somewhat shocked that this is up for deletion.</li>

<li>Well, it is an award for something that is exclusively online... The only people who would care about it all have internet access, and read about it from internet sources that have reported the results. I really can't imagine it being printed in an offline source, in the same way that I can't imagine ANY webcomic award being printed in an offline source. That said, I'm also a bit surprised that there are only two offline mentions of it. Then again, I guess two are all that are needed under Wikipedia guidelines.129.138.44.202 03:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)girl from before

<li><b>Author response</b>
<ol>
<li>Tags were removed only when re-write was major or totally re-done in other words it was deemed a new document by the author. No trouble re-tagging after major edits but when edits are of such a magnitude a re assessment is in order.</li>
<li>Recently tags were added without explanation on the discussion page. At times those responsible for the tags have done so without any comment- this may be vandalism but I am not an expert.</li>
<li>Comments placed in the discussion area have not been sufficiently in depth to enable the author to make corrections. A reference to a very complex reference page is not helpful. When a tag is added imho the editor should be responsible for defining the problem completely and citing that portion of the reference page that applies.</li>
<li>This article is in no way self promotion. That is to say a factual statement that someone did something, made something etc....has nothing to do with promotion of that individual. In the case of promotion aspect one would have to see some form of promotion- that is ...I did this so you should hire me. Statement of fact or opinion identified as such is not promotion it is history and notable as history.</li>
<li>The author has provided extensive citations of formal as well as informal, local as well as national and international references to demonstrate notability. These are written by others and include researched feature news articles, Chapters in Books, Entries in books,Television documentaries, citations of national awards. Description of the role of the works described in relation to the development of national and local art scenes and art history.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Essentially the article is a material description of notable fact devoid of self promotion and backed up by significent, in depth and accurate citations. Note that Wikipedia only objects to a high level of self promotion and that autobiographical content is not banned simply discouraged. I have provided citations from Wikipedia pages to support these statements on the page discussion page.
<p>While I appreciate constructive critique, the essence is "Constructive" I am fortunate to have been working closely with at least one editor who has tried to come close to being constructive. I thank all for their generous donation of time and effort. Conrad Jay Blade 02:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that you are not making money off of this article does not automatically mean it is free of self-promotion.

<li><i>Not at all correct. I am not seeking recognition and fame. I am seeking but to recognize the recognition provided by third parties-not myself. This is a big difference. I present only the actions of others- to select me for inclusion in non-trivial as well as other works. Actually creating a wiki page will open me up to critical review by many parties. Quite the opposite of self promotion. Volunteering to put the article up makes it a free forum for the factual discussion of all sides of my work so I am actually creating more of an opportunity for criticism than for self promotion. Actually to be technical this article is intended to be more about material artworks and that which was written about them by others not myself but it has gotten bogged down with response to tags and critique.</i>-Conrad Jay Blade 00:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also want to add that you're defining "self-promotion" a little too narrowly, Cbladey. Although something may simply be a "statement of fact," it still remains that you are here writing your own article to preserve your information that no one else has yet felt the need to preserve. You're "promoting yourself and your works" even if you don't stand to gain any tangible benefit. There are other ways to preserve the information other than writing on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not the place to do that if it hasn't yet been recorded. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 13:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If I have written poorly in the article I can make further corrrections but the article is for the most part the writing of others, recorded elsewhere, from many sources both trivial and non trivial-now that has been accomplished and is clearly the stated goal I welcome any advice as to how to present it more convincingly and still have it read tolerably- that is not just a list of quotes and sources.</p>
<p>I could just include the words of others which seems an option but it would not be as readable. Again most of the information will be images and facts about the cars- no commentary but have not had time for that yet. I believe that the sources are speaking for themselves. I do not need to self promote<i>-Conrad Jay Blade</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Objective history is present and notable-I am giving it to you and allowing you to share it for the future and preserve it when I am no longer here-it just so happens that I alone possess much of the information-still history. Shall we loose it because I am the sole possessor of it? Even if I qualify the type of information I am providing and refrain from self promotion? I do not need self promotion! Just look at the sources....and there are more....far more exposure than anyone needs. The needs of history are however important. I have many many web pages covering this and other topics.
<p>History is in the article and will be in the artwork descriptions when I get the time from all this discussion to accomplish it. The point is that if there are problems other than formatting present I can not see them as major or damaging to the conveyance of fact. Nothing is provided other than fact or qualified fact. One must acknowledge that many many facts are based on qualification such as "to the best of my knowledge" The question is will the reader be miss led? References are indeed provided if the reader wishes to get closer to absolutes. Academic practice which is widespread and universal is to deal with facts by the way they are presented. In essence very few facts are absolutes when you really look at it. Third party sources are not always the best the fact is that the first news report of my work came out several years after I had first begun my first artwork.</p>
<p>Facts are as close as the recorder of the fact can come. "as far as I can tell" may be as close as one can ever get-but it is better than nothing and is qualified. I am trying to be very adaptable to the process here at Wikipedia-I respect it. I could easily be more devious and find someone who knows nothing about the subject to write as I dictate. I would never do this. I find it problematic that when a primary source comes forward to record significant notable history (I have provided many back up sources for this) that they are discounted and discouraged from providing the facts without embelishment or self promotion. IMHO there should perhaps be a process for vetting primary sources. Maybe we should submit a copy of drivers license or copy of an image from a book or newspaper- see...thats me doing that on whatever date...and you could compare that with the ID. I welcome anyone to run around the end of all this,legally, and re-write the short piece. To date the comments have added up to much more than a correction would be. I thank user Leebo86 for his hard work and dedication. Others have been more hostile than helpful. Tolerance of new users is the key to success. Wikipedia is relativly easy to use and there are many conventions to master but helping new users collect and preserve information is a great reward. Conrad Jay Blade 03:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

However, its clearly a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> which is one of my particular peeves. Based on some of the talk page comments I have read by the author "I am a visionary artist", it is pure vanity and shameless self-promotion. I can only conclude that pending a complete re-write by a neutral party, the article is not something that I can endorse. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 06:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I find it very strange that with a good number of sources listed on the page for the issue of noteriety as well as for other purposes there is a complaint about this issue-there are lots of souces cited and enough to comply with the noteriety definition. Additionally remember that writing an article about one's self is discouraged it is not banned- it may be hard to do but it is still permitted. At this time the language used is "discouraged". In this case you can not tell me that it can not done you can only tell me that errors have been made, point them out and provide me with the way to correct them. Empty critique attempting to ban something that is merely "discouraged" can only be perceived from this point of view as personal attack. WhatI need to see here is a specifc problem and this is how to fix it. I mean specific problems. I see one way to improve the article is to not simply list sources that editors seem not to have the courtesy of looking up but to cite brief statements from them. I shall do that. Then I will have the words of others and from the type of sources which fulfill the noteriety definition. One problem is with video. I have one article based on a script but that is all. Two videos I have on tape. I suppose I could transcribe short exerpts and include them. That will take a while so I shall concentrate on citations from books and news article studies.Hope this helps. Now....if there is objection to a legal article pinpoint mistakes specifically and I will address them. Note. Due to the wording it is very clear that I do not have to have a third party do it. Note that I have already responded to the vanity charges and made corrections. If you are to provide critique be sure that it is based on the way the article looks at the time of writing. Writing about something that has clearly been addressed and changed may be perceived as less than constructive critique. Conrad Jay Blade 14:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or at best, <b>Userfication</b> into Cbladey. The author has not clearly established notability.
<p>This quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ten years ago, Conrad Bladey's '78 yellow Dodge Omni needed a new transmission. He didn't have the cash, so he just let it sit for a while in front of his house. When some kids defaced the car with an Andover High School sticker, Bladey didn't let it bother him. Instead he put a couple of bumper stickers of his own on it. By the time Bladey got the transmission fixed, about a year later, the car was covered in stickers. "Sticker Car" was his first art car. Now, after transforming three more cars into artistic expressions, Bladey is known as a car artist-Source:"Cars With Attitude Gear Up for First Night. "Nicole M. Miller. The Washington Post. Washington, D.C.: Dec 28, 2000. p. C.01</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Only establishes that Bladey is a car artist, not that he is one of any particular distinction. Speaking as someone who has been featured along with their art car in the newspaper on a couple occasions, newspaper articles do not automatically prove notability. Particularly when the article in question is about an event in general (in this case a First Night celebration), and the person in question is mentioned in, apparently, one paragraph of it.
<p>As for this quote:</p>

<li>I own a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Cars-Artists-Obsession-Craft/dp/1579903304/sr=8-1/qid=1169739754/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0934594-8700153?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Cars-Artists-Obsession-Craft/dp/1579903304/sr=8-1/qid=1169739754/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0934594-8700153?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">the book</a> referenced here. It is 144 pages long, and consists mainly of two-page spreads featuring artcars of distinction (as determined by the author). These articles have one or more large photos of the artcars, descriptions of the vehicle and artist and other relevant information. I believe (do not have the book in front of me) that Mr. Bladey's car is mentioned once in the book, in the line quoted above. If his vehicles were notable as he asserts, would they not get a full layout and writeup in the book, rather than one passing mention as an example of a surface texture? Furthermore, the mentioning of this book under the <i>in depth study</i> of the page is grossly misleading. A one line mention is far from an in depth study.
<p>The <i>Articles Referring to Local Significance</i> section does not in any way make clear how these articles note the local significance of his vehicles. Several of them are clearly about a general event rather than his vehicles in particular. As for the others, mention in a newspaper <i>may</i> mean the subject is of particular importance, however it does not guarantee such.</p>

<dd><i>This collection of artcars also represents the largest known number of artcars created by a single artist in Baltimore, and for Baltimore, Maryland the Hutman "School" or "Studio" represents a part of historical development of the Baltimore Art Scene as it has in-fact operated for a period of time in the region of Baltimore for at least 20 years when the first artcar produced "Sticker" was begun.(source:personal communication of fact from the Artist)</i></dd>

</li>
<li>This statement is a perfect example of the gross flaws throughout this article. It contains a falsely reasoned statement of importance(see #1 below), incredibly convoluted and confusing grammar, and an invalid source (personal conversation).
<p>#1: Ignoring the potential for a quantity vs. quality debate, being the largest producer of an artcar in the Baltimore area is not inherently notable. As is fairly clear in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_car.html" title="Art car">Art_car</a> article, artcar artists are rare, and as such in most areas there are only a few. I personally have produced at least three artcars, and have plans for a fourth, This may well make me tone of the most prolific artcar creators in Connecticut, that does not however make me notable as I would guess the total number of artcar artists in CT as being in the dozens.</p>
<p>These reasons, along with the lack of any authors aside from the autobiographical one, the need for a massive re-write for both wikification and basic coherency, the author's repeated deleting of tags all make, to me, a strong case for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprobcat_0177.html" title="User:Improbcat">Improbcat</a> (<a href="../../../i/m/p/User_talk%7EImprobcat_5c45.html" title="User talk:Improbcat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Improbcat_fc7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Improbcat">contribs</a>) 2007-01-25 16:23:06 (UTC)</small><a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprobcat_0177.html" title="User:Improbcat">Improbcat</a> 20:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am an artcar artist (I can not say so myself I have used local news media sources which should accomplish this with out being guilty of self reporting)</li>
<li>My work (all of the cars) has been recognized as "Art Cars" by a jurried major respectable municipal event over many years. As well as a juried national event where I have appeared with three of the cars. (again I cited local media of trusted respectable sources)</li>
<li>I am part of the history of the art scene in Baltimore and to date a major player. If in an area one person has done more than others that is information of significence. Not any reflection on quality but I have evidenced my participation in the art scene and as such part of its history and until someone does more than I I currently hold a position of significance in that history etc....My work is part of the history of the art car in Baltimore and this is sourced.
<p>Essentially editors have asked me to prove my existence as artist, as creators of works acknowledged as art cars and having a particular standing in the art car world which is not "ordinary" I had to do so using the reporting and documentation of others. It has been accomplished. Moving on.</p>
</li>
<li>When work is included in major respectable publications that is a degree of notability. There is a differnce in magnitude between those who are not selected to be included in important and reputable publications as examples (Blank) or as focus for chapters (Lake) and those who are not. If one is included in such works one has a certain level of notability.
<p>I cite the following notable inclusions and documentaries and feature (these are not news articles) ] Notable Sources Illustrating the Significance of Hutman Artcars Locally and Nationally [edit] In-Depth Studies "The Passions of Conrad Jay Bladey" Carl Schoettler; The Sun; Sep 6, 2003; 1.D; A detailed study of the work of Conrad Bladey in the area of Artcars "Conrad Bladey", "Hometown Portraits."

<p>Once again there are artists and then there are artists who multiple times have been included in what one might call upper level or significant or researched documentaries. This inclusion changes the status of the individual.</p>
<p>Then I can go on to national recognition. There are people who take part in national events and then there are people who win prizes in those events. There is a notability difference. Winning first prize in one's category-Daily Driver in what is acknowledged to be the most important event for art cars in the world Houston Art Car Parade-a juried event. and one who simply has an artcar or several.</p>
<p>The editor above has not utilized all of the sources which appear in the article. It is important to do so. The local articles establish my existence and role as a part of the history of artcars in Baltimore- for example the distinction of the first person to have designed and created 5 artcars if you will....not concerned about the national importance of this but it is none the less a milestone in history....not looking at significance here as much as the fact that I am a player of note at least now in the history of the art scene in baltimore.....</p>
<p>The several documentaries, selection for coverage in important books of note, and national and worldwide distribution of these (see voice of america) indicate notability which has been bestowed upon me by important writers. Again this is much more notable than someone who has just created an artcar or several. I would believe that these authors and documentary filmers did not create their work at random. Selection for these is a sign of notability.</p>
<p>For example of all the art car artists in the country few were selected to be featured and researched for an episode of Monster Nation-cable television series on the Learning Channel. I was selected. The research was in depth and production took place over a month with research and filming. The production covered all my artworks, studio. I have traveled out of state to places I have never been.....people recongnize my notability and come up to me and mention my inclusion on the program.....</p>
<p>If the total number of citations is considered I believe I have overcome criticism. As for writing and style that is being worked out as soon as possible and will be complete certainly when the major criticisms are dealt with and those tags removed.</p>
<p>That the artcar world is small is immaterial. There remain important artists of varying degrees and unimportant artists. Wikipedia determines this based upon inclusion in important, selective works of note. Sorry that some do not consider me as important as others-that happens with all communities and I don't aim to please anyone. However I can cite the proper sources required and have done so adequately. Not after vanity or self promotion. I have been very much factual in this very short article. I state facts, back them with citation. I am only promoting the preservation of history which is notable. Conrad Jay Blade 19:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Carthedral won first place at Houston and doesn't have a wiki article. Holy Mercatoyd won first place for the same category you did - daily driver - and doesn't have a wiki article. In fact about 8 cars a year get first place in some category or other and don't have wiki articles. You AGREED with me on the artcars page that we can't include every car that has won a prize because there would be HUNDREDS. Harrod Blank CREATED the book you're citing as your source and doesn't have a wiki article. What makes you more special than all of them? Also, I would disagree that Houston is <i>the most important event for art cars in the world</i> - it happens to be the BIGGEST but that doesn't make it most important. It's also one of the few that happens to offer prizes - ArtCarFest doesn't, Artscape doesn't.<a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 19:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a>'s perspective on this from another art car hobbyist is important. I don't know a thing about art cars (nor had ever heard of them before this article), so it's hard for me to argue notability within the field. The more and more we get into this, the less and less it feels as though notability has actually been established. At the very least, Cbladey's efforts would be better spent writing articles about <i>other</i> notable art car people and events, rather than himself. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 20:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<i>The fact that other important cars do not have articles is immaterial. Both of those cars are notable beyond a doubt. The fact that they dont have articles is that the artists or others have not taken the time to write them. (I can see why as it is a lot of trouble, time and effort). On the Art Car page one is dealing with a representative sample of a whole. I stated that a rotation of featured cars would be best.</i>
<p>Harrod is worthy of a page but it would be hard to write it himself and he has not been documented much more than I have. A few more articles but of the same type and if you dont like the notable publications written about me you won't accept the publications written about Harrod....more of them perhaps he as as notable as a president and I am only as notable as a congressman for example... but I am certainly more notable than either of the ordinary cartists taking part in this debate. Far more articles about me, far more documentaries far more worthy books.And a much longer time in the field....So what is the answer....I think it is to consult the wiki instructions in regard to notability. I shall paste them here soon and we can check them off.</p>
<p>Ok I will qualify- houston is the biggest event in the world not my favorite either. My favorite event is when I pull in to the I 95 rest stop in laurel. However it is probably either equal to artcar fest or more important but importantly they have a serious juried show which is important (I know of no other serious juried shows as in juried shows in the art world with experts and rules) .</p>
<p>Independent decision I thought that is what the wiki system wanted to see. I have also won prizes and been selected for honoraria (which were limited to a few-one year an early one I was the only one selected out of a large field at artscape to receive the only one...) in other competitions. The point is what constitutes notability? At least I have put my record out in an objective way independent of my own voice. The wiki rules should be able to overcome diverse opinion.</p>
<p>Specifically was I mentioned in the type of sources mentioned in the wiki guidelines independent of myself (non-trivial) simple...It does not matter if you like one artist or another it matters what has been written about them of what type of source.</p>
<p>While editors of an artcar background are interesting it is important that concerns about deletion be addressed by a broader audience as artcar artists both of whom writing here I know are far from any unbiased sources. I respect and appreciate their time and effort however, we have had differences in the past that I fear are getting in the way of an objective consideration of the sources which I have used to back up my claims of notability which are material facts.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Perhaps it will be helpful to document how, in the Art Car World notability is obtained.(as best as I can tell) Unlike many Genres of art which have many dedicated academic joiurnals devoted to them and a long established series of tests which artists have to undergo to obtain notability the artcar world is a recent development. Therefore we do not yet have journals or a large range of scholarly writing available. The artcar world does however have milestones of a sort that can be used to rank individual artists and their works. Even though we are a new genre there are ways that noteriety can be assessed. As with any other genre some artists are ordinary while others are notable while still others are the most notable. Wikipedia does not deny notability to all but the most notable (example being congressmen are notable presidents and world leaders may be most notable-both are included...)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
So what do we have in the artcar world with which to measure notability-
<p>1. Has the artist created an art car (admission to the process)</p>
<p>2. Has the artist been recognized by juried shows and awarded prizes (this is a convention in other genres whereby a jury is selected to review an entry in a competition and prizes or admission to an event are awarded based upon this independent jury)</p>
<p>3. Has the artist become part of the Local Art Car Scene in an important way-do they hold or have they held for a period of time records- for example have they created more artworks than others and maintained that position over time- have they brought more art works to competition, have they been written about more in he local media. The ordinary artcar artist would be at one end the notable one would be at the other.</p>
<p>4. Has the artist received awards from a major rather than minor local juried events. There are a wide range of art car events. Among those which give prizes the Houston event for example would serve as an example of a National event whereas Artscape in Baltimore although sometimes cars from outside the region attend is primairly a regional event. A notable artist would be one who has won recognition Honoraria, admission to juried events of both types. I suppose if one wants to get picky one could google artscape in baltimore and the houston event and determine which has the most entries but it is most likely that the Houston event is the largest juried show.....</p>
<p>5. Has the artist been selected to be the subject of documentaries or television programs. While one could determine that selection for inclusion as the focus of documentaries may be a random act I doubt that those producing these would agree. If an artist has never been selected for such coveraege I would say that they were not as notable as one that has consistantly been selected over time by several. Of the artists that have been selected for inclusion in documentaries and television programs of a non news nature some will be ordinary in that they are selected once or twice and not consistantly over time, and some will have been only been selected for local documentaries. These would be more ordinary than the notable artist who has been selected for local national and international broadcast.</p>
<p>6. Moving to Books. There are books which are casual and there are books which attempt to be selective. Selection for inclusion in books could be a random process but I believe that if you ask authors they would disagree. I would maintain that those not selected for inclusion were ordinary where those who were included were more notable. If an author wishes for example to illustrate art car surface treatment it is generally assumed by the reader that the example selected pleases the author more than others even though this is not stated it is implied by the inclusion. No one can really tell but when an artwork is published it has a quality ok maybe only slightly elevated from the ordinary. It is none the less a part of notability.</p>
<p>Other books are defined as works capturing the significant. That is an author studies the city and finds things that are notable. The book has this as its purpose. Monuments, Houses, landmarks and in one case an artcar or several. These could be included randomly but not when the purpose of the book is to capture the notable. An artwork appearing in such a book is more notable therefore than one that was not included.</p>
<p>Notability in books is also defined by the length of the entry. Weird maryland is a book surveying the entire state of maryland. They wanted to include an artcar or two. In their attempt to single out notable places, landmarks and individuals they selected one artist rather than another. The ordinary artist not included the notable artist has been included. Of course one could insist that this process of editing is random I think not.</p>
<p>I hope this survey of notabilitiy in the artcar world will help editors to assess the relative notability of my work. The notability threshold is important. I do not believe that one has to be the "most notable" to be included. One simply has to be "notable".</p>
<p>Another important point is that one article or one entry does not make one notable. Notability is the sum of many parts in many dimensions. Yes the inclusion of one photo is only slightly notable but added with all the other aspects of notability it assists with making the case. Some achievements are more notable than others but all notable achievements should be considered.</p>
<p>If one is judged not notable one must know what is lacking from the case for notability. The question to be asked is what hasn't been achieved.</p>
<p>The artcar world is a bit more difficult to work with because we are not yet covered by a large corpus of academic work and writing. This does not mean that there are not ways to judge the relative notability of an artcar art work or artist.(note I do not wish to assert that there is anything wrong with ordinary art car artists.

<li><b>Comment regarding notability criteria</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wikipedia discusses notability as follows:"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. This requirement ensures that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic."</i>
<dl>
<dd>It should be quite clear that I have provided "multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject". In addition I have included other sources but if you read the direct citations you will find that I have met the standard.See my discussion of the means to obtain notability in the Art Car Community should you believe the sources are trivial.

<dd>OK let's take a look at these multiple non-trivial sources. You've got a passing mention in a book by harrod (fails non-trivial), you've got a passing mention on monster nation (fails non-trivial), a passing mention in the washington post (fails non-trivial) and about 8 mentions in the baltimore sun (can't be counted as separate sources). What's left that potentially counts as non-trivial and independant? Weird Maryland and the Voice of America video. I don't think that counts as "multiple". And none of the sources are things we can actually check on (sorry, no, I don't think it's reasonable to expect us to fly to baltimore to look up newspaper archives)! Not that ALL of your sources are required to be readable online but it would be nice if at least a FEW were. I do a google search for your name and the first couple of pages of results are all your webpages and blogs and other things you wrote on message boards (or pages that compile links that link back to your pages). If I actually do a search for "Hutman ArtCars" there's even less. Why are you SO DESPARATE for fame? You keep asking for specific suggestions - here's a specific suggestion: wait until someone else decides you're notable and writes an article about you. That would solve all of your problems. Meanwhile try to edit things on wikipedia that you don't have a conflict of interest when writing about to try to get a feel for the place. You picked about the most difficult way possible to jump in. You're right that there are a lot of rules and guidelines and it can be a lot to absorb - if you do it while writing about a subject you have less emotional involvement in it will be easier. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 17:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could also add in the participation in juried shows, exhibition of my work at the American Visionary Art Museum (I think July 1998-9)......winning local and national honoraria and awards.....</p>
<p>I also wish to point out that Wikipedia does have a Good Faith Rule. This editor- Plymouths has made several statements re. fame etc. which indicate that there may be an absence of good faith.<i>Conrad Jay Blade 13:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><i>Try this thought. Fame is being written about in an article. Notability is being chosen to be included in a work-documentary,feature article, television story even a photo to represent something.....I have described the monster nation piece. It is not passing mention. It is a chapter in a program as in a book. When you look at television scripts these are chapters or segments. It is a whole mini documentary. A tour of all the cars, of the studio, interviews with me, family others.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Voice of America Piece- I dont think anyone would doubt that the VOA is not a trivial source. The VOA produces news stories- brief pieces. The piece cited is not a news item. The Editor/writer looked around and decided what to write about. He made a selection. He chose me.</p>
<p>(VOA is just one of several media outlets that did this- you see there are more than one who out of the available field selected me....) This is also a mini documentary. Two days of interviews, background research and all about my work.</p>
<p>News articles are of two types- basic reporting which I cite for information and feature articles written as "Studies" in my case a study of an artist and his work which I also cite for the purpose of notability. The paper asks who of all the possible people out there shall we take the time to do an in depth reporting on- this involves research, interviews, vetting, as well as writing. Not a passing reference.</p>
<p>I have been selected for in-depth articles- this goes beyond trivial mention or simple news coverage.....now one can assume that inclusion in books etc. is a totally random practice. I dont think this is the case. I believe inclusion in in depth pieces- non trivial sources- involves assessment of the significance of the subject and a reflection on notability. I may not be the Most notable but I am confident that I am not the most ordinary. Hard to figure out when one gets notable I have just used the Wikipedia sources to determine that-looks like it sould work. I would appreciate taking beter care with the sources I cite. I believe that all I have to do is cite them-I have gone further than needed by providing brief exerpts from them. It is the readers job to find the sources and consult them.</p>
<p>I provide a breakdown on the article concerning the nature of sources and why they are included. You can tell which are used to demonstrate notability. The VOA article is linked to the article. (yes I am working on format but articles are evolving things) The Baltimore Sun has an archive on line, I save money by accessing it via my local library branch. If you cant get to a Maryland library branch try a college library.</p>
<p>Wierd maryland is in bookstores at least around here....(actually a very good book I can not count the number of people who have seen me in the book and told me all about it...)Again though about weird maryland like it or not they had the potential to include any other maryland artist and they picked me, dont think it was random. (just for information the Weird NJ book has a section like the one they did for me on Hoop- another notable art car artist.)</p>
<p>Fame? Couldnt care less. But things accumulate. One ask? "could it be that I am notable?" lets see....why not. Right now I am cutting back on travel and festivals. I have been to so many. I get a large number of parade requests now and have to trim that back. I am content with the notability that exists- When I get out of a plane to attend the Houston festival dozens of people come up to me and know who I am and I have never met them, every day someone comes up to me and tells me that they saw me on Monster Nation (seems to have been re-run lately), The association with AVAM is amazing. Many come up to me and tell me hey you are in the AVAM (visionary art car museum which I have distanced myself from years ago) The public response and on such a high level is what counts in the area of fame.....but really at its foundation the therapy created via the artcar creation process is the most helpful. I dont care how people respond - one way or the other making a response happen is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Why did I pick the hardest way to write? Because it is there! Why do I keep at it- because I want to be famous....no....it is because I want to win or at least make my best case!</p>
<p>Remember- Wikipedia does not ban self written pieces they just "strongly discourage" this means either someone tells me how to correct the article in specific terms and I will do so. Or that no one has ever done this before and I am a trail blazer and shall do the best that I can.</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments, always helpful. There are many art car artists who qualify as notable. I believe I have cited multiple non trivial in depth reporting. Some have more multiples than other others are more notable than others. The threshold is crossed when "multiple" exists. Isn't that more than one? I believe art cars should be more represented on Wikipedia. I believe that the artists themselves can make the case for notable and write in such a way that they themselves are not speaking but that the cited facts and sources are speaking for them. I am trying hard to do this and if I have not overcome myself show me how specifically. <i>Conrad Jay Blade 18:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>No, there are not MANY notable artcar artists going by the wikipedia definition of notability. Being notable within the artcar community (i.e. known by lots of your fellow artists) is not the same as notability in the general sense. I would say that there are an exceedingly SMALL number of notable artcars and artists - and most of them are people who are notable for other reasons and ALSO happened to build an artcar or several - <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, for example, made artcars but is notable for his groundbreaking art in other forms, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrod_Blank_4d00.html" title="Harrod Blank">Harrod Blank</a> is notable for his documentary work (to which his artcars are related but are not the main source of notability) (Harrod is on my short list of things to create articles on when I have time). As you said above <i>"The artcar world is a bit more difficult to work with because we are not yet covered by a large corpus of academic work and writing."</i> - you know what that means? It means that artcars have only just made it into the category of notability as an <b>entire genre</b> and as such individual artists and individual vehicles (or collections of vehicles) within that genre are by definition less notable. Why don't you take a breather and go give some input on the <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_art.html" title="Folk art">folk art</a> article? You said elsewhere that's something you wanted to contribute on. You have experience and knowledge on the topic, NOBODY is going to dispute the notability of it, and the article itself is tagged with needing input from an expert. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 23:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>I do not dispute that others are more notable than I nor that others are notable for other things-that does not matter. Lots of things I may be more notable for rather than artcars but...the task is demonstrating according to Wikipedia rules that I am notable, my work is notable. One does this by citing the work of others, non-trivial sources and more than one. Now either I have done this or I have not. Documentaries and books are not trivial sources and I have appeared in a good number of them by invitation- selected for coverage. Do not confuse these sources with others which may be trivial and are included to be complete. I did not say artcar artists have not had notable coverage because it exists I just said that artcar artists have not had as much as is available in other fields but it is quite clear that documentaries have been made, serious studies created, books written so that now artcar artist are obtaining enough notability. Again- some are always more notable than others. You dont have to be the greatest you just have to deomonstrate you have crossed a defined threshold.</i>-Conrad Jay Blade 00:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

So why not just remove the stuff that relates to you, Cbladey, and leave only the info on the cars. What they are and what they look like should be enough. It seems like you're trying to write this massive article about yourself when there's really only a little bit to say. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 00:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>actually the article is not that massive. The intent indeed is to focus on the artworks. I categorized the article today as: artworks-artcars.

It would read more like a resume but I would clearly be totally out of it-one solution it would work for me.

<li>Remember <i>that this is only part of the article. It is only the part that provides background for the artworks/introduction. There appears to only be this way for me to compose it otherwise people object to my voice. I think as a backgrounder for the cars and their descriptions it should work. Readers are not misslead and through independent notable sources they can get an idea of how the art work came to be. If it is terse and uninteresting well....perhaps someone else can provide in an independent voice transitions that reflect on the meaning of the citations. At some point my work becomes significant in the local community....at some point nationally...at some point more notable....Yes! somenone anyone, can put in the words that I as author, and artist can not voice due to restrictions. That is the wonder of an evolving document. This is just a start. Once this is clear of tags (I have to do one spell check in the morning but that one should go...soon) I can add in the meat of the article which will also be only materially described. In my situation I must count on the community to flesh it out. But...I have eliminated so much.....ego, personal gain etc.....However the sources are now documented as demanded and it is evident that many of them are not trivial and that the not trivial are several....the only thing missing are the awards via national and local jurried shows which will be in the material description of each car. So....for now a bit dry and terse but with community involvement it can evolve and once the tags are gone I will invest more time in adding the cars and their particular information and leave that for the community to flesh out too. Hope all this work helps, but I want to act on all constructive critique for which I am thankful.</i>-Conrad Jay Blade 04:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<i>The Purpose of this article is to describe the cars. The section will contain exactly this:</i>

<p>4. Evolution of the art from start to present</p>

<p>6. Citations of the car specifically.</p>
<p>7. Vision of the car-that which it is supposed to project</p>
<p>As the article evolves it is hoped that independent critique of all kinds can be added in a critique or review section. At the present time there are problems with the introduction to the article which need to be resolved. Constructive criticism or editing of the article will be greatly appreciated.

<p>Well congratulations - you've managed to turn the code for this page into such a mess that I can't find the proper place to reply. Anyway, in regards to your statement that I am not assuming good faith because I said you have an ego I have only this to say - creating a page about yourself is inherently an ego-driven act, no matter what you put in it. Your repeated arguments here and in other talk pages are only further evidence of said ego. Besides - good faith and ego aren't mutually exclusive - you honestly believe you're worthy of inclusion here. The problem comes in when you've got half a dozen authors disagreeing with that and you're not respecting their conclusions. At this point it's up to the admins to sort out (and any other authors that might like to weigh in).

<p><i>I appreciate all criticism and take it in good faith</i></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that although testimony from within the artcar community may be helful it may also be less than helpful
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Two critics who have written here: Plymouths and Improbcat are both artcar artists who I have encountered on several ocasions in a variety of forums. While I must take their critique in good faith I suggest that as artcar artists they may or may not have a conflict of interest derived from the nature of the artcar community as one with competing philosophies and points of view if not one also with competing artists and artworks. I do not wish to state that conflicts are present but it is a possible downside when evaluating fellow artists. Often conflicts are revealed via tone in writing and statements focused on the individual rather than upon the subject matter being discussed. I draw you attention also to the length of time a writer has been a member of the community which somewhere in wikipedia is discussed in relation to discussions concerning deletion.Again I value all constructive critique and as you have seen I have spent a considerable time addressing specifics involved. I note also that it is clearly evident that some of the crtics have voiced opinons and made statements that they have not taken the time to read the article fully nor look up sources. Another concern is that often critique has taken the form of generalized blanket statements rather than specics. It is one thing to point out a problem but another to describe the problem in such a way that the critique can be constructive. It is also not helpful to be pointed to wikipedia's volumes of help material or even a major section of it. With pages of help it is hard to pinpoint the one line or two that is of concern. I wonder about critcs who seem not to be specific in a constructive sense. I am greatly appreciative of all of the assistance prvided here.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some progress has been made on the article, with regard to the readability and the tone. It appears to take a more encyclopedic view on the cars, featuring facts on the cars and images. The autobiographical sections have been greatly reduced. The sections below are still a bit heavy on quotes, but this is more of a writing concern than a deletion concern.

<li>Thanks for the comment. Notability is spelled out by Wikipedia. There are plenty of Non-Trivial sources, completely cited in the article for you to read and evaluate. Wikipedia contains several references to Art Car and The Houston Art Car Parade and Outsider and Visionary Art-must be a valid topic! As for autobiography well the article is about my artworks and unless you know something more than I -they can not yet write. I have not provided anything more than the material facts and anything about me has been written by others and I would remove that if not for the other issues such as notability. I suppose I can remove all of the quotes leaving only citations but then it would be even harder for folks in your position to read them but that is a possibility.</li>

You were concerned with the Visionary Artist Claim (actualy the term is a bit messy....I started out a visionary but you see when someone calls you an artist and then you slip and call your work art some day it is all over and then once you drive from your house and park in an event you are no longer an outsider....These days I am more an Artist Visionary and an insider outsider-so maybe I need folks to call me those and I will be on to a new reality). If you havent noticed it is no longer there. There is nothing there about me that has been written by me! One of the sources uses the word. Did you know that it is a fact that self written articles are not banned in Wikipedia! That's right. They are just "strongly discouraged". That makes the problem not if but how should the article be written. Any concrete, constructive recommendations would be highly constructive for this debate.

<li>thanks for the positive response. Notability takes a lot of thought. There are lots of articles on wikipedia which are not about truly the most notable people or things. Recently to link my article to related individuals- a local author <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rodricks_f666.html" title="Dan Rodricks">Dan Rodricks</a> who has written about me in the Baltimore sun and even helped with and narated the channel 2 article about me has an article that is not in "trouble". Dan is a local writer who is employed by a newspaper and radio station. He has written this and that, columns and articles and did a television show, edited a book. Dan is known locally - most if not all of his contributions have been local but he in his field is not one of the most Nationally Significant Journalists of our time- far from it. Yet his article is there. He possesses a degree of notability but it is not defined at the national or international level. It seems it is defined within his own business. I guess-since the article is not in trouble that the level of significance within the field of journalism is significant enough.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Sort of like in football. Teams are just teams- ordinary teams. What makes a sports team important enough to have an article? How is notability awarded in the field of sports? It is awarded by the number of steps on the ladder (in pro football) one has accomplished out of the number possible. I would say that 50% is winning whatever it is that is beneath the play offs. (Notability need not be 100%-back to the congressman and president distinctions) It only need to be on or over the threshold. A first down is a first down on the line and does not have to be yards over the line. Notability need not be a superbowl winner or even a play off winner.</i>Conrad Jay Blade 17:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The question it seems is that some think that art car artists (a relativly new art form) is not important or useful enough for inclusion generally.(what is useful? Certainly a student wanting to research Artcars would find the inclusion of a profile of an artists work and examples of it useful?) How would one determine if art car artists were worthy? In the art world the highest level of reflection of importance is the dedicated museum- The fine art museum, the modern art museum. For us in the art car world we have the Houston Art Car Museum and to a certain extent the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Visionary_Art_Museum_b8f7.html" title="American Visionary Art Museum">American Visionary Art Museum</a>. A few others. So I guess art car is a significant art category judged important. So I guess if you are at the top of the game being in a museum is the Superbowl. (my artwork was invited to be exhibited (outside of artscape) at specific events sponsored by AVAM and placed on display in the courtyard (fourth of july temporary exibit) I have been written about in their Tabloid exhibition guide for a major exhibit) But I get ahead of myself.</p>
<p>In the artcar world what are the steps to the top? (sort of like elections in politics- there is the nomination process, the primairies the general election the innaguaration.....) I have described what we have in our world to mark notability- making a car, being recognized and included in an exhibit with artcar criteria, winning a jurried artcar event, being selected and included in non trivial publications and video documentaries, being included in exhibits (invited by galleries etc...) Having artwork included in Galleries (in the artcar world the exhibition space is so small that this is truly an honor....)</p>
<p>As I have discussed the point is getting half way or more. So where am I in this? -made <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artcar.html" title="Artcar">artcar</a>- Yes (actually a high level of achievement here I have made the most in the area) -Admitted by application to artcar events with artcar criteria?- Yes many of them,local,regional,national -Winning a juried show?-Yes <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Show_976a.html" title="Orange Show">Orange Show</a> not third,or second but first prize in the category that my car is. (remember one does not have to get the top prize of the entire event just a major one!) -Being selected and being exhibited for exhibition by a museum or Gallery and or being selected to be written about by the gallery- yes! I was requested to place my car on display within the property of the museum for a temporary exhibit and was referred to (validated) by inclusion in a tabloid guide published by the AVAM on the topic of artcars (refered to as "the" Baltimore Art Car Guy (a bit over the top as there were others but they knew there were others so I guess its their call... -Inclusion in non-trivial publications- Yes. A good number. Books, Videos etc....</p>
<p>Now where am I in relation to the first down. Well I think I am over the line which is all that matters. In terms of being the most notable I may be on the way- edging into the museum area which is perhaps the top but not there yet. So I guess I have won a few playoffs but am in line for the superbowl.</p>
<p>One of the questions to ask is what more can be done in the specific artcar field to reach the notable threshold-on or over the line? I think I have done most everyting and to the above add in being commissioned by non trivial organizations to create artworks, teach workshops, create cars with students in workshops and classes, I even was selected by a local college to offer a college course (did not run but they listed the class which is a judgement of my qualifiations to teach it...) There is a lot on the scale. Can't think of much more to add. Thanks for being patient with my evolving thought but this is a "trailblazing" sort of issue. At some point this discussion is necessary- other artcar artists are out there becoming notable every day and significant work should be recorded here at some point.

<li>it is noted that after the re-write tags were added. Very vague reasons were given not indicating what needs to be fixed. It seems that some believe that Wikipedia bans articles written by the subject. It is very very clear that the words used are "strongly discouraged" if therefore a type of article is legal, not banned then it can exist and if it has problems they can be corrected. I will gladly make any corrections needed to fix this legal article. If the tags are placed in good faith the editor placing the tags should indicate with some degree of specificity what corrections should be made. They dont have to but if the goal is progress and improvement that would be most helpful. I don't mind the tags but I have a feeling that those adding them do not seek improvement of the article nor assistance. Again I am glad to have assistance and will do what I can to fix things. It is hard to improve things if all people are saying is that something (legal) should not exist. I invite others to fix the article- I have even done this on the page itself. It is a short article. Let us just fix it and move on or else leave it aloneConrad Jay Blade 18:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody here has stated that autobiographical articles are banned - if they were your article would ALREADY be gone. Instead you get a 5-day review process that gives you a chance to convince people that your article is worthy of keeping. As you quoted about 5 times here - it is "strongly discouraged".

<p><i>:To assume good faith is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia. In allowing anyone to edit, we must assume that most people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it. If this weren't true, a project like Wikipedia would be doomed from the beginning. When you can reasonably assume that a mistake someone made was a well-intentioned attempt to further the goals of the project, correct it without criticizing"</i> Ok....I have been told that something is difficult, hard work essentially I have been " discouraged" <i>it is abundantly clear that I can do what I am doing legally</i> It is abundantly clear that I have heard the discouragement and am going to continue. <i>your instruction then from Wikipedia is:"assume that most people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it"</i> <i>that person is me</i> The only problem is therefore that you sense that there are mistakes <i>Wikipidia then says: "correct it without criticizing"</i> So....if you have a problem what is it specifically, since the article is legal the only thing it can have wrong is problems. Find the problem, find the solution and either fix it or tell me and I will fix it.

<li>I get the feeling from the wording "strongly discouraged" that it's only not banned because that would require actual identification (and that it <i>can</i> theoretically work). I've <i>never</i> heard of one that was actually brought up to standard and existed on its own with only the subject writing it. I think some editors might see it the same way as if someone ran by proclaiming that they were going to run from New York to California without taking a break. It's theoretically possible, but just about everyone is going to tell you not to try it, and they're not going to point out ways you could improve your running form, because that's not the main concern. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 19:39, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I am acting in good faith- <i>trying to help it not hurt it</i>. It is my point of view that finding a solution will assist more numbers of important and meaningful articles for inclusion added more efficiently. If information is real and documented who cares how it gets here. Why kill messengers if there are no lies, overstatements, or legal violations.

<p><i>yes! but Wikipedia is not interesting in your personal reaction. You may discourage but if the page is legal....you are pretty much commanded to "correct it without criticizing" These are two different things. Discourage and correct. The question is not if a legal artical should come or go but since it is legal- how can it be corrected?</i> As in take this sentence and write it this way not that way. Punctuate or format like this. I try to make sure I address recommendations promptly as best as I can.

<li>continued replacement of the quotefarm tag reflects at this point the presence of critique for critque's sake. Clearly removal of any of the four quotes on this page would not benefit the article but harm it. Quotes are the product of the independent parties-the authors. The length of the quote can not be adjusted by the author of this article as the quote is that of the independent party-length is out of the control of the author of the article (proper critique would simply helpfully find a way for the author to trim the quotes down limiting them while still making the point) . There is no better way of conveying history than through independent voices from reputable sources. Stating that a quote farm exists is not an attempt to help the page but to bring it down simply because something about the page content or author is disliked by the editor. Again it is so easy to make constructive criticizm that this editor has become suspect.Conrad Jay Blade 22:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Since the subject of "truth" has been brought up by the author I felt obliged to put in a comment. WRT sources, I'm increasingly skepitical of the quality and objectivity of the sources listed and how they are being categorized by the author. In addition to originally overstating the extent of coverage in "Weird Maryland" it appears that the author's description of "In-depth Television Documentary" is overly generous as well. So far I have been unable to find any sort of documentation confirming that the author was the subject of an In-depth Television Documentary in either Monster Nation or VOA. In particular, Monster Nation as a series does not appear anywhere on the Discovery Channel website. I spent some time trying to find references to it and it appears to have been a mini-series (or possibly a series of specials from the Monster Garage series) in which each episode featured <i>several</i> notable vehicles of different types. Within a one hour show (with commercials) you're probably looking at 3-5 minutes per segment and that seems to be a far cry from an "In-depth Television Documentary". It is also worth pointing out the that link provided by the author wrt Monster Nation seems to be for a site that is asking people to volunteer to participate in the project which would seem to be a blatant form of self-promotion. Given that a television series should be the easiest thing to verify, this makes me seriously question the nature and quality of the other sources cited. This skepticism is further increased since the author's response to a question about his sources was "find a library and check the on line archives" which seems to make the task of verifying and working with his sources needlessly difficult (and it places the responsability for producing the sources on an editor's shoulders not the author's, contrary to Wikipedia's guidelines).</p>
<p>I think that the author is probably notable and/or noteworthy, but I have serious doubts if his notability meets the Wikipedia standards. In the last several days, I've made a concerted effort to find references to either Mr Bladey or his vehicles online and ALL of the sources I've come across seem to be either directly created by him, or purely promotional (and even references that he's included in the article use quotes from Mr Bladey where he claims to be a "Visionary Artist"). I also took a look at existing articles for automobile figures (e.g. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Foose_f854.html" title="Chip Foose">Chip Foose</a>), and did searches for them online and I found a great many sources and independent references to the people and/or their work. If Mr Bladey was as notable as he seems to believe, I would expect to see some chatter from discussion groups, forums, etc... indicating that people were talking about him or his work and that just doesn't seem to be the case. Given the amount of time he's spent defending his article I find it odd that he hasn't thought to produce some of the articles he's mentioned (not for inclusion, just so that other editors can look at them and perhaps find other information to include). It seems odd that there haven't been all that many references to factual details of the vehicles and/or their creation, maintenance, current status etc... Even after numerous edits, each auto's section seems more like a sales brochure than an encyclopedia entry. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonvpm_36b7.html" title="User:Dragonvpm">Dragonvpm</a> 07:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alejandro Zamora cannot be deleted from Wikipedia for the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He born to be a musician. He is a new age musician now, he does have composed and recorded several albums on his country, and he does have a website on the Internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, he meets several of the criterias for inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Has won or placed in a major music competition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre.</dd>

<p>Please do not remove the deletion notice from the article. See Wikipedia:Guide to deletion as per the notice. If I were you, I would continue to improve the article, in style and substance, but leave the notice there. Other users of Wikipedia will then contribute to the debate about whether the article should be kept - the better the article, and the more justification you can find, the more likely it is to be kept.

<p>Answer for MKoltnow: I am a fan of Alejandro Zamora, and I am introducing him to Wikipedia, so please do not delete it again. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well this brings up somewhat of a conundrum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let us assume that you are, indeed, not Alejandro Zamora. We will also, for the purpose of this discussion, assume that Zamora is notable, per wikipedia guidelines. Therefore, your <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">username</a> is somewhat inappropriate, as it implies that you are someone well-known, when you are not. It will also always give the impression of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> when people look at the edit history of an article such as the one on Zamora. (We avoid conflict of interest, when possible, since one of the wikipillars is having a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, something which is a challenge when you write about <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">yourself</a> or someone you are close to.) As a possible remedy, consider changing your username to Zamorafan or something which makes it clear you are not Zamora himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other possibility is that you are actually Zamora himself. We <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> until we have reason not to. At the same time, edits to an article by the subject of it will always seem suspicious. Autobiographical articles tend to have trouble with POV, and sometimes get away from what the author intended. (<a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> states this better.)</dd>

<dd>OK. I am agree, but trying to erase an artist like him or Yanni from Wikipedia, or from another place, is impossible. He is an new age musician, and he must be included on the list of new age musicians of Wikipedia. Furthermore, he meets several criterias for the insertion on Wikipedia. Now, if you are agree, and all the world here is agree, we can reach a common agree. So, I will be glad if the case is closed, and you can leave me to do my job.

<dd>I think there's a possibility that the author didn't mean it like that. Based on their gramatical style it appears that the author's primary language is something other than english and they're not fluent, so there's a good chance the author doesn't fully understand the definition of the word "job" (then again that's a pretty good argument for them not editing the english version of wikipedia, though that's probably outside the scope of this discussion as a poorly written article can be cleaned up by a native speaker rather than being deleted). <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 23:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is enough proof of notability and he meets several criterias for insertion on Wikipedia. #1 He does have recorded several CDs, #2 he does have won several awards of music on his country, #3 he does have performed public concerts, #4 he does have composed music for radio and tv shows, #5 and he does have a website on the Internet... so, what more you want? an interview with LARRY KING on CNN to get notability? He is not so notable like Yanni, but he already meets several criterial for insertion on Wikipedia, and to be honest, anyone who is unable to see that he is a new star, is a blind person.

And attempts to influence this by way of creating multiple accounts to act as separate people is also a violation of the guidelines of Wikipedia, and is eligible for punitive measures as dictated by WP rules.

<dd><i>Comment:</i> Are you using Google to find a review and judge the notability of a person? So, if Google cant find a single review of an artist, should not be included in Wikipedia? Did you know that there are a lot of notable artists around the world that his names produces no results on Google or Wikipedia?

<dd>No, DGG is using YOUR ARTICLE - YOU haven't provided a single reference in the article. It is your responsibility to do that if you want to prove notability, not ours. Please find some references to this guy somewhere and post them in the article! And that person MEHDI you linked to has albums for sale at Amazon.com. I search amazon.com for Alejandra Zamora and I don't find anything. Is there anywhere one can actually buy music by this guy? What is his record label and do they have a webpage?

<dd><i>Comment:</i> You are asking 3 questions at 6:59 UTC and 5 minutes later you are changing your vote from <b>Weak Keep</b> to Delete. Its no fair play! Questions are generally answered within hours, but I would be glad to answer your questions now: #1 you can buy his CDs from his website. #2 The record label does not have a website. #3 If you want more references I recommend to travel to Venezuela. So, please keep or change your vote again when you have finished reading this message. I remember you that Alejandro Zamora meets several requirements to qualify in Wikipedia (although only one is needed). Zamorafan 17:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Answer:</i> If you want to get reliable independent references besides his website, you will need to: #1 buy his CDs, from his website, or from selected music shops of his country, #2 you will need to travel to Venezuela and listen the local radio AM/FM networks to catch his music, or #3 tuning local TV networks to catch his music on the background of ads or TV news, #4 joining his music school, and #5 perhaps if you travel to Venezuela you would have the luck enough to catch him doing a public performance in a national event. I rememeber you that Google or WP is NOT a reliable source to know if a musician is notable or not. There is still a lot of notable musicians that Google or Wikipedia produces no results or unrelated hits like MEHDI<a href="http://www.soothingmusic.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soothingmusic.com" rel="nofollow">[85]</a> or another notable musicians.

<dd><i>Comment #1:</i> There is a lot of musicians on Wikipedia without websites on the Internet or any kind of external links, without album information, and without biographies or with poor or no information about the artist. He at least meets several requirements to qualilify for insertion in Wikipedia (although only one is needed). Furthermore, I remember you that MEHDI began to sell his CDs from his website, of the same way that Alejandro Zamora, before of selling his albums on Amazon.com. The label record printed on his CDs is Z-records, and apparently this company does not have website. However, you can order his CDs directly from his website, or you will need to travel to Venezuela to buy his CDs on selected music shops as said <a href="../../../z/h/a/User%7EZhakira_8680.html" title="User:Zhakira">Zhakira</a>.

<dd><i>Comment #2:</i> About the differences between notable musicians, the merits of how they reached to be famous is a thing very important when judging the notability of a musician. In my humble opinion (and from a neutral point of view), <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yanni.html" title="Yanni">Yanni</a> had to travel from Greek to the USA to be a notable musician , MEHDI traveled from Iran to USA to be a notable musician. <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Eustache_01de.html" title="Pedro Eustache">Pedro Eustache</a> the venezuelan flutist traveled from Venezuela to USA and joined to the Yanni orchestra to be a notable musician. Alejandro Zamora has not traveled to USA to be a notable musician, of the same way like Raul Di Blasio was famous from Argentina without traveling to USA, or <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitaro.html" title="Kitaro">Kitaro</a> from Japan. So, you can see that too much people think that the easy way is travel to USA to be a notable musician. Perhaps, Alejandro Zamora chose the hard way to be a notable musician from a socialist country where Internet access is really very expensive, latin music is predominant and piano or new age music is very rare, so I believe that he is at least doing his best effort to reach the top of mountain from the bottom, without using a copter to reach the top, or traveling to USA, to be notable.

<dd><i>Comment #3:</i> However, if you travel to this country you can listen his music on local AM/FM radio networks and like backgroung music on local TV ads and news. He often made public perfomances in some national events, and does have a music school on his country where I had the opportunity to meet him. He knows to play several musical instruments besides of the piano, and he always repeat to his pupils that he himself learnt to play piano "without a teacher" when he was very young with his own computer using a system that is not available today, called the Miracle Piano Teaching System.

<dd><i>Final Note</i>: I still guess that we will reach a common agree to keep this musician in Wikipedia because he meets several requirements for insertion (although only one is needed). Furthermore, there are a lot of musicians on Wikipedia without websites, no external links, no album information, and without biographies or with poor or no information about the artist. So, if this musician is deleted from Wikipedia, we would have to delete a lot of musicians or whole categories from Wikipedia too (including a lot of people from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_garage_rock_bands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_garage_rock_bands" rel="nofollow">The List of Garage Rock Bands</a> or from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Punk_Bands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Punk_Bands" rel="nofollow">The List of Punk Bands</a>).

<p>The Miss California Teen USA Pageant is a BEAUTY CONTEST. Miss Teenage California is an extablished scholarship competition for young women, and attractiveness of the contestant's is only a part of the overall young woman the pageant attracts. Candidates are for the most part involved in school and community and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. The pageant is notable because each year the winner is NOT the only contestant who wins significant awards. The runners up in the 2007 Miss Teenage California Pageant will win college scholarships of $5,000, $4,000, $3,000, and $2,000 respectively. I believe their are no significant scholarships awarded at Miss California USA, and the winner of the California's OUtstanding Teen Pageant last year won a $1,500 college scholarship.

<p>Esperanza, Apologies. So new to wikipedia.com Learning as I'm going here.24.23.51.248laceydog</p>
<p>Esperanza, please note that the Miss Teenage California Scholarship Pageant is nothing like Miss California Teen USA or California's Outstanding Teen Pageant. There is no swimsuit or talent competition at Miss Teenage California. The competitive categories are Achievements &amp; Activities, Personality, Poise &amp; Appearance in Formal Wear. Miss Teenage California was founded in 1980, Miss California Teen USA in 1983, and California Outstanding Teen in 2005. 24.23.51.248 08:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)laceydog</p>
<p>If truth be known the Miss Teenage California Scholarship Pageant existed long before either the Miss California Teen USA and California Outstanding Teen Pageant which is relatively new. These are established facts. The rpize package for Miss Teenage California stands alone as being among the top prize packages in the nation for a state pageant. This is the 28th consecutive year for Miss Teenage California. (See list of winners)</p>
<p>There is nothing of an "ad nature" in the article. The address of the production company, phone number are not even mentioned. Everything contained in the article is FACTUAL. "Esperanza" seems to think that simply because one girl goes to a nationally televised pageant it suddenly adds credence to the system. I beg to differ. Look at the website, study the prizes being awarded, the history of the event as the facts do indeed speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Non-notable state pageant? Miss Teenage California annually has over 200 contestants from every corner of the state. By comparison Miss California Teen USA has between 45-75. You also may wish to check out the prize differences. Our program has existed since 1980 and is the largest teen scholarship pageant in the nation.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_California_Teen_USA_c066.html" title="Miss California Teen USA">Miss California Teen USA</a> pageant has dozens of local feeder pageants.

The winner of that pageant will go on to the nationally televised <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Teen_USA_1b59.html" title="Miss Teen USA">Miss Teen USA</a> pageant. Your contestants will go where?

<p>You need to check your facts. The Miss California USA Pageant and teen division NOW have very, very few local preliminary pageants. It is almost entirely at-large.

<p>Esperanza had mentioned in response earlier, that their are other " far more important pageants", and she gave reference to both Miss California Teen USA and California's Outstanding Teenager. While I'm willing to update and change information for suitablity I take som offense to these remarks simply because they are not based in fact. Here are the facts. The Miss Teenage California Pageant was founded in 1980. Miss California Teen USA some years thereafter and the California's Outstanding Teen Pageant is only two years old. These are facts. More facts? The winner of the California's Outstanding Teen Pageant won a $1,500 college scholarship. Our winner receives a $10,000 college scholarship and $5,000 cash. The Miss California Teen USA winner receives very little in comparison to our state winner. Both of the other mentioned pageants that Esperanza notes, do not offer substantial college scholarships to their runners-up. It is a fact our 4th runner up at Miss Teenage California receives more than the winner of the Ca. Outstanding Teen Pageant. I would further go on to state that someone who wishes for me to provide "reliable sources" does not even know how to spell the word "pageant" correctly.</p>
<p>I wish for someone to be exact in the criticism of input, as EVERYTHING mentioned is factual.

<p>The definition of "notability" is vague at best, and doesn't constitute basic facts that exist in the text. Wikipedia needs to do a better job in explaining this. It's rather "wordy" diatribe hardly makes it easier for the layman to contribute.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Of these, one is from Pageant News Bureau, which covers all pageants, even squitty little ones, so that doesn't prove much. The first one is good, although its more about the locals than the state pageant, the rest are just lists of scholarships and I can't see that establishing notability. Others might disagree, but that's just my opinion. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 01:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Somewhat-weak <b>keep</b>. I added two sources to the article and formatted it a little better.

Another one may have moved to Utah and won a major pagent there; but I'm not really sure it's the same girl.

<li><b>Comment</b> the issue is that the winners didn't go to Miss USA or whatever <i>because</i> they were Miss Teenage California, but because they later won other titles. Quite a few of the other titles you noted are notable, but things like "Miss Teen of the Nation Pageant", "Miss North American Teen ", "Miss U.S. Teen Pageant ", "Miss Intercontinental", "America's Perfect Teen " are not. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 18:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Further, it is important to mention that Miss Teenage California is a scholarship program which offers their winner the OPTION of competing at a national pageant. It is an independent, as participation in a national pageant is just one prize that can be accepted or declined by the winner of the state pageant. I believe the winners of Miss Teenage California might be more interested in the $10,000 college scholarship and $5,000 cash, rather than competing in a winner take all nationally televised event, where the runners up receive very little. All of that data can easily be verified.

If you would like to research either person extensively, i think you would withdraw your offensive statements and remove this article from the deletion process please. Thank you.</p>
<p>Please do not penalize talent, Francis (the woman who entered the article) intends to expand the source and cite references, this source is of venerable provenance, unlike many of the other articles listed for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.129.0.110 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.129.0.110.html" title="User talk:81.129.0.110">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.129.0.110_57d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.129.0.110">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>nn stands for "non-notable", i.e., failing to specify any way in which the subject reaches WP's notability guidelines. If it is offensive to you that i have stated this, then I apologise, but it is a fact that as the article stands notability has not been established. I find it interesting that you mention "Francis (the woman who entered the article)", given that the article was created by User: Tony Montanna, who has yet to create a user page. As such, I suspect that you may know more about this article's creation than you are letting on. As it says in the introduction to AfD, <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons).</i> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - putting "sofa king" in quotes still gets me 339,000 google hits (not in quotes is over a million but they're both common words so that's less meaningful). It's the name of more than one band, a couple of sportsbars, included in the domain of several websites, it's in the urban dictionary and several other dictionaries of slang. You're not going to find academic work or newspaper articles discussing it because of the link to profanity, which those sorts of mediums tend to shy away from (it's awkward to write an article full of asterisks and euphemisims) but it's pretty clear to me that this term has soaked into popular culture pretty thoroughly.&#160;!!!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> (<a href="../../../p/l/y/User_talk%7EPlymouths_ce88.html" title="User talk:Plymouths">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Plymouths_9b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Plymouths">contribs</a>) 11:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small> oops. that was a typo - put exclamation points instead of tildes - they're right next to each other. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 11:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>As a member I'm obviously biased, but this fact also gives me more insight than your average Joe. A few years ago I was motivated to learn about overclocking and quickly found the forum on google. I have been a member in SO many forums, but Overclock.net differs in that its members are leagues above other forums in both intelligence and kindness. This was obvious from the beginning, when no one complained about the frequency of my questions (many of which had been answered numerous times before). Were it simply a nice forum, it might not be notable, but the aforementioned truths have caused the community to explode from around 7,500 members (when I joined in March of 2005) to over 32,000. That's about a 425% increase in under 2 years. It certainly deserves a spot on Wikipedia.TheInformationator 02:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (<small>marked as duplicate vote</small>) Your argument Gracenotes, with all due respect, is like claiming Dunkin Donuts belongs in the context of Donut Shops and therefore should only be mentioned in an article on Donut Shops. Doesn't add up. Overclock.net had 3 million page view in January 2007. A year ago it was averaging 206 thousand unique visits a month. IT IS WELL KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE LEADING OVER-CLOCKING FORUMS if not currently THE leading forum on Overclocking, just as Dunkin Donuts is well known to be a leading Donut shop seller among donut shops. Overclock.net probably receives more visitors than all the Dunkin donuts do in the state of Delaware per month. Ask any donut eater if they've heard of Dunkin donuts, most will say yes. Ask any Computer enthusiast &amp; Overclocker if they've heard of Overclock.net, and they will likely say yes as well. Why? Because Overclock.net is a notable site - especially to the 200+ thousand people who visit it per month. This is well known by some very large online sellers such as Newegg, Tankguys &amp; Easypckits who realize just how notable the forum is, and how valuable and specialized. Perhaps the current article needs upgrading to Wikipedia standards - you have a much better argument there, but in regards to notability, as was mentioned earlier - notability requirements have been met as listed by WP:WEB standards. Jamenta 05:05, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can tell you for a fact that Overclock.net gets more people than Dunkin' Donuts does in state of California. That has no bearing on the notability of Dunkin' Donuts or anything else. Dunkin' Donuts is notable for being a very large global business that has been around for 60 years that everyone and thier mother writes about. One can't say the same for overclock.net. Please go read <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>, the number of people that visit isn't an indicator of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just a note, overclock.net is dedicated more in to performance, rather than simple overclocking. ALthough yes, it's main function is to provide users to refine their overclocking ability, it is a general computer's and electronics reference site. Not only overclocking is discussed, but other ways to enhance performance. Please, keep it. F2002yann</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia. As an encyclopedia, it is then a bunch of other things - 1) not paper 2) one that anybody can edit (until they prove that they can't play well with others or aren't interested in creating an encyclopedia), and others. #1 argues for keeping lots of stuff that your average encyclopedia wouldn't keep. #2 means that we get a lot of stuff that isn't ready for an encyclopedia yet. So we have discussions about where some things fall, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability guidelines</a> about what we have found in the past to normally be sufficiently noticed to keep an encyclopedia article in good shape.</dd>
<dd>Policy requires that all content be 1) verifi<b>able</b> (not necessarily <a href="../../../c/t/t/WP%7ECTT_ba6c.html" title="WP:CTT">cited</a>, not necessarily online) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, 2) written from a neutral point of view <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and 3) not original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. We've found through experience that what it takes to have an article that complies with policy is a sufficient number of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable sources</a> that are primarily about the article's topic. (They provide a body of data to work from and an indication that we will probably have enough interested editors to keep the article from being hijacked into spam or an attack page.) <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> each indicate some other criteria that we take as indicator variables - if they are present, we are willing to bet that the sources exist. (Like smoke coming from the computer is an indicator of a need to buy a replacement part.) Any website or business is a reliable source when self describing, but maintaing a neutral point of view tends not to be a high priority, so we assume that their publications exist, and focus on looking for other sources. We need reliable publications by independent authors that have the article's topic as the primary subject. These need to be non-trivial, which is a discussable interpretation - directory listings are always trivial, full length books are always non-trivial, and in between we are evaluating the amount of content available for having a good encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>As to the village comparison, experience has shown that when someone goes looking, print sources exist. More generally, see the essay <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - massive meatpuppetry aside, the non-trivial mentions are enough.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - many (most?) college professors at major schools have published or contributed to one or more textbooks. I don't know that that's really much of an assertion of notability, though. If the article is kept, however, the quotes section needs to go.

<li><b>delete</b> I improved the page, removing unsouceable classroom quotations, and added the 4 or 5 universities using his main textbook. There are at least two law review articles, but I didnt look for them yet. I do not consider that this makes for a legal scholar, especially considering that only 1 of the universities is well known, and they all seem to be for construction engineering, which is not his field. I haven't the least idea what he was doing at a College of Marine Studies, nor can I source it.

<dd>Yea, that made the decision more difficult, but in my mind, we want to be covering people who have written textbooks that are used by many. So, because his book is required reading for a good many people, at more than one university (which I assume means that the author cant be affiliated with all of them), I think it is worth recording who he is. e.g. "Contracts and the Legal Environment for Engineers and Architects" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 007039363X</a>) is ranked #259,619 in amazon books; "Construction Management Fundamentals" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0072818778</a>) is #192,905 in amazon books. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 03:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is not simply a business park, this was a government financed iniative as part of a wider development... the University of South Australia campus, the failed 'multi function polis', and the eventual Mawson Lakes project. There are verifiable sources in numerous books on this part of South Australian history.

<li>Have to agree with Michael that it's important and notable. 1st technology park in Australia, home to many important companies....unfortunately that's basically the substance of the subject apart from some bits about the foundation of the park.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> to Mawson Lakes and redirect. Michael is correct that there is more to this subject to meets the eye – the area is the watered down product of a historically important proposal to redevelop northern Adelaide. It is also a significant example of government sponsored economic hubs in Australia.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 15:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
