<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm sick of you people putting up AfDs just for fun when you obviously have no idea what's going on just because an article is on a website. Are you guys just clueless? Ignorance is truly bliss. Look it up, we have guidelines on this stuff. You know what guidelines are right? Evidentally none of you have read them, so I would suggest you click <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">here</a>. Read them before you go off making pointless deletes because you feel like it. Does it not say "A forum with more than 5,000 users that has made a verifiable impact beyond its own user community" is notable? If you'd bother to read the article you're motioing to delete, it says that they have almost 30,000 users, which, not only is notable, but also can be verified by going to the site. A few clicks around the internet and you'll realize that the tournaments organized on these boards are obviously giving the site an impact beyond its user-base. All of you need to start recognizing these guidelines before you go off AfDing. 12:31, 1 January, 2006 (UTC) - <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanillaX_0984.html" title="User:VanillaX">User:VanillaX</a>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Nothing pointless about this AfD. It's a forum with no particular claim to notability beyond its community. When we say "has made a verifiable impact beyond its own user community," we mean beyond its niche. Where's the media mentions? Where's the evidence that anyone outside the Super Smash Bros. community cares about these forums? Also, if it's kept, nuke the forumcruft.

<li>Google scholar indicates a publications by him. I find some 29 papers on Web of Knowledge by an LR Doyle on astronomical topics, which I believe are by him. Also appears to have been editor of the proceedings of at least one conference. Work is of the sort likely to interest the public, as evidenced by at least one article in Scientific American.

<li><b>Comment</b> I created it, but I'm not voting in this case. I was surprised when this was put on speedy as that seemed a bit extreme. That said I mentioned this guy when doing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christian_Scientists_%28religious_denomination%29_34a0.html" title="List of Christian Scientists (religious denomination)">List of Christian Scientists (religious denomination)</a> and at the time things I said indicated I didn't think he was noteworthy enough to start an article on him. So that might explain some things. That said I did an article on him because I did find he was in Google News and also figured he might actually be important enough. Oddly I'm still not entirely certain of that, but he has a couple books at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00010RH1Y/qid=1136084792/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-7244289-3211260?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00010RH1Y/qid=1136084792/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-7244289-3211260?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. I'm assuming that is the same guy as it's a Laurance R. Doyle book distributed by SETI, which indicates he probably is LR Doyle. "LR Doyle" gets a good deal more hits at <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22LR+Doyle%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22LR+Doyle%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Scholar Google</a>. That said his books at Amazon have a sales rank that is lower than even that Kenneth Eng guy so I'm not sure.

<li><b>Keep</b> - He was chosen as editor for "Circumstellar habitable zones: proceedings of the first international conference" (intro written by Carl Sagan, mind you...). That honor alone makes him worth consideration, as he is obviously respected by his peers. His thesis, entitled "Voyager imaging photometry and radiative transfer modeling of the spoke-like features in Saturn's outer B-ring." was also quite good. I remember reading it two years after he finished it. He deserves a biog. article here.→ <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:Pádraic MacUidhir"><font color="#006400"><b>P</b></font><font color="#4B0082"><b>.</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>M</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>a</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>c</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>U</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>i</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>d</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>h</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>i</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>r</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User_talk%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6a00.html" title="User talk:Pádraic MacUidhir"><font color="#9400D3">(t)</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_P%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6232.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pádraic MacUidhir">(c)</a> 09:39, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, you don't need to be an admin to nominate or vote. I <i>think</i> that a nomination is generally counted as a vote to delete, unless otherwise specified. However, it doesn't hurt to also vote to make it explicit. If you do, it's a good idea to mention that you're the nominator. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 15:27, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Is it really a copyvio? From where? To the above: anyone can vote, though only an admin can close the voting process once some consensus is reached. And yes, unless you say otherwise, it's implied that if you nominate an article for deletion, then you are voting "delete". --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Rewrite from scratch</b> - as others have said, this is mostly cobbled together from bits of other Wikipedia articles. A Google shows "conflict behavior" exists as a term, but it does not refer to fidgeting etc. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 03:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. From what I can tell, this is a purely descriptive phrase, with no definite meaning beyond "behavior in/during conflict". Therefore, it would be at best a dicdef. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 15:27, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looking at Google Scholar again, I notice that I seem to have overestimated his total number of hits. A few of those "R Celmer" are actually by other people called "R [initial] Celmer" and in other fields, such as metallurgy. As for cites: if I understand this correctly, the top one is cited thrice. Of the others belonging to the right Celmer, none have any cites noted.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Despite what people think, the Kingdom got wide press coverage in Australia and within the worlds Gay media and is an historical fact! The Australian Attorney-Generals department mentions "Declaration of Independence of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands - Office of International Law (OIL)" and whilst no nation is yet to recognise the Kingdoms sovereignty neither does any country recognise Quebec and its fight of independance within Canada yet Quebec's plight is widly covered. good on them I say and please keep!

I would like to know who keeps putting this page up for deletion and why? my only guess is that there is a homophobe within this organisation that does not agree with its content. The events took place and a search of the Attorney-Generals department in Australia mentions the Kingdom, as well as Independence documents were lodged with the United Nations in New York and the ICJ (International Court of Justice) in the Hague. There is much interest in the Kingdom in Australia particularly with the government of Australia winding back gay and lesbian rights, banning gay marriages, and removing gay and lesbian rights from its human rights charter so I say keep it!!!

<li><b>keep</b>. Perhaps you should try "German African Party" + "South West Africa", which is what Namibia was called until the late 1980s!

<dd>It's got nothing to do with 9/11 happening in America. It just happened to be a very well-known and larger terrorist attack.

<li><b>Keep</b> I found it useful when checking to see if any if my Spanish aquaintances had died</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; I am the person who made this article. I just want to explain why I think the English Wikipedia should have such an article. However, of course, if you think that this page should be deleted, go on. (Interested people can check this information in the Spanish version, if they understand Spanish.)
<ul>
<li>1) Most people argues that <i>"Wikipedia is not a memorial"</i>. Well, <b>this article should not be considered as a memorial page</b>, but as a page with additional information about the Madrid bombings. If you consider that the names of the people who died in Madrid are not relevant for Wikipedia, you can delete these names, but at least keep the information about the victims (for instance, why does usually appear the name of Francisco Javier Torrenteras between the people who died, although he did not die in the bombings; or why at first officially the media spoke about 202 casualties, instead of the real number, 190; or the fact that died people of 17 nationalities... etc). If this page is deleted, I think that this information should be added to the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, but, in order not to excede the amount of information that appears there, I think that the better solution is a page about the persons who dead there.
<p>I understand that, as the names of the victims takes up most of the article, many people could think that it is a memorial, but if you read it, you will see that there is more information (that has to be emproved and expanded, I know).</p>
</li>
<li>2) Before I made this article, I saw that someone (I don't know who), added in the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, in the "See also" section, this hidden line:
<p>&lt;!-- * [[Casualties of the 11 March 2004 Madrid bombings]] --&gt;</p>
(as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" rel="nofollow">you can see in this edition of an <b>old version</b> of the article</a>), <b>claiming for such an article</b>.</li>
<li>3) <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:Pádraic MacUidhir">P.MacUidhir</a> argues that <i>"Bombings are not unusual, and certainly not usually notable"</i>. I agree, bombings are not notable. But not all bombings are the same! Sadly, <a href="../../../e/t/a/ETA_5e56.html" title="ETA">ETA</a> is responsible for most bombings in Spain, but <b>the Madrid March 11 bombings were not at all usual</b>. It was the worse Al-Qaida attack in Europe. There died almost four times more people than in the <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July London bombings</a>. Millions of persons took part in the demonstrations against terrorism the day after (more or less the 28% of the Spanish population). Many poeple think that there was a political change in Spain because of these bombings (they happened three days before the March 14 general elections), and that the authors aimed this change; other people think that the former goverment lied supporting that ETA was the author of the attacks until the last moment, as they could lose the elections because of their support to the Bush' invasion of Iraq (it is still a very hot subject, and I don't want to give my opinion here, I just speak about the opinion of many people). I only want to say that obviously the Madrid bombings are, sadly, once again, a historical event, not only in Spain, but worldwide, such as the London bombings, the 9/11 or the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings_9e25.html" title="1998 U.S. embassy bombings">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a> in Kenya and Tanzania. I am not speaking in this point about the number of persons who died, but just about the importance and consequences of the event.</li>
<li>4) I saw that there was an article about the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_7_July_2005_London_bombings_233a.html" title="Casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings">casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, with the names of all the victims, and I thought that <b>there should be an equivalent article with the Madrid victims</b>. I don't want to think that nationalism should be so important in Wikipedia (when we speak about worldwide events), and the terrorism victims in England should not be more or less important than those who died in Spain. I saw too that there is an <a href="../../../../es/v/%C3%AD/c/V%C3%ADctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres_579e.html" class="extiw" title="es:Víctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres">article about the London victims in the Spanish wikipedia</a>, without the names (in my opinion this article lacks those names). Nevertheless, in the 9/11 died thousands of men and women, and I think that it is better there an external link, not because those persons were less important, but just because it would be too large; but maybe some persons who died in the 9/11 should appear in wikipedia (the many firefighters who died there? People who saved other people? For instance, William Rodríguez became famous, but he didn't die there). I think that the queston is not as simple as "there should appear all victims of terrorist attacks or none of them".</li>
<li>5) I made the article, as every article, thinking about it as a starting point. So, it should be extended and improved by other wikipedians. For example (as in the July London attacks), who died in each place (the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atocha.html" title="Atocha">Atocha Station</a>, or El Pozo, or Santa Eugenia, or the Téllez Street)? How many? Where were first carried? What does <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilar_Manj%C3%B3n_1578.html" title="Pilar Manjón">Pilar Manjón</a> (president of the Association for the victims of 11-M) think about the political reactions? These questions maybe could be too much for the principal article, but not for an article about victims, and it could contain interesting information for wikipedia. I think that <b>there should be a page of the same quality as that one about the London attacks</b>, and I hope that it will be so. I only contribute with my knowledge. I don't know many things about the London attacks, so I can't speak about them.</li>

<li>On re-reading the article's actual content, <b>keep</b> the article but the list/memorial/whatever you want to call it should be deleted.

<li>"This is a made up word" pretty much proves our point. Just because someone makes a word up one day doesn't automatically mean it deserves a Wikipedia article. I can make up a word right here. "Splaw" means the same thing as "excellent". But no one else than I is ever going to care a flying toss about that word, even if I were to write a Wikipedia article about it. Wikipedia should <b>not</b> be used as a medium to <b>gain</b> notability for new concepts, it should only be used to document concepts that already <b>are</b> notable. If we allowed articles about everything just because "it doesn't use up much space on the Wikipedia servers" then we would have tens of millions of poorly written articles about things only their author will ever care about, and the actual real encyclopedia articles would get lost in the background noise. — <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Subject is notable, the article as it stands is fuly sourced and hardly constitutes an attack page, quite the reverse. I was confused about which link was which but am happy to leave out the parody website if Longhair prefers. I don't know how to test the prominence of a user but certainly a Google search shows very many references to Rizzuto playing an active role in public life in Melbourne. Seems very notable to me. Have also improved the sources with links to newspaper articles and and other links. Seems to be pretty comprehensively sourced now. Longhair seems determined to delete the article and is now saying the sources are low quality without elaborating. The sources all seem pretty good to me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenBengHo_1ec8.html" title="User:StephenBengHo">StephenBengHo</a> 09:48, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> She's just an ordinary failed political candidate (to a local council, no less), who seems to have earned the obsession of some random guy (as evidenced by his "parody site"). The "sources" consist of a news story which she is not mentioned in at all, two blog articles, some minutes of a local council, and an alumni association entry which she appears to have written herself. There's practically no relevant Google hits about her, and I can't imagine this being of interest to anyone much else apart from its author. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:58, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The site does exist, however a Google search only shows 514 hits for the term "sheabaseball." I note also that someone attempted to avoid detection by not making Sheabaseball.com the title of the article, knowing it would be deleted, instead, they tried to name it to sound like a serious subject. If it is not a criteria for deletion, I think basic dishonesty in any manner weighs in my mind in favor of deletion.

<p>The name is spelt wrong in the earlier check, it is sarkar google 'sagar sarkar'+ contraband returns several relevant hits. Further verification of sources on the article are also authentic. Google 'Packabelles' returns the band page and there is indeed a vrushali bokil in the band.</p>

<li>please check <a href="http://m.domaindlx.com/milinddate/Albums-Recordings%201.htm" class="external free" title="http://m.domaindlx.com/milinddate/Albums-Recordings%201.htm" rel="nofollow">http://m.domaindlx.com/milinddate/Albums-Recordings%201.htm</a> - Milind Date, the famous Indian flautist has recorded several albums on authorised labels, many of these are South Asian labels, but in all fairness would be very discriminatory not to consider. Sagar Sarkar and his band Contraband was the first musician Milind Date played with and even mentions this on the site. This fulfils Wikipedia criterion that the band should have at least one known artiste who has officially released recordings on known labels. In India Sagar Sarkar is well known as a pioneer of the Pune Blues scene. (that was User:Mifern <small><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 19:36, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</small>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I suggest renaming this page to <b>contraband (band)</b>, with a much more prominent link to Milind Date (who clearly does have a verifiable discography and easily qualifies for his own wikipedia article, and appears to be the only qualifier for a contraband entry), and if necessary, adding Sagar Sarkar as a redirect. The assertion that Sagar Sarkar is known as the 'Father of Indian Blues' appears totally unverifible (0 google hits) , and the single reference to Pune Blues in the context of a musical style appears on the band's site, pretty much making it a neologism. with that, I'll change my opinion to <b>very weak keep</b> <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMNewnham_fbea.html" title="User:MNewnham">MNewnham</a> 20:28, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Using google I have been unable to verify if this comic actaully appears in the Weekly World News - someone in the US could probably verify it more easily. The page has been speedied several times as nonsense. I also don't think that a comic that appears in a spoof newspaper is necessarily encyclopedic - all edits that aren't from the original contributor are fixing disambigs.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 23:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but clean-up. The character is legitimate though I don't recall if it's actually a comic strip. I thought it was a photo feature. Characters like <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Boy_b860.html" title="Bat Boy">Bat Boy</a> from the WWN get their own articles, so Miss Adventure I guess deserves one, too. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:23, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As 23skiddo already said, Miss Adventure is a legitimate character, but is not a comic strip. More of a fictional story that is continued each week.

<p>I posted the following on aeorpagitica's user page:</p>
<pre>
lemme explain why this deserves an article:
1.Allmusic.com recognizes golden age as a genre 
2.Old school hip hop has its own page. 
3.There is plenty to talk about, of encyclopedic significance. 
Please remove the suggestion for deletion, or if you disagree, discuss this with me. Thanks! --

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-known in the area of web standards (RSS, RDF). Only 140 unique google hits out of 499,000 total, but I take this as indicative of highly focused activity rather than non-notability. Notable for his work on the RSS 1.0 spec if nothing else.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Better, although 83.71.106.95 up there added some condescending stuff that should have been taken out (which I did). I have no involvement with Aaron, never met him or corresponded with him, but I know his work. The comments above and the defacing of the article smell bad to me. The actual edits of the article by Aaron Swartz look pretty minimal to me, unless someone knows that anon 69.181.82.221 is him (not impossible). <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 04:14, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not create the article. I believe it was created by Andrew Morrow, who I'd never heard of until he sent me an email saying he'd created a page about me on Wikipedia. He said he created it because I was referred to in a number of other articles on Wikipedia. (There are 4 backlinks: <a href="../../../r/s/s/RSS_%28file_format%29_5526.html" title="RSS (file format)">RSS (file format)</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Graham_1672.html" title="Paul Graham">Paul Graham</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-power.html" title="Low-power">Low-power</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markdown.html" title="Markdown">Markdown</a>.)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The backlinks are very convincing. I've always thought the point of having notability criteria is to avoid cruft and keep only useful material...not to argue about if someone is "famous". Is Swartz notable enough? The answer to that should be related to, are the links to the page currently serving a purpose? I think "yes". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 12:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Author of article</b> I am a newbie. I also created about seven articles, including one for another magazine, not at all connected with Quest. Five came directly from Quest Magazine. I created the articles with the understanding that Wikipedia policed them somewhat. I have been polite with the exception of one remark I made to user <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGrye_3ca8.html" title="User:Grye">Grye</a> who has been nothing but <b>rude</b> and a vandal by removing the source from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Masonic_organizations_226f.html" title="List of Masonic organizations">List of Masonic organizations</a> (an article from Quest).

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I am frequently asked by fellow classmates to give tours of the apartment for possible place to live (they literally ask if they can come over and "check the place out"), and i thought this would be an easier way for them get to know the apartment without having to give tours all the time. This is not advertising in anyway, as i would be doing a favor for my fellow classmates by making this. Also wanted to make my first Wikipedia Article. Besides its obviously not taking up too much space and besides being reffered to the page by me, it will remain unknown to the average Wikipedia User. I know it probably goes against Wikipedia code, but this remaining on here would be a great referance for me to use. Wikipedia is supposed to be the sum of all human knowledge, and this is verifiable useful information that many people will find useful.

<li>Chrisboven, I removed all the unverifiable info (aka everything beyond existence). As said, we can't advertise an apartment for you.

<ul>
<li>I would love to remove thousands of uncited sections from thousands of articles. However, time constraints and popular opinion prevent me from doing that. Instead, whenever I find something with no sources *and* it's not possible to ever find any sources, and it's therefore *inherently* unverifiable, then yes, I do remove the section. I have removed a *lot* of sections, from a lot of articles. Occasionally, those sections are added back when sources are found, but usually they stay gone. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:13, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Originally tagged for speedy deletion as copyright violation from <a href="http://www.typenex.com/en/risk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.typenex.com/en/risk/" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, yet in its latest version the article asserts there is permission to publish the text here.

<li>This is a blatant advertisement, and there is really no need to have an entry on a specific brand of transfusion-related equipment. Wikipedia isn't an advertising medium for Baxter Healthcare. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 15:54, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep &amp; Clean (if possible, see below)</b> The page seems to contain enough generally useful information that it could be salvaged as an article, if the specific references to the "Typenex-Transfusion Safety Wristbands" is removed. Once those are removed, what remains is an article on a notable subject, which is blood tansfusion errors. The page should then be renamed to remove the brand reference, renamed to something like "Blood Transfusion Safety Systems" or "Blood Transfusion Errors" Now as to the <i>copyright issue</i>, that's another story, because we have no way of knowing if such permission was given. Salvaging the article then would require figuring out how much of the text is copied. If that cannot be done, then I am afraid it would have to be <b>deleted and replaced</b>. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 16:33, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Whether or not it's a hoax or if the place really exists, the article should be deleted because it's only one sentence. As <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> said recently on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Butterfly_Caught_23b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Butterfly Caught">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Butterfly Caught</a> page, "One sentence does not a Wikipedia article make." From one sentence, we cannot determine the notability of the place, or the truthfulness or accuracy of any statements. If the writer cannot bother to write more than one sentence, or doesn't have enough knowledge or material to write more than one sentence, it should be deleted. For reference, pick up any bound encyclopedia and look at the entry for any major city near you. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 17:02, 1 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With respect to you and B.Wind, a tiny village and a major city are hardly the same thing, and similarly Wikipedia and a bound encyclopedia are hardly the same thing. In the former case, a village will almost always have a tiny article compared to a major city; in the latter, bound encyclopedias only ever contain finished articles - Wikipedia always only contains articles in progress. As such, a one sentence stub may be the start of a future featured article and - as long as it contains <i>some</i> information (like a village's location) - should not automatically be considered for deletion on its size alone. In this particular case, however, neither Google nor Ordnance Survey have ever heard of Obesanes, so let's all be sane and <b>delete</b> it. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not quite what I meant. Even in bound encylopedia entries for what one might consider obscure towns that almost no one has ever heard of, there is generally some standard information that is missing here. I was concentrating on the lack of information, such as approximate population, local industry, local places of note, form of government and so forth, usually found in material that is considered "encyclopedic." Your point about bound encylopedias vs Wikipedia is well taken, however, I have written article stubs and when I have done so, it has at least been one paragraph, and more than one sentence. So, I think size does have to do with it, again, I would say that one sentence doesn't even make a stub, and one sentence weighs heavily in my mind against keeping the "article." <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 01:28, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>, not notable enough. The cited sources used to back up all claims consist largely out of tiny newspaper snippets that are blown up out of proportion. He was never on TV, he only worked on projects that never aired. The notability of that title "International Magician of the Year" is heavily questioned: The award organisaton seems to not even have a website, and a search for the title leads to only 123 hits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22International+Magician+of+the+Year%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22International+Magician+of+the+Year%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). So when one removes all that promotional hoopla, his notability has to be rated on this bottom line: Aladin performs rarely, is portrayed in 1 book, and works for the City of London. I strongly believe that those elements don't suffice that an individual be included in the wikipedia. Additionaly, the article sounds very much like blunt euphoric advertising, written by the person himself to jumpstart his career and business by taking advantage of the popularity of the wikipedia project. <b>To any admin deciding the vote</b>: I'd like to order a full sockpuppet and meatpuppet check on all people that have voted here, with an article of such a bad quality, all those "keep" votes cannot possible be the thruthful opinion of the well-educated general wikipedia public.

<li><b>Comment</b> (considering all those "keep" votes): Whoa whoa whoa people.... I think you need to slow down and take a look at this before you vote... The article as written makes it seem like he is notable, but it's written like a brochure for self-promotional purposes. For example, the extensive quote cited to Inside Magic is deceptive, as that quote was printed in Inside Magic, but it was quoting a student newspaper ("The Oxford Student has an incredibly positive piece about a young magician") -- the most important bit from that piece is that the editor of Inside Magic calls aladin <b>"a magician I have never heard about."</b> Furhtermore, he questions the student newspaper's claim that he left some society because it wouldn;t admit women as he knows a number of women in the society. This looks like a majorly deceptive bit of advertising by someone trying to give himself credential he doesn;t have. DON'T JUST VOTE KEEP claiming that he's notable without EVIDENCE that he is notable. He fails the Google test, and quite badly. The writer of this article created deceptive references, and sockpuppets have already been suggested. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 22:04, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

Other misleading credentials include the link "NBC Today Show featuring aladin's Book of Cool", but "aladin" was never mentioned on the Today Show, just this book with 25+ different people in it.

<li>Englishrose, the organisation behind "International Magician of The year" doesn't even have a website, how notable can this award be? There are thousands of such smallish awards with grandiose names. Bottom line is, Aladin performs rarely, is portrayed in 1 book, and works for the London gov, so I really really can't see how he's notable. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 22:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article has distinct verifiability problems, not least because most, possibly <i>all</i>, of Aladin's self-publicity seems to be either exaggeration or outright fiction. Last year we had Alkhemi (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alkhemi_214b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alkhemi">AfD discussion</a>), which was as far as could be determined a fictional company created by this person, published on his web site, and mentioned wherever his autobiography is quoted, and for which no independent evidence of existence could be found. (It's possible that it is a one-man consultancy company that exists solely on paper, for tax purposes.) But that is far from the only apparent work of fiction in this person's publicity, it transpires.
<p>Mentioned above is the fact that <i>Inside Magic</i> is using <i>The Oxford Student</i> as its source for an article on "a magician I have never heard about". However, it seems that <i>the only source for that article is Aladin himself</i>. On Aladin's web site we have a quote from the article, describing it as a "3-page feature", published on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">02-19</a> by Tamara Cohen. However, going to <a href="http://oxfordstudent.com./ht2004wk5/features" class="external text" title="http://oxfordstudent.com./ht2004wk5/features" rel="nofollow">the archives for that issue of The Oxford Student</a> (Volume 37 issue 6) I find <i>no such article</i>.</p>
<p>True, Aladin was a "subject of a documentary on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a>". But that was as a refugee, not as a magician. True, there is a <i>Book of Cool</i> (It's actually a set of DVDs.). But it isn't by Aladin. True, Aladin was a "government adviser". He was the vice-chairman of the Mayor of London's Cultural Strategy Group. And the article in the Times is inaccessible without a subscription fee, but given that it begins "Alaudin Ahmed used to use his sleight of hand to broker million-dollar deals." and is an interview with this person I am highly skeptical of its accuracy.</p>
<p>The key to notability here is being the subject of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources (e.g. magazine feature articles, books, and so forth). But upon investigation the whole thing turns out to be either built on sand or unverifiable. The <i>Inside Magic</i> article cites as its source an article in <i>The Oxford Student</i> that doesn't exist. I am unable to verify the purported 1999 coverage in <i>The Hindustan Times</i>, because its archive doesn't go back that far. The only person who appears to have even heard of the "Golden Turban Award from the Magic Academy of Bangalore" (or, indeed, the Magic Academy of Bangalore itself) is Aladin himself. The <i>Daily Star</i> archives don't go back to 1999, either.</p>
<p>Strip away everything about this person that isn't verifiable, and one is left with someone who <i>only</i> satisfies the WP:BIO criteria because of the National Geographic documentary. <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:49, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This Article is Misleading and Inaccurate. In order to judge the accuracy of this article, one would need expertise in the subject, right? Well, I may not be able to judge the accuracy of the scientific articles on wikipedia, but I have performed Sleight of Hand for over 30 years and have never heard of this individual. Additionally, the original article listed Sleight of Hand Artists that I not only *know*, but several of them have given me endorsements for promotional material. I've even gone to the trouble of contacting some of the most knowledgable Sleight of Hand people in the world and none of THEM have heard of this fellow. This leads me to believe the article was posted for purely promotional reasons. Keeping the article would lead people to believe that this indiviudal is one of the top Sleight of Hand Artists/Magicians in the world and this is simply not the case.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have managed to track down two of the articles.
<dl>
<dd>The Asian Age of 9 January 1999: aladin has the top right quarter of the 'People' page on page 21 in a four column article entitled 'Man with the magic lamp' which also has a photograph of him across two and a half of the columns; written by Abhik Sen:</dd>
<dd><i>To mobilise support for the homeless, to walk some of London's roughest neighbourhoods in the middle of the night and charm street gangs off their crimes, to help the UK government as a Cabinet-level adviser on youth and community projects, to coordinate and synthesise the work of South Asian musicians and artistes in Britain, and to do all of it at the same time, one would have to be a magician. That's precisely what aladin is, among, it has to be added, many other things.</i></dd>
<dd>Indiaweekly of Friday September 10 - Thursday September 16 1999: aladin has practically the whole of page 25 in the 'Entertainment' section in an article entitled 'Master of Magic'; 3 of 4 columns to be exact, including a photograph stretching the width of the article, which is written by George Simpson. aladin was interviewed at the Institute for Contemporary Arts where he was appearing:</dd>
<dd><i>aladin, amongst many other things, is a magician, live artist and producer/director. Born in Washington DC to Indian and Bangladeshi parents, aladin (his real name) was brought up everywhere, speaks English, French and Bengali, has worked with street gangs and been an academic, journal editor and government advisor. And this is just a small sample of the man’s achievements.</i></dd>
<dd>Both articles cast him as a Renaissance Man and so have some fascinating background which I am going to include in the Wiki page.

<li>Peter, I understand that you're suspicious. Since I too believe that aladin has been editing his page with sockpuppets, I can understand that you'd look askance at any editor you didn't know. Well, Autumnleaf has been editing Indian cinema articles for a while now and she seems quite level-headed. I don't agree with her on this issue -- I think she has too much faith in journalists! -- but I don't think she'd lie.

<li>Let's say he had 2 Dozen Articles about him in magazines and newspapers. That's enough to make him worthy of an article in a reference source? If so, there are at least 10,000 more amateur magicians waiting to use wikipedia as their personal promotional tool. Anyone with a modicum of talent and enough money to hire a press agent could easily get more press than that. Has he published any work in any of the trade journals? What are his contributions to the art? Has he lectured for the International Brotherhood of Magicians? How about the Society of American Magicians? How about for The Magic Circle? Has he even played the Magic Castle? WHAT?!? Tell me something he's done besides generate a few articles!!! And then tell me why those achievements make him high enough on the ladder to earn his own article in what is supposed to be a serious and accurate reference source.

The claim is of course unverifiable, although I have been able to determine that there is an aspiring magician by that name.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am more than willing to assist you in verifying my qualifications. You may e-mail me at steven.youell at gmail.com Allow me to repeat once more-- I don't think "notable" should be defined by how much press you get, but by what you've contributed to the particular subject. Go search your 1400 newpapers and find out how much press Karl Fulves has, yet he is a prolific author on card magic. How about Charlie Miller? If you don't know those names, then you're not qualified to form an opinion on who is "notable" in magic and who is not.

<li>I understand your position now. Expertise in a subject is defined by how much you've participated in Wikipedia and how well you can use google. Brilliant. Now THAT'S how you build a reliable reference source. By the way, Karl Fulves has written more than a dozen books on magic and produced three of the most influential periodicals in magic-- The Pallbearers Review, Epilogue and The Chronicles. But you didn't find that from searching newspapers online, did you? Probably because the only people that care about that would be people who are knowledable about the subject at hand. See my point?

<li>We are not <i>building a reliable reference source</i> with your input since you have made no material contribution to the project besides this AfD.

<li>"Comment'**** JJay-- you've made it pretty clear that you determine who is "notable" in a field based on press clippings and from what you can find out from behind your keyboard.

<li>It's not useful for anyone doing serious research on historical/professional magicians to come across articles about amateur magicians because they have been linkfarmed into valid magic articles. That "aladin" would appear on a list among the likes of Houdini, Copperfield or even David Blane is utterly ridiculous.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- on all of the above.
<dl>
<dd>I've managed a look at the Times article (being coy, lest the copyright police swoop) and it does state as fact a number of the items that we can't substantiate with google. But I *still don't believe it*. Sorry. The only thing that the writer of that article knew for certain was that aladin was a youth-worker. All the rest of it seems to be repeating claims that aladin made to the writer. But if he had put on a magic show in India that had a cast of 800 magicians and was watched by a billion people (one sixth of the population of the planet, right?), surely there would be some record of it in google? Is there <i>any</i> TV show on record with a demonstrated viewership of one billion? Is there <i>any</i> Magic Academy of Bangalore?</dd>
<dd>Googling furiously, I found the following curious note in ExpressIndia:
<dl>
<dd>Muthukad, who is popularly known as India’s Houdini, also runs the Gopinath Muthukad Magic Academy in Thiruvananthapuram, the first of its kind in Asia. "Magic with a mission" is the slogan of his institution. <a href="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=104609" class="external autonumber" title="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=104609" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If the Magic Academy of Bangalore is so famous that a billion people watched the show it sponsored, how is it that ExpressIndia doesn't know that there is another magic academy in India?</dd>
<dd>Plus, I can't replicate much of anything in the article on aladin's supposed father, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a>. Certainly nothing that proves that he <i>is</i> aladin's father, or that various details given in the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a> article are true. There are details that could have only been supplied by a fabulist -- or possibly a family member who edits from sockpuppet accounts, and may be prone to exaggeration.</dd>
<dd>I was originally trusting, but the more research I do, the more alarm bells go off. I know that it's upsetting for people to admit that they've been conned, but aladin seems like a con. A con who edits vanity articles from sockpuppet accounts. Possibly a notable con, but con nonetheless. I don't think it makes any sense to trust a conman just because he's South Asian, or argue that it's prejudice to distrust him.

<li>JJay, the only thing in that article that the reporter said that she personally witnessed was aladin interacting with some youths in a slum. I believe that she witnessed that. It's possible, and I have no reason to think that she would lie about what she had SEEN. (Of course, journos have done that -- does the name Jayson Blair ring a bell? -- but I see no motive here.) However, given that she reports as fact extremely dubious material that she can only have gotten from her interviewee, I think she's too darn trusting. Gullible. Journos can be. A friend of mine who was a magazine reporter wrote a long crusading article about a man who had a land claim against the state of Hawai'i, a claim based on supposed Hawaiian historical facts. I trusted the friend until I spent hours in the archives trying to chase down the "facts". I found that my friend had believed the claimant without checking anything, and that the claimant had been b!llsh!tting him. JJay, your faith in journos is misplaced. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In the last few months, the credibility of Wikipedia has been questioned and I had no basis on which to form an opinion either way, since I really don't have any specific academic credentials. However, if this article is kept then I will sadly conclude that Wikipedia is not a reliable reference source. I could make that conclusion based on the fact that *I DO* have the expertise to judge whether or not someone is a "notable magician"-- and people who *DO NOT* have those qualifications are making editorial decisions based on magazine articles rather than extensive knowledge of the subject at hand. Wikipedia may be accurate in the Scientific realm, but if this aricle is kept, I will have no doubt that it's usless in every other sense. --Steven Youell<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.7.141.95 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.7.141.95.html" title="User talk:68.7.141.95">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.7.141.95_a6c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.7.141.95">contribs</a>) 20:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Mm, i was pointing out that micronations arent inherently unnotable.

<p><b>Why are no other micronations tolerated on Wikipedia?</b> This is crud about some guy that did a TV show. That makes it important? Wikipedia hates this kind of stuff! Look at the number of micronations that tried to add themselves to the list of micronations, none of them were tolerated! Why should Lovely? Becuase it was on TV? Is Sealand the only Micronation that has a page? There are hundreds of micronations on the internet, mabye three on wikipedia? Keep the pattern.

<li>The show kicks off in a week from today, so what would be the point of deleting the wikipedia now only to update the show's status in a mere 7 days? Besides the fact that MySpace hosts BANDS...how would that help? it'd be useless! Wikipedia is a free encyclodpedia for everyone's use, and if they wish to add a description of their show on it without quite advertising it then it's their right! Tell me, what's the difference between wikipedia's pages for "The Light Side of the Moon" and "Whose Line is it Anyways?" Sure they haven't had the chance Whose Line had, but if you're offended by this in any way by this, DON'T WATCH THEIR SHOW! Leave 'em alone! Everyone's got a point of view, and a right to bear their own opinions, but why don't we all save those up for bigger, more important issues, eh? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.219.168.45 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.219.168.45_7f17.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.219.168.45">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>It's not patent nonsense, because it is comprehensible. It's just a joke article, aimed at some woman called Rebecca Coyle and full of what are clearly in-jokes.

<li><b>Delete it to Hell</b> it's first creation was a mistake, now it's a big mistake. The album has yet to be titled. It's an illusion created by the "fake" mandy moore site apparently. It should be deleted at least until Mandy Moore post it on her site. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParys_d8c8.html" title="User:Parys">Parys</a></li>
<li><b>Move</b> to Mandy Moore's fifth studio album and <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Moore_af54.html" title="Mandy Moore">Mandy Moore</a> following a complete removal of all the information (and the album cover) that originated from <a href="http://www.media-press-release.com/release-69.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.media-press-release.com/release-69.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.media-press-release.com/release-69.htm</a>, as well as the external "Hey!" lyrics link. The direct quotes from Moore and the list of people she collaborated with on the album are from reliable sources, however, and probably deserve a mention in Moore's article (at least until the actual title of the album is announced).

<li><b>Comment</b>. What objective truth? That they are not notable enough? A couple other constants such as Eric and Maggie, and especially Ivette had a far-reaching effect on the show and are alot more well-known by casual tv viewers than Ashlea.

<li>I have no problem with articles on game show contestants. Big Brother's ratings average 8-9 million per week. Compare that with published authors who are eligible for an article according to guidelines with book sales above 5,000.

<li><b>Keep</b> for being on a major hit show. Reality contestants on a show aren't the same as Jeopardy, as they are "characters" on a show, with a closer analogy to an actor of a hit TV show (e.g. for a hit sitcom or drama we might have articles on the character and the actor, in reality TV, the two are one). Generally, Jeopardy contestants have no national mainstream published sources of information about the lives of the contestants outside of the show, and little independent stuff about the show. In cases where a Jeopardy contestant receives sufficiently high levels of mainstream media coverage, relating to their show, and life outside the show, they may well qualify for a bio article. People do follow, in the press, the lives of these reality contestants, like it or not. Finally, I suggest more recent precedent is to keep an article like this (though not consistently). But, it probably would be good to discuss at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> some mention of reality show contestants. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not the type of case where the professor test is applicable. Viera Scheibner seems to lead some kind of campaign against vaccination which has made her known and controversial. She may be on the fringe as a scientist, but that is not a reason to delete the article, just to make sure it is NPOV. <i>"Dr. Viera Scheibner is a retired micropalaeontologist, without any formal training in health-related sciences, who tours the world claiming that vaccines are ineffective and dangerous and lead to a host of ills such as cancer and asthma. Professionals in public health or the clinical arena are from time to time called upon to publicly respond to her, or similar, claims disseminated during tours of Europe, North America or Australasia and in books and articles."</i> <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/virology/mby480/lectures/Scheibner.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.utoronto.ca/virology/mby480/lectures/Scheibner.pdf" rel="nofollow">Julie Leask, Peter McIntyre, "Public opponents of vaccination: a case study", <i>Vaccine</i> 21 (2003), 4700–4703</a> (PDF) If scientists feel a need to analyse and discuss her in scientific journals and respond to her publicly, that makes her notable enough. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Up+land</a> 22:33, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>One of their main fears is publicity for her research into cot-death and vaccination using a special cot monitor http://www.whale.to/v/scheibner.html which proved the vaccination cot-death connection, no mention at all.

<li>I don't care whether she is right or not (and the article certainly should not express the POV that she is right), but the fact that she is controversial for something makes her a reasonable candidate for an article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Up+land</a> 10:52, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm in favor of keeping this, although I hope it doesn't fall foul of Ombudsman's usual tactics. People need to know that this lady has no relevant qualifications, since she is commonly cited as a medical doctor by anti-vaccinationists or by parents who've been suckered into these things. Even when this bio first appeared, however, Ombudsman went straight in to remove this critical information, as he has done with so many of these biogs intended to create (a false) sense that there is a body of medical opinion which thinks, eg that MMR causes behavioral problems. Probably, we'll end up having to rely on the drug industry to provide the staff time necessary to watch all this stuff, which will be a shame. Before long maybe someone could make up a page of all these characters - Scheibner, the Geiers, Yazquack, Wakefield, Bradstreet and all that crowd - and people will get a real good sense of what's happening. 86.129.115.248 17:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: 'No relevent qualifications' is <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a>, and gives the impression you need a medical (allopathic) education to form a sound opinion on vaccination, which is complete nonsense of course, but a belief medical people like to spread and fertilise, for obvious reasons. And it is completely untrue that 'she is commonly cited as a medical doctor by anti-vaccinationists'. I have been in this game for 10 years, and I can't recall one instance of that, that may have happened with a parent but so what, that is an easy mistake to make for a newcomer, and anyway, it gives the false impression being an MD is an advantage, when the medical education would be more of a hinderance. Also it gives the impression people are lying to make a better case, when any idiot can work out the truth doesn't need to lie. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 19:19, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

So if John intends to use this new page <b>instead</b> of including long lists of individual critics, I think this page is valuable.

<dd>Ten, I think that is a productive solution, but because John isn't the only person affected, I'd rather get consensus before changing the template.

Perhaps it would make sense to replace pox party with <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">Vaccination critics</a>. If nobody objects, then if this page survives VfD, then I'll make that substitution. I think Ombudsman supports the direction we're headed (he left a kind note on my talk page about it) but let's give him some time to respond. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 16:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd prefer a page like this that doesn't get shafted by allopaths, and a link from <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a> (which is an allopath page when I looked at it) and a page with a foot in both camps which doesn't appeal to me much, so I'd prefer a link here and to keep off that page, myself. Are you suggesting I limit my pages to individual vaccine critics? I think a page like this with all the books listed along with the organisations is valuable to offset the bias on all of the vaccine pages, and vaccine disease pages. I may try and add 'the alternative view' to those pages but it will be a battle to get one or two lines in, let alone a header. I could put the alternative view (naturopathy, nutritional med, and homeopathy) for mumps and measles, for example, here and save all those edit wars on those pages. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 19:48, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The critics page would serve well as a hub for the template. As it stands, there is nothing else resembling a centralized nexus where a clear account of vaccine criticism is available. Surely, this article will eventually cover epidemiological vs clinical perspectives, data manipulation, pathologies related to <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> (e.g., <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>). Maybe, when the Age of Autism has receded into the rear view mirror, hopefully by the dawn of the next century, this page will no longer be so necessary, except as an historical footnote. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 02:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You would say that, you are the main hub for allopath/medical butchering of vaccine/allopathy criticism. The vaccine controversy page is a half way house controlled by vaccinators, so a link to a proper page on vaccination criticism is a good solution, but I don't expect them to give in without a fight, as vaccine criticism has been well suppressed for 150 years or so, which begs the question---what are they afraid of if vaccination is safe and effective????? Surely they would like everything to be out in the open to show vaccination is above reproach? <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 10:24, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This page seems to have sprung from the seemingly intractable RfC on whale.to on <a href="../../../m/m/r/Talk%7EMMR_vaccine_7f6b.html" title="Talk:MMR vaccine">Talk:MMR vaccine</a>. Basically, the RfC was meant to determine the appropriateness of whale.to for external linking on a variety of sites. Several editors suggested that whale.to receive its own page in lieu of links on the multitude of topics that whale.to objects to. Personally, if having its own page stops <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> from spamming it on the medical pages, I'd support <b>keeping</b> it. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 04:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll <b>abstain</b> for now, but I have a question for John that may help us work through these issues. You keep adding links to your <a href="http://whale.to" class="external free" title="http://whale.to" rel="nofollow">http://whale.to</a> website to many, many medical Wikipedia pages. Are you doing this because you believe whale.to is currently a notable resource, or because you are hoping it becomes a notable resource in the future? --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcadian_5c4b.html" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> 17:15, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't added any links for weeks, I'll be back in the saddle in a week or so. I did a Wiki page some time ago which had a few links pointing out the allopaths game, and I'll update that in due course, eg deleting pages I have done such as Lily Loat, and attemting to delete these <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viera_Scheibner_10a0.html" title="Viera Scheibner">Viera Scheibner</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination_critics.html" title="Vaccination critics">Vaccination critics</a>, that one took an hour to do. While I have been off whale.to for a few weeks, for various reasons, I have been doing Wiki pages, eg <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Anti-Vaccination_League_e1b9.html" title="National Anti-Vaccination League">National Anti-Vaccination League</a>, started this one <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harris_Coulter_7642.html" title="Harris Coulter">Harris Coulter</a>, so I may do more of that as Wiki certainly needs more of a balanced viewpoint as nearly all of the vaccine pages and vaccine disease pages (for starters) are purely allopathic thinking, with no vaccine criticism allowed, and I enjoy doing that. I did manage to create <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Kalokerinos_9e2b.html" title="Archie Kalokerinos">Archie Kalokerinos</a> and put his vitamin C cot death prevention on the SIDS page---after a big battle on the Talk MMR page (not sure that was worth the talk). But at least he seems to be still up there, fingers crossed. I may put a link to the Wiki page I have done on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Anti-Vaccination_League_5236.html" title="The National Anti-Vaccination League">The National Anti-Vaccination League</a>, rather than duplicating it on whale.to. That needed doing and I doubt I would have done it if I hadn't come here, so that is one plus point. I have the books on the shelf. I can't see Wiki ever improving on my pages eg Scheibner <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/scheibner.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/scheibner.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, unless you have a document facility, and can keep the allopaths from deleting them or the links. As to your query about whale being a notable resource, I feel (IMO) it is the most valuable resource on medicine on the internet, right now, but i don't expect anyone who hasn't done the research I've done to see that, especially allopaths for obvious reasons, the main reason being the lack of real knowledge of most people who have been fed propaganda, like I was. (Medical) Truth is very simple, but really annoying to man, as Goethe said. I have the best vaccine document resource on the internet, especially smallpox. I have taken apart vaccination already, so any additions will be gilding the lily, but I will have all the relevent smallpox books up there one day, as I like to be thorough. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">john</a> 23:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
