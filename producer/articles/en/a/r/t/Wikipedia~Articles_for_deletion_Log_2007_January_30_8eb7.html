<p>I'm concerned about the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> of this topic. After quickly searching on search engines for the band information, Wikipedia was the only source listed in top results. The article has no references except for some external links of which none, being written by third parties, specifically mention the band. Additionally the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability</a> is highly controversial. Other than the external links (of no value to this debate) can the authors present any evidence this topic deserves an article? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 05:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- any unverifiable information should be removed, of course, but there's plenty of sources linked from the article that provide verification of key facts. Notability criteria requires multiple non-trivial independent reliable published sources to have discussed the subject -- I count at least three in the external links section. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Not enough notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. RE:JulesH - three external links talking about the band doesn't signify notability. There is no number and I do not think the content of those external links justifies notability especially under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> Anonymous user. 166.153.176.215 01:28, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I think that the external links do justify the notibility of the band. What sort of evidence other than external links do you want? Notability is hard to judge based on search-engine results. Try searching less generic terms than the band name itself such as the names of the band members. Regardless, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> clearly defines that ONE(1) of the criteria be met, regardless of your personal opinion of how many must be met. And though some of the links have gone into internet archives, and should be removed, there are still several notable publications that feature articles solely based on the band and it's work. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGaryleeweinrib_5e62.html" title="User:Garyleeweinrib">Garyleeweinrib</a> 18:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Of course there is enough notability for this band listed under "External Links". I don't know what Wikipedia's notability rules are, but this article is nearly four months old. Why in the world would it be nominated for deletion after four months of no problem? Really, I find this ridiculous. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael.m.winters_dff8.html" title="User:Michael.m.winters">Michael.m.winters</a> 06:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>How do you know it's true Shudda? I'm 5th, 6th, 7th generation British and I still consider myself "NZ British". It's what I put under "other" in the census form. There is evidence for a least one other formally considering themselves NZ British - Aidan Work, the guy who created this article - and Bill Wilmot's link to Aidan's speech implies he shares the same sentiment. And we're all conservative royalists. So, tell me, are the three of us real people with real ethnicites or not??

<p>As one who did some work on this article I concede as follows. Regarding "NZ British", there seems to be a lack of source material to reference, which is sad, so I'm willing to see that incoporated into NZ European. I suppose it would be fair to even leave it right out, as there only seem to be just a few bloggers using it in common currency. I certainly count myself as NZ British, and know others I share this in common with, but it looks like I'm going to actually have to do some more research and encourage more publishing in the area myself before I can prove its validity as a 21st Century NZ ethnic group.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I vote for merging with NZ European but would like to see a reference retained in NZ European discussing the fact it is used by the likes of myself, Wilmot &amp; Work (conservatives &amp; royalists).<a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.Chesswas_db9b.html" title="User:A.J.Chesswas">A.J.Chesswas</a> 14:55, 30 January 2007 (NZT)</li>

<dd>doesn't British (in this context) <i>imply</i> European? You couldn't, (in the context of 19th and early 20th century Britain) be from Britain <i>without</i> being from Europe, but you could be from Europe without being from Britain.

<p>This would only be true if the two races have been thoroughly assimilated. It would be easy to argue they have been assimilated, but in saying that it would be more linguistically and culturally accurate to say Europeans were assimilated into British culture, and thus the term used should be NZ British, not NZ European. It's a political mess, the etymology of NZ European, but I suppose you are right - NZ British and NZ European are the same thing - Pakeha - but for some reason NZ European has become a preferred term. However I will continue to identify myself as NZ British, as do others, and I think it is quite strange that British ethnic identity has been so sidelined in this country. - <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.Chesswas_db9b.html" title="User:A.J.Chesswas">A.J.Chesswas</a> 08:00, 31 January 2007 (NZT)</p>

<p>A1, A2 and A3 are imaginary designations of major motorways in Serbia, which are actually designated <b>only</b> by their European route numbers (such as E-70, E-75 etc.) <a href="http://www.dzp.co.yu/pdf/serbia_main_and_regional_road.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dzp.co.yu/pdf/serbia_main_and_regional_road.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - this constitutes a case of original research and affects the whole article, as motorway which is designated as A1 here, in fact consists of section of E-70 and section of E-75 motorways. While not disputing a need for original and new designations of Serbian motorways, this article is simply inaccurate and, perhaps, only wishful thinking. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelosh_65b5.html" title="User:Meelosh">Meelosh</a> 00:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let me try to explain once again if I wasn't clear enough - not only that designations (A1, A2, A3) are imaginary. Real trouble is that <i>real</i> E-75 road in Serbia consists of "A2", part of "A1", and also of a stretch of the road which is not covered by these articles. Thus, a simple rename would just not suffice - only alternative I can see to deletion is <b>merge and rename</b>, which would also require an extensive update to the info in the article. In fact, since these pages are not heavily used on Wikipedia (A1, for example, has only one interwiki link, apart from links to A2, A3 and relevant userpages), I was thinking that it would be better to create a new article and delete these, than to redirect from designations which have never been used in reality. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelosh_65b5.html" title="User:Meelosh">Meelosh</a> 01:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As much as I would like all this to be true, your source is a webpage <i>created by Michal Halabica</i><a href="http://motorways-exitlists.com/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://motorways-exitlists.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, with Wikipedia as its source - which just makes a better case for deletion, since already websites are coming out with wrong information thanks to our encyclopaedia. Please do check out the only official source, PE Roads of Serbia (formerly State Directorate for Roads of Serbia) <a href="http://www.dzp.co.yu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dzp.co.yu" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and their map in the nomination. All this would just go away if someone made a picture of a road sign with designations A1, A2 or A3. However, that's impossible since they don't exist - would you accept several pictures of signs (without those designations) on these stretches of the roads as proof of otherwise? Or an email from the directorate? <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelosh_65b5.html" title="User:Meelosh">Meelosh</a> 13:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see how do you see that the website uses Wikipedia as a source, but OK, agree that a single amateur website isn't much of a source. I'd just want to say that:
<ul>
<li>I have a hard time imagining why would someone make this up completely;</li>
<li>the designations are consistent with those of surrounding countries (see <a href="../../../a/1/_/A1.html#A1_Roads" title="A1">A1#A1 Roads</a>);</li>
<li>the designations are consistent with those for other roads in Serbia (M# for magistral roads so logically A# for highways);</li>
<li>the fact that they are not used by the PE doesn't mean that they aren't used at all: for example, they may be formerly used designations, which still deserve a mention.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Merge salvageable contents into (new) Highways in Serbia</b>. Several issues:<br />
1) European routes <a href="../../../e/7/5/E75.html" title="E75">E75</a> and <a href="../../../e/7/0/E70.html" title="E70">E70</a>, and our articles, are too general, and describe more or less "corridors" rather than real infrastructure objects.<br />
2) The highways exist, but they're not officially named "A1" and "A2" and "A3" (nor anyone in Serbia calls them like that); I think that the site referenced by Nikola is a Wiki, more or less (see the bottom of <a href="http://motorways-exitlists.com/europe/srb/serbia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://motorways-exitlists.com/europe/srb/serbia.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>).

However, as Meelosh said, as of 2007, <b>continuous</b> pieces of highways are like A1/A2/A3 rather than like E70/E75.

<p>Despite research I cannot verify Reichsfolk actually exists as an organization.

<li><b>Tricky</b> Here's at least one scholarly reference that mentions Reichsfolk <a href="http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/history/staff/griffin/fasrelnat.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/history/staff/griffin/fasrelnat.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> albeit in passing. It's by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Griffin_2160.html" title="Roger Griffin">Roger Griffin</a>, who seems to be somewhat of an authority. However, given the nature of the organization, it's quite likely we won't get much more in the way of convincing coverage. Of course, there are tons of extreme right-wing forums mentioning Reichsfolk but that's clearly not reliable coverage as they're probably all echoing each other, or even echoing Wikipedia. It's also quite possible that although the organization exists, it consists of two or three wackos who found a cool name to refer to themselves. All in all, I'd have to&#160;!vote for deletion based on lack of sources supporting the actual importance of Reichsfolk even among right-wing extremists. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I think he seems to be notable as a minor dot-com celebrity who weathered the storm, although he is getting less attention now.

<li>If there were any justice in the world the result here would be <b>delete</b>. The test is not "non-triviality" but "notability." Nothing indicates that Fest, as apart from quickbrowse.com or metabrowsing generally, is notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article only motivates for the notability of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabrowsing.html" title="Metabrowsing">metabrowsing</a>. Unfortunately for Mr Fest his inventions/products are far more notable than he is. His other minor work is completely non-notable and shouldn't even be in the article in the first place, in fact the article <i>still</i> sounds like a form of promotion for the subject in question. Most of the info is referenced from the Quickbrowse website itself, which is not an <b>independent</b> source. Notability of the <i>person himself</i> has not been proven through coverage in "multiple 3rd-party non-trivial reliable references". <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 12:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry, this article was earlier nominated for deletion, under the name YA Entertainment (Entertainment Company) on 12 January 2007. The article was then deleted on 19 January 2007. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_YA_Entertainment_%28Entertainment_Company%29_e879.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/YA Entertainment (Entertainment Company)">The results of the previous delete can be found here.</a> Basically, the reasons are very similar. In summary, the original contributor of the now-deleted article was copying text and images from YA Entertainment's web site, and was not providing sufficient information to prove that she indeed obtain permission from YAE to use the material. The behavior of this person was suspicious, where at times she even attempted to socket puppet the editing. To add to the reason, several of us suspect that one or more users have grouped together and are trying to re-resurrect the article for only professional gain of the company. According to <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOncamera_ef1a.html" title="User:Oncamera">User:Oncamera</a> in the discussions page, he's observed similarities between the users working on the article, including the IP addresses, as well as the timing of the edits being so close together. It appears to be a group effort. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroink_9787.html" title="User:Groink">Groink</a> 06:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. Although everything about this article's re-creation is suspicious to me, the reason for me saying delete is the lack of notability. <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOncamera_ef1a.html" title="User:Oncamera">User:Oncamera</a> has made a sound argument for it on YA's talk page. Also, I think List of YA Entertainment Releases should be nominated along with this page as well, for the exact same reasons. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 07:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - As the author of this article I understand all about nobility and I cannot prove anymore than what I have given. I would like to mention that this group is unique and should be kept. I don't think that they will ever reach nobility under wikipedia standards, but when everything else has been written that is nobile, all that is left is uniqueness. for you who have to edit and scan these documents that can be a big pain. Delete it if you must, but please consider the uniqueness of the group. Duffylaudick 15:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are plenty of references although few quality ones in English. I've added one from <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio-Canada_c3ce.html" title="Radio-Canada">Radio-Canada</a>. In any case, Thomas Hellman isn't a "borderline pass": he's gotten plenty of media coverage in Quebec <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Thomas+Hellman%22+singer&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Thomas+Hellman%22+singer&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">in English</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=+%22Thomas+Hellman%22+chanteur&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=+%22Thomas+Hellman%22+chanteur&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">in French</a>.

<dd><b>Extra comment</b> I'd also like to suggest that whoever put up the prod tag with the rational "NN-artist" should do his homework next time around. The external links that were there at the time all contained perfectly verifiable references to multiple shows in Quebec and in France, as well as perfectly reliable links showing that he had recorded two albums. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep pending independent published references provided in article</b> Per above, it sounds like there are probably some independently published articles about this person that can be used as references. However, they should be included in the article. As the article currently stands, it has insufficient independent references <i>within the article</i> to establish notability. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>Well I added one link in French which is from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> which is third-party and meets all our requirements for reliable sources. What else do we really need? <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 01:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The link you added is a start, but are there any published articles or interviews with this guy (aside from blogs, etc)? Also, the link looks to be a short paragraph about the musician but (as my French is lacking) I can't tell if it's something written about him by an independent source or is a blurb submitted to the site by the singer's publicist. Normally you want to have multiple (ie more than one) independent published references talking about the person to verify the information is both notable and not autobiographically biased. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look, I really don't have any interest in developing the article. All I'm saying is that there is clearly more than enough third-party coverage to justify keeping the article. We can tag it with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnref_47af.html" title="Template:Unref">unref</a>}} if need be. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if you're not developing the article, then someone will have to. I'm personally getting out of the habit of using unref tags, though, since technically unreferenced articles are supposed to be deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:07, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, you might want to review the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. If the article is lacking in references, the article should be tagged as such and references added by whomever is bothered by that absence. If, however, it is established that sources on the subject are so scarce and unreliable that the content is unverifiable, then the article should be deleted. As people keep saying: if we start deleting unreferenced content on Wikipedia, you can say goodbye to 50% of the database. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And saying goodbye to the unreferenced and unverified portions of the database would be a problem because...? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, one more thing. It's not the responsibility of the person tagging the article to add references. It's the responsibility of the <i>author</i> of the information that is unreferenced. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="WP:V">"The burden of evidence lies primarily with the editor who adds or restores material"</a> And unreferenced material <i>can be</i>, and often is, deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:07, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, all I'm saying is that the overwhelming consensus and practice is that unreferenced articles are routinely kept and tagged, whereas unreference-able articles are not. You may or may not agree with that practice but that's not what this debate is about. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:54, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the author has a responsibility to provide the references up front as much as possible. The original author does not, however, <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the article, and therefore does not necessarily have any special responsibility to monitor the article on an ongoing basis to see if his or her work is being challenged by others. <i>Especially</i> when the original author was an anon IP — you can invent all the theoretical responsibilities you want, but do you really think an anon IP's going to honour them? If you find it insufficiently referenced, then nothing's stopping you from taking on the job — maybe it's not your <i>responsibility</i> to do so, but it sure as hell ain't mine or Pascal's, either. So if <i>somebody</i> has to do it, but <i>nobody</i> has any particular <i>responsibility</i> to take it on themselves, then where does that leave us? It leaves us at "if you see something that needs doing, you may as well go ahead and do it yourself since it's right in front of you", that's where. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 11:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kittybrewster is unaware of any relationship to/with the subject. If Darcy can substantiate this false allegation then several people would be delighted. The article was created to blue a red link. I agree that the article would benefit from additional references and they will be added when time allows (meaning quite soon). The red link was created by another editor and several editors have contributed to the article. I did draw one person's attention to the afd but s/he has not yet contributed. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 21:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Robert M. Arbuthnot was lead trial counsel in the seminal case of Tarasoff v. U.C. Regents, 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976), which was the first U.S. case to impose liability on a psychotherapist for not disclosing a patient's violent propensities. This has completely altered the landscape of the psychotherapist-patient relationship and privilege, as well as malpractice law.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Reasons for Deletion:</li>
</ul>
<p>This album is clearly a fake,or unofficial copy with the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) The album has not been on any official sources/announcements such as on <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utada.html" title="Utada">Utada</a>'s homepage, or any branch of Toshiba-Emi-including Foozay Inc. Or has been announced on Utada's English Record Company- Island Def Jam.</p>
<p>2) The album's track listing is faulty, the "Hotel Lobby" Remix, is a Fan-made remix provided by a fan from Utada-online.net</p>
<p>3) The picture used for the "cover" of the album, was used for promotion of other materials back almost 2 years.</p>
<p>4) The actual official album <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> was released almost 2 years ago.</p>
<p>5) This album has already been re-released, did not sell in America, there would be no point in re-re-releasing and unsuccessful album.</p>
<p>6) I have been a fan of <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utada.html" title="Utada">Utada</a> since 2003, I have kept up with her most recent materials to date, which would be <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_Of_Life_c2e7.html" title="Flavor Of Life">Flavor Of Life</a>- I have never heard of, nor rumor of "Exodus+ " until I saw this clearly fake article.</p>
<p>7) All of Utada's materials have released on the day countries normally release music, as for US and Japan it's Tuesdays/Wednesdays, this "album" appears to be released on a Monday.All the following was by --<a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUthipratuma_1498.html" title="User:Uthipratuma">Uthipratuma</a> 03:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In response to those claims (in order)</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Yes it has. I uploaded a screenshot at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:UtadaExodusPlusNews.PNG" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:UtadaExodusPlusNews.PNG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:UtadaExodusPlusNews.PNG</a> oh, and PLEASE, <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utada_Hikaru_973d.html" title="Utada Hikaru">Utada Hikaru</a>'s official page on wikipedia has SEVERAL missing citations, so should we delete her page too?</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>2. Maybe she got a copyright or permission to use the remix, That has happened before in some of her singles (You Make me Want to be a Man is an example)</p>
<p>3. She's probably using old promotion beacause it's a speacial edition of an old album; Many artists use old promotion art for re-releases of old albums.</p>
<p>4. Yes, we all know that, it has nothing to do with the special edition re-release.</p>
<p>5. No, it was re-released for japan. Even if it was re-released for the U.S., making a special edition of an album would make dedciated <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utada.html" title="Utada">Utada</a> fans buy the album again, so it's actually a very smart marketing tool. <i>Edit</i>: I MEANT EXODUS, NOT EXODUS+</p>
<p>6. I'm glad your a fan, so you should know artists CAN keep information from leaking. Albeit strange that information wasn't available, it would still make sense because she obviously meant this album to be special release; like a "golden ticket". Releasing information as soon as the album comes out might be odd, but is perfectly believable.</p>
<p>7. Remember, it was not "released" on January 28, it was made available with certain copies of Exodus, so maybe editing the article to say "made avaialble January 28" instead of "released on Januray 28" should be done; deleting the article is completely opposite.</p>
<p>I can't speak for <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utada.html" title="Utada">Utada</a>, so if she decides to make a special edition of an album, only able to get through certain copies, that's her business. I do think the article needs some editing, but deleting is not one of those edits. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtistthatneverwas_fa5a.html" title="User:Artistthatneverwas">Artistthatneverwas</a> 02:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Important response</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In response to your claims:</p>
<p>Nope, stop with this FALSE information, you just have a bad bootleg then, because I just checked the official site, you, or someone else, just edited that "source". The exact same REAL site has none of that on it, link below. Also having spelled "Certian" and "Januray" wrong. Also to mention the grammar is horribly set with random capitalizations.</p>
<p>As to the comment on Utada's Wiki....at least it has citation's on at least 90% of the article, your Exodus+ article page on the other hand, does not.</p>
<p>"5. No, it was re-released for japan. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtistthatneverwas_fa5a.html" title="User:Artistthatneverwas">Artistthatneverwas</a> 02:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>You also said it was only re-released for Japan, if so, why is it on the USA site- to which you gave this as a source, which is proven fake.</p>

<li>This release is crap. Completely false, untrue, just get rid of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>'Screenshot' of the official site was clearly tampered with. There is nothing like that on the official site. And actually, the newest bit of news on the official site says "Japan Tour Confirmed!". That appears in the spot where the 'apparent news' of this 'release' is seen on the 'screenshot'. Clearly, the screenshot was taken from the site, then the "Japan Tour" news tidbit was edited out, and this 'new news' was edited in. If the site was actually updated with news of any new release, the "Japan Tour" news would have been shifted down to where we see "Utada Featured in American Magazine", like all the news updates have done since the site opened. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESora-kara_a8bc.html" title="User:Sora-kara">Sora-kara</a></p>

<li>I'm not exactly sure what to say. The screenshot above is an OBVIOUS fake, none of hikki's websites have any information on it, and the person who started this article (<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtistthatneverwas_fa5a.html" title="User:Artistthatneverwas">Artistthatneverwas</a>) has also started other meaningless articles, like Emily Grutz (which was deleted) and has uploaded copyrighted photos and pictures that aren't used at all, which have also been deleted. So, when I saw that this user made this page, I would be quick to delete it. The only problem is that one of my friends who recently ordered Exodus also got a different album with it, with the cover art as shown, labeled Exodus+. Now, I'm not saying that the Exodus+ page isn't a hoax, but I don't think that the article should be deleted just yet. I actually went back to the post office where my friend's copy of Exodus+ came from, and they said it came directly from the sender (at amazon.com). I'm confused. Is this, or isn't it a hoax?</li>

I think not.
<dl>
<dd>You're forgetting that the album ONLY COMES WITH CERTAIN ORDERS OF EXODUS!!! It is not for sale individually. And you checked all the japanese sites anyway, EXODUS is an American album, so you wont find it on the japanese sites. Exodus+ is like Willy Wonka's Golden Ticket, it comes as a special album with a 20 page booklet inside. featuring lyrics, and additional pictures. I can scan the back of the album and take pics. would you like me to? It will show the copyright info. THEN they're will be official proof that it exists. Unfortunately, I won't have acess to a camera/scanner until after 3:00 (I'm at school right now). So, I WILL HAVE PROOF SOON ENOUGH. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtistthatneverwas_fa5a.html" title="User:Artistthatneverwas">Artistthatneverwas</a> 10:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>'tis not fake. You just haven't seen the news post - however, I'm afraid that the screeshot is the only evidence me and artistthatneverwas (let's refer to him as 'Jacovie' for now) have. Jacovie checked the site just this morning - and the page he took a screenshot of was gone. Of course, he was indignant, as that was some of his only proof, besides his own copy of Exodus+ (which he now keeps in a glass case). And besides, Jacovie isn't skilled enough to tamper with a screenshot - I know this for a fact. As skilled as he is, he's not good enough to do that. And the school computer he used had practically no extra programs at all.</dd>

But when it comes down to it, despite some media attention, this is someone accused of a relatively run-of-the-mill felony who may or not have some very controversial opinions. There is no Wikipedia:Notability (criminals) that I know of, so let's hash this one out. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 03:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually everything in that article is verifiable in reliable sources with the exception of two things:
<dl>
<dd>1.)The "counter argument" to the U.S. attorney's "seed money for larger criminal enterprise" theory. Added by another editor, it may well be verifiable, but I haven't checked the sources yet.</dd>
<dd>2.)Those things that were directly quoted from the blog but no longer exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I know this because I've been working on this on the weekends and my next step was to figure out which sources to cite for which points. I'm also new to wikipedia, and not sure how heavy a citation method need to be employed, citation being very inconsistent over the whole 'pedia, but every section that was revised under my signature can be traced to multiple sources of record that are also readily available online. Again, I'm new to wikipedia, but I find it strange that someone can begin a challenge with an unfounded claim against the article's verifiable matter. Rather than say make a blanket judgement of "much of what is here" why not bring up your concerns of veracity on the discussion page?</dd>
<dd>As for the "run-of-the-mill"-ness claim versus the participating authors' claim to Sommer's significance, I find the objector's frank dismissal fairly callous. In your book, bank robberies perpetrated by groups consisting of mostly active duty rangers employing automatic weapons allegedly smuggled back from Iraq, possibly under a political pretext (or at least the ringleader is lodging a political pretext as the core to his defense) is somehow run-of-the-mill? At the <i>very least</i> Sommers figures as an illustration of American culture so affected by the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_prison_abuse_scandals.html" title="Iraq prison abuse scandals">Iraq prison abuse scandals</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_site.html" title="Black site">Black site</a> scandel mythology (not to mention the tarnishing of the military's reputation in many eyes post <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Tillman_719d.html" title="Pat Tillman">Pat Tillman</a>, and Sy Hersch's journalistic numbers of <a href="../../../t/a/s/Task_Force_121_c90d.html" title="Task Force 121">Task Force 121</a>) that a run-of-the-mill criminal is using that political climate to extradite himself from a extradition, so to speak. In other words, at the very least he's a sort of zeitgeist figure. By the way, there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_bank_robbers_and_robberies.html" title="List of famous bank robbers and robberies">List of famous bank robbers and robberies</a> which Sommers could easily fall under, due to his background, media attention, and (at the least) unorthodox extradition defense.</dd>
<dd>By your logic, I fear all the articles on military personnel facing court martials for run of the mill dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming charges in opposition to the war (<a href="../../../e/h/r/Ehren_Watada_d8f7.html" title="Ehren Watada">Ehren Watada</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Hinzman_79e1.html" title="Jeremy Hinzman">Jeremy Hinzman</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Paredes_201b.html" title="Pablo Paredes">Pablo Paredes</a> etc.]].--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesesteak_the_Impaler_e2a1.html" title="User:Cheesesteak the Impaler">Cheesesteak the Impaler</a> 04:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Please note that an article like this (see <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for the relevant policy) has to be sourced with extreme care; I would recommend using the &lt;ref&gt; markup described at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and connecting everything to established media sources; I don't see how you can reference the blog.

<dd>My contestation of your nomination is also measured and neutral, but does find some flaws in the thinking the nomination is predicated upon. I am aware of the extreme care sourcing requires, which is why I have saved it for another weekend (editing it out of its original form into something that resembled coherence was my first priority). I have no problem ridding the blog section that is no longer verifiable (though I'll poke around archive.org before I do so), though a lot of it has been quoted and encapsulated in a lot of media outlets, but what matter is only in the section of the article that directly discusses his blog. Lastly, I believe wikipedia's coverage of other run-of-the-mill military delinquents as I sighted, and a number of pages collecting perpetrators of noteworthy crimes, including bankrobbery, serves as an initial if not definitive counterargument to your run-of-the-mill dismissal. I'm not critiquing your neutrality, I am critiquing your "measure". That is, your estimation of the article's worth.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesesteak_the_Impaler_e2a1.html" title="User:Cheesesteak the Impaler">Cheesesteak the Impaler</a> 05:20, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My take is that the <b>bank robbery</b> is almost certainly notable (very few bank robbers have been <i>active duty</i> military), and in that article there should be information about all the accused, including Sommer. The information about his blog is trivial and most of this article is of little interest to someone not following every turn of the case. I'm not sure that AFD was the best choice here. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Blog portion was started when the blog was still active. Yes it needs to be updated. But deleting this file is not the best method. Lets revise it and continue from there.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Your right Chick, there may not be a category for criminals. But that is fine, considering he is not a criminal, he is an accused. The bottom line is this: whether he robbed a bank, or not; he is worthy of note because of the impact he has caused. His getting ruled a Canadian resident after being in the United States for three years is case law that will be cited in future cases for tax disputes and future extradition hearings. The fact that his platoon has had SIX felony accusations within six months, and NINE within his company speaks volumes about a larger problem within our military. I personally have interviewed Sommer and I know a lot of the deeper details to the story, but I will continue to provide facts and nothing more. However it is important to remember that unilateral action taken upon an assumption... is what started the war we are in.Powerofhistory 04:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wow. So when Special Operations Commandos, verified to be a part of one of the most protected military Task Forces since the inception of the war, rob a bank with illegal, high powered weapons... alleging that their former unit was involved with murder, rape and abuse... it isn't notible? I know Sommer quite well, I served with him in Afghanistan and I am glad that so many people have taken the time to update this, but will someone please inform me why this didn't get more media attention? North Hollywood Shootout was famous for one reason... someone pulled the trigger... And you want to pull the plug on this page because unlike the idiots in hollywood, he used intelligence and didn't go in spraying rounds... Well my two, emotionally charged cents. I never saw rape or beating, but I saw people killed legally under the Rules of Engagement that NEVER should have died.

<p>Comment: Don't believe for a second the media has not given this story enough attention -- they have, but that should not be confused with the fact that the attention has not turned into more published articles. A very big problem with information available (for the media) is that much of it is not verifiable (a hallmark of good journalism). If journalists are having trouble verifying information (and thus not reporting it), it stands to reason that the question of whether to delete this entry from wikipedia (because of lack of verification) has come up. Personally, after having spent scores and scores of hours with Elliott Sommer, I have to say that this is a most notable story and there will be far more coming of it in due course. Sure, bank robberies are every day occurrences, but you have a situation where five elite Army Rangers were allegedly involved in some degree with this particular robbery, plus two Canadian citizens. This occurred on U.S. soil by two Canadians and one dual Canadian/American. You also have the situation where Sommer made it across the border and is under house arrest, protected by extradition proceedings and claiming all the while that "if he did it", it was to draw attention to war crimes. That isn't notable? Writerdave 01:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)writerdave</p>

<dd>While this and a lot of the military vouching is interesting, nonetheless, getting direct verification from Sommer himself, participants in his alleged action, or people who have served with him would pretty much constitute original research and not something wikipedia can vette. The initial ADF call of the article was based on the false claim that many of the article's assertions couldn't be backed by reputatble sources. Reputable sources doesn't mean from the horse's mouth. It means things like "Papers of Record." The deletionist who opened this discussion is right in what an article needs (and the article needs proper citation), he was just wrong in how unsourced the info in the article is. It looks like the consensus here is to allow the article to continue to exist under the understanding that it will be revised to reflect proper citation of verifiable source material (and again, "just call him at this number" or "I was there" isn't a statement of record. It's gotta be in print or online somewhere reputable. This is why everything in the blog has to be pulled out, since with no blog to cite it's just hearsay.)--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesesteak_the_Impaler_e2a1.html" title="User:Cheesesteak the Impaler">Cheesesteak the Impaler</a> 02:45, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well said. In the mean time, let us get rid of the hideous label at the top of this page and someone who knows enough about the situation start editing. I do not feel in good conscious that I can have any part considering that in and of itself would cast serious doubt on "neutral point of view." Cheesteak, I have no idea who you are but you have taken a commanding interest in this issue. If there is information you would like put into a newspaper or another article let me know. Rolling stone is publishing in a week and a half and I may be able to answer a question in it for you if you take the time to ask ahead of time.ElliottSommer 05:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll be in touch with a more experienced wiki editor, who has some more administrative clout to make sure we're removing the tag in accordance with wiki policy, and also mentor us in proper citation formatting (I've seen footnotes, I've also seen just lists of works cited, we'll see what the "right" way to do things is to keep the article's nose clean). Also, as we start editing the article in good faith, I'll be using the discussion section particularly for source citations of various points. A lot of editors seem to have a lot of info on Sommer, I'll see if I can keep an eye on when we need to corroborate what is put forth in the article with a "reputable source." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesesteak_the_Impaler_e2a1.html" title="User:Cheesesteak the Impaler">Cheesesteak the Impaler</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheesesteak_the_Impaler_2d16.html" title="User talk:Cheesesteak the Impaler">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cheesesteak_the_Impaler_7cc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cheesesteak the Impaler">contribs</a>) 15:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li><b>keep</b> This is to long to merge. It does need sources. There is an additional major reason not to merge it: the article on Tipler is concerned primarily with his religious views. Although Tipler considers it to have religious implication, the omega point theory does not necessarily have them. It is perfectly compatible for the theory to be correct without any religious claim whatsoever. The beings who transmit their information so it exists after the postulated crunch of the universe are not therefore necessarily divine. ( I should mention that the postulated crunch is quite independent of this particular theory, is very widely supported, and does not necessarily lead to it.) This article is somewhat more general about the theory , and therefore justifiable. Whether or not is correct is not for WP to determine. Whether it is scientifically supported is irrelevant if it is widely known outside the science community, for whatever reason. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is one of those times when the first sentence of an article provides the best reason for its deletion:
<blockquote>
<p>"The main article on the early-2000s Internet phenomenon <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> contains only occurrences/incidents that obtained media coverage; this list is intended to provide a broader inclusion of AYB cultural references."</p>
</blockquote>
In other words, the main <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> article contains those references to the term that are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> This list copies those and adds trivial references. I really don't think we need to document every sign someone holds up at <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestlemania.html" title="Wrestlemania">Wrestlemania</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - (zomg, someone&#160;!voted keep)! Yes, I think this is a helpful list. This is a very culturally significant term, and many of the listings are interesting, encyclopedic, and useful (e.g., <i>In the Futurama episode Anthology of Interest II, a space invader speaks the phrase.</i>). Per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>: <i>The list may be a valuable information source</i>, I believe it applies (I know, you don't think it's valuable, but is this any less valuable then <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28slang%29.html" title="Santorum (slang)">Santorum (slang)</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Steamer_e6c5.html" title="Stanley Steamer">Stanley Steamer</a>, which the community has decided are encyclopedic?). Unfortunately, we don't have any guidelines on what a list should be, but I think this falls under it, as much as many other lists we have, and have set a precedent on WP for notability: (e.g., much more valuable than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ace_Mystery_Numeric-Series_Single_Titles_e978.html" title="List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles">List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles</a>). Keep in mind, this was a very culturally significant term in the early 00's (&lt;-- how does one pronounce that?), and the list is pertinent. If you wish to trim out unverifiable terms, I say go ahead, but keep this list. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 10:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The cultural significance of the term is what paradoxically would make this list an indiscrimate collection of information. There would be just too many references to make this article useful. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 11:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, What you say&#160;!!? Many of these items would have been left on the root article without much debate, but the size of that article warranted splitting. I think the list as a whole should stay, but needs to be further referenced, and perhaps pruned. — <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosflux_5b5b.html" title="User:Xaosflux"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>xaosflux</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaosflux_b62d.html" title="User talk:Xaosflux"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 13:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and repurpose.</b> The article's current mission is to include less-notable and borderline notable cultural references to AYB: this is a bad idea. However, if it were repurposed and pruned per Xaosflux's suggestion, it would be a good article. (If not a Good Article.) -<a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJHFTC_516e.html" title="User:JHFTC">Toptomcat</a> 13:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep but Prune</b> As annoying as the AYB phenomenon is/was, the content listed is verifiable, and follows guidelines for encyclopedic content. Some may question the usefulness of the article, or like me may just not care for the subject, but these are not valid reasons to delete, as per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nom provided an excellent analysis. That this might be "interesting", "helpful" or "useful" does not make it encyclopedic or change the fact it's trivia and an indiscriminate collection of AYB..."cruft". There is also nothing to back up any assertion that this is a "very culturally significant term". Whether or not one can measure its "value" is questionable, especially by comparing it to other articles. We're not discussing those other articles and whether or not they are encyclopedic does not affect this article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - after comparing the two articles, it looks like the best and most verifiable references are already in the main All Your Base article.

<dd>The issue isn't if the list is "interesting" or "relevant". It's that the entire list is unverified and unreferenced.

<li><b>Delete and replace</b> I'm persuaded by the argument that such a list might be useful as a standalone page.

<li><b>Delete unless references provided</b> I can personally verify that I've heard the term "mark" used in professional wrestling circles in pretty much the way described. Unfortunately, though, I'm not a source you can reference. The article will have to be deleted unless <i>published</i> references can be provided to verify information in the article. My suggestion would be for an interested editor to copy-and-paste the article to their user space as a draft article, then recreate the article once good references are found. That way you keep the information around in user space as an unverified draft, and can easily recreate the thing once the reference problem is addressed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>P.S. In reply to MLA above, I wouldn't be surprised if this is indeed related in origin to the use of the word <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_%28victim%29.html" title="Mark (victim)">Mark (victim)</a> in a con game. In essence, a mark in professional wrestling would be a fan who "buys into the way the promoter wants them to feel". A mark for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cena_3d8a.html" title="John Cena">John Cena</a>, for example, would be someone who genuinely cheers for John in the ring and genuinely boos and dislikes his "heel" opponents. I would bet that the word dates back to the days when many people didn't understand that professional wrestling matches are "fixed", and thus were in a way marks of an elaborate act.</dd>
<dd>I've also heard the term used as a verb meaning "to buy into the act", as in "My friend was totally <i>marking out</i> when he watched the return of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Backlund_30af.html" title="Bob Backlund">Bob Backlund</a> on the TNA pay-per-view last week." <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per CyberSkull. Keenspot is a definite notable (and prominent) independent host. I believe WP:WEB's relevant criterion was first made with it specifically in mind.<br />
Dragonfiend's extremely strict interpretations of policy classify this as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>, but looking at that policy page, the article draws from the primary source - the comic - without "unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories," without independent "analysis or synthesis" of material, without "advancing a position," without a "novel narrative interpretation." Aside from the brief fandom coverage, the facts in the article are unambiguously visible in the work itself. If we must blind ourselves to a work while making an article of it, then every plot description of every book, play, TV show or game on Wikipedia is immediately suspect. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 09:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The real world connection of these fictional mobile suits is that they were the primary vehicles used by the characters in a 49 half-hour episode anime series based on the successful Gundam franchise, and which in turn has a 3 episode OVA series that was later compliled as a single anime movie, three multiple-issue manga comics, and several model kit releases directly resulting from this series.</dd>
<dd>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, point 7 (Plot Summaries) - <i>Topics within a work of fiction however may not have a real-world context, and should be referred to their parent articles.</i> (<a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing_a938.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam Wing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a>, which while not the best, could be improved with the addition of further information proving it was the first Gundam anime to be translated, dubbed, and displayed into English with a mainstream release [as far as I know, I could be wrong]). I interpret this (quite liberally) as meaning that "If the parent topic can prove its importance, subarticles derive their real-world importance from the parent article, as long as the subarticles are written from an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">out of universe perspective</a>". If POV is a problem, that can be fixed through editing as opposed to deletion, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=XXXG-01W_Wing_Gundam&amp;diff=103948286&amp;oldid=103651693" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=XXXG-01W_Wing_Gundam&amp;diff=103948286&amp;oldid=103651693" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> from <a href="../../../x/x/x/XXXG-01W_Wing_Gundam_c6f7.html" title="XXXG-01W Wing Gundam">XXXG-01W Wing Gundam</a> as a possible example.

<dd>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>, point 1 (major characters) - <i>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> By the time you include the basic information and an image for visual identification, each 'suit' would add at least a screen-length to whatever article they were merged into. So, as a practical matter, it should be included in an individual article.</dd>

<p>I had my {{prod}} removed on this by an anon IP so I'm bringing this here. In my opinion the article makes no good assertion of notability per our inclusion policies, and from what I can make out one seems unlikely. Whilst <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillips_Exeter_Academy_058f.html" title="Phillips Exeter Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> is most certainly notable, I'm not sure the same can be said about their "only all-male a-capella group". The biggest assertion of notability made is that they "have performed with many college groups" (which I'm sure is true of many non-notable groups) and "gained standing in the high school a cappella community" — a fact which is unsourced.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. The fact that it has references is grounds for deletion now? We have an entire <a href="../../../d/u/n/Category%7EDungeons_%26_Dragons_standard_creatures_e8b5.html" title="Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures">category for Dungeons and Dragons creatures</a>, and all of these things are verifiable by sources whose authority within the D&amp;D context is impeccable. Personally, I'd prefer that this be merged to the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> article, since the D&amp;D satyr is obviously derivative of older mythology; but then we'd see complaints when gaming material showed up in those articles and they began to be listed in D&amp;D related categories, so separate articles for D&amp;D related critters may be for the best. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A stub, absolutely, and in needs of expansion, but I can't see a need to delete. I'd be happy with it merging to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> but given the complaints mentioned above, I guess it needs its own article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete pending independent references</b> The references are not <i>indepedent</i> of the fictional source itself, and the article provides no real-world context or analysis. This would seem to fail to meet guidelines for minor characters in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> (and in essence minor monsters in D&amp;D are the same as minor characters in fiction). I should also point out that this same complaint probably applies to a number of monsters under <a href="../../../d/u/n/Category%7EDungeons_%26_Dragons_standard_creatures_e8b5.html" title="Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures">Category:Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard creatures</a>, most of which only have references from the fiction itself with no outside references to establish real world notability for purposes of WP:FICT. Thus while I'm an avid D&amp;D player, I'm not conviced this article follows the guidelines and should probably be merged into a "list of D&amp;D standard monsters". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that might have problems as there are lots of creatures in D&amp;D. Listing them all would lead to a rather long list, and while there are some, like Beholders and Owlbears that I think are unusual enough for coverage, I suspect this one wouldn't have an article if not for its mythological derivations. Though it does make me wonder if maybe List of D&amp;D creatures derived from mythology might be a worthwhile list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, it would be a long list article, or possible a couple of list articles, of minor characters/monsters, but that's still preferable to a large number of actual <i>articles</i> about minor character monsters with no references outside of the game itself. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:30, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, as far as it goes, there are relatively few monsters of D&amp;D I'd suggest having articles, as most are not iconic enough to really matter, and possibly some directory concerns with a listing of D&amp;D monsters. That might be something outside the scope of a general purpose encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The fact that there are similar articles probably just means that those articles probably should also be discussed in afd also.

<dd>Firstly, I really don't think that a trivial fan poll run by Wizards of the Coast, the creators of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> on the official <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> website really counts as an indepedent source, especially as the satyr came 6th. If it had come first, it may have some bearing, but not there. Secondly, nobody can change their vote, as AfD isn't a vote.

<dd>Actually <i>external</i> notability has not been established within the article. The only references are from D&amp;D rulebooks themselves. To establish notability outside the game, though, you would need published references external to the rules that talk about satyrs in D&amp;D. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To give an example of what I mean, compare this article to the <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beholder.html" title="Beholder">Beholder</a> article that Shimeru mentioned above. D&amp;D Beholders are mentioned in published sources outside of the D&amp;D game rules, and even have appeared in some popular media or been the inspiration for some non-D&amp;D related creatures. By contrast, it's not clear from the Satyr (D&amp;D) article that the D&amp;D version of satyrs has any notable mention outside of the game rules. So the level of notability for the Beholder extends beyond just the game rules compared to this article about the Satyrs. So <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beholder.html" title="Beholder">Beholder</a> probably does meet <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFiction_b036.html" title="WP:Fiction">WP:Fiction</a> guidelines, but this article about D&amp;D satyrds probably doesn't. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"The Ecology of the Satyr" from Dragon #155 is a non-rules article that discusses the satyr, and is also not in a rule-book.204.153.84.10
<dl>
<dd>That's an interesting question. Is <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28magazine%29.html" title="Dragon (magazine)">Dragon magazine</a> actually a publication that is independent of D&amp;D? It is an official source magazine for D&amp;D, and devoted mainly to D&amp;D rules, adventures and source material. Should a magazine devoted almost entirely to D&amp;D be treated as a source for purposes of showing <i>real world</i> notability outside the game? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At the time, Dragon was still published by TSR, if I'm not mistaken. It's one of the pre-eminent publications on D&amp;D, and should certainly be a reliable source, but I don't think it's an independent one in this case. I could be wrong, though, as I don't have the issue in question to check. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. Is it actually a rule that independent sources are required to "prove" notability? If so, how many are required? One? Two? Five? I have seen suggestions that editors should try to provide them, but not that it's a requirement for inclusion. 204.153.84.10 22:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not <i>necessarily</i>, but it's actually a somewhat trickier question than it looks. All that's needed to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. If none of the sources are independent, they are all effectively primary sources. This is acceptable if no extraordinary claims are being made (those would require stronger sourcing). However, it's easy for articles based entirely on non-independent sources to fall into <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is one reason secondary sources -- independent sources -- are stressed. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">Notability</a> suggests that the article topic should be the primary subject of "multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." This is, however, a guideline, while the earlier ones are policy; therefore, there's more room for flexibility. As my general rule, if notability is being questioned, I'd want at least one truly independent source among those listed -- if there's one, it's easy to imagine there might be more. Two or more would be even better, of course. Is there anything anywhere outside of D&amp;D/TSR/Wizards of the Coast publications that talks about satyrs as they're presented in D&amp;D (not merely as the mythical creature)? If so, that would be an excellent source. As it is... it's not unknown for an article to be founded entirely on non-independent sources, but it's not exactly ideal, either. <i>Dragon</i> may be judged enough, but the article would be stronger if a wholly independent source (or several) supported it. I hope that answers your question. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, all of this <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholasticism.html" title="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> wrangling over various policies and guidelines is interesting, in a way. My understanding is that primary sources are perfectly valid sources provided that the article simply describes what's in the primary source. Secondary sources are needed only for analysis or interpretation, and I see little of that in the article at issue. As to notability, the <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokémon test</a> is a perfectly valid analogy here: D&amp;D critters are notable for the same reasons that the several species of Pokémons are. As to whether there are secondary, independent sources that discuss D&amp;D satyrs as opposed to other satyrs - since the concept of satyrs predates D&amp;D, this would be a matter of interpretation that's hard to judge. (Need a secondary source for that.&#160;:) (There are instances where the D&amp;D mythology added non-traditional elements that were borrowed from nameable sources, and that found their way into later works: the D&amp;D <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a> is an example.) - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:18, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but the reason we need the sources specifically about the D&amp;D version of the creature is that the article is specifically about the D&amp;D version of the creature. Nobody's suggesting that <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyr</a> should be deleted. The base question here is: Do we have enough material about satyrs <i>as they specifically pertain to D&amp;D</i> to sustain a separate article? My feeling is, we don't, and this would therefore be better left to a subsection of satyr or <a href="../../../f/e/y/Fey_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_1d07.html" title="Fey (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Fey (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</a> or Satyrs in popular culture or something similar. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>An alternative view would be that the majority D&amp;D monsters are just as non-notable as the majority of Pokémon, the Pokémon test is a mistake and as such this article should be deleted. That's the view I subscribe to&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 17:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To reply to the comment about the WP:POKEMAN essay, note the essay is merely a discussion of why some Pokemon monster articles are kept. However, one could argue that Pokeman monsters also frequently have cross-media references outside of the game itself, since they appear on television or films for example. Also note that the essay is not a clear defense that <i>all</i> the pokeman monster articles should be kept. It correctly states that there are currently articles for all the pokeman monsters, but note that many of these articles have not been reviewed in afd. It's certainly possible that a broader review of Pokemon monster articles could result in some of them being deleted. for lack of suitable references or meeting <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a mess. OK, here we go. There are 3 related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a>, small Greek town; (dab notice put on top)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>, French village (dab notice now put on top by myself);</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> etc. It turned out that "Servia" is an archaic (pre-1920s) English term for Serbia (found in e.g. Catholic Encyclopedia and 1911 Britannica etc.). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Serbia#The_Inclusion_of_the_name_.22Servia.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Serbia#The_Inclusion_of_the_name_.22Servia.22" rel="nofollow">related talk</a> on Talk:Serbia. Now, <a href="../../../r/9/t/User%7ER9tgokunks_6dd1.html" title="User:R9tgokunks">R9tgokunks</a> (<a href="../../../r/9/t/User_talk%7ER9tgokunks_17b3.html" title="User talk:R9tgokunks">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_R9tgokunks_659c.html" title="Special:Contributions/R9tgokunks">contribs</a>) has unilaterally moved things around quite a bit, which I attempted to fix by reverting and putting dab-notices at top of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, that fixes the issues, and this article has turned out as unnecessary and orphan. Now, I didn't want to stretch <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> G6 (housekeeping), as the article was subject to a <a href="../../../h/i/s/Special%7EHistory_Servian_%28disambiguation%29_8fcc.html" title="Special:History/Servian (disambiguation)">revert war</a>. (Plus, there are potential COI issues of mine: the attempts to use term "Servia" in Serbia-related articles were taken as trolling rightly or wrongly). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 09:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like I tried to say, it's complicated. The original layout of articles was as it is now, minus this dab page. Then R9tgokunks moved the French commune to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian_%28commune%29.html" title="Servian (commune)">Servian (commune)</a>, and made a redirect from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a> to Servian (disambiguation). Instead, I tried to overcome the problem by ensuring that top-page dabs are at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>. This dab page is now simply... unnecessary. Nothing points to it, no one will arrive at it, and it basically contains only two items, which are already cross-linked. I don't see a point in keeping it. Like I said, I didn't want to stretch CSD G6 and delete it myself. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh-oh. It seems we still misunderstand each other: at the moment, there aren't <i>any</i> redirects involved. I <i>am</i> an admin, therefore I technically had the tools to sort things out, and I used them to an extent to revert the things to the previous state (i.e. moved <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian_%28commune%29.html" title="Servian (commune)">Servian (commune)</a> back to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>), and decided to let the community sort this mess out via this AfD (which also has the capacity of renaming/merging). <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> is the hard and unreliable way (trust me, I closed many with 3 votes). I could have just <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignored all rules</a> and sort things out as I thought it was best, but I wanted to hear some outside opinions. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Erm, yes. I didn't say that "Servia" wasn't a notable term for Serbia (although it's <b>very</b> outfashioned); just, it's supposed to be sorted out via top-page dabs at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a> (and a notice to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> should be added, like I said on Talk:Serbia) rendering this page useless. How can anyone arrive to this page when it's orphaned? (except for this AfD). If anyone suggests a better organization of things, I'm all ear. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 10:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It <i>is</i> a little confusing to have a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servia.html" title="Servia">Servia</a> and a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servian.html" title="Servian">Servian</a>. I wouldn't personally mind having a top edit dab at both pages linking to each other, but it seems easier to just have a top edit dab at every page linking to Servian (disambiguation). No? Considering it is a notable term, I think it's worth being noted on WP. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 11:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think that since it refers to "Servian", 1st point Servia should be scrapped from this, and 3rd point turned into an earlier form of "Serbian" i.e. "Servian". Otherwise it's not making much sense. --Abu-Bakr69 13:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Continueing from the talk section of the page, how are individuals "not a reliable source of information"? That is like saying what can George Lucas possibly know about Star Wars. To be fair, if I created the sport three years ago, wouldn't I be considered the expert on it? I also want to convey the point that this sport runs like a well-oiled machine, gains members every year, and is well organized. I just dont see the logic in deleting a page that broadens a person's horizons from an encyclopedia. regardless i would like the opertunity to keep this page and I will makes corrections to fit your sites needs, again, thanks for your time.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe the company meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as it has had multiple non-trivial published works written about it. See the articles linked in the references section. I also disagree with the assertion that it exists solely as a marketing aid -- the first paragraph states what the company does and summarizes their product offerings, while the rest of the article summarizes the company's history, which I would consider encyclopedic. Are there gaps in the company's history? Probably. That's why its a stub. Which, by <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">definition</a>, doesn't have much encyclopedic content. As far as it existing as a marketing aid, you could probably make that argument for virtually every company article, possibly except for those with a Criticisms section. -- <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawaiian717_5c0b.html" title="User:Hawaiian717">Hawaiian717</a> 16:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm concerned about the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> of this topic. After quickly searching on search engines for the band information, Wikipedia was the only source listed in top results. The article has no references except for some external links of which none, being written by third parties, specifically mention the band. Additionally the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability</a> is highly controversial. Other than the external links (of no value to this debate) can the authors present any evidence this topic deserves an article? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChupper_786a.html" title="User:Chupper">Chupper</a> 05:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- any unverifiable information should be removed, of course, but there's plenty of sources linked from the article that provide verification of key facts.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Not enough notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. RE:JulesH - three external links talking about the band doesn't signify notability. There is no number and I do not think the content of those external links justifies notability especially under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> Anonymous user. 166.153.176.215 01:28, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I think that the external links do justify the notibility of the band. What sort of evidence other than external links do you want? Notability is hard to judge based on search-engine results. Try searching less generic terms than the band name itself such as the names of the band members. Regardless, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> clearly defines that ONE(1) of the criteria be met, regardless of your personal opinion of how many must be met. And though some of the links have gone into internet archives, and should be removed, there are still several notable publications that feature articles solely based on the band and it's work. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGaryleeweinrib_5e62.html" title="User:Garyleeweinrib">Garyleeweinrib</a> 18:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Of course there is enough notability for this band listed under "External Links". I don't know what Wikipedia's notability rules are, but this article is nearly four months old. Why in the world would it be nominated for deletion after four months of no problem? Really, I find this ridiculous. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael.m.winters_dff8.html" title="User:Michael.m.winters">Michael.m.winters</a> 06:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Autobiography about non-notable beatbox person. Fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> by a large stretch. Made his YouTube debut last year (along with 80 zillion other people, no?). I speedied once but it was fleshed out so I wanted to give it a fair chance here. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 12:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, the article that was originally posted and was deleted by someone on this page was not an "autobiography" and the YouTube info was simply a way to familiarize with people who may not be aware. Non-notable beatbox person? I'm sorry that you feel that way, but there are notable accomplishments that was not posted up as of yet. Wikipedia is about sharing information with others and building a source together. An online encyclopedia. There was more details that was edited out so others may contribute in the future, so if you feel you cannot add anything at the moment, don't feel discouraged in the future. Isn't that what wikipedia is all about? Building a source of information together.<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasontom_d487.html" title="User:Jasontom">Jasontom</a> 00:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> That's because this wikipedia page was getting tags that it was an autobiography when it isn't. A lot of content was taken off to encourage others in the future to contribute.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> A lot of stuff originally up were edited out because there seems to be members here that feel that what is written is an autobiography when it wasn't. Information is simply shared with Wikipedia members, but a member wanted to speedily delete the info. The YouTube debut is far from a notable accomplishment, it was merely a way to introduce people like yourself who may be unfamiliar.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't follow the argument that this isn't an autobiography, by the way. A large portion of the edits on the article were by an editor whose user name matches the name of the subject. The article will have to go unless <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>/<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> can be met. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 05:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Hello <b>Jane Jelly Roll</b>, argument? Who said this is an argument? This is a discussion taking place. There are friends and supporters that have provided information for this article. Is it illegal for supporters to present and share such information? I thought Wikipedia was about sharing information together and I don't mean that by means of creating personal websites or whatnot. Would you prefer another username be used to prevent confusion for editing purposes for this particular Wikipedia article? That could be done in a blink of an eye. Problem solved!<br />
I believe much unneccesary attention have been given toward this article, but I thank you all for your input and whatnot. I will say this again, if anyone feel that he or she can contribute to this article than that would be greatly appreciated! It's nice that many of you want this article to be deleted, but that is due to a great misunderstanding. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasontom_d487.html" title="User:Jasontom">Jasontom</a> 06:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean argument in the sense of "fight." I mean it in the sense that this discussion consists of people presenting their "arguments" for or against deletion. It certainly isn't illegal for friends and supporters to present and share information, but Wikipedia might not be the place to do so. There are policies to consider such as <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Are you the subject or not? Your user name makes it appear as if you are and if I misunderstood that, then I apologize. Usually though, editors don't take the names of people other than themselves. You say that there is a "great misunderstanding." What is the misunderstanding exactly? If you could demonstrate how this article meets Wikipedia policies for notability, then it would help a great deal. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 06:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Well I'm sure Jane Jelly Roll isn't exactly your real name or people with aliases such as wknight, etc. It's just an alias. For example, how many Michael Jackson supporters have aliases with "Michael Jackson" or "King of Pop?" Countless! It isn't against Wikipedias' terms for parties involved with the party that the article is about to edit or post either. It is limited though due to the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> terms. That is understandable. The article was already as neutral as can be, but obviously from reading this discussion here people want more info than what was vaguely presented prior. So there is definitely great interest for this article to grow contrary to the "Delete" requests. But to stop any more confusion, you may change this username to JanesNumberOneBuckethead. I would gladly have your guidance since I am relatively new to editing Wikipedias. If you wish to assist me in improving this article, I would appreciate it! It definitely deserves a chance! Trust me and thanks! <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasontom_d487.html" title="User:Jasontom">Jasontom</a> 07:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Previous years in New Zealand have yielded at most five or six but usually just two things of note occuring in the New Zealand TV industry. Two items is not enough for a whole article.

In fact, it makes no sense to merge it with <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_in_New_Zealand_6418.html" title="2007 in New Zealand">2007 in New Zealand</a>, because the latter page has more info on it that this one. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKripto_baad.html" title="User:Kripto">Kripto</a> 12:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page has become unwieldy and redundant and seems to be no longer maintained - last edit was in November. It was created just before Wikipedia's categorisation system was implemented mainly for (I believe) using the "related changes" function associated with entries on the page.

<li>Yes, I have read the previous AFD, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The result was keep with three editors weighing in against one. Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> he is notable. "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors <b>who have played in</b> a fully professional league, <b><i>or</i> a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport</b> such as swimming, <b><i>or</i> at the highest level in mainly amateur sports</b> or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States."

<ul>
<li>He fails the central criterion for inclusion though, as he hasn't been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of him. Furthermore if the unverifiable information is removed the article becomes "Don James Alto is a Table Tennis Player who won the Cadet Boys Singles category at the 2006 US Open Table Tennis Champianship". <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>He seems to have been very active in the table tennis circuit, including playing for the US national team. As examples: He placed 4th in the 2004 nationals<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and won the bronze in the 2004 California State Games<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He also placed 2nd (Finalist) in the 2005 Sandiego Open<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and placed the same in the 2006 Berkley Open<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. He was also part of the 2005 U.S. National TT team<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. It at least <i>seems to me</i> that he is clearly notable in his sport. Of course, that is <i>just my opinion</i> from the research I have done. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 16:58, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

In my view, the central criterion approach is viable, however there should be some flexibility. This article has 7 references that cover every statement in the article.

<li>You're misinterpreting the example. The example doesn't mean that <i>all</i> groups of minor characters are notable, but that minor characters should be grouped into one article instead of each given their own article (such as with, oh, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_0ca3.html" title="Characters in The Legend of Zelda series">Characters in The Legend of Zelda series</a>). The Middle-Earth horses are distinct enough, as a group, to be seperate from the other characters. The information in this list contains one real important animal (Epona), some minor characters who just happen to be animals, and some info on Twilight Princess. It's all duplicated from other articles, and can't be expanded unless someone goes <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">bean-stuffing</a> and adds in the stuff I mentioned above. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> really only has two horses that were notable to any degree: Bill and Shadowfax, and they were pretty minor to begin with.

Hell, Coccos (not in this article, but need to be if it's keep) are more notable than Rochallor, the horse of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingolfin.html" title="Fingolfin">who?</a>, king of <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noldor.html" title="Noldor">where?</a>--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's great, but you're comparing apples and oranges...the merits of Middle-Earth horses are not the issue here. Go take it up with the Tolkien fans.&#160;:) The question here is this: Are the various animals in the Zelda series, taken as a whole, notable enough to deserve their own article when this information already exists in other articles? If there were several animals along the lines of <a href="../../../o/c/a/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Ocarina_of_Time_characters_1770.html#Epona" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters">Epona</a>, I'd have a different opinion.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> I added the sources with the intent that whomever eventually came to work on the page would use them. This content of this page has not been changed since then. This page was written without the aid of those sources, and is thus completely OR. The only way this could become a valid article would be if it were to be started from scratch. I'm not willing to work on it, so it's best that it just be deleted for now. Relevant, cited information could probably still be kept on the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrowind_%28province%29.html" title="Morrowind (province)">Morrowind (province)</a> page, nothing substantial can be salvaged here. <a href="../../../g/e/u/User%7EGeuiwogbil_9388.html" title="User:Geuiwogbil">Geuiwogbil</a> 00:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Projectify/Userfy</b> I'd support good cleanup and reworking of the article on user or wikiproject namespaces for the purposes of reinclusion in the main article namespace or for use in external wikis. <a href="../../../g/e/u/User%7EGeuiwogbil_9388.html" title="User:Geuiwogbil">Geuiwogbil</a> 11:30, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Projectify/Userfy</b> – There are currently no Elder Scrolls wikis that use the GFDL license. However, there may be a fan site, such as TIL, that would highly appreciate this article and would gladly accept the GFDL license that goes with it. I request that we userfy this article to User:Aristeo/Architecture of The Elder Scrolls so I can look for someone who can accept this article. Once I find a site that will use this article, I will propose the Wikipedia article for speedy deletion. A lot of contributors have put a lot of effort into this article, and I would hate for their efforts to be wasted. --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristeo_e4fb.html" title="User:Aristeo">Aristeo</a> 20:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Projectify</b> - The article is not fitting on its own, but not harmful; and it contains information, which is likely to be useful for other articles, here or elsewhere, and is worth rewriting for sites not using GDFL license. I suggest to move it to Wikiproject:The Elder Scrolls subpage, as we already did before with some articles, which later were cleaned and merged into longer and more comprehensive articles on broader subjects. BTW, on subject of sourcing - the sources are on fansite, but from the original game (assumedly having permission, as the website used to be linked from the official site when there was links section - Bethesda is quite permissive in terms of copyright); so this is actually linked to books from the primary source, not just speculation. There are other reasons, of course, but UESP was somewhat interested in the article already. And there likely are GDFL TES wikis; furthermore, preservation of the article in the project subspace will serve preserving copyrights. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../w/n/p/WP%7EWNP_d2ca.html" title="WP:WNP">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 17:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> – The only Elder Scrolls wiki under the GFDL is <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com" class="external text" title="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com" rel="nofollow">an empty project on Wikia</a>, unfortunately. Anyway, you're proposing that we split the article up and distribute it to the rest of Wikipedia, and I'm suggesting that we package up the article and send it to another site. I think you're idea is pretty good, but if it doesn't work for any reason then we can fall back on my plan if everyone is up to it. --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristeo_e4fb.html" title="User:Aristeo">Aristeo</a> 18:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The standard by which this list goes is US-centered. Furthermore, a man like <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Sarkozy_0554.html" title="Nicolas Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> is often derided in France because of his short stature and called "<i>le nabot</i>" (the midget) by his ennemies. Being 164 cm, he is excluded from the list, although in public perception, he is notable for being a tiny man (and married to a tall and broad-shouldered wife, which makes things worse&#160;!). So i think it is quite absurd to fix 150 cm as an upper limit. <a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCS_dae0.html" title="User:RCS">RCS</a> 16:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The problem with the Sarkozy example is that there are many nations where 164 cm is not necessarily short. Granted I mentioned Pygmies as an exception as if we had to go "short" by their standard we'd have to drop some dwarfs as well. I could maybe add the Hmong as well as I seem to recall they have an unusually low average height. However if we include China, Japan, and most of East Asia as exceptions we're exempting about half the planet. Still if you want to divide by nation, and have anthropometric studies of nations, it might be reorganizable at a later date.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>The thing is I think the shortest men are largely not in that list and may not even have articles. I'm 3 ft 6, but I don't think I'm among history's shortest men.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, for reasons mentioned already and also that it should be easy to determine if a person should be on the list or not. Simply ask yourself, "has this been been refered to in the media as <i>short</i>?". If so get the source, and cite it. Easy as pie. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 11:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is difficult to see why a workable list of "men notable for their shortness" can't be sustainable - perhaps a guideline max of e.g. 150 cm plus any others who are/have been notable for shortness (and, off on a tangent, difficult to see why same approach couldn't have worked on List of Tall Men also). <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartofaDog_3faf.html" title="User:HeartofaDog">HeartofaDog</a> 12:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the overturn/relist arguments in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_30_68c1.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 30">List of tall men DRV</a>, which although endorsed, I find did not provide sufficient consideration for all of the concerns. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 18:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. Per my same reasoning on the AfD for the lists of tall men/women. Also a <b>comment</b> to some of the above commentors. The AfD we are discussing is NOT "List of men notable for their shortness", it is "List of short men". There's a big difference. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Really, this AFD should have waited until the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tall_men.html" title="List of tall men">List of tall men</a> AFD had finished, as this article suffers the same problem. There is no signle definition of 'short'. If it does have to stay, it should be renamed to List of shortest men. But given that we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_dwarfism.html" title="List of people with dwarfism">List of people with dwarfism</a> (which is what "list of shortest men" should redirect to, this list is pointless. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 22:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is the same as the previous articles for "T. Allen Greenfield" and "Allen Greenfield." These articles were deleted after the administration deemed Mr. Greenfield a "non-noteworthy person." I believe that these efforts to recreate this article are being perpetrated by Mr. Greenfield's friends or persons who have a business relationship with him and wish to use this forum as a free advertising agency. This entry has been deemed non-noteworthy and so should not be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMensKeperRa_5c0d.html" title="User:MensKeperRa">Eyes down, human.</a> 17:37, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's a bit troubling that the references section is longer than the text of the article; what exactly are these references supposed to be providing sources for?

<li><b>Comment</b> - please note that the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> comment was directed at the line in the nom that <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> is somehow part of a cabal dedicated to the promotion of the subject of the article, despite that 999 has always seemed to me to be a quality contributor guided by the principles of Wikipedia.

<li>Sources aren't just there to be dumped at the bottom of an article. The article has to be written based on the sources, and editors are required to fulfill requests to tighten sourcing around the claims of the article, in particular the claims to notability (which itself seems to be missing, btw). ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Regardless of subject's merit (or lack thereof) for inclusion, this method of recreating an article is highly suspect. The initial Greenfield and Del Campo articles read like advertisements for those authors' books. I am concerned that these new articles are, in fact, just efforts to promote a couple of marginal occult authors and sell some books. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMensKeperRa_5c0d.html" title="User:MensKeperRa">Eyes down, human.</a> 11:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This author is CLEARLY notable. In fact, if the persons involved in the earlier deletes had actually been occultists or Neopagans or even casually acquainted with either field, those deletes would probably not have happened.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm not convinced that this meets notability guidelines, but procedurally, if it was deleted twice, the rewrite needs to go to userspace and review as stated.

<dd>Netscott -- No one needs to brush up on their knowledge of the "Mel Gibson DUI incident," in order to exercise their judgement concerning Michael Richards and the Laugh Factory incident. I don't know what you see as your "logic" for creating this page. If, as you point out, other editors of the Michael Richards article were arguing on the Talk page that the Laugh Factory incident needed to be trimmed back, and blunted down -- that was your opportunity to argue your point of view on that. And I don't accept your argument that recent news stories focusing on the "n-word," with mention of the Michael Richards incident, is reason for a separate article on the Michael Richards incident. The simple fact is that the Michael Richards incident is over. Of course they mention the Michael Richards incident when they discuss the "n-word." They are mentioning something that has been over since November 2006. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 03:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Netscott -- I don't think you have articulated a reason for this article which you have created. You state above that this article is needed because increased space is needed to cover recent news coverage concerning the usage of the word "Nigger." If that is so, then why haven't you inserted coverage of that into this article? Can you please explain why you have created this "breakaway" article? I don't think there is anything in this article that is not in the original article. This article is simply the placing of a subject in incorrect context. The proper context for the "Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident" is the life of "Michael Richards." "Michael Richards," the person, is not quite properly seen in the context of the "Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident." One way is preferable to the other. Furthermore, any coverage of the use of words, such as "nigger," would best be served in an article covering that subject -- either an already existing article, or one created for that purpose. The argument can be made that the Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident precipitated the discussion of such words, and the possible banning of the use of such words, but it is hardly the specific cause for any such discussion. The term "Michael Richards" is inextricably linked, linguistically, to the "Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident." It is not as though someone is not going to be able to find the Michael Richards page. I consider this page which you have created to be entirely redundant. It creates incorrect context, which in the final analysis is unfair to Michael Richards, because it creates a perspective in which Michael Richards' life is seen as an appendage to one evening in which he had an emotional outburst. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> after condensing. Wikipedia does not need to include every detail about a news incident where a comedian raved at a patron in a club, any more than there should be an article about an actor being rude and insulting when stopped while driving under the influence. A shorter version of this in the main article on the performer is sufficient. The amount of detail kept should be proportionate to the overall importance of the topic. We should not allow "recentism" to dictate that things in the news today require a longer article than if a similar thing had happened 40 or 50 years ago. Wikipedia is not a tabloid newspaper. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Mason_345c.html" title="Jackie Mason">Jackie Mason</a> made a controversial finger gesture on the <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Sullivan_828e.html" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a> show in 1962 which got a great deal of attention, and made controversial racial comments about a black mayor of New York, but these are not and should not be breakout articles any more than this one should be. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Firm Keep</b> The information in this branch article is well sourced and contains information regarding a potential lawsuit which is not really covered by the main article. With the large amount of news coverage this incident <b>still</b> gets (especially in relation to the coverage on anything else Michael Richards has been up to lately) I see no reason for the article's deletion. If the original section was getting "too long", as some editors were claiming, then that is precisely the reason why off-shoot articles were implemented to begin with. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 19:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

You make the same error in reasoning that Netscott makes in referring to the <i>"large amount of news coverage this incident still gets."</i> In point of fact there is no new news coverage. Almost nothing new has developed since the incident took place, and the cell phone video was made public. Michael Richards made a couple of apologies, the offended men appeared on television, a publicist issued a couple of statements, a lawyer issued a statement. It was all over by the time the month of November ended. Unfortunately gossipmongers need juicy material and this suits the bill. The information in <i>"this branch article"</i> is no more <i>"well sourced"</i> than it was in the main article on Michael Richards. Any recent developments in discussions concerning the "n-word" are only tangentially mentioning the Michael Richards incident. That is not a valid development in the incident of November 17, 2006. Mere mention of the incident does not constitute a development in the incident. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete, or Merge</b> it back into article on Michael Richards. Uncalled for emphasis results from breaking the Laugh Factory incident out into a free standing article. It is still an article about a living person, even on this page, except that separating out one incident from a person's life gives enormous emphasis to it. That is totally uncalled for, and unfair to the man Michael Richards. Wikipedia editors are supposed to exercise sensitivity in writing about living people. Highlighting one negative incident by breaking it out into a free standing article is nothing if not insensitive to the person being written about. Michael Richards is to racism as Marilyn Monroe was to sex. They were (and are) symbols. But they are hardly representative of anything that they symbolize in some people's minds. Michael Richards is more representative of the term <i>scapegoat.</i> Michael Richards has become a convenient figure on which to hang all the ills of America's several hundred year long dilemma with racial inequality. Wikipedia shouldn't be a participant in characterizing Michael Richards as the quintessential racist. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not lynch mob. There already exists an article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a>, as well as one on the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laugh_Factory_868f.html" title="Laugh Factory">Laugh Factory</a>, which also mentions the November 2006 Michael Richards incident. Any reader seeking to know what transpired can easily find information at either of those articles. And they can do their own research on their own. There is plenty of shrill commentary to be found, out there. Wikipedia does not have to participate in that shrillness and the resultant uncalled for emphasis on one man's outburst, one evening. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 20:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

You responded with some random statement trying to be sarcastic "Funny, I don't see a sock tag on his user page". Where did I state I saw a sock tag on his user page? The best part is, 1 day later <b>now there is a sock tag on his user page</b>. Needless to say I shouldn't hold my breath on you apologizing to me and Netscott after eating crow.

I assumed, at the time I made my statement, that the matter had been investigated by an administrator and that he had been determined to be innocent. I was wrong and I appologize. I will say, however, that there is reason for concern on the part of the community. From what I can see, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> has a veritable host of pupeteers creating socks which are apparently following him from article to article creating conflict and disruption for everyone.

Statements <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> has made on Wikipedia seem to indicate that these people are specifically targeting him.

<dd>I find it fascinating several times now you like to present links that goes against your own arguments, either hoping no one will click it or follow the thread and understand the facts. e.g previously you provided a link and claimed Netscott attacked BusStop, when all it showed was Netscott defended him. Now that BusStop and I were discussing who merged back the section Netscott split out into a new article, you showed a totally unrelated link where another sockpuppet reverted some sentences, and lie and claim that was the rv of article split was being discussed. Your dishonest tendency to do this reflects quite negatively on the general believability--or rather lack thereof--of your arguments. Then again, likely it's just a [[red herring] ploy you use to divert attention. Tendancer 00:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your remarks are uncivil. You are also mistaken. I suggest you re-read the talk page discussion titled "Time to Reduce the text?" which is where the "break away" article was created.

<dd>You seem very confused. I stand by the statements I have made on this page. I believe I have provided an accurate description of <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a>'s behavior in this particular situation. The article's talk page contains a clear cut written record that supports my statements. As the editor who introduced the proposition to trim back the text, I made every possible effort to try and circumvent potential conflict. I believe I have every right to be upset by <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a>'s behavior.</dd>
<dd>Little did I know, that he apparently has a history of disruptive behavior as seen in the block log. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Netscott" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Netscott" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. I find your fierce defense of <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> and his record to be extremely curious. Apart from saving him from 3RR on the Richards' article and supporting some of his arguments, your contribution history doesn't indicate an extensive working relationship with the editor you are so vociferously defending. Your edit history does demonstrates an uncanny knowlege of Wikipedia from the very first edit. You are also apparently fond of the unusual phrase "alot of vitriol" which is also used by <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> on the Michael Richards talk page. Well, I must say <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> is lucky to have found a kindred spirit to speak out in his defense. I will make the AFD page easier to read by not responding to any more of your attacks. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 03:41, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for volunteering to cut down on your posts to improve the quality of this nAfD. In closing I suggest you read the WP guideline on unacceptable behavior: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Behavior_that_is_unacceptable" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Behavior_that_is_unacceptable" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Behavior_that_is_unacceptable</a>. esp 1. No personal attacks (e.g. calling Netscott a "BULLY", "acted in BAD FAITH", "should be BANNED" and many many other ad hominem attacks in your long diatribe below). 2. Don't misrepresent other people (e.g. reordering my text to take them out of context as you just did and which I just fixed).</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, since you are concerned anyone who disagrees with you must be the same person, then unless you're just slandering in another violation of WP:NPA, please ask an admin immediately to checkuser either me or Netscott or both and post the results here so everyone know whether only one person finds your communications objectionable.

In terms of "undue emphasis", there is little that wikipedia could do to overshadow the uncounted thousands of articles and commentary that have been written on the subject since the event. Nevertheless, I reiterate my view that these are editorial issues that should be worked out on the article talk page. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>JJay -- I don't think I ever expressed "admiration" for Michael Richards. My "sympathy" grows out of the demonization I see other people engaging in towards Michael Richards. He simply doesn't deserve it. He had an emotional outburst. No one is in a position to judge him because no one is aware of what stresses were at work on the evening that he engaged in his racial tirade. But only words were exchanged -- no one was hurt. Wikipedia is not in the league of "tabloid journalism." Why are you comparing what is ostensibly an encyclopedia to the lowest dregs of journalism? I don't know why you and Netscott are so concerned with Google hits. Beyond a certain point that sort of statistic becomes meaningless. It doesn't matter how many articles are written about, or mention, Michael Richards or the Michael Richards incident. No one is arguing that the incident is NOT noteworthy. You say that the editorial issues should be "worked out on the article talk page." On which article's Talk page? This discussion was taking place on the Michael Richards article Talk page. Netscott can answer for himself, but the real question is: why the creation of this separate article? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 04:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>I Nominate this Article for Deletion</b>, if that's what's necessary. The creator of the article under discussion, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a>, has nominated this AfD discussion for speedy deletion because it was originated by a banned user (it is not visible on the version transclued onto the AfD log; you need to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Richards_Laugh_Factory_incident_7d62.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident">view the AfD itself</a>). This is despite the good faith contributions of everyone else to this discussion, and two offers to "cure" the nomination by nominating it in the place of the banned user. While the originator of this discussion may be banned, even "wrong" people can be right from time to time. It would be a pity to stifle discussion on the basis of a technicality. Better to let this discussion run to completion rather than to have it start all over again with a fresh nomination. In addition for my reason for deletion, above, I would like to adopt what <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> said as part of my reason for nominating. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>By the way, the right way to do this is to strike out your previous vote and add your new one, not to edit it. Also, that's a lot of vitriol for Netscott who in my observations has been one of the more neutral editors I've seen on WP. Though I'm also voting for a merge, I want to note for other editors: contrary to the above claims there had been NO consensus, ever, to not create a new article--there was a brief tangential discussion and exactly two people, namely Bus Stop and Cleo123 who are rather well known to be biased pro-Richards, voiced their objections while two others (I, who wanted to throw the idea out there and didn't care either way; and another editor whom I think is anti-Richards). I wouldn't call 2 vs 2 consensus, rather indifference. In any case, that amount of vitriol for Netscott is uncalled for as he has done nothing against consensus, and branching was perfectly fine per WP:SS--I rather admire his ability to maintain civility in his responses in light of these uncalled and extremely uncivil accusations. Some folks are too thin-skinned and take impersonal edits personal. Tendancer 04:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is history of Tendancer engaging in personal attacks against <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> and myself. The fact that I have simply ignored his last diatribe on my Talk Page may well be what is motivating his commentary. Well over a dozen editors have expressed concerns about the amount of text Wikipedia should dedicate to this incident. A review of the Talk Page Archive reveals that early on several editors expressed the view that the incident did not even warrant its own SECTION, never mind a seperate article. My understanding was that a consensus had been reached. I'm sure Netscott has demonstrated nuetrality on many articles in the past. In general, I respect his work. Unfortunately, he appears to be a bit too personally invested in this particular situation. He actions, in this case, are rash. It appears that he became angry when other editors attempted to engage him in discussion so he attempted to "punish them" by creating a seperate article to serve as a platform for his POV. I am not "Pro-Richards". Myself and other editors are engaging in a good faith effort to create a NUETRAL &amp; UNBIASED section in accordance with WP:BLP <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 05:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please explain how Netscott's intention to branch the article and shorten the Richards article (to be only about Michael Richards) is not "NUETRAL (sic) &amp; UNBIASED"? As far as I can tell, the main POV-pushers are some pro-Richards editors who are paranoid that branching the article would draw attention to the incident. You are tossing out an unbelievable amount of vitriol against Netscott who's been an invaluable and neutral editor on the article, and I am starting to think you pile on him because he's too civil to stoop to respond in kind, and instead of recognizing that, like most bullies you instead take it as a sign of weakness and license to continue to lie about and attack him. I think we only need to look at the sheer number and length of the missives by a couple pro-Richards editors here to see who are the ones "personally invested". Tendancer 19:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ufortunately, in this particular situation, Netscott seems to have been unable to maintain his objectivity, and he appears to be without remorse. Only hours ago, he was "campaigning" on another editors talk page, attempting to influence their vote on this AFD by misrepresenting the facts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=104651495&amp;oldid=104647970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=104651495&amp;oldid=104647970" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> His has encouraged other editors to "gang up" on those who oppose his POV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=91897477&amp;oldid=91835010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=91897477&amp;oldid=91835010" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. His talk page is chock full of inappropriate commentary and speculation about <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Netscott" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Netscott" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> and he has accused pratically every editor who disagrees with his POV of being a sockpuppet.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=93086639&amp;oldid=93086556" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wahkeenah&amp;diff=93086639&amp;oldid=93086556" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. When all his campaigning failed and the article began to finally take a more nuetral form, rather than engaging in a rational discussion, he got angry and created his "own" article. I believe several editors on this page have adequately explained why a seperate article isn't warranted at this juncture. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 21:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP policies does not forbid people from campaigning. He created an article and campaigned for a vote to keep it, just as you advocated trimming the section and campaigned for people to weigh in, that's perfectly fine. You can accuse him of campaigning if that's such a crime, but not of bias. On the links you've given I see him _defend_ Bus Stop against accusations that Bus Stop is a POV-pusher and a troll, it's disingenuous to twist it into a claim NetScott commented inappropriately about Bus Stop. Furthermore, every editor NetScott has "accused" of being a sockpuppet has turned out to be a sockpuppet: <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechJon_6d39.html" title="User:TechJon">TechJon</a>, <a href="../../../k/g/e/User%7EKgeza67_fb51.html" title="User:Kgeza67">Kgeza67</a>, and the latest <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKramerCosmo_cb36.html" title="User:KramerCosmo">KramerCosmo</a> who shares the same IP with a known sockpuppet of the Michael Richards article, and was reverted by a bot: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:KramerCosmo" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:KramerCosmo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:KramerCosmo</a>. In short, he has yet to make a false sockpuppet accusation in violation of WP:NPA unlike e.g. Bus Stop who rather hilariously think I'm the same person as Wahkeenah. In short you are perfectly entitled to believe he created the article out of anger, but please keep in mind that's your POV and not a valid reason for deletion. All of us here should read over <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a> which would trim down the verbosity in this discussion. Tendancer 22:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Campaigning? Give me a break... contacting one <b>seriously involved</b> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> article editor over this is <b>not</b> campaigning... it is normal for fellow editors heavily editing on a particular article to contact each other regarding editing/content/AfDs surrounding that article. Removal of all of the material from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Situation_Room_ccaa.html" title="The Situation Room">The Situation Room</a> interviews of Kyle Doss and Frank McBride effectively cancels out <i>any</i> of the details that led up to the cameraphone recorded part.

<li>Wait a minute. Let's not be dramatic. The nexus of this entire dispute was other editors' desire to omit ONE STATEMENT which read&#160;: "According to Kyle Doss (one of the targets of the tirade) the incident began when his group of about twenty people entered into the Laugh Factory after Richards' performance had started and proceeded to order beverages. He stated, "[...] I guess we're being a little loud, because there was 20 of us ordering drinks. And he said, 'Look at the stupid Mexicans and blacks being loud up there.'"<sup id="_ref-CNN-transcripts_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN-transcripts" title="">[7]</a></sup> Your commentary on the Talk Page would seem to indicate that this statement must be retained because it somehow "justifies" the heckling. All anyone has asked you to do is provide an NPOV source for what started the incident. Without a secondary unbiased source, it is opinion and cannot be presented as fact. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">User:Bus stop</a> is correct in saying the "incident" starts when the cell phone camera footage starts, unless you can provide a reliable source. If your version of the article is retained, the same editors will undoubtably follow you to the new article requesting a source.

<li>Cleo123 please read over WP:NPOV. That Doss stated that is already a <b>fact</b> and a <b>sourced fact</b> from CNN less. The article does not claim what Doss stated has to be true. Netscott and anti-Richards readers can choose to infer from that quote Richards started it, you BusStop and the pro-Richards readers can choose to infer from that quote that Doss is lying/feigning victim. Regardless, that's <b>a sourced statement from a main participant in the incident</b>. One can debate removing it if there's e.g. undue weight issues (which there isn't because deleting it actually created undue weight as now we lost all perspective from one side). Citing WP:NPOV or lack of source however, is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst. By that butchering of WP:NPOV, any statements Richards made in defense of himself should be omitted because Richards does not have NPOV. Tendancer 15:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tendancer, presenting ONLY point of view, as to the cause of the incident is misleading and constitutes a misrepresentation of facts.

If you will read the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> Talk Page discussion you will see that a good faith attempt was being made to remove all POV statements, including Richards quoted appology.

Yes, the Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident comes up often when people discuss, for instance, banning the "n-word." But they are not discussing the Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident. They are discussing a subject related to the Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident.

<dd>Netscott -- What you fail to understand is that the context of the article is Michael Richards. The context is not racism. You are putting the cart before the horse. Logically, the distinction is not significant. But meaningfully, it is very different. The same article gets written either way, by and large. Maybe a few more details get left out of the racism-oriented article concerning Richards' earlier personal history that are included in the Michael Richards-oriented article. But even the racism-oriented article has to provide some context as to who this man is who is on the stage and saying those words. The difference between the two articles is significant. In one there is a man leading a complex life who has a bad evening and says things that he regrets. In the other article there is a primarily racist incident with a man added on as an appendage. Michael Richards is not a lifelong racist. The proper context of that incident is the lifetime of Michael Richards. Wikipedia should not be misrepresenting that fact. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 14:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Commentary: I accept a degree of responsibility for the present dilemma because I encouraged Cleo to reduce the text pertaining to the Laugh Factory incident in the Michael Richards article. But Netscott did not allow for sufficient discussion of the subject of starting a separate article before doing so. I understand Netscott's adamant refusal to allow the details of the Laugh Factory incident to be pared back. I accept that he is right about the need for a thorough coverage of the Laugh Factory incident. But I part company with him concerning the advisability of a separate article from the perspective of the incident. I should not have urged Cleo to remove material from this article concerning the Laugh Factory incident when she asked me what my thoughts were about that. I gave her the wrong advice, as I now see it, with hindsight. My revised feelings are that the Laugh Factory incident should be thoroughly covered, but from the perspective of Michael Richards' life. To cover Michael Richards' life from the perspective of the Laugh Factory incident is to put undue emphasis on that incident. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

However, we must be mindful of the fact that <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> created the stand alone article because other editors, including yourself, wanted to omit inflamatory POV material.

I suspect that <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> and his supporters will use a free standing article as a platform for adding MORE biased, defamatory "tabloid" material contrary to WP:NOT. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 06:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article on the main page is significantly skewed in favour of the "victims". In order to properly balance it, we either have to eliminate the POV or balance the article. To balance it, we would have to expand it by adding the point of view of Richards and/or Richards' supporters. However, the overwhelming opinion seems to support a reduction of the text there - with some significant opposition. The best way to reach a consensus would be to reduce the main article, and expand the discussion here. But no matter what happens, the main article has to be repaired and improved.

<dd>Bulbous -- I don't think you are addressing the question. I think the most pressing question is whether of not to keep this article which was just created just a few days ago. Obviously any article has to have a neutral point of view. You say that <i>"the overwhelming opinion seems to support a reduction of the text there,"</i> but I do not count myself among that group. I am in favor of putting whatever is called for in the Michael Richards article to fully tell the story in appropriate and balanced terms. I don't agree that the original article is skewed in favor of anyone. But if you or anyone else feels it is, that is a valid subject for debate. I feel we are talking in circles. I think the issue to be addressed is whether or not to have this article. I think that calls for reasons, and not just reasons that apply to any article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But it is illogical, and not useful. But you make a good point. Richards is not a lifelong racist. He doesn't have a history of hate speech. The evening's melt down is out of character, for Richards. Had he been a frothing-at-the-mouth racist he wouldn't have likely risen to the level in the theatrical arts to which he had risen. He actually had a show -- the short lived Michael Richards Show, that had many black members in the cast. He was a part producer of that show. He responded improperly to black people on November 17, 2005, at the Laugh Factory. That doesn't make him the quintessential racist that this separate article can be construed as implying. That was one incident in his life. This article serves no purpose, except to imply an improper perspective on one person's life. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 18:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. Why impossible? There is no logic there. Especially since even ONE peer reviewed article carries a lot of weight.</dd>
<dd>2. The article is not simply a list of promotional web sites, although a link to the man who developed it is promotional in the same way that a link to Microsoft is to a promotional site. As it happens, much editing has been done by people hostile to EFT</dd>
<dd>3. If EFT were not notable, then there would not be so many people actively using it (which they do, incidentally, because it works even if we do not know why). There are much sillier things on Wikipedia.</dd>

<li><b>Abstain</b> for the moment. This article is too long and promotionally detailed. Perhaps cut it in half and expand reference sources. I do not think an article on this subject has to be "all scientific" but rather descriptive if the subject is notable and popular. I am unfamiliar with EFT except for minor exposure from working on the Mercola article. This sounds somewhat different - are there substantially different EFT versions or is Mercola's newsletter a more circumspect summary? Also I would expect an attempt to address any claims/connection on "psychoneuroimmunology", pro and con.--<a href="../../../i/27/c/User%7EI%27clast_cb31.html" title="User:I'clast">I'clast</a> 15:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is one peer reviewed study in a major academic journal, (showing that EFT produced significant reductions in phobias to small animals): Wells, S., Polglase, K., Andrews, H., Carrington, P., &amp; Baker, A.H. (2003). “Evaluation of a Meridian-Based Intervention, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), for Reducing Specific Phobias of Small Animals”. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 59 (9). 943-966. The implication is that EFT has been considered serious enough for academic researchers to be the subject of at least one well designed study.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the professional literature about psychotherapeutic methods, EFT is mentioned as one of several emerging techniques. And yes, these references should be here in the WP article but their absence does not mean that the article should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>And by the way, EFT does not purport to be a science. It is a newly developed technique that shows workable empirical results when used in practice. Absence of rigourous large scale studies proving the effects of a method is not enough to delete an article describing an emerging practice based method.</dd>
<dd>To claim that something is "fringe" when one does not understand it or have knowledge about the literature could be construed as – well – arrogant. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxPont_6146.html" title="User:MaxPont">MaxPont</a> 22:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

The "professional literature about psychotherapeutic methods" is generally indexed on PubMed, yet there's nothing except the one small study from 4 years ago. The rest of the refs are self-published by people who sell EFT books and DVD's.

<dd>Pubmed is only a database covering journal articles with formal empirical studies. Outside Pubmed there exist a large literature where therapists develop concepts and methods, discuss the field and similar matters. These books are written by professionals for other professionals in the field and not for the wider audience. That’s where you can find references to EFT (which should be used in this article). I can agree that the article needs more references and a more NPOV. (And by the way, disliking something is not a valid argument in a deletion debate either <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>). <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxPont_6146.html" title="User:MaxPont">MaxPont</a> 09:55, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject of the article is notable for its popularity among psychotherapists and the general public even if it is not notable as a topic of scientific research.

<p>No sources, no evidence that the role of administrator of an estate is significant outside of a very small locus. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is difficult to find sources for more recent individuals in the White Estate. The White Estate serves the Seventh-day Adventist Church which has a membership of around 15 million members. A history of the White Estate is very much needed and the chairman of the board of the White Estate has played a significant role in shaping the church's role of who Ellen White is and how she is perceived. His name doesn't appear in more recent denominational histories which is all the more reason that we need to keep his name so that we can learn more about him as other Adventists contribute information ~~thewalkingstick~~ 22 Jan 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The only mention of Bradley in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_G._White_Estate_9bb6.html" title="Ellen G. White Estate">Ellen G.

Frankly, I don't see that the trust is particularly notable in any context except a small historical sidenote to the Seventh-Day Adventist church, so I think the White Estate topic should be merged into an SDA article. Certainly being a former chair of an estate trust is not a sufficient claim to notability under WP:BIO unless he was involved in some event which drew substantial coverage from independent published sources.

<li><b>Does not meet Speedy criteria</b>: Regardless of what personal beliefs you might have on the subject, neither Cruft nor Original Research is a reason for an article to be speedied.

<dd>Having reviewed <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and having been the one who has authored and contested the deletion of this article based on my points that I included in the talk page debate. I would add further that under the Criterion of notability, this person meets the following Criterion:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The person has been subject of numerous non trivial articles in various verifiable publications. (I indicated this with a list of the articles and direct links to them as well as their outside sources)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The person has made widely recognized contributions that are part of the hiistorical record in their field including the holding of patents and creation of processes related to the work in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the Criterion of Alternative Verifiability:</p>
<ul>
<li>All information can be verified and some already extends beyond a decade ago</li>
<li>Exandability is without question doable. In fact, this was being addressed prior to this marking of the article and the subsequent talk page and now this.</li>
<li>100 years. Yes, if people are interested in who built the gates that surround the shrine of Muhammad in Medina or who modernized the bronze windows at the library of parliament in Canada or who and what company built the International War Veterans memorial in Toronto Canada, or who and what company built the Baha'i temple in Santiago and so on.</li>
<li>Search Engine Alternative test will also return 100's of hit's from third party sources on this person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can an editor provide me with examples from the article that are out of line with the criterion of wikipedia? I don't believe anyone has done this yet and instead has kept referring to the wp:bio and so on but no specific references. Thanks for any help you can give in keeping this article of this notable person available for continued expansion. <a href="../../../d/j/a/User%7EDjamieson_7bf1.html" title="User:Djamieson">Djamieson</a> 21:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Does it say somewhere in the Wikipedia notability criteria that all self-described fringe political parties in the world are inherently notable enough to have an article? As a non-Canadian, I do not know have a feel for how hard it is to become a "registered" political party in Manitoba. The fact that one person can decide to change a party from Libertarian to Marijuana is not very impressive. How does Wikipedia treat parties in the U.S. or other countries which get a few hundred out of a couple of hundred thousand votes, and which seem not to have been mentioned in the press? If there are no independent, reliable and verifiable sources (other than for the fact of having registered) how can editors obtain enough info to write an accurate and encyclopedic article? I feel that the technicality of "registering" does not automatically confer notability. We have defeated city coucil and county board candidates in major cities who are not notable for articles, but have extensive press coverage and many times more votes than this party got. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are currently only six registered parties in Manitoba (New Democratic, Progressive Conservative, Liberal, Green, Communist, Marijuana). Parties must field at least five candidates in a provincial election to retain their registration. This isn't a case of someone just waking up one day and declaring a new party; there's a process that has to be followed. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not surprised that the speedy delete was removed. The preferred way to request removal of mixed drink-related articles (even really bad ones like this particular one) is to place {{<a href="../../../w/p/m/Template%7EWPMIXMergeDelete_a25b.html" title="Template:WPMIXMergeDelete">WPMIXMergeDelete</a>}} on the talk page and then add a note explaining the request. The reason we request this (and it is a request, not an official policy), is because the <a href="../../../m/i/x/WP%7EMIX_415d.html" title="WP:MIX">Mixed Drinks WikiProject</a> tends to cut and paste little snippets of otherwise substandard articles, and merge the good parts into other articles. For <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL license</a> requirements, we must keep the original edit history intact, and turn the old page into a redirect pointing to where the information has been moved.</li>
<li>The question to be determined in this case is: is there <i>anything</i> worth salvaging from this article? I do not know anything about the topic of this article, but the discussion on the talk page indicates that the term, at least, might be notable enough to be described somewhere (possibly in the Spanish Wiktionary with an interwiki soft redirect?). Here is what one user wrote: "Maybe the article should be changed to define it as a joke/slang term and it ways it <a href="http://www.colimamagic.com/id26.html" class="external text" title="http://www.colimamagic.com/id26.html" rel="nofollow">can be used</a>."</li>
<li>I have no opinion on the value of the article itself (I don't know enough to make any judgment), but <b>if <i>any</i> part</b> of the article is kept (even in the Spanish Wiktionary or a different article here), then my vote is to convert the article into some type of <b>REDIRECT</b> to the new location to preserve the edit history.

<li>The article hasn't changed substantially since I translated it from Spanish. The article has a couple of curious points, like the insistence on using tapwater rather than distilled water. Also the phrase "una bebida alcoholica preparada antiquisima" in the original kind of gave me translation problems. I translated this as "an alcoholic beverage prepared since ancient times" although it literally means "an alcoholic beverage prepared very antiquely" or somesuch.

<li><b>Question</b>. Has his work been established as notable, or is he just another designer in a crowded, competitive field?

<li><b>Response</b> As best I can guess, he's an example of the modern trend towards people who are celebrities not for what they did or can do. Contestants from these sort of reality show often make public appearances, try their hands as actors or anchorpeople, etc. I don't think anyone is claiming Knight is a notable or successful designer. He's a notable pop culture figure, however.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My concern isn't whether people like or dislike her, in fact I've never seen or even heard of the show or her, but that has no bearing on her notability. The fact is she fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, specifically <i>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</i>. There's not enough source material to create a verifiable encyclopedic article about her in my opinion, if more sources are added my opinion will change though obviously. For example see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ben_Mills_6748.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Mills">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Mills</a>. At the time he was simply a losing contestant (finished third) on a show (similar to American Idol, but with slight differences) and wasn't notable. However since then he's signed a five album deal with Sony and is therefore notable. In my opinion runners up (and sometimes winners) of reality shows aren't notable unless they achieve something afterwards. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 20:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_J.P._Calderon_2fa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/J.P. Calderon">second afd</a> for this article. I believe it should be deleted because the person is not notable and for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It fails several parts of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>:
<ol>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>) - <i>Nope</i></li>
<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person - <i>All of the interviews were mandatory Survivor interviews conducted because of his Survivor involvement, not because of his self notability</i></li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ol>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a>, <a href="../../../g/q/_/GQ_8d36.html" title="GQ">GQ</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/ELLE_7ea6.html" title="ELLE">Elle</a>, <a href="../../../f/h/m/FHM_6b72.html" title="FHM">FHM</a> or national newspapers. - <i>The only articles cited are mandatory interviews that come automatically after elimination. Meaning that none of the interviews were conducted because of his notability. And, the Calgary Sun is hardly a national newspaper.</i></li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following - <i>No indication of that</i></li>
<li>An independent biography - <i>Not much of a biography</i></li>
<li>Name recognition - <i>They didn't even tell his last name on Survivor</i></li>
<li>Commercial endorsements - <i>None indicated</i></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He fails of the criteria listed there, as well, will anyone really find such a page necessary in 100 years. A google search yielded <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22J%2eP%2e+Calderon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22J%2eP%2e+Calderon%22" rel="nofollow">20,200 results</a>, but compare this with Sekou Brunch (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Sekou+Bunch%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Sekou+Bunch%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">20,700 results</a>) and Cecilia Mansilla (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Cecilia+Mansilla%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Cecilia+Mansilla%22" rel="nofollow">32,100</a>) who were both voted out before J.P. and compare this with the people from CI that do have pages: Jonathan Penner (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Penner%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Penner%22" rel="nofollow">73,500</a>) , Ozzy Lusth (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Ozzy+Lusth%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Ozzy+Lusth%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">79,000</a>), Becky Lee (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Becky+Lee%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Becky+Lee%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">54,500</a>) and Yul Kwon (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Yul+Kwon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Yul+Kwon%22" rel="nofollow">105,000</a>), so how does that make him a stand out?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Precedent has already been set that merely being in Survivor is not enough for a page. See the afds for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Candice_Woodcock_e550.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Candice Woodcock">Candice Woodcock</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Keith_Famie_5b7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Keith Famie">Keith Famie</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathy_Vavrick-O%27Brien_4a6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien">Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien</a></li>
<li>I looked at that Volleyball article, and very few of them have pages, not even the two players who the article claims were the top ranked in 2005. Precedent has already been established for Survivor articles, and if not even the top ranked AVP players have pages, then the main reason for his page is JDMA, which he hasn't done anything of note in, and by the way, none of the contestants from that article have individual pages, not even JDs page is linked from there.</li>
<li>Most of the articles cited are merely standard interviews that every ex Survivor gives once being voted , meaning that every single Survivor contestant has similar pages, and yet these were admissable in previous afds.</li>

<li>The admin responded to the message you left on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:W.marsh#J.P._Calderon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:W.marsh#J.P._Calderon" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> <i>eleven minutes after the AfD closed</i> by saying "Sure, you can technically re-nominate whenever you want, <b>but it's best to present new evidence/arguments if you nominate again immedietly, not just "go for round two" of AfD and rehash the old discussion.</b> Most people would suggest <b>waiting at least a month</b> for re-nominating if there's no compelling new evidence to present." (emphasis added). Your new nomination is largely a copy and paste from the previous AfD, not new evidence, compelling or otherwise.</li>
<li>The admin also directed you to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> which says in relevant part "By long tradition, the consensus opinion of the community about an article's disposition is held virtually sacrosanct, and may not be overturned or disregarded lightly. Sometimes, however, users disagree with the consensus opinion arrived at in the AFD quite strongly. What can you do if you disagree with the consensus opinion? First, it is a good idea to try to understand why the community made its decision. You may find that its reasoning was sensible. However, if you remain unsatisfied with the consensus decision, there are a few options open to you.</li>
<li>"If you think that an article was wrongly <i>kept</i> after the AFD, you could wait to see if the article is improved to overcome your objections; if it isn't, you can renominate it for deletion. If and when you do renominate, be careful to say why you think the reasons proffered for keeping the article are poor, and why you think the article must be deleted." Rather than wait to see if the article could be improved to answer your objections, you re-nominated the article just 37 minutes after the first AfD closed.</li>
<li>Your conduct regarding this article has been questionable from the start. You redirected it twice to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Survivor%7E_Cook_Islands_f5fe.html" title="Survivor: Cook Islands">Survivor: Cook Islands</a>. You attempted to orphan it by repeatedly removing the link to it from both that article and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Template%7ESurvivor_contestants_792f.html" title="Template:Survivor contestants">Template:Survivor contestants</a>, including removing it from the template once under the subterfuge of performing other cosmetic maintenance. For whatever reason, you do not have any critical distance from this article. I have asked you repeatedly to take a step back from it. I will ask you to do so again and request that this AfD be closed. I imagine that you will fell compelled to respond to this message by arguing or pointing out some of my actions regarding this article. Do so if you must but I still encourage you to take a step back. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have questioned your <i>conduct</i>. If you choose to take questioning your <i>conduct</i> as an attack on you personally, that's your unfortunate choice. I have already defended this article repeatedly at the previous AfD. This second nomination has nothing to do with the article itself and everything to do with the motivation of the person who nominated it. You have displayed a strong bias against this article since it was created. This nomination is nothing but a continuation of your attempt to enforce your bias. You may very well be acting within the letter of the rules but your taking refuge within the letter doesn't change the fact that you're acting outside their spirit. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I agree with others saying that he should not be included just because he was on Survivor, but it seems to me his collection of work merit mention, at least at this time, I say lets revisit this in 6 months to a year to see if this is still the case. <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsRedShirt_0fad.html" title="User:EnsRedShirt">EnsRedShirt</a> 01:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm sure WP doesn't want this type of article creep, and even if those that have been editing this for a while don't add them, the existence of the J.P. page will likely embolden newer users to create pages for all the other contestants. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 14:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that Survivor contestent articles should be handled consistently. If other contestents have similar references to this one, they should be treated the same way. Unreferenced articles should be deleted. I don't have a problem, though, with articles that are otherwise referenced by multiple published articles about the subject being kept. I've never watched Survivor, personally, but if that stance means more Survivor contestents have articles, then more power to them. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, the only Survivor contestants that get a lot of post-show recognition (and thus pages with a lot of info) are those that made it to the final 4, and specifically those that also appeared in All-Stars (not mutually exclusive sets). So about 25% of the contestants have pages. This means about 150 more paged will be made, with rather simple statements like "John Q Smith was a contestant on Survivor Alaska. He is from Anytown, USA, and is a part time editor" with otherwise minimal backup. This makes the information pretty much duplicate what is already on the CBS website and fan sites for these contestants. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 00:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To quickly reply, 1) this particular article does not simply say "he was a contestent on Survivor from Anytown USA". It's quite a bit lengthier than that. If a <i>different</i> article about a Survivor contestent appears that is little more than a one or two sentence stub, then that can obviously be safely deleted. That's not the case for this afd though. 2) I don't really see a problem with duplicating information that also happens to appear on another website. In fact, since Wikipedia isn't a primary source, <i>all</i> the material in Wikipedia has already supposedly been published before and is available elsewhere. Thus duplication with a fan site isn't a problem, and in fact would be the norm for all articles about anything in pop culture. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the JP article, in of itself, isn't bad and if it weren't for being a Survivor contestant (like 200+ other people) I'd not have the issue; it's just, again, if a new user that doesn't see this discussion but sees that JP (a early outted player with a few wikifiable and links that could be added), they may try to make similar pages for any other Survivor contestant with even less notability. As a counter-/co-example, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Jon_Drinkard_98d9.html" title="Bobby Jon Drinkard">Bobby Jon Drinkard</a> is article for another Survivor contestant. This article has no biographical info, and mearly is a restating of the information of the main Survivor season articles he was in. I'd strongly suggest that be up for deletion. Then there's Gregg Carey, where the bulk of the article is based on Survivor season info, and has a tiny tiny bio line as well. That's the murky water I'm concerned about: is that page notable or not? --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 18:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If, as you say, you don't consider this article to be too bad and wouldn't have an issue aside from the fact that he was a Survivor contestent, then <i>this</i> article should be kept. If someone else write another article about a different contestent, and <i>that</i> article has no biographical info or lacks references, etc, then <i>that</i> article should be deleted. We have to consider the articles individually in terms of their published references and whether or not the article is simply a stub with little to no information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just a note for those interested, this seems to be the exact same debate that's going on right now over at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stephen_Colbert_Day_f041.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Colbert Day">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Colbert Day</a>. Basically it's an argument as to whether or not having sources automatically makes something/somebody notable enough to warrant an article. The same as how there are dozens of news articles this week about "Stephen Colbert Day" and some people there don't believe that it makes the "holiday" (celebrated only in one small town of Ontario) notable enough for an encyclopedia, people here don't believe that having a few interviews published about you in relation to a reality TV series doesn't make you notable enough for the encyclopedia. Anyway, just an interesting parallel I noticed, it'll also be interesting to see if both AfDs go the same way or not. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 17:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Mael, I don't think both have to go the same way as I agree Stephen Colbert Day is about as notable as Bradmas, but I don't think that sources making something notable is at issue here as much as one persons vendetta versus a certain article, and how many people must think of an article notable before it is notable enough to warrant inclusion in the pedia. This person is obviously notable to a certain segment of the population even if he is not notable to you me or scorpion. Why is our non notability of him a reason to delete the article? There are 1.6 million + articles on the pedia now I doubt that I will ever see most of them, does that mean they should be deleted because they are not notable to everyone?? Of course not. <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsRedShirt_0fad.html" title="User:EnsRedShirt">EnsRedShirt</a> 19:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you're going by recognition, then I'd guess that the millions of people who've watched the Colbert Report in the past week or two would say Stephen Colbert Day is a bit more recognizable than the dozens of people who've heard of Bradmas.&#160;;-) And on the same grounds, I'd bet that a lot more people watch Colbert Report and remember the discussions about SCD than there are that watched Survivor and remember some guy that was only on the show for a couple weeks, didn't do anything apparantly notable or memorable, and then left to go join another reality show with a much smaller fan base. But from what I saw on this and the last AfD, most people weren't judging based on whether or not they recognized or remembered the guy (since everybody has different experiences, that's hard to judge), but they were instead judging on how many references there were to news articles about him. Now, the SCD article is up for AfD on the opposite grounds, that even though there are a lot of news articles about it, it's not innately notable (which is a similar argument that I'd made on the previous AfD here). And if SCD isn't innately notable (when it was mentioned several times on a highly rated nighttime show), then I have trouble seeing JP as innately notable (when he was only on 3 episodes of a highly rated reality series) as well. Just my thoughts... --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 19:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If it makes you feel better, Mael, I'd probably recommend keeping the SCD article <i>if</i> it is properly referenced and doesn't comfortably fit within the text of Colbert's main article. I have no problem with well referenced articles about subjects that receive coverge from multiple published sources being kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. After reviewing the SCD article, I notice it actually <i>doesn't</i> have good references in the article. So in fact I'd probably recommend only keeping if adequate references could be provided within the article. It needs a good reference clean up to be kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe this article should be kept. Sure, he was one of many, many people to be on Survivor, and creating an individual page for each of them <i>would</i> be pointless and waste bandwidth. However, He <i>IS</i> notable for more than just being a minor contestant on Survivor. He was/is featured on more than one reality show (and heavily featured on JDMA), both very popular on their respective networks. His appearance in Instinct magazine, in which he and his sexuality and coming out were the cover story, IS reason for inclusion in Wikipedia, under gender/sexuality issues, not to mention that it is a non self-authored print article included in a nationally circulated publication, which supports inclusion as well. I have a feeling that some of those who oppose Calderon's entry in Wikipedia are doing so due to his sexuality, as per the comment above about "Buy the magazine, go to a bathroom somewhere, and get over your obsession". Please, let's be a little more adult about disgreements. Some people may be arguing for his inclusion because they're "fans", but there are very legitimate claims for keeping this article, and personal dislike of Calderon, for whatever reason, should not not enter into the discussion as long as it is a rational one. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBounti76_115a.html" title="User:Bounti76">Bounti76</a> 14:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am proud to announce my first proceduaral AfD nomination on Wikipedia. A user tried to list this article on Afd, but apparently didn't know how. It was deleted once before per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Space_warfare_in_fiction_bca5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Space warfare in fiction">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Space warfare in fiction</a>).

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> No reason is available for the nomination by the anon IP who attempted to list, nor is this the same article that was previously discussed. It's clearly not OR, and is fully referenced from start to finish. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 20:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I nominated the first and second versions of this article for deletion. They were quite different from this third version. Unlike the first two versions <s>(the nominator seems to be referring to the speedy deletion -recreation of deleted material I assume- of the second in their nomination),</s> this version has sources that may qualify as secondary sources (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Types_of_source_material" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Types of source material</a>). While I still think the article is unencylopedic cruft and essentially an OR essay, I will abstain from&#160;!voting. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 22:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I recommended Delete in the previous afd, but that was a very different article to this one. This article appears to have much better references and less original analysis and original research. I'm not in a good position to really delve into this article's details and such at the moment, so I'm going to abstain for now on keep vs delete. But I will say that at least at first glance I'm more inclined to keep this version of the article than the one I seem to remember reading last time around. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Clearly not a repost as it is different text with sources that aleviate the prior concern (OR essay with no secondary sources). Should be kept (possibly speedily) as no argument for deletion has been presented. If the article keeps improving deleting is clearly unwarranted and if not it can be discussed when someone is willing to take the time to make a reasoned argument that it (still) violates policy. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 11:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Looks like it might be merged into an sf themes article such as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_opera.html" title="Space opera">space opera</a>, but there's enough verifiable material which is of interest in a historical discussion of sf themes that it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 19:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Needs expanding to include more context (e.g. a more thorough history of the development of the genre, common criticisms of the depictions, etc.) but otherwise nothing wrong with this article. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 20:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The thing about redirecting the page to the album article is that myself and at least one other editor have tried it (not to mention the various editors who have, in good faith, been blanking the page completely), only to be reverted by overzealous Aguilera fans trying to "scoop" other websites. So, if the page was to be turned into a redirect as a result of this discussion, I'd strongly recommend that it be protected. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 13:14, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are over a hundred separate Grammy Award categories this year, so I think listing every single nominee in each is unnecessary. The nominees for the major awards are already listed at the main <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Awards_of_2007_550f.html" title="Grammy Awards of 2007">Grammy Awards of 2007</a> article. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 21:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Using an internet search engine created over 40 years after a company closed is the incorrect method of determining notabilty of such company.

<dd>I've cast my vote already but allow me to expand. If Colbert, tomorrow, in an act of pure comic genius, sticks his finger up his ass, I would not expect there to be an WP article on Steve Colbert's Ass. There should, however, be a mention of this meritorious incident in the Colbert article. That's what this "day" is. Citing article after article mentioning the "day" only proves that the show has promotional weight, it does nothing to establish true notability. It's a stunt, not a true civic holiday, so mention it in all its detail in the main Colbert show article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 01:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me compare this to another Colbert event that made the news this month: when Colbert and his victim of parody, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, [<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/09/tv.oreillyvscolbert.ap/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/09/tv.oreillyvscolbert.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">swapped guest appearances on each other's shows</a>. In that case, it received similar attention to Stephen Colbert Day (may I also suggest, in a side note, that non-Canadian editors may not grasp the relatively grander levels of attention this story is getting in this country, and Wikipedia is not just an American encyclopedia. Although as "Of Montreal" is indicative, this does not affect your view. This note is merely for others). However, where O'Reilly and Colbert's guest appearances were a similar promotional event, they did not affect the world in any way outside of their respective shows. As such, information on this still fairly notable event was relegated to their respective show's articles. In the case of Stephen Colbert Day, however, this stunt does have effect on the real world: Oshawa, Ontario is now made to celebrate Stephen Colbert Day every year as a result. Again, may I suggest that your extreme dislike for Colbert's shtick and the recent Colbert-inspired Wikipedia vandalism you aided in preventing (I saw your request to have Stephen Colbert Day locked from editing on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStephen_Colbert_6f25.html" title="Talk:Stephen Colbert">Talk:Stephen Colbert</a>) is such a strong bias it makes you ignore these notability factors and differences to some promotional stunts? -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 02:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

It sounds to me like you're all just sore that, once again, he trashed the site on his show. Now, I'm not saying he should do that, I'm merely saying that your whining HERE is only serving to give him more material, which makes his "lame show" more popular, which means he'll just CONTINUE making wikipedia-based shows. I don't see how having this definition up in general serves any discredit to wikipedia, nor do I say how it could possibly be a bad thing - it's a "Day", it's not like it's saying "Stephen Colbert LOL!" made for every thing he said. I admit, he has a lot of stuff here, but that's like saying Martin Luther King (No, I'm not comparing Colbert to King, it's just an accurate analogy here) shouldn't have a definition for Martin Luther King Day but instead should just have it under a little heading in his full definition of him. Or, for a fairer comparison, that International Talk Like a Pirate Day and Day of the Ninja should not exist as articles, but should rather just both fall under Pirates vs Ninjas. Yet, of course, NONE of you complain about that - you only whine about this day because, boo hoo, Colbert insulted (in his SATIRICAL CHARACTER, might I remind you) your precious wikipedia. And remember - the definition for both DotN was up MONTHS (or at least weeks) before the actual day was first celebrated, so your argument of "it hasn't been scheduled yet, it's not a crystal ball omg!" doesn't work here.</li>

<dd>Yep. For what it's worth, I reverted about 5 similar edits to other pages before searching "commodity" to see if there was any vandalism of obscure commodity-related pages, and I was curious as to how long it would take to see a revert on a fairly unedited page (the last few of only a handful edits were in December and November). It was low level vandalism that affected an obscure page as part of an experiment, and mentioning it here, I thought, would be blown out of proportion, though I'll thank Shawn in Montreal for not doing so. I was curious as to the result and decided it would harm no one, though it was wrong. If that rebukes all my valid arguments about the notability of Stephen Colbert Day, so be it.

<li><b>Changing vote to Merge and redirect</b>* Ehhh... my main problem was with the stupid basis of the arguments for deleting it (which tended to be LOL COLBERT R SUX), which thus lead ironically to my OWN bias and voting keep even though I don't actually think it should be kept. So, I'll say merge and redirect, but I stand by what I said earlier - for all of you voting delete, unless you have some sort of ACTUALLY VALID reason for it... please refrain from posting at all.

<li>Aguyuno, would you mind logging in and formally striking your original comment? (You can do that by wrapping it in tags &lt;s&gt;like this&lt;/s&gt; - either the entire comment or just the bolded part, it doesn't matter). I'd do it for you, but the fact that you posted your new recommendation under an IP instead of logging in sort of complicates things.

<li><b>Delete and merge unless adequate references provided for verification</b> My only problem with this article is that the references are entirely inadequate. The only acceptable source provided is the MSNBC article, which only covers the very bare bones details. The great bulk of the article is currently entirely unreferenced and unsourced. Delete and merge the basic facts into Colbert's main article unless the references receive a major cleanup. Note that I do not have a problem with "potential notability" or "fancruft", so if the reference issue is corrected then I will probably change my recommendation to keep. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Crystal-ballism. Hasn't happened yet, no indication it will be noteworthy when it does, definitely no indication anyone will remember it in five years, let alone 100.

<dd>FYI, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a> only comes into play for future events that aren't verified by published sources. You can, for example, write articles about future planned events, albums, films, and so on provided that there are good, verifiable references to show the information in the article is accurate and not simply editorial speculation. Also, note that notability doesn't "expire". So if an event is notable enough for inclusion now and provides sufficient references for verification, it can be kept for historical purposes on Wikipedia even the public loses interest in the even at a later date. (Otherwise what would be the point of writing historical articles about subjects the general populace doesn't know about?) <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, I'll reiterate that I think this article as it currently stands doesn't have adequate references. So on <i>those</i> grounds, I still support deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know, but I don't feel this has been verified by published sources. The hundred-year metric is shorthand for considering notability of current pop-culture events: Will anyone remember them in a hundred years? It does have its flaws, of course, but I find it useful to keep in mind when considering this sort of thing. Could've sworn it used to be mentioned at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, but if so, it seems that's gone away some time in the last few months. Anyway, its main thrust is that a current event that gets some media play is not necessarily notable in the long term. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Notability doesn't expire with time, and far as I know there isn't a "hundred year metric" in policy. Rather, it follows as a means of showing that there is a suitable level of verifiable information and interest at the time the article was written. If Wiki was only intended for articles that people remember after a hundred years, there would be little point in writing historical articles about esoteric subjects that aren't currently widely discussed but that still offer interesting or possibly useful information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course there isn't. There isn't a notability metric in policy; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is a guideline. It is, however, true that there is consensus that passing media notice does not equate to notability.

<dd>Well, I'm afraid the burden of proof of the statement that there is consensus regarding handling media notice for notability purposes is on you. Far as I know no such consensus exists or is discussed in any existing guidelines or policies. But I'm certainly not perfect, so if I missed such a consensus discussion or guideline, feel fere to post a link. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As the main original author, and a resident of Oshawa, I request that this be kept. It gives more detail as to how Stephen Colbert Day came to be. I took the picture of the newpaper to show how important it is for the city of Oshawa. The day will be celebrated annually, therefore, detailed information, specifically a separate article, is desirealbe.</li>

<dd>Actually, the reference I recently added included a quote from the mayor of Oshawa inviting Colbert to visit them for the holiday, and offering to do several things to accomodate him (including declaring a "bear-free" day and other things in line with the humour of the event) --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 23:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course the mayor issued an official invitation, and I'm sure some members of the community will turn up at whatever event they have and get videotaped for that night's Colbert Report. That doesn't mean that anyone is going to care even a year from now. It's a publicity stunt, not a holiday, and certainly not an even remotely important one. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Just because a few people really, really care does not make the topic encyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 00:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And I say, forget the metric system. As I stated above, perhaps too colourfully for my good, I don't even agree that the number of media hits or geographical spread of coverage even <i>matters</i>. Certainly it's proof of the popularity of the show. But I don't believe it does anything to establish the reality of this "Day" independent of the show and its hype, hence my vote to include the Day in the main show article.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 21:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think something that is being missed here is that it isn't important whether or not the actual holiday is "celebrated", or even officially recognized. The question is whether the <i>news story behind</i> the holiday is notably verified. Even if the mayor in the story welches, the article only has to show that the news story about the bet behind the holiday meets notability guidelines. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The length of a given Wikipedia entry tends to grow as people add information to it. This cannot go on forever: very long entries would cause problems. So we must move information out of entries periodically. This information should not be removed from Wikipedia: that would defeat the purpose of the contributions. So we must create new entries to hold the excised information. - from the content guideline <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary_style#Rationale</a>. The article <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> is a good-sized article. The two tables on this article are a page long each. This article's reference section is a page long as well. Merging it into the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article would add the much to the already large article. I think it should stay separated to keep the Wii article from growing too large.

<li><b>keep</b> Since the main article willcontinue to grow, it is appropriate to keep this separate, since it is notable in its own right.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge/redirect</b>. Most of the article is described on the Wii page (as the original editor stated). I see no "first weekends of movies" or launches of televisions or anything else, why should video games be an exception? Yes, a launch is a big deal: but Wikipedia isn't a place for articles like this. Put this on a Nintendo Wiki of some sort, not here. Merge the notable information that isn't on the Wii page already, then redirect this to the Wii page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 07:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The main problem is that <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> and <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360_launch.html" title="Xbox 360 launch">Xbox 360 launch</a> are both at AFDs with different results, while <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_launch_ee26.html" title="PlayStation 3 launch">PlayStation 3 launch</a> is exempted. All three articles should have been grouped in a single AFD, otherwise there will be conflicts (this will be merged, and people will try to merge the Wii launch article having this as precedent, while others will try to recreate the Xbox 360 launch article because the Wii launch was kept). I suggest closing this and reopening the AFD with the three grouped as one. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with ReyBrujo, a grouped together AFD would work better. I put the Playstation 3 launch in an afd just now. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 01:02, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as another nominator said themselves <i>"a launch is a big deal"</i>. Add onto that this is one of the biggest launches of last year, you get an article that has had massive news coverage and is highly notabile. There is a already a section on the Wii page, with a link to <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_launch.html" title="Wii launch">Wii launch</a> as <i>the main article</i>. Naturally the three newest would have articles about it, while older ones were launched in the early days of wikipedia (or even, long long before wikipedia existed). Thus this is just one reason why claiming "older consoles don't have and article for launch and thus this one shouldn't either" is not an argument at all. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The parent article is growing quite long. While I have no crystal ball, I do not forsee it shrinking massively in the next few years, and thus splitting it apart is a valid reason for this to exist. That said, if the parent shrinks a little, a merge is in order. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 09:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm just making this page as a temporary page for my girlfriend, definitely not self promotion or anything of the sort. I also had no intention of maintaining or keeping it, and would most likely have deleted all the information by tonight. Please just leave it up for the next day, it's just to give her a laugh while she's stressed.

<dd>See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Criteria for Speedy Deletion</a>. A7 says an article may be deleted if the article has no assertion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. Speedy deletion means that an article is so unequivocally unqualified to remain that any administrator can delete it without discussion. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 23:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
