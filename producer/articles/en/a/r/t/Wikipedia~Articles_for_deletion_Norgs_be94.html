<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps it's a neologism, but it's a neologism coined to describe a new and evolving phenomenon. In his original post, Will Bunch wrote "Hence, the 'norg.' 'Norg' because we need to lose our old identity with one dying medium, newspapers, and stress our most valuable commodity, the one that we truly own, and that is news . . . without the paper. Thus, we must now be news organizations, or 'norgs.'" Before this entry is deleted as a neologism, I would like to know what term can be adequately substituted in its place. We -- and by "we" I mean a diverse and influential group of established journalists, new media bloggers, and community activists -- are starting a growing conversation about the future of news and the future of newspapers. I agree with Carl that critical mass has been reached, as reflected in the google search linked above. I hope that the quote from Will Bunch shows that this is not, as Deville suggests, "completely restricted to blogs." -- <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETattered_Matt_2d97.html" title="User:Tattered Matt">Tattered_Matt</a> 19:39, 26 March 2006</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> - The meaning of this word is changing by the moment, and elevating to a higher and useful purpose. I would think again before removing it because some Australians have used it childishly. If you insist, keep it singular: Norg. -- Daniel Rubin, the Philadelphia Inquirer/blinq. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Danielrubin (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielrubin_d65b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielrubin">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The above two comments describe why it should <u>not</u> be kept. It's a new, evolving, changing word, that is not in widespread use, and what use there is, is inconsistent. Most definitely not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:02, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fan-1967, can you clarify what you mean by "widespread use"? Where is the threshold, and how is "widespread use" measured? <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETattered_Matt_2d97.html" title="User:Tattered Matt">Tattered_Matt</a> 05:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know where you'd draw the threshold exactly, but wherever it is, "norgs" is clearly below it. I find less than 1000 google hits, half of which seem to be about breasts. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 05:18, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If there is no measurable threshold, I find it hard to understand how norgs is "clearly" below it. <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETattered_Matt_2d97.html" title="User:Tattered Matt">Tattered_Matt</a> 07:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I didn't say there was no threshold, I said it isn't precise. IMO, a few hundred references doesn't cut remotely qualify as "widespread". Words in common usage get tens (or hundreds) of thousands of hits. This is a new word that hasn't caught on yet, and there isn't even consensus as to what it means. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 07:25, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - While some have said the meaning of this word is changing by the moment, I would argue there is a solid definition of the word - but its implementation will change as the web changes.</p>
<p>"Norgs are news organizations that support "acts of journalism". This support can sometimes include legal, financial, organizational, and instuctional components in different combinations, regardless of medium. Products may include printed newspapers, websites, forums, wikis, podcasts, blogs, video, or any combination of these. As such, a Norg operates independently of format and medium, a break from how many traditional media organizations view themselves."</p>
<p>I've editted the Wikipedia entry to firm it up a bit - but I think Will Bunch, fairly much defined the term appropriately. It's "newness" or lack of poularity should not be a cause for deletion. Maybe for it to face Wikipedia's community for further editting - yes - as examples and implementations come along - but not deletion. -- Karl Martino, host of Philly Future. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.17.32.27 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.17.32.27.html" title="User talk:208.17.32.27">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.17.32.27_d20f.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.17.32.27">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - Concerning the threshold for widespread usage, is this threshold at all influenced by the authority of those making the case for it? In other words, if the term is in heavy use by executives and veterans of the field to which it applies, how relevant is this vague threshold for the Google-ability of the word? Would it be any more legitimate if two million teenagers were using it online as a slang term? If so, maybe some are misunderstanding (or overestimating?) the legitimate purpose of this site. -- Howard Hall <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.162.174.36 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.162.174.36_fc79.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.162.174.36">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - This term has been used for the last half a year by established people from the main stream media and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_media.html" title="New media">new media</a>. This conversation has spread from blogs to the corporate boardroom. If credibility is what some are worried about, then what do managing editors, senior writers, an editorial page editor, senior IT people of two established papers in the fifth largest city in the US bring to the table? One of the founders of Entertainment Weekly? The cooperation of an Ivy League school along with the attendence of the Dean of said school? A group of the most involved and widely read bloggers from the community? Representatives from Independent Media from two cities? Among others from across the country who could not make it to the physical unconference due to scheduling conflicts. Yes this is a new term, but as Karl noted, there does exist a solid definition and ideal behind the word. It will be an organic and changing form, but the roots are firmly in place. This term should stay and continue to grow and be edited by the wiki community as the wiki is a part of the essence of the term. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonballyee_f313.html" title="User:Dragonballyee">Dragonballyee</a> 21:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
