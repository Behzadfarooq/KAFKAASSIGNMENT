<p>If you fail in your run for office as the mayor of Ottawa, receive campaign contributions from the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">KKK</a> and get arrested for breach of probation, are you <i>then</i> notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia?

<li>Nah, had she been, say, a labour/social democratic (or whatever they call that in Canada) politician, receiving campaign contributions from the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">KKK</a> would have made her notable, but if she is a Nazi, I don't see how it could.

<li>Seems like a fairly minor candidate. If she's not from a major party/doesn't have a reasonable chance of winning, not notable--<b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 02:15, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As I have said, running for mayor of Ottawa is notable in its own right, add the fact that she created quite a lot of controversy. There are lesser candidates for other elections who were spared deletion, I don't see why she has to be. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> 03:10, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ugh! Sounds like an attack page. Is this verified? Considering that any citizen can run for mayor, I don't see how that is notable in its own right. However if she was a major news item, then that would be notable. <b>Abstain</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 12:20, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. She is quite notable. Wanted in several places for crimes, and ran for Mayor of Ottawa. She made quite the headlines. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a> 18:58, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Are we running out of space here? Is his article tkaing up real estate that could be used for something else? Of course not. If there can be bunches of pages dedicated to computers and fantasy games, surely there can be pages dedicated to political also-rans, especially those who are notorious by virtue of their despicable views. It kind of sounds like "I'm not from Ottawa, so this is not important to <i>me</i>, so it shouldn't be in Wikipedia." <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 19:01, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Only 365 hits, and some of those are for a guitar teacher in Philly. Couldn't find verification of being 'wanted' other than WP mirrors. I could file in the next election for mayor in either of the cities where I have apartments; would that make me inherently notable? I don't think so. I've even been arrested four times, spent close to a week combined in jail, and lived with a warrant out for my arrest for months. Still doesn't make me notable. Stupid, maybe, but not notable. Oh, and given that there is now a $75,000 fundraising drive, shortly after a $50,000 drive, I'd say yes, 'running out of space' <b>is</b> an issue. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:23, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article provides evidence that Canada is not free of racism. It also helps to show that racism does not have popular support. So, I believe it is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">James Teterenko</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesTeterenko_796e.html" title="User talk:JamesTeterenko">(talk)</a> 20:14, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia policy is clear that prominent local candidates (even those on the political fringe) qualify for inclusion. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 00:43, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. She does not meet my understanding of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Being an alleged criminal is not sufficient. Being a failed candidate for local office is not sufficient. Being both at the same time is, unfortunately, not uncommon enough to be notable either. Certainly does not pass the "100 year" test. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:28, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, notable enough to have her arrest in Atlantic Canada and subsequent run for mayor in Ottawa covered by the national media.AndyL 06:10, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, although I hasten to point out mayoral candidates are not inherently notable <i>just</i> for being candidates; they need to have some additional criteria of notability. Upson <i>did</i> receive national media coverage in Canada for both her criminal charges and her links to the KKK and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Party_of_Canada_8eb2.html" title="Nationalist Party of Canada">Nationalist Party of Canada</a>, so IMO she qualifies. It's the national media coverage that makes the difference for me, though; there have been other controversial Canadian mayoral candidates whom I <i>wouldn't</i> support articles for, due to their strictly local notoriety. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:01, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
