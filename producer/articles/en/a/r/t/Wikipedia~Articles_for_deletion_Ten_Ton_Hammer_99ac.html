<p>Deleted once as A7 and G11, now re-created with assertions of notability in the form of passing mentions in some external media.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a third party proponent. I use Ten Ton Hammer as a source for many of the MMO's that I participate in. It is accurate and reliable. Yes, it has forums, but many places that are listed here have forums as well as content. TTH articles themselves are not OR, but well documented with references to other articles. I find I link to many other sites listed in their articles during the course of my time spent on TTH. I am not a paid employee. I am volunteering my time to see that a valuable resource be included in the Wikipedia. It would be a shame to not include this type of resource in this encyclopedia. It's larger and more helpful than the other two sites mentioned below. --Zannniee 17:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Indeed we are JzG. *smiles* Anyway, you should not redelete the page, as there are sites of comparable size and stature (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratics.html" title="Stratics">Stratics</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcry.html" title="Warcry">Warcry</a>) that have pages on the Wiki and are not being threatened with deletion. We are still looking for clarification on several issues brought up in the "discussion" section of the page that have not been addressed. I'll reask here: would being considered an "affiliated" website (a status symbol) be the equivalent of a notable award. There are several gaming companies that consider Ten Ton Hammer "affiliated". We are collecting quotes from their community managers as we speak.

<li><b><s>Cleanup &amp; Neutral for now</s></b> WarCry is AfD too right now, but I've been working to find and add proper references for it to show its notability per WP:WEB. If someone could do the same thing with TTH, I think that'd go a long way towards establishing notability. And clean up the article to be a bit more neutral too, right now, it reads like an ad/press release.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 12:57, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b>. Cleaned up some stuff, added a reference or two, but it does need more references. And serious rewriting of some of the parts. I've already started NPOV-ing the thing, need some help rephrasing some stuff to make them not sound like a promotional thingy. To the TTH people here, if you guys are serious about the entry, please look for some 3rd-party references and add them to the article. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 17:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Site's verifiable and notable enough for me now. While there's a lot of WP:COI going on here, I think the article is moving towards NPOV now. Cleaned up the links and references, could use some more.<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 20:48, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hello, Nicole Hamlett here, I work for the aforementioned insubstantiated network. It appears that our Affiliation with Sigil Games is not a valid indication that we are a credible source for MMO news etc. If I may, could I please have a direct list of things that we need to do as a company to validate our existence within these pages? Thank you. -- unsigned comment left on 18:38, 25 January 2007 by 75.70.215.55 (Talk)</li>

<dd>Hi Nicole, I did initiate an AfD for WarCry (website) actually, but since then some reasonable references have been found for it.

<dd>Hello, Danny Gourley here. I also work for Ten Ton Hammer. I find it interesting that so much effort is being made to keep this entry from existing. I mean, I can use Wikipedia to find an exact recipe for how to make crack cocaine, but the information on TTH is deemed to have too little value to be here? Just tell us what hoops we have to jump through to impress you guys as much as <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bees_wax.html" title="Bees wax">Bees_wax</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewing_gum.html" title="Chewing gum">Chewing_gum</a> and we'll get it to you.</dd>

Based on the comments in this debate, there are two things I should mention: Firstly, please read <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. Just because you like it and find it useful does not mean it should have its own article on Wikipedia. I like the picture frame on my wall, but that doesn't mean I should make an article about it. Secondly, looking at the comments by some of the TTH staff, it seems there is a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Be aware that Wikipedia records what is verifiable; it does not record everything in existence.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As mentioned earlier, TTH staff participants should be aware of the guidelines in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>. This doesn't mean that TTH staff input is not valued, just that it can't be treated as an unbiased source. Nor does it mean that TTH is in any way a poorly run site, just that its encyclopedic value (see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) has not been verified by a reliable third-party source. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 17:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm in no way affiliated with anyone to do with gaming, except I bought a Wii for my niece. It does seem that TTH is being regularly covered or republished by <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Ten+Ton+Hammer%22+site:ign.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Ten+Ton+Hammer%22+site:ign.com" rel="nofollow">"Ten Ton Hammer" site:ign.com</a> (e.g. <a href="http://vanguardvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25576" class="external autonumber" title="http://vanguardvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25576" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), which could assist them cross the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> line by way of criteria 3. If this was to be kept, it would need to grow a lot of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> rather quickly. If the TTH staff wanted to do this, I suggest they find the best five sources from the most notable sources (i.e. no forums, and try to find sources where the author has a real persons name), and include them on the talk page. If they are not publicly accessible, please provide explicit details on how the article can be found (title, date, author, etc), as we have people here who have access to <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a>, but you need to do the grunt work so they can verify the article in a few minutes. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:08, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
