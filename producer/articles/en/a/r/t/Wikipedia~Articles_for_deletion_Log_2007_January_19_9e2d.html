I have removed problematic unsourced info (details about mental illness, drug use, the "love of his life") several times and it just reappears. Same deal with the "autobiography" tag. The author/subject also removed a "speedy delete" tag placed by another editor at least once. The subject is an actor/artist of some sort, but other than a reference to a community theatre-type group, there are no details. Says he was mentioned once in "Wired."

<li>I am in the middle of trying to update the Wiki. I am using certain tags, references, and fillers until the data can be fully parsed and formatted. Historical references, reference links, and more WILL be provided in due time. As for removing 'speedy delete' tags, I have been in the process of pasting the article from a text file where I am formatting it so I haven't seen any tags as I have done a 'select all' from my menu and pasted in from the text file. Not sure why this is an issue. There are many Bios out there with less information than this one. Does no one here allow for time to collect data?therealduckie</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The issue is not the amount of information but the notability of the subject. The subject of this article is clearly not notable. Further, from the caption on the only photo included in the article, it can be inferred that the above user is the subject of the article in question. Therefore, this is not only a non-notable bio, but also a vanity article. It should be speedy deleted and protected from ever being recreated in the future. Further, in response to the poster's last comment, enough data to adhere to Wikipedia standards should be collected prior to article creation. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 00:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As much as I appreciate your candor due to the recent issues with Wikipedia's standards, not everyone is Paris Hilton and has a plethora of online data. Some of this data must be created, scanned, researched, and verified. That being said, the fact there there are numerous other bios that exist on Wikipedia which have little to no information, yet are not classified for deletion, leads me to believe this issue is less about merit and more about control. I, personally, would have no issues presenting any and all relevant data in any form necessary, but as with all issues regarding Wikipedia, it was better for this article to be created by those in the know than by an outside source who would seek to villify the content and individual. therealduckie</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> No information as to notability, you would think that that information would be the first thing added to the article. Not everyone gets their own wikipedia article.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Conflict of interest also often lends itself to crummy articles. Let someone else decide if you are notable enough--if no one else has decided that, that might be saying something like some non-notable person posting his CV on Wikipedia in the guise of an "article." Please don't use Wikipedia as your word processor. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:59, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Being on the IMDb is not a measure of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate guys have a job to do(and apparently a busy one), that's fine...I thought this Bio was noteworthy and of some general significance. All it would take is a simple Google search and you would see the number of relevant articles, which I had intended to include, about this individual. Right now, after spending 2 hours editting code, gathering info, and trying to format it appropriately...I am too tired to fight about it. Do what you want, but again--I think the subject has merit. And the date of that last entry on IMDb is wrong. Most of the actors in that production were born in early 1900. It would seem there was another David Wasman prior to the one in this article.therealduckie</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> [change to <b>Delete</b> as per nom unless adequate sourcing could be provided; for reasons, see below] because I get the distinct impression from the article that there is something DISTINCT about people in Malaysia of Turkish descent, but I'm only in favor of keeping if the article has potential for expansion in describing that. I strongly suspect that it does. Compare with <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a>. In both of those articles we see distinct patterns of behavior by these groups in America that differ from Americans as a whole -- <i>and from the nations where they or their ancestors originally migrated.</i> You can't understand either group by simply reading about America, Italy or Ireland. The Italian-American group, for instance, tends to be more religious than Italians back in Italy. Can this be done with Turkish Malays? With most immigrant ethnic groups I strongly suspect that it can. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivaDaDestroyer_150a.html" title="User:ShivaDaDestroyer">ShivaDaDestroyer</a> 19:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You seem to be confused - Malay <b>does not</b> equal Malaysian. Instead of your analogy of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a>, a better analogy would be Eskimo-Africans. It is of course nonsense to have such non-notable articles. (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 20:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've been reading a bit more since I posted, that and I'll accept your point about misunderstanding what was meant by "Malay." My broader point is about what criteria we should be thinking about: I think that to define the group, distinct cultural characteristics are what should count, which is harder to do when the group is spread across nations, but often not impossible. Behavior is the yardstick for definition, and it can be demonstrated or not. As to notability, you're right, that needs to be demonstrated. Some criteria for that would be size of the group, it's influence on the larger society (dominating some industries is a common for ethnic groups, and cultural characteristics that the larger culture takes from the group). Eskimo-Africans? Of course not, but that's probably just a function of numbers. Yet Indians and Pakistanis in Africa definitely could, as could Japanese Brazilians, Korean Americans, Indian Guyanans (and maybe there are already articles on these, I'll have to check). One good, readable and reliable source (but not deep for minor groups) are the many books by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sowell_4946.html" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a> (see the books in the last third or so of the list in his Wikipedia article). Not all sourcing for this needs to be academic. Would you agree that these kinds of criteria, if they could be met, would make a good article on an ethnic group (especially a migrant one)? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivaDaDestroyer_150a.html" title="User:ShivaDaDestroyer">ShivaDaDestroyer</a> 21:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The difference is that <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Americans_538a.html" title="Korean Americans">Korean Americans</a> are an ethnic group combined with a nationality. The number of people in such groups can be measured for example if ethnicity questions are asked on a population census. The example we are talking about here is a mix of two ethnic groups, without regard to nationality. <i>Can you cite any precedent for this type of inter-ethnic article on Wikipedia?</i> It is hard enough to define and measure the number of people who are Malays (the term in itself has many alternate and wide ranging definitions), let alone scope the mix of two ethnic groups. Would people who have Arab+Malay+X blood or Arab+Malay+Y blood be included or excluded in this group? Unless there is evidence that this is a notable population group (which there doesn't seem to be, based on google results), any notable information contained in this article should be moved into a broader article such as a <i>List of notable Malays</i>, or <i>List of notable Malaysians</i> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 21:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Still, I feel that it's best to ask the opinions of the Malays themselves. Being a non-Malay myself, I think it is the best that such issues are up to the Malays to decide. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 06:57, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mr Tan, who exactly are the Malay? There are a multitude of varying definitions ranging from everyone in South East Asia (the definition used by these articles), to more precise and academically correct definitions. The use of term Malay as a race was a misnomer first proposed in British colonial times. Its use is no longer relevant and it is factually incorrect. As others have mentioned above, any ethnic group articles which are created need to be supported by reliable sources. When one racial or ethnic group breeds with another this does not necessarily constitute a new ethnic group. Please supply <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that the ethnic group <i>European Malays</i> exists and is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>. (MichaelJLowe 07:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Likewise, an Eurasian or a Mestizo does not necessarily constitute an ethnic group. The word Malay can mean the people of the Malay Archipelago or the Malay ethnic group used in Malaysia and Singapore, but the intrebreeding between a Malay and European/Arab is just like the interbreeeding of an Asian+European=Eurasian.</p>
<p>Look up the book sources on the Eurasians in Malaysia/Singapore/Indonesia (see also <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papia_Kristang_3461.html" title="Papia Kristang">Papia Kristang</a>.) You might want to take a look at some of the book sources: <a href="http://www.asiapacbooks.com/product.asp?pid=518" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asiapacbooks.com/product.asp?pid=518" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.malaysianfood.net/Eurasianfood.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.malaysianfood.net/Eurasianfood.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The book lists out many notable Eurasians with Malay parentage.</p>
<p>If you are here to ask for a change of a new term, say Arab-Indoensian or whatever, a redirect to the article from Arab Malay is more than enough, not a deletion. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 07:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I'd like to compliment the author (correction: authors) on the work done, but I think the subject is too broad and undersourced. But this could be broken up into separate articles, with each one not only more specific but with more content. European Malays in either Southeast Asia or Malaysia, for instance. The criteria should be: <i>Is there a definable set of characteristics that distinguishes these people from people in general in the nation where they live.</i> If Austrian-Malays and Italian-Malays <i>together</i> have an important set of characteristics that they share and that distinguish them, and if it can be sourced, it's an article. If the important distinctions are not shared but nevertheless present in each group (distinguishing them from the general population), then we've got two articles. Of course, each article needs to be substantiated, first off by proving that others believe the specified ethnic group exists and by specifying what cultural characteristics make it distinct. I especially disagree with Indon's comments above: It's not the actual combination of ancestors that counts, it's the cultural distinctiveness.<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivaDaDestroyer_150a.html" title="User:ShivaDaDestroyer">ShivaDaDestroyer</a> 20:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wait. There are a multiple number of references in this article, which proves the existence of the variants of this mixed racial community. Secondly, this article is elaborated and expanded relatively well, comparable to the standard of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporeans_6631.html" title="Arab Singaporeans">Arab Singaporeans</a>. I have checked the references on this article, and nonetheless variants of communities of euromalays do exist. One example is trying the yahoo hits <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0geuo1.iLFFVkMAxBxXNyoA?p=portuguese+melaka&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fl=0&amp;fp_ip=SG&amp;x=wrt&amp;meta=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0geuo1.iLFFVkMAxBxXNyoA?p=portuguese+melaka&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;fl=0&amp;fp_ip=SG&amp;x=wrt&amp;meta=0" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> on the euromalay papia kristang commune in Melaka. This article is nonetheless serves something like a conclusion of the variants of mixed euro"malay" communities-between mixed marriages of the european and various groups on the malay archipelago. Look at the sections of this article, which links of to a <b>main article</b>. I still harbor some doubts as to why this article should be deleted, for I need an explanation on this point. Even if we create a category linking the articles of Spanish Filipinos, Filipino Mestizos and Indo into a category , say something like a name of "Mixed communities in SE Asia" or something like that, ultimately all these articles are brought together like in one umbrella. The content of this article here are derived from the properly cited articles (stated above). However, as with Arab malays, I do agree that an article like European Malaysians could be created on grounds of sufficient notability and references.</dd>

<dd>Mr Tan, who exactly are the Malay? There are a multitude of varying definitions ranging from everyone in South East Asia (the definition used by these articles), to more precise and academically correct definitions. The use of term Malay as a race was a misnomer first proposed in British colonial times. Its use is no longer relevant and it is factually incorrect. As others have mentioned above, any ethnic group articles which are created need to be supported by reliable sources. When one racial or ethnic group breeds with another this does not necessarily constitute a new ethnic group. Please supply <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that the ethnic group <i>Arab Malays</i> exists and is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>.

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b></s> [change to <b>Delete</b> as per nom, unless adequate sourcing could be provided] although the article needs beefing up in sources, it's a good start. All this business about racial groups and intermarriage is balderdash. Think culture and behavior and whether certain people perceive themselves as part of a group — those are the criteria for whether the group exists or not. This article shows that this distinct ethnic group exists and has particular characteristics. That is an important contribution to understanding Malaysia and therefore an important addition to Wikipedia. The "Malay" part of this refers to the nation or state in which this cultural group is located. Anyone supporting deletion of this article should support deletion of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> (which would be ridiculous because lack of knowledge about these ethnic groups would hobble anyone's understanding of the modern U.S.) or be able to say what the difference is.

A closure of that division of the company would not be described as "real financial trouble" or "bankruptcy" by an "insider" (see this prodded article, created by the same user who created Neopets Bankruptcy for more so-called info on the alleged "insider").

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Now the truth why I’m doing another column on origins. I had a subtitle in last Wednesday’s column that read “IMSCF syndrome,” but didn’t quite get to discuss the syndrome for lack of space.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>So just what is this syndrome? One of my graduate students, Christine Ajoc, alerted me to this term in a paper she submitted for my biological anthropology class. It means “I am Spanish-Chinese-Filipino syndrome,” and it is common among overseas Filipinos living in North America. Among Filipinos in Hawaii, there’s another variation where they claim Hawaiian ancestry as well.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term actually appears in a legal website, dictionary.laborlawtalk.com, and is described as “ethnic forgery” because that mixed ancestry is fabricated. The dictionary entry speculates that this falsified pedigree reflects the lack of a national identity among overseas Filipinos and the need to boost their social status by claiming to have Spanish and/or Chinese blood. Somehow, Filipino takes on connotations of being poor, of being inferior.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It seems even Michael Tan didn't know the existence of this "phenomenon" or term until it was introduced to him by a student. Which is not enough in my opinion to merit as a reference for this article. Had Michael Tan himself researched and verifiably proved the existence of the term through a survey or some anthropological study he conducted, this article would stand. But a paper from a graduate student? I don't think that's enough. And it is said <i>it is common among overseas Filipinos living in North America</i> but hey, if it was actually that common, wouldn't there be more reputable third-party sources?</dd>
<dd>As for the 3rd link, the word IMSCF Syndrome appears in a column (?) or opinion (like youngblood of PDI?) <i>Juvenile Answers By: Tyrone Jay V. Samson</i>. It seems to me that this article is based on this link, quoting:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aside from colonial mentality, there’s also this IMSCF Syndrome. This is a non-academic term that relates to a unique form of institutionalized identity crisis phenomenon seen amongst overseas Filipinos. IMSCF Syndrome specifically refers to the tendency of many Filipinos, when questioned about their ancestry and nationality, to recite the phrase “I’m Spanish, Chinese, Filipino”. The name of the syndrome itself is an acronym formed from the first letters of this recited phrase.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If this is a reference, well, I find it laughable. All in all, this "syndrome" or "phenomenon" might really exist (in the minds and consciousness of Fil Ams abroad) but really, IMSCF Syndrome does not belong to Wikipedia until a more reputable and credible source crops up. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 12:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Ok I must admit, this article is cleverly presented as reputable, verifiable and factual. In reality, this is a non-existent "phenomenon" and unverifiable term. It is disguised with supposed references and external links which will purportedly support the claim of the validity of this syndrome. I've checked the references, and nothing directly refers or talks about IMSCF Syndrome. The references are about facts alright, but facts about different topics like the percentage of Spanish/Chinese, the Catalogo for names, and American colonial mentality. I am really appalled but dazzled by the absurdity of this article, because to uncritical Wikipedians, it will really seem fit for Wikipedia. The External Links do not provide as well an answer to who coined the IMSCF Syndrome, or what it is, or why it has been said. If it is a common non-academic term, why do Google and Yahoo hits only show for the ten most related links <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome</a> and mirror sites like answers.com copying Wikipedia?? And to even put as External Links forum discussions just goes to show the lack or want of references to support this article. <b>Laugh out loud</b>. IMSCF Syndrome??!! I've never heard that in my entire life as a Filipino who reads PDI and Phil. Star daily, watches TV Patrol and 24 Oras nightly, and follows up on news in the internet about any Filipino, including Jasmine Trias.

<li><b>Still Weak Keep plus Major Cleanup</b>. First of all, I only mentioned those articles because they contain the term. I am not saying that they are reliable sources, what I'm trying to say is that its existence is acknowledged even in the Philippines. The term is non-academic so its not surprising that nobody in the Social Science section of the academic world found time to seriously research about the subject. Do they have journal articles for every <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">Internet meme</a> out there? Surely it is a fertile field in the study of human social behavior. This term describes a behavior that exists in the minds of Filipinos around the world.

It was involved in a number of court fights and other public disputes in various states over whether its credentials would be recognized, and as a result a number of media articles specifically on it and its practices were published.

From the sources supplied there doesn't seem to be any evidence anyone has written about this church's history, views, or activities, which don't seem to have any independent notability. The sources show people using it to get a credential enabling them to perform a wedding. But for all the sources establish, maybe they did this for no other reason than that it charges less for the credential than the next brand down in the Google search, or has a more prominent ad, or some other non-notable reason. There doesn't seem to be anything <i>individually</i> notable about this organization from the sources supplied so far.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article attempts to establish notability through various articles on weddings and the like in which it is mentioned that the minister belongs to the Church for Spiritual Humanism. <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> requires, at its barest, independently published articles that say enough about the subject to permit <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.

<dd>Your link #1 mentions <i>"While clergy still perform most weddings, the ceremonies are straying ever farther from tradition, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" attitude toward religious nuptials. The minister may be an old friend, a professor or Dad, ordained online for the occasion."</i> It only mentions this particular Church/sect/commerce as 10 or 20x smaller than an apparently similar one. It describes a practice in general (of what I also see this particular 'Church of Spiritual Humanism' to be mainly doing). There could be an interesting NPOV article about this new social practice in which it can be mentioned as an example —but no article on that still unnotable example— and not present it as if it were a noteworthy 'religious and philosophical movement'.<br />
Your link #2 indeed mentions this "Church" by demonstrating it to lure people into an innocent rather funny wedding practice and then without their knowledge or consent abusing and possibly damaging their name for its own self-publicity; exactly what I see as a good reason for not to allow further abusing Wikipedia. [I already had removed the link from the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Template%7EHumanism_3c48.html" title="Template:Humanism">Template:Humanism</a> that occurs in a few dozen articles.]<br />
Your link #3, from a relatively obscure source, depicts the story of an otherwise totally unnotable man who became a Church of Spiritual Humanism clergyman to feel a bit more important himself but neither takes it very serious nor performs clergy practices: good for him but it shows the 'clergyman' not be be specifically religious or philosophical and not even as participating in Church community practices - if such would exist, no sign of that or of a 'movement' so far.<br />
Good research, and appreciating your current edits to the article, but if some of the content is to be kept or recreated, it must carry a more general title and describe this recent evolution in wedding practices etc, including criticism on dubious practices as false suggestions of a religious-philosophical movement and unadmitted usage of people's name. (Avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, e.g. by your above links). Only in case 'Spiritual Humanism' would succeed in becoming sufficiently notable (one way or another not unlikely seeing its efforts), its article content might rather compare with the one on as forementioned 10 to 20x larger but possibly equally sized <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_9762.html" title="Universal Life">Universal Life</a>, which could be an Afd as well as it has no source except one <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=Schmid+%22Churches,+Sects,+Religions%22+-wiki+-wikimedia+-wikipedia+-wikimiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=Schmid+%22Churches,+Sects,+Religions%22+-wiki+-wikimedia+-wikipedia+-wikimiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">untraceable</a> "book" (though <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/zq.htm#001209a" class="external text" title="http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/zq.htm#001209a" rel="nofollow">this lecture</a>/<a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/WIR/wir5-35.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xenu.net/archive/WIR/wir5-35.html" rel="nofollow">same (cf.Switzerland)</a> I think to be the real source) and the topic's own website; note that neither 'Church' is mentioned in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">NRM</a>. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_19.html" title="Jan 19">19 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 06:28&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Of course the article could use improvement, it is practically a stub. There is a bias on the part of some editors against religious humanist organizations and some of the movement to delete is motivated by their efforts to promote "propper" humanism (i.e. secular humanism). I have run into similar hostility on several occasions when editing artilces in the humanist subject area. Maintaining NPOV also means including articles on topics that represent all points of view. <a href="../../../2/c/t/User%7E2ct7.html" title="User:2ct7">2ct7</a> 01:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>And precisely this kind of article and as I see it, this particular topic and its methods (which had caused an administrator to speedily delete upon my earlier proposal as normal AfD), do not do well for the reputation of proper religious humanism. Yes we've met on another talk page and I assume you kind of fell for Spiritual Humanism. So prove notability and try rewriting the article in a NPOV style providing decent sources from outside the topic's circles. And if it would really be about religious humanism, instead of for instance a society picking a wish-wash name that can attract as many people as possible without putting any demands regarding religion or humanism, hoping for the-more-the-merrier financial contributions for clergy 'attributes' and using Wikipedia for promotion, show so in that properly sourced and NPOV article; that goes for the claim of (already) being a 'movement' as well. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_20.html" title="Jan 20">20 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 04:22&#160;(UTC)</span>

<li>Not name-calling, the derogatory depicting of the <i>topic</i> of the article is nicely formulated in my first AfD and whatever I could find before putting it up as such, could not at all take away the possibility. WP appearing to be used for self-promotion or for such purpose by adherers, makes it WP business. With that in mind, knowing 2ct7 to have spoken favorable about the topic before and to have recreated the article, saying that he 'fell for it' is WP:AGF and my true opinion. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_20.html" title="Jan 20">20 Jan</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 04:45&#160;(UTC)</span></li>
<li>Sorry if my posts were uncivil. The overly aggressive nature of many of secular humanist editors has left me on the defensive, especially after the speedy delete of this article which allowed no discussion. Since the subject of financial contributions has come up, let me mention a few facts about the IHEU who's secular promotions and official opinions and positions are forever dominating the Humanism related articles. The IHEU is more of commercial business then the Church of Spiritual Humanism. "Votes" on their official positions are bought and paid for. The more money your organization pays for its membership the more votes you get. You cannot become an individual member of the IHEU without paying £33 / $60 / €50 a year. Since the Humanist individuals and organizations that cannot or refuse to pay are not allowed to vote the IHEU can never represent the opinions and positions of all and probably even most Humanist. The editors that are most aggressively promoting secular humanism over religious humanism also incorporate the IHEU's agenda when editing. The secular official positions of the IHEU are bought and paid for and should not be used as the standard by which judge what is Humanism and what is not. The general tone of the articles in the Humanism subject area unduly favors secularism over religious humanism. I have to wonder if Spiritual Humanism paid the IHEU to become a member organization if this article would be facing deletion.<a href="../../../2/c/t/User%7E2ct7.html" title="User:2ct7">2ct7</a> 16:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

Nevertheless, I have the clear impression that the Church has been noticed for its wedding ceremonies <i><b>only</b></i>, and <i><b>not at all</b></i> for its claimed 'religious and philosophical movement'. It appears best to <b>maintain the article</b> but to <b>move it</b> towards the title <b>'Church of Spiritual Humanism'</b> at least until it could be shown that the claimed movement itself would have become <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> New sources have been added from articles reporting a trend in do-it-yourself weddings in which an individual receives a no-requirements ordination from an on-line ordination mill. The difficulty here is that the articles just don't appear to say anything much about the church (and don't seem to pay much attention to it); it just seems to be listed as the place a blogger happened to pick to get his on-line ordination or casually mentioned in discussing a trend. This church/movement needs an article or two in mainstream media <i>specifically on it</i> as at least a major if not primary subject. If they exist it's notable and <b>Keep</b>. Otherwise not and <b>Delete</b>. The standard is objective, it makes no difference whether one agrees or disagrees with its beliefs and practices. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 04:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Could supporters identify a couple of sources -- the best sources -- and explain why they demonstrate notability? There are a now a number of marginal-looking sources.

-<b>Keep</b>: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." In addition to the article found at [www.csp.navy.mil/news/rel06024.html], a separate article (which is not availible online, therefore no link is availible) was published in the national newspaper: The Navy Times. Also, a local Hawaiian news channel included a story on the nightly news about Josiah Rojas, his brother, and the intergral part they played in a policy change of the United States Navy that, up until just recently, prohibeted immediate family members from serving together on the same sea going vessal...a policy that was established due to the tragic loss of the Sullivan brothers during the attack on Pearl Harbor. This is not an autobiography, this is an article that was written about someone that truly deserves recognition. I challenge anyone to review the requirements for publication and "What Wikipedia is not" , and prove that an article on Josiah Rojas has no grounds. I am sure that any arguments will be addressed and able to be corrected with little effort. --Bobsxe 05:03, 23 January 2007</p>

<dd>But as Rojas works for the Navy, a Navy publication is not a source "independent of the subject itself." It could be considered an in-house source. Please look at coverage of other servicemen and women on Wiki: they are considered noteworthy because they have done significant things that have received national coverage in <b>known</b> and <b>independent</b> news outlets (CNN, the New York Times, etc.). Even if Rojas is known on his ship and is popular in his place of employment, it does not qualify him for an article on Wiki. It's not a mark on him or his character; it's just saying he's not considered notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or the other guidelines set forth here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 17:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>whoa, you are right! Very very long article there. Am tempted to change my vote to keep. But.... I fail to see any references to news articles (or books etc...) in the German article? And my German is so close to non-existent I can't tell from reading the article itself what is there that means it is worthwhile keeping. Perhaps I could get my German grandmother to read it out to me! lol More seriously, give us some more info (in English) please and perhaps it is worthwhile keeping after all? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 11:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article as it stands is highly promotional for this author/speaker. A Google search suggests that he is not notable - almost all of the results are from sites selling his books, and a few are from places who have scheduled him to speak. Not a lot of outside coverage. So, it looks to me like it should probably be deleted, but it's not completely obvious. If <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> turn up demonstrating that he actually is a pioneer of the Christian men's movement (as claimed) or an influential speaker, that would change things. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 10:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b> I edited out most of the promotional crap this morning and moved the article to "Gordon Dalbey" with a capitalized "D". Based on g-hits he seems likely to be notable, as he is being noticed and discussed, however, documenting this may be a challenge. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I see enough to believe that he is notable as an author. Someone with JSTOR access might check <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0304-2421(199812)27%3A6%3C817%3APCOPAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0304-2421(199812)27%3A6%3C817%3APCOPAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B" rel="nofollow">this scholarly article</a>; he is at least mentioned therein but I can't see if it is a passing mention or a demonstration of notability. One of his books was cited as a source in <a href="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FbWCvGnhvsLWbNQ1WhS3hDVh21GHp3CTWGC2WYQgH77T3jhgrHF1!244758214?a=o&amp;d=5000424960" class="external text" title="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FbWCvGnhvsLWbNQ1WhS3hDVh21GHp3CTWGC2WYQgH77T3jhgrHF1!244758214?a=o&amp;d=5000424960" rel="nofollow">this 1997 Questia article</a>; while that is not notability to our standards, it makes me believe that he is notable to our standards. Someone with access to the 1994 editions of <i>Christianity Today</i> should look at the July 1, 1994 issue; he is mentioned therein, but free access doesn't reveal the extent of coverage. Someone with free access to the November 5, 1999 issue of <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> can check their religion briefs, but that might be just an announcement of a speaking engagement. His books are included in the libraries of seminaries; see <a href="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/isbn/0849932572" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/isbn/0849932572" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> (results are sorted by distance from your address; I get <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>'s divinity school, and three others in Massachusetts as the closest ones for that particular book. All in all, I think he is a notable author. Sorting out the truly independent reviews from attempts to sell his books is more than I want to dive into, but the profusion of such sales attempts is an indicator of significance all by itself. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 06:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article about a young entrepreneur and TV producer. While he has been listed as one of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Week_1844.html" title="Business Week">Business Week</a>'s top 25 entrepreneurs under the age of 25, there really isn't anything else that indicates that he is notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There's no interviews, articles or other coverage of this gentleman in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and his accomplishments don't seem to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. The article itself was originally a copyvio from his personal website (until it was licensed under the GDFL), is written somewhat like a resume and Mr. Holland himself appears to be the author of the article, presenting a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> problem. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 04:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Wehwalt that the Business Week article establishes notability - If Business Week, which is a major publication, considers you one of the most notable entrepeneurs in your age group then you are notable enough for Wikipedia. Certainly there must be other sources out there if Business Week considers him this notable. Please also keep in mind that NPOV and COI problems are <i>not</i> valid reasons for deletion, rather they are reasons for adding a cleanup tag and such to the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. But for the citation in <i>Business Week</i>, I'd say "delete". However, that is one small reference in <i>one</i> publication, and this person was not the main topic of the article - he was one of 25. If this person garners more media attention and better meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in the future, no prejudice against recreation. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did some research since I figured there had to be more articles about him if he's important enough to get attention from Business Week. Turns out this guys personal website has a whole section dedicated to media coverage of him and there are quite a number of notable sources. CNN Money, Business Week, The McClean Times, Gazette.net, the Sun Gazette... all of these articles focus either solely on Joel Holland or mention him several times. There are also links to articles from TIME Magazine and the Washington Post, though these links don't seem to work anymore. Given the number of sources found here: <a href="http://www.joelkentholland.com/presscoverage.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.joelkentholland.com/presscoverage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelkentholland.com/presscoverage.htm</a> I think that everyone should reconsider their votes to delete. These are legitimate sources and he does seem to be quite notable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>If the article is updated with such sources, I'd reconsider and say "weak keep", but as for now the article remains the same. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst I was wavering on delete, on top of the Guardian review they've been signed to the same record label as Franz Ferdinand and the Arctic Monkeys as of this month.

<li><b>Keep</b> - <b>(1)</b> All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other to ensures that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. The article now has several cited works, at least two of which appear to be the required non-trivial published works. As a second reason for meeting Wikipedia:Notability, the article now appears to be a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. Thus, the article appears to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> policy requirements. Since the article appears to meet this policy, I believe it inherently meets the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidance that depends from that policy. <b>(2 AfD#1)</b> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wild_beasts_595c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wild beasts">AfD#1</a> concerns about not meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> have been addressed in the article. <b>(3 DR#1)</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_7&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87960173" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_7&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87960173" rel="nofollow">Deletion Review's</a> concerns regarding actual present notability and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> have been addressed in the article. <b>(4 DR#2</b>) <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_13_08c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 13">Deletion Review #2's</a> request that actual citations to information be added to article have been addressed in the article. <b>(5)</b> As QuagmireDog points out, this band is going places and media interest in this topic seems more likely than not.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a good point about the Domino signing, I can't find any reference to it at all on the Domino site. I think it's an important point, not just in that particular nugget of info but also the wider perception of the article. I've just sent Domino an email asking whether this is the case.

Perhaps this is notable enough to keep but I have to say <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu.html" title="Ninjutsu">ninjutsu</a> is notorious for inflated ranks - 12th Dan after 15 years? I also brought it here for opinions on what to do in general - ie other similar cases.

<li>While I do not dispute any of the Wikipedia guidelines (as they exist in part to protect the integrity of the information provided), I am unaware of what evidence exists for inflated ranks among <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu.html" title="Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</a> practitioners of the <a href="../../../b/u/j/Bujinkan.html" title="Bujinkan">Bujinkan</a> organization (Ninjutsu being only one of many fields of study taught and practiced within the Bujinkan). There certainly are martial arts practitioners throughout the world who misrepresent themselves, however, I am presently unaware of anyone doing so in the Bujinkan organization. In fact, I am unaware of any factual information supporting that this practice exists in any form within the Bujinkan. There are individuals throughout the world who have created their own martial arts (including those who claim to teach various forms of Ninjutsu), who have bestowed inflated ranks upon themselves. Perhaps this is where the source of your statement lies. However, I am unaware of any factual information suggesting that this practice exists in the Bujinkan. In terms of Dan grades, the Bujinkan divides its Dan ranks into 15 increments instead of the typical 10. Some might say that a 12th Dan in the Bujinkan organization may equate more to a 7th or 8th Dan in other martial systems. Furthermore, when awarding a rank, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masaaki_Hatsumi_88d2.html" title="Masaaki Hatsumi">Masaaki Hatsumi</a> takes much into account. In other organizations, ranks may be earned based on one or more of the following attributes: proficiency of skill, years of membership, loyalty, teaching, competition, judging, coaching, and other attributes. The Bujinkan is also unique in their approach to ranking, with one constant being the Sakki test performed by Masaaki Hatsumi, in order for the practitioner to attain the rank of 5th Dan. I am in fact a 12th Dan in Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.</li>

<p>The game was orginally nominated to "no consensus" <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Quantum_Legacy_%28game%29_96dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quantum Legacy (game)">here</a>. In the last several months, there has still only been one non-trivial source presented, though I'm nto sure how major strategyinformer.com is. I believe the subject does not present <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">multiple non-trivial sources</a> for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, and that it doesn't meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (take your pick).

<li><b>Week keep</b>, yes the article has a few problems. But then again what article doesn't? In conclusion I do not see this being a bad enough example that we should give up hope on it and delete it away completely.

<li>Having only one source (an interview with the creator, no less) is a problem. It's hard to build a neutral/comprehensive article from one source. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I've been the main editor of that page. Yes, sources are little, but the information is acurate, and little bit comes from the creator over the games creation period, not said specifically for this page to advertise it. I've also, if you review history of both the page and discussion, tried to implement or remove parts of the article to help save it. So please be generous and contribute yourself if you think the article needs work. --K776 08:23, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The best way to get this article kept is to present multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually we need multiple sources. We still only have one pre-release interview. It even states in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that <i>"The content itself has been the subject of <b>multiple</b> non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</i> --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But then almost 50% of all pages relating to products and games would have to go. Not everything has multiple reliable sources, especially during its early development. A reliable source to me is something that can be seen by everyone. For example "3d graphics" can be seen, "amazing 3d graphics using a new graphics system in the backend" cannot. Thats all that should matter on articles like these. Facts that can be seen by others by simply opening the game, and they must be said without opinion. I've tried my best to do that. --K776 19:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hyperbole and made up statistics won't answer this article's problems. A reliable source is something that has gone through an editorial process, as noted in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not seeing any sources <i>independent of the game's creators</i>. Most of the assertions made in the article, moreover, do not appear to be sourced at all.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> No third-party sources and the article seems to consist primarily of original research. Also, in response to some of the above comments, one legitimate source is insufficient as policy requires at least two. Whether or not other existing articles fail to meet this requirement is of no relevance in this case; that's an argument supporting nominating those articles for deletion rather than an argument for keeping this article. If proper sources can't be supplied then this article needs to go. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Way_dad2.html" title="User talk:The Way">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Way_bdbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Way">contribs</a>) 06:31, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>I'd never heard of GameZone, actually. It looks like it's a reputable site, judging from <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameZone_76f1.html" title="GameZone">the article</a>; however, that page probably wouldn't be considered a "non-trivial" source, as all it has (as far as I can tell) is a description of the game's storyline and a couple of screenshots. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 11:11, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've heard of Gamezone and it is reputable, however we need to be careful when using gaming magazines to determine notability. Almost <i>all</i> games get attention in the bigger gaming magazines and websites; usually every game gets a preview and a review, this may not be sufficient for notability since these magazines are so indiscriminate.

<dd>As for "article comparisons," <i>of course</i> it matters if this article is identical to another that isn't deleted, as that Kingdom of Loathing article has no reviews connected to it either.

Children of Kings and Presidents are considered notable, tho not children of most others people. There is at least one specific reference, from the MLA bibliography; I added it. If one goes by sources, the younger Bennetts and Wickham don't have any, so there's a distinction.

<p>The article's interesting, but basically just non-notable, unencyclopedic fancruft for Cornell (can there be fancruft for a University?) Some of this info probably has a place in the Cornell article, but much of it is ridiculously widespread and of no real interest--chalkings, traying: what university doesn't do this? Also, a lot of it is just random student gossip/legends that have no place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 07:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> This is going to open a can of worms. I think it might be valid to have a culture page which this basically is. However I don't see how this meets notibility guidelines.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, I may have a bias here, but this article containts well-referenced facts and history about Cornell, its alumni and its unique culture, and it belongs in the encyclopedia.

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> Not only is the title of the article inappropriate for the content, much of the article consists of Original Research (although some of it is sourced). I'm not convinced that an article on cultural aspects of a particular university are sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia and, if it is decided that this is the case, then we will need to be willing to accept similar articles for all universities. Indeed, if this is kept I may develop articles on cultural aspects of my alma mater, Millikin Univeristy, as well as my grad school. Overall this seems just a bit too trivial... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Way_dad2.html" title="User talk:The Way">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Way_bdbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Way">contribs</a>) 06:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>I'm changing my opinion from delete to <b>Neutral</b>. The article needs better sourcing, but the sources that do exist are notable enough. I am not 'voting' either way, however, because I remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions of any given university are notable enough for inclusion on the Wikipedia. It would be nice to see a guideline/policy developed specifically for universities about what aspects of a university are acceptable for articles. Overall, I still sort of agree Dacium's claim that "This is of interest to no one except people who go there and it is mainly neoligisms and weird cruft." --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 23:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Some parts of this article are non-notable or undocumented, and have no place here. Other parts ( e.g. <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Day_41ca.html" title="Dragon Day">Dragon Day</a> ) are notable and already covered. In any case, the correct place to put links to the notable items is in the main <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> article. If we accept <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelliana.html" title="Cornelliana">Cornelliana</a> we will have to add Oxoniana, Cantabriana, Yaliana, Harvania immediately. And then we'll have to add Mancastriana, Cantuarian, Sorbonniana, MITiana. And in due course we'll have Podunkiana and HicksvilleAlabamiana. And that's just the universities, because we'll have to add Trekiana ( already an established fan term ), Pokemoniana and GalaxyQuestiana ( or should that be Questorianiana&#160;? ). And so on. Notable lore about an existing subject should either go in the appropriate existing article, or should be notable enough to stand in an article on its own, linked to from the main article.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> As a bad faith nomination. Nominator has a history of edit waring through and anonymous account to inserting his own convention, Anime South, onto the list, but was reverted because it doesn't meet criteria. Nominator has also failed to "broaden" the lists criteria to included all anime conventions so that his convention can be listed. But there is really nothing wrong with the list as is. Attendances figures are verified through AnimeCons.com or other sources on the main articles. The list is also annotated and sorted so that conventions in the area are grouped together instead of purely alphabetically. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 11:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It seems I have misinterpreted the policy somewhat, hence I have struck though this. To elaborate on the point I intended to make, I feel that the article could stand if it were drastically cut down. Winning a significantly large or small amount of money is notable and worthy of inclusion, but being one of 30ish people to win between 10p and £100 seems too insignificant to me. Likewise listing ~20 people to win £20,000 and ~10 to win £10.

<li><b>Keep (assuming article's references up to par)</b> Reviewing the article and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as cited above, I fail to see any parts of WP:NOT that apply to this article. The indiscriminate section cited is, as written, limited in scope primarily to the areas of consensus mentioned in the policy, none of which fit this article. Likewise, other sections of WP:NOT don't fit either. In fact, this would appear to be essentially an episodic-synopsis of the series. And since articles about television series episodes are generally acceptable, and this article actually accumulates multiple episode details within a single text, if anything this appears to be a better format for providing details for a weekly serial realty series.

As all of the information is from the show itself, there is also no notability to the subject: if you find secondary sources (e.g. newspaper articles) on specific wins, then those are notable: a list of what hapenned in a show is not.

It's also a news report of kinds, and opinion on current affairs. Also, whilst it's not fiction, I think it comes under the spirit (if not the letter) of the plot summaries section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (under wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information). --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 06:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To reply to each of those concerns -</dd>
<dd>1) "Not a publisher of original thought" The article does not obviously fit this section, which covers "publishing your own thoughts and analysis". It is listing data about the show, but is not (far as I know) an analysis by the author about what the data might mean in any social or scientific context. And anything that <i>is</i> disputably original opinion can be deleted from the article without deleting the entire thing. For example, if it appears that a comment about the significance of an event is a "weasel word" or the author's opinion, that can be deleted without removing the actual data. Note that there is, however, the issue of providing references to verify the facts.</dd>
<dd>2) "News reports" specifically covers the firsthand reporting on breaking stories. These are not breaking stories, but rather an accumulation of historical data from the show. It is not reporting on "current" events, but indexing historical ones.</dd>
<dd>3)"Plot summaries" Plot summaries is specifically for works of fiction, which this isn't, and says that an article should not solely provide a summary of a fictional plot. Since the show is neither fictional and is providing information outside of a simple plot summary, this section does not apply.</dd>
<dd>So, again, I am unconvinced that this article fails to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> standards. It might fail on standards regarding providing references, though, and like many articles could probably stand a cleanup on the writing. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced. Verification has to be repeatable, and already-broadcast episodes of game shows are not, by and large, retrievable for anyone who wants to check the facts. The episodes of most fiction TV programmes can be used as primary sources because every episode is usually easily available on video, but episodes of daily gameshows are not. Verification is also not repeatable if verifying the record requires watching every single episode and looking for the highest/lowest bid etc, that would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, but as Noel makes a habit of comparing current games to previous records, I would guess that most of the records have been explicitly set out in one episode or another. However, that's the point, I have to guess - I cannot go back and watch previous episodes because it's a gameshow and unlike fictional series, there is no way for the average reader to confirm the facts. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As an aside, repeatability of verification is an interesting point that might be relevant to a related more general topic of how to handle episodic information for television series. Some television series have articles for each episode, but other series don't. The point you bring up regarding some shows not airing in syndicated or DVD reruns is a good one, and could apply not only to game shows but also soap operas and professional wrestling shows, etc. We might want to require that, if a show does not air reruns, the information be verifiable through a DVD, for example, or a published news article or review talking about that particular episode. I'll mention this on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Television_2ace.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Television">Wikipedia:WikiProject Television</a> - it might help lead to a good guideline for handling these sorts of shows. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's wonderful - it houses a whole host of information. But, that information isn't necessarily encyclopaedic. As myself and others have pointed out, it's not verifiable (as if it were sourced, which it isn't, it would be to individual shows which the average reader has no way of getting hold of a copy of), and because we are taking it straight from a primary source, we have no way to establish notability (as we would if, say, we were to make reference to academic papers, newspaper articles etc.). I'm also not sure that it's particularly encyclopaedic to have such a list, regardless of its sources. Finally, going back to the notability issue - right now, a few editors are interested in it. In 12 months, nobody will remember the majority of these players and wins, and in 5-10 years, the entire show is likely to be a distant memory. So why should we keep it? "It holds alot of information" doesn't really cut the ice, IMHO. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 17:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't consider that fan sites count as unbiased secondary sources, all they prove is that someone else has already written a list of what hapenned in every episode: that's no reason for us to do the same, or to pick out what we consider to be the most important ones. IMHO, the topic only becomes notable once it is talked about outside of the inner-core of fans (e.g. a newspaper article, and more than one at that). --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 06:49, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The original article on this subject Angry Nintendo Nerd was deleted after an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angry_Nintendo_Nerd_9ec0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angry Nintendo Nerd">AfD</a>. The Angry Video Game Nerd article was originally protected to prevent it being used to recreate Angry Nintendo Nerd. After AVGN was unprotected it was recreated on January 16 covering the material from the original ANN article, despite there being no deletion review to overturn the original AfD. So technically this article could be speedy deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>:G4. However I'd rather open discussion to the community. There is a claim of notability, but the only <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> cited is a brief mention of one of James Rolfe's online reviews being shown in the background of an MTV report on internet celebrities. This doesn't seem to reach the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, so I believe unless further sources can be found this article should be deleted and salted to prevent further recreation as the subject is not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and the article is not properly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 08:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>If people from many different countries who speak nine different languages have noticed something it still isn't notable because IGN hasn't written an article about it?</p>
<p>If millions on youtube have been watching him, and Alexa confirms those millions, that isn't verifiable because they aren't "independent of the subject".

<p>I'm going to explain what's happening in detail because I think you people are really confused about all this newfangled technology.</p>
<p>Remember in the old days when people needed things to be mentioned in books, newspapers, and television for it to be famous?</p>
<p>Nowadays, we have this magical invention called the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Through this amazing advancement in technology we can quantify something's popularity without the need of publications telling us something is famous, because we already know!</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>? Notice how new they are and how they don't rely on the media to obtain information? That's the age we're living in.</p>
<p>Now, five years from now, gramps, you're going to look pretty silly when you look back at yourself insisting that something wasn't notable because a publication didn't make it official when millions upon millions already knew about it because they realized things had changed when you didn't.

<p>I think the objectivity of this debate is horribly distorted at best. It appears that the Nysted guy has been met with the same criticism for each Wiki entry -- whether Lee Nysted, NystedMusic, or this current one. Reviewing the deletion discussion forums, it seems the central argument against deletion is that Nysted's group (in whatever form) lacks notoriety/credibility.</p>
<p>Let's look at this objectively. WP:MUSIC defines the following as "central criteria" for inclusion. I've bolded those which Nysted clearly meets:</p>
<p>1. Has had a charted hit on any national music chart.</p>
<p>2. Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one country.</p>
<p>3. Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,3 reported in reliable sources.</p>
<p>→4. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</p>
<p>→5. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</p>
<p>6. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</p>
<p>→7. Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award. <i>(Ok, nominated with a Grammy, but I think that fits the bill)</i></p>
<p>8. Has won or placed in a major music competition.</p>
<p>9. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.) →10. Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</p>
<p>11. Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio or TV network.</p>
<p>For composers and lyricists:</p>
<p>→1. The person has has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the person and reliable.</p>
<p>2. Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above, a notable theatre, or has been taken up by a musician or ensemble that qualifies above.</p>
<p>3. Has written musical theatre of some sort (includes musicals, operas, etc) that was performed in a notable theatre that had a reasonable run as such things are judged in their particular situation and time.</p>
<p>4. Has had a work used as the basis for a later composition by a songwriter, composer or lyricist who meets the above criteria.</p>
<p>→5. Has written a song or composition which has won (or in some cases been given a second or other place) in a major music competition not established expressly for newcomers. <i>(see Grammy nomin above)</i></p>
<p>6. Has been listed as a major influence or teacher of a composer, songwriter or lyricist that meets the above criteria.</p>
<p>→7. Appears at reasonable length in standard reference books on his or her genre of music.</p>
<p>While I'm not a Nysted fan -- all I've seen of him is from this article in question -- it's interesting enough that an open forum like Wikipedia would rather have NO information about this musician than SOME information. When I think of Wikipedia, i think of an "end all, be all" information forum. Why not let Nysted and his cohorts have their say? He may meet only the minimal requirements, but they should be sufficient; now, if there's something UNTRUE or DISHONEST about his entries, then we're on something different, but I don't see this being a dishonest quest.</p>
<p>While he's certainly not of Bob Dylan notoriety, I vote <b>Keep</b> -- his notable group members (some from my beloved Chicago) should easily qualify him.</p>
<p>Does anyone think Wikipedia is any less credible because his entry exists??!! --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicago60607_d4fa.html" title="User:Chicago60607">Chicago60607</a> 23:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not create the Lee Nysted Experience, or Nysted Music, although both articles should be allowed, or in the alternative, my name, and the Nysted Music articles should re-directed to The Lee Nysted Experience. (A legitimate and verified inclusion into the encyclopedia.)</dd>

<li><b>Question</b> The only possible criterion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> this subject could meet is <i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i> Lee Nysted has used as studio musicians two drummers who are certainly notable, but is a studio musician in a band if he is a hired hand who does not otherwise tour or write music for the band (and according to the article, Lee writes his own music)? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as I believe the article does not support the assertion that the notable musicians are in a "band" or "ensemble", since the music is by Lee Nysted.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The authors and subject of the article have little experience with Wikipedia, so I forgive them their breaches of rules such as calling a legitimate nomination on Articles for Deletion "vandalism" or based in "wrong motives", a breach of our rule that we should always <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I must also insist that they stop claiming that people are making up rules when we are having a discussion about how to interpret them; this is disruptive.</dd>
<dd>To the question "Could anyone open a Wiki account and speak about this issue? Would the opinions matter?", in our <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">guide to deletion</a>, which I recommend you read, we state "Because of our past problems, opinions offered by new or anonymous users are often met with suspicion and may be discounted during the closing process." Opinions that are phrased politely and properly based in Wikipedia policies and guidelines are likely to be given greater weight. To the question, "Who is the decision making body?", we are it -- Articles for Deletion discussions are open to any Wikipedia editor and drawn from the entire community by intention. If there is a legitimate complaint about the <i>procedures</i> of a particular AFD, an appeal to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> may be made, but that will almost always simply result in a relisting and a new vote.</dd>
<dd>As for the article before us, there is a persistent argument for notability based on the projects of these other musicians, but notability is not associative; the individual must be independently notable. The <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> loophole puts an article on shaky notability ground, and this one is a primary example of why. Articles still should meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> above all, and "15,000 articles on Google" is not meeting that requirement. Google is <b>not</b> a source. Labels and companies that sell music are not <b>independent</b> sources, no matter how "reliable" they may be (presumably their information is accurate, but they have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>). All Music Guide is occasionally used as proof of notability, but they don't actually write about Nysted, they just list one album and not the most recent. That would meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for information on that album, but it isn't really good enough per our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines. I strongly appreciate that Mr. Nysted is an accomplished musician, but the lack of sources which meet our <b>policy</b> is a difficult bar to step over. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:10, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b>All artists in all bands directed by labels and production companies are "hired hands." The <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_Street_Boys_8836.html" title="Back Street Boys">Back Street Boys</a> were all hired hands. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Corgan_9198.html" title="Billy Corgan">Billy Corgan</a>'s band were all hired hands. Double standards are not seemly. All members of established bands that are now back on the road, are hired talent. A band is a band. The Experience is a band/ensemble by definition. You have simply chosen to re-write the rules and criteria; definition of band/ensemble. Majority rules? Let's get a rope?</p>
<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>As I suspected all along, this is nothing more than a "witch hunt" (as seen by all the "new" posts from MySpace users.) The article meets the guidelines and Wikipedia criteria. I am in no way involved with any false or misleading information about Lee. Billy Corgan wrote all the material for the Pumpkins, yet it is a band/ensemble.</p>
<p>The Lee Nysted name and the name of his band should be available to the world as it is on thousands of sites. If that does not happen on Wikipedia; for the wrong reasons, then Wikipedia guidelines and criteria do not amount to more than the gang rape that is happening here.</p>
<p>This is the reason I asked the question above.</p>
<p>I resent the idea that Lee and his fans would add to this charade.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You need to understand something about how Grammy nominations work. On the first go around, MANY artists get nominated, by peers, by their labels, by the raidio stations, by just about anybody. Then there is a winnowing, by committee's I think, that reduces the nominees in each category to 3-5. THEN the full body votes on those reduced lists to arrive at winners. EVERYONE that was in that first grab-bag is a NOMINEE, but this first round is almost never listed anywhere. Simply the fact that Lee's nomination does not show on the Grammy's website is NOT proof that he was NOT a nominee. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillWSmithJr_9db3.html" title="User:BillWSmithJr">Bill W.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you Mr. Smith. There is a second tier to determine if the inclusions are actual and in the right genre. There are steps taken to verify the facts about artists. Not everyone can submit a "tape." The artist must then meet certain guidelines established by NARAS. The next tier goes to voting members only. Then there is a final tier, which is the one recently published.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 15:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Dhartung, I believe Mr. Smith was trying, and rightly so, to correct a remark that is considered against Wikipedia guidelines and that is to assume that Mr. Nysted is lying about his Grammy nominations. There is nothing phony about Mr. Nysted's claims; unless the author of that statement can prove otherwise, it must be withdrawn as not credible. The comment was made by someone that has no knowledge of the "Grammy" process, and thus committed an error in judgment, by "our" standards.

<li><b>Reply</b> Mr. Smith committed no breach of process, but he is wrong if he is asserting that because it cannot be disproven, then we can use a person's claim that they were included in a private tier of Grammy nominations. This is exactly opposite to Wikipedia policy. We may only use the claim if it can be independently verified. Saying that is not saying that anyone is lying, and you are muddying the waters to portray it that way. <b>We cannot use this claim, period.</b> --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 23:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Song #264 was nominated in the second tier. There is nothing unusual about being a nominee. It happens all the time and it is the truth.

<dd>That's fascinating. The document you point to is clearly marked <b>Entry List</b>, not "Nominations", "Nominees", or anything of the sort. According to the official website, "Entries are recordings submitted for GRAMMY consideration. Entries that meet all eligibility requirements are then voted on by The Academy's voting members and the results of that vote are the nominations." <a href="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> While it is certainly possible that your entry was advanced to the nomination round, the document above proves nothing of the sort. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Reply:</b> Entry list are those that were nominated and made the list. If you go to the end of the list you will see verification that said list came from NARAS. As I said earlier, the nominations were done and I ended up in the third tier, after the voting members, including me, voted. I had 3 nominations, one of which was for Best Gospel performance? Go figure. End of Grammy story.</p>
<p>You sir, Mr. Dhartung, are not following your own guidelines of assuming that what I tell you is correct. I back it up with a document from NARAS and you still do not get it.

<p><b>Comment:</b> To: Mr. Dhartung I think it is imperative that "reviews" not be made a central issue here. If you want reviews, many of the links in the article will give you reviews. (Hundreds, in fact.)However, reviews literally have nothing to do with the reliablity, notability and verification issue, all of which have been met. If you want reviews, we will list dozens from the various sites out there. That is not seemly and it is not part of the issues that Rambling Man stressed as the keys to keeping my article about Lee's band. <s><b>Strong Keep.</b></s><a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 00:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please sir, "your word?" We are encouraged to discuss the issue at hand; change your posts and your mind, if you see evidence to do such a thing. That is stressed in the guidelines. You made a false accusation and you have a choice as to whether or not you can admit you were wrong. There is no bullying in this discussion.

<p>I changed my mind and came back here to defend my name and my rights.

<li>Quite the assumption, Mr. Dhartung. The two journalists that wrote the article are to be commended for their works and the due diligence expended to get all the details in, so the article would qualify for publication according to Wikipedia guidelines and criteria. Rambling Man indicated what was needed and that has been supplied many times over. The basis for Wikipedia, as a resource of information, is getting to the truth rather than throwing it away. A good editor would help to write an article about an artist that works within the framework of this encyclopedia. My work is very real as is the band/ensemble. The Lee Nysted Experience is notable by every standard known to mankind, including Wikipedia. The idea of starting out this way on Wikipedia, is unfortunate. It is even more unfortunate that editors with less than 6 months of experience here, can and do, destroy the very framework of this organization. Journalists are not required to like the people they write about, nor do journalists have the right to censor the real truth from an encyclopedia.</li>

Essentially, these are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. That is the key problem here and, as stated in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, multiple, non-trivial published works are the central criterion for inclusion. The album is distributed by Orchard Music, as are thousands of others by independent artists, but is (despite the strident comments at the top of the page and elsewhere) not produced by a notable record label. That is another issue under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Congratulations on the first-round Grammy nomination; the criteria states that awards must be <i>won</i>. I still, despite the substantial verbage brought into this article by the two proponents, see nothing at all that indicates the artist meets the inclusion criteria. Judging from the fact that only four editors, three of whom are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single-purpose accounts</a>, feel this article should be kept, the arguments have yet to sway anyone who has opined towards deletion. (To forestall the apparent need to claim everyone who's against this article is an attacker from MySpace, I should note that I've never had a MySpace page, I try to avoid going to MySpace pages, and so on.)

<li>First off, I did not write the articles. Your agument about that, Peter, fails.</li>
<li>Second, "Google hits" will never be a reliable guide to notability. Anyone can buy Google hits. The original article was in my name, and should have been left; edited. My web site is getting hundreds of thousands of google hits, partly because we use ad-words. The Lee Nysted name is the source. Your argument, Tony, fails at both ends. Further, you are only one editor to return, and I suspect that you have not gone through all of the links, or the new sources, judging by your comment about notability.</li>
<li>Third and most important, the article now meets all of the requirements as set forth in Wikipedia rules, guidelines and / or established sources for reliability/notability. Quite simply put, the discussion should be over and the article stays per the comment made by The Rambling Man.</li>

<li>I'd like to encourage everyone here to "assume good faith" in what has become a rather heated discussion. It seems to me that while <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> has failed to note that not everything about Lee Nysted is self-published, he has broadly hit the nail on the head: there seems to be a determined claque that wants to see an article on this artist, and this claque is determined to cite any source it can to claim notability. I've taken a look at the references cited, and my own view is that at present notability is not proven: once I remove the various self-published sites and sites that simply mirror press releases ( see the Jazz Review link for a particularly egregious example of this - exactly the kind of thing that doesn't make a good source but has a superficial gloss of plausibility ) I do not find much more than for any other minor pub or club artist. This is not enough, and for that reason I feel that we should <b>Delete</b> this article. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to say that although they did not play a part in my decision, I was very unhappy about the small number of editors for this article, and in particular the fact that <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> appears to have no existence other than as a member of the Lee Nysted fan-club.

Finally, I notice that <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> has made some contributions to this article and to various talk pages. Neglecting the similarities in posting style between <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a>, which ( "assuming good faith" ) I am assuming is entirely coincidental, I would suggest that if Mr Nysted is really keen on getting an entry in Wikipedia he would be more likely to get it by concentrating on his music. The musicians we cover in this Encyclopedia tend to get their coverage because of their musical work, not because of their skill in quibbling in deletion debates.

<p>I have provided everything required of any article, per Wikipedia rules guidelines, reliability tests, criteria, etc. I will post dozens of links to sites all over the free world to show you that my music is out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Start with THE ORCHARD.com link. Go to "digital partners." There you will find 14,000+ partners that are carrying my C.D. Amazon is one of the dealers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. Go back to the article. I will start releasing threads. Most reviews are copywritten, so you may have to join sites. I will not post copywritten material, that I do not own. The main review on iTunes is copywritten and must be viewed there.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 02:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly merge with comic articles. A couple of these I would call not notable, and a couple I would call most certainly notable. It makes sense to me that in the case of a comics group the notability should be determined by all of the included comics put together. As such, this is definitely a keep. It seems a good middle-ground instead of each one having it's own article to combine them under the umbrella of their group. As for this particular case, I know there are some sources to look through. Too busy now, but hopefully I'll get some time later to hunt those down... --Nmaster64 10:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

How does being non notable in several stories make you notable?--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 18:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Their entry there (along with that of any other character without a separate article) can be expanded. If some enterprising editor adds enough content about them, we can always revisit whether they need a separate article. I think it's a better process to have one article about all the minor characters, then break out articles about individual subjects as needed.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 04:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable private institute in Uttar Pradesh. Only assertion of notability is an international link with an organisation in Canada, but no useful Google hits.

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/-/e/S-expression.html" title="S-expression">S-expression</a>. This is probably notable within a tiny domain, but it isnt universally notable, and the article wont grow much beyond its current size. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphviz.html" title="Graphviz">Graphviz</a> already contains a brief snippets about this tool, and that is all that the article could reasonably do, as this tool only creates <a href="../../../d/o/t/DOT_language_92cf.html" title="DOT language">DOT language</a> files that can be used by Graphviz -- there is no direct relationship. Graphviz is extremely commonly used, so that article will eventually grow and list2dot would eventually become insignificant and more than likely eventually removed. OTOH, the S-expression is lacking in examples and even states that it hasnt been adopted widely. A long-winded explaination of this tool on that article would not be in danger of being dropped in favour of a better example. Unless the author himself comes here and tells us that this high ranking wikipedia article name is annoying him, I would prefer to keep a redirect from "lisp2dot" to the article where this info is moved to, as people will have bookmarks to this article as it has existed for 18 months. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 21:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Merging this to S-expressions would make little sense in my opinion - kind of merging "William Shakespeare" to "English language", since the two are supposedly related. Anyway, there's no reason to keep this as a separate article; few bits and pieces that are part of the "unseen infrastructure" deserve such article, and are best discussed in some other article instead. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable e-Book; was tagged for db-spam but the author removed the tag. Thought it would be better to have the discussion here.

<li>I'm curious about what the criteria is for a book to be considered "notable." As for removing the tag, I have never used wikipedia before and am still learning the process. I read this book as part of my research for a book that I am writing. I was surprised that Eric Scheibeler was on Wikipedia, but his book was not. The book link is on his entry for Wikipedia, so I thought I would try to add to Wikipedia for the first time by making an entry for the book. It may be a disputable book, but so is something like the "loose change" conspiracy video about 911 and countless other entries on Wikipedia. Disputable does not mean disreputable. It doesn't really matter to me if you delete the entry, but I would just like to understand why so I don't waste my time in the future. What if I changed the entry to "A book written by Eric Scheibeler about Amway/Quixtar." I can't think of any other way to be more objective, although uninformative as well, about the subject.

<p>This article is mostly an attack on U.S. work visa programs. "Global Labor Arbitrage" is not a well known economic term, although it was used in a widely-circulated article on the anti-immigration site VDARE.com. <a href="http://www.vdare.com/roberts/labor_arbitrage.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vdare.com/roberts/labor_arbitrage.htm" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 13:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The purpose of the article is to identify the different forms of Global Labor Arbitrage and to explain its underlying economic logic using the American labor market as an easy-to-comprehend example. The article is useful in that it ties together several individual subjects that are often treated separately and explains how they are all instances of a greater and more abstract economic concept. The article may be admittedly raw and unrefined, but every article has to start somewhere. I'm hoping that other people who are familiar with the concept will help to improve and to add to it and that I can work on it further the next time I have a day off. Regarding the reference to an op-ed where nationally syndicated columnist and economist Paul Craig Roberts, Ph.D. (economics), makes use of the term, it should be noted that Dr. Roberts is not a mere unestablished two-bit commentator, but rather, the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury of the United States (under the Reagan Administration). Moreover, a Google search for "global labor arbitrage" returned 11,000 hits. Furthermore, as the article revealed, the manifestations of global labor arbitrage are very well-known subjects, which means that people discuss the subject matter of global labor arbitrage profusely but often do not know to identify it as a component of a more abstract and lesser known economic concept. Likewise, people might discuss the merits of international trade without understanding or ever having heard of the concept of comparative advantage, but, as I understand it, that fact does not render "comparative advantage" as inappropriate subject matter for the Wikipedia. Rhobite, regarding the "attack on U.S. work visa programs", does merely describing the effects of an economic policy constitute a a hate-filled attack? Do you take issue with the truthfulness and accuracy of that content? What, specifically, did you find to be inaccurate or false? I'm pretty sure I can find references and examples, such as case of the Florida computer programmer who tried to run for Congress. WhipperSnapper 14:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>unreferenced, been in this state for 6 months, user who created is absent for 1 month (I was going to contact him first), needs a reference to at least state this game existed, and another reference to state it "will go down as one of the greatest combacks in the history of Division 1-AA college football" (should be I-AA).

<p>Pilots for 9/11 Truth is simply <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wondered about this article's appearance in the templates. No vote at this time, but I doubt there's any press coverage <i>or</i> members who are active pilots. One of the debunkers of the Journal of 9/11 Truth was a military and civilian pilot, and his comments may me wonder how any pilot whose license is current could believe the "no plane" theories or that the planes <i>couldn't</i> have been "stolen" and flown by terrorists in the sense of the mainstream account. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 17:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have felt concern about this group because it appears to focus only on the idea that a commercial jet didn't hit the Pentagon, while not even making a serious case that is definative or scientific. The group says "it is impossible for this aircraft to have struck down the light poles." This implies that the lightpoles in front of the Pentagon came down in some other manner, which there is zero evidence for, or that their (NTSB) data is flawed. Many witnesses reported seeing a large jet and many analyses have shown that it indeed COULD have taken down the lightpoles, so I'm concerned about the poor quality of research this site is promoting while using the title "pilots" to suggest expertise. The most one can determine is that the data they used to reach their conclusions is wrong, but they don't even suggest this or any other conclusion from what I can tell. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 21:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC) 21:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>STRONG KEEP - Pilots For 9/11 Truth isn't notable?? There research on the flight data recorder of American 77 is flawed?? Are you kidding me? Have these people even bothered to look at the members list on the actual website or bothered to examine the Flight Data Recorder of American Airlines Flight 77 for more than five minutes? If so, they'd realize that not only is the NTSB's animation of American 77 too high during it’s approach to the Pentagon, it's also too far north to have taken out the light posts.</p>
<p>Question: If the NTSB's CSV file(hard data) on American 77 shows that hijacker Hani Hanjour reset the barometric pressure as he plummeted through 18,000, why does the altimeter on the NTSB animation not indicate this reset with a snapback of the altimeter hand? Question: Why did the NTSB release a flight data recorder showing that the yoke(steering wheel) was never pulled back on to level off the aircraft's final approach to the Pentagon in direct contradiction to what we've all been told(and shown through DoD pictures) for last five years that American 77 flew parallel to the ground just prior to impact? Question: Why is the vertical speed from the flight data recorder in total contradiction of the government’s account of American 77’s final approach?</p>
<p>This is NOT conspiracy theory as the mission statement of Pilots For 9/11 Truth specifically avoids theory. Instead, these are serious questions that are deliberately being ignored by the FBI and NTSB regarding a government-released piece of evidence from September 11, 2001. The burden of proof is NOT on Pilots For 9/11 Truth to explain what happened to American 77. The burden of proof is on the NTSB who released a contradictory piece of evidence that goes against the government's account of the fate of American 77 that the world has been spoon-fed for the last five year. Why is that so difficult to comprehend?</p>

<p>Pilots For Truth sources the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI (as noted in the recorded calls on their site). Tony thinks those sources are unreliable. Many in the 9/11 Truth movement would agree. The Flight Data Recorder provided by the NTSB is unreliable to the govt story as it is in direct conflict with the 9/11 Commission Report. Pilots For Truth exposes these conflicts. It seems some people here want to sweep the facts under the rug. Then again, anyone who references wiki knows its a place for bias and editing at will.

<p>-Comment - I see we have another cracker jack researcher calling for delete. Several articles on the site reference mainstream media, the FBI, the NTSB and the 9/11 Commission Report. The site and forums get over 300,000 hits per month in its short existence so far.. and growing. As the owner and co-founder of the site, I would prefer when people reference our site, they reference the site itself instead of Wiki as Wiki is open to any type of edit from anyone. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.153.105.229 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.153.105.229.html" title="User talk:70.153.105.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.153.105.229_5842.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.153.105.229">contribs</a>) 03:50, January 25, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>ONE touchdown all season, 68 yards all season...star players would see that as a bad game. Simply being a player on a third-rate college football team does not make someone notable or memorable or leave a lasting legacy. In addition, Wikipedia is not a memorial. Any time an article is created after the death, there must be a suspicion of that.</p>
<p>Further, it seems this is yet another case of the overvaluation of the input of young and immature editors, who often see the world only through their own lenses and don't seem able to distinguish between a current event and a lasting legacy.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 12:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (after ec) - Well I don't know W. Marsh's real life <i>age</i>, but he's been editing here as long as you and is an administrator...so I wouldn't be so quick to toss around 'immature'. I'd remind you to AGF if you hadn't been here so long. That said, I'm leaning in favor of <b>keep</b>. Herr Dorsey might not have been a star football player, but as in some other cases a bizarre death can make one notable. How many college football players have died ever during conditioning workouts? He has a cite (which most truly non-notable college football players would indeed lack), and Wikipedia is not paper. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 13:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The death while it's rare it's not completely bizzare, there has been many cases of a college or pro player die after practice, mainly because of heart issues, etc, which this appears to be one. If it was an heat stroke death then the case maybe more notable but there is nothing a person can do with an heart defect afterworkout. Each college football player has their own college page as well and could be sourced as well.

<dd>Yea but it also says <i>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</i> The only claim of notablity is dying. Of cource a sudden death of an athlete makes local news and sometimes that is covered by the AP, my newspaper had only one sentence of his death so it only minor death that made the news for not very long.

<dd>Frankly I don't think you're reading WP:BIO closely enough, those planks are merely signs that the more important criterion of sufficient verifiability is met, a subject can easilly meet the main criterion without meeting the planks at the bottom. None of those planks have to be met before there can be an article, and that's explicitly said in the guideline. As I've said before the claim of playing for a Div. 1 sports program itself is a claim of notability. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Reading his profile he is an 'inclusionist' (i.e., an advocate for having an article on anything verifiable, forget the need for notability).

<li><b>Delete</b> Dying in an odd way is not usually notable. <i>Maybe</i> if you're the first to do so or your case leads to some sort of reform or medical breakthrough or... you get the idea.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree that this appears to meet one point of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: <i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i> Given the nature of this criterion, this would mean the article would clearly meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and should be kept. However, the only reason why this person was the subject of a non-trivial work is because he died in an unusual circumstance (heatstroke is common, nowadays; but it is still newsworthy when it involves sports players). We should <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> as the criterion on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> only works for this article because of his death, and his article has no merit otherwise. Besides, since the person has not made a name for himself at the college level, I doubt there is much expansion that can be done to the article. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 00:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The guidelines under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> indicate that playing in a fully professional league is required except in primarily amateur sports (such as many college sports, but <i>not</i> football). I don't think signing a football letter of intent should automatically qualify someone for an article, and inevitably there will be a long spiral down as we debate whether benchwarmers at Division III or NAIA schools qualify. College football players who never play pro football should qaulify only if they achieve All-American status (as was often the case in the pre-NFL era and for some time afterward). There <i>should</i> be an article on mortality issues in college football, with substantial material on the pre-1910 era when dozens of players were dying annually.

<li>Uh no, WP:BIO explicitly says things like "playing in a fully professional league" are not required. That's literally what it says... "just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted" and yet you claim the opposite.

<ul>
<li>It says that playing in a fully professional league is not required <i>IF</i> the sport is primarily amateur; this was the case for the early years of college football. Exceptions are made (quoting the guidelines) if: "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided <b>to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion</b>—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level." This <i>specifically</i> refers us to the first criteria, which is: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." That is clearly <i>not</i> the case with Dorsey; he falls short regarding the first criteria, so the one discussing sportspeople clearly applies. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 01:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>At any rate I think you also misunderstand what is meant by "[verification] should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level", that just means that in disputes over whether someone actually did perform in a professional/highest level situation, that an independent reliable source needs to be found to confirm that. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. That is what I assume you're arguing. However, that means he passes WP:BIO solely because of his death, since that is why he has multiple non-trivial news articles. Yeah, I used a non-consesus verifiability test above that technically doens't count on WP:BIO. Anyway, if we allow him to have an article and his notability stems from his death, then that could be argued for everyone showing up on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2007.html" title="Deaths in 2007">Deaths in 2007</a> link.

<li>Well, if we had articles on all those people the project would be better for it. As I've said we want more accurate/neutral articles, not fewer. WP:BIO's core criterion doesn't specify a concern about why someone would get non-trivial media coverage, and exclude certain reasons for it, because to do so is subjective and leads to bias.

<li>True, accurate articles are good, I just feel that the line has to be drawn somewhere on what college athletes can be considered notable. I'm actually an inclusionist, so your convincing me to not delete the article is probably inevitable. I went and googled Keeley Dorsey minus died, death, etc. and actually got a lot of results.

<p><b>Comment</b> The three 'sources' listed are all local Tampa area news coverage, and can hardly be said to be a 'published' work.</p>
<p>Elitist theory, including 'bread and circuses,' states that you can keep the people preoccupied with sports and food, and take their money while they're not paying attention. It worked for the ancient Roman empire and it is working for modern-day America. Simple transient news coverage hardly merits an 'encyclopedia' entry. Wikipedia's danger is the same as that of video games: it can become unobjectively time-consuming. For all those who think they might 'save' this article: what a waste of time. No wonder the education of America is in such trouble.</p>
<p>Also, I thought that "Wikipedia is not a memorial." Clearly, had this player not died, there wouldn't have been news coverage. I disagree that because something is in the news, it merits its own article. By that low, low standard, Wikipedia ceases to be an encylopedia and becomes simply a lowest-common denominator. Might as well have articles on oneself at this rate. Come to think of it, I've been in the newspaper on six continents, too many times to count. I guess I merit an article, too. Anyone for starters?</p>
<p>However, the worst part of having an article like this being included is that it makes a mockery of effort. If rushing for 68 yards and 1 touchdown, career, is notable, then dying early, while we ignore someone who might have rushed for 68 yards/game but dies at 76, then what we are doing is simply creating a system that overvalues itself, youth, and current events, while lowering the standards to simply attracting media coverage, transient or no. What is the purpose of trying if simply existing is the new standard? → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 09:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, but will require better citation</b> Television show character articles are normally ok, even for minor characters (and I noticed this character was supposedly on the show for five years, which sounds like a pretty good run). There is a problem, though, in that the article seems to be weak on references for verification purposes. I would suggest improving the references and expanding the information about the character to make it more than just a stub. If after a reasonable time no additional references are added and the article is not expanded, I'd be more inclined to reconsider and suggestion deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Minor characters in television shows are almost never notable enough for an article. Without any sources that show notability this stub definitely needs to go. And in response to an argument made above, the fact that articles exist for other minor characters of this show does not, in any way, imply that this should be kept. In fact, it implies that those articles should also be nominated for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you think it still even resembles a dictionary definition, one must conclude that you have not spent much time reading dictionaries. Furthermore, it is a phrase. Dictionaries are for words. An argument could be made that it might resemble an entry in a reference book on American idiom, if one wanted to be pedantic, but certainly not a dictionary definition. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmonk_956c.html" title="User:Amonk">Amonk</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/o/User_talk%7EAmonk_5302.html" title="User talk:Amonk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amonk_0f1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amonk">contribs</a>) 16:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> It's <i>not</i> an Americanism, as the history of the term actually dates back to when the leaders in question were <a href="../../../k/i/n/King.html" title="King">kings</a> or their advisors — Merriam-Webster (as part of the 1995 Brittanica home edition) reports the date of origin as 1599.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fine. Delete it if you all want to. I didn't write that it was an <i>Americanism,</i> or even that it originated in the USA. I wrote of how it is used in the USA. Learn to read what is written rather than what you assume is written. Not doing so makes you look sloppy at best. Furthermore, only lousy dictionaries, such as Websters, and only recently, started including phrases too. Not long ago, dictionaries were for words, just as not long ago people could still write with punctuation and capitalization. Furthermore, since you seem to like Websters for some reason, it's own definition for the word <i>dictionary</i> says it is for words, and nothing more. <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dictionary" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dictionary" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> Moreover, even the Wikipedia <i>dictionary</i> page you cite says dictionaries are only for words.&#160;:-) Finally, regarding your last point, it is the only intelligent thing you wrote. Evidently, it is usually written as one syncopated word and there is even an entry for it as such in Wikipedia already. I therefore propose they be merged under the original. [Note: I tried to uncapitalise it too, but it broke the link and I didn't have enough time to look into resolving that before you all started jumping down my throat.] <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmonk_956c.html" title="User:Amonk">Amonk</a> 17:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Great. I was going to do it, but I'd be just as happy if you would. I'm a Wikipedia editing newbie and, as you all may have already noticed, not so adept as yet.

<li><b>Speedy keep as redirect</b> to Kingmaker. The "information about U.S. politics" was unsourced material about matter that belongs elsewhere and had NPOV problems: George McGovern's role in setting up the current primary system, (2) the relevance or irrelevance of kingmakers to U.S. politics since then, (3) POV assertions that political contributors "buy" or "rent" politicians and that this is a change from previous systems. All of this may belong somewhere, but not in a dab page, and certainly not unsourced. I removed all except the restriction of usage to the United States, which seems likely and I do not challenge. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 20:31, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Proceedural listing; an anon apparently tried to AFD this by doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_14&amp;diff=101016801&amp;oldid=100760615" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_14&amp;diff=101016801&amp;oldid=100760615" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but they obviously couldn't create the subpage and didn't put the AFD notice on top of the article or ask anyone for help. I can only guess at their motivation; but the article has been tagged with the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">notability concerns</a> and unreferenced templates for about a month. There are some notes and external links at the bottom. One is to a blog, two are to the internet movie database, one is to his official website, one is to youtube, one is to a newspaper, and one is to experts.about.com. Only one of those qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Looking at the filmography section I would <i>think</i> he'd be notable; but the IMDB link does not confirm that he was in those movies. The only place that I can find where he is alleged to have been in those movies is this Wikipedia article. He is not listed in the Wikipedia articles for the movies, or in the IMDB as having been in those movies. However, none of those movies or tv shows are ones that I have watched or follow; and I have not done much research as I intend this to be simply a proceedural nom helping out the anon. Nonetheless, I'm wondering if this is a hoax article. Is this article <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> or not? ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 15:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There are millions of gaia online users (OK, fine, there are millions of accounts.

I nominated this because I remembered repeated assertions in the past by others on the talk page that the only reason it was notable was something that was itself unverifiable. As for not explaining it; in VFD's I've seen in the past, it seemed to most common to say something like "non-notable", "fancruft", "original research", or whatever else and then disappear off with no further explanation, so I honestly thought this was standard practice and no further explanation was necessary. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a><sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">T</a></sup> 05:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>This musician seems to have no claim to fame beyond appearing on two "idol tryout" CDs by a label whose notability seems to be established primarily by reference to the artists on these idol tryouts CDs.

<li><b>Keep</b> (but needs radical improvement). There is no question that Clifford Orwin is notable. Per the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">proposed guideline</a>, he has published a significant and well-known academic work (<i>The Humanity of Thucydides</i>, Princeton University Press, 1994), which has been "the subject of multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews." (L'Année philologique lists 17 reviews in scholarly journals, plus a review in the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Literary_Supplement_1168.html" title="Times Literary Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>.) The problem with the article is that it's not an article on the notable scholar qua notable scholar, it's an article on a non-notable figure in political controversies. In such a case isn't policy to keep it but mark it for cleanup? <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 20:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There has to be a reason to get a Guggenheim, I think.

<p>Non-notable army officer from Bangladesh.

I am a resident of Brampton &amp; think this company should be listed. <small>— Woodyinbrampton (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Woodyinbrampton_681c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Woodyinbrampton">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> - a lot of historic theaters would probably be good topics for Wikipedia articles, but as it is right now, this is just an advertisement and could really be speedied as G11 if someone felt so inclined. But a well-written, sourced, article on a historic theater (which this one appears to be from the description) would not be a bad thing. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This film is neither scheduled or expected. I searched for it through Lexis Nexis and found nothing other than there was an "idea". Billy Joe Armstrong said it was "definitely going to happen", but unless he's going to fund it himself, no deal has been inked. In Hollywood, rumors of a film do not a film make. It sounds like no script has been written either. To me, do deal in place + no script written = delete. Put it on the Green Day page if you have good citations. But it does not yet warrant its own page.<a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 07:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The claims to a "world-wide" movement are suspect. There is only one artist listed as a neopoprealist, Nadia Russ, who already has a page. This is not a dispute over her notability as an artist, but the questionable importance of a one-person art movement started in 2003. The only other artist mentioned uses the term "neopoprealism" once on his personal website with no indication of affiliation with Ms. Russ. The references all lead back to Nadia Russ' webpage, wikipedia, or discussion groups in which Ms. Russ belongs, as do any google searches, or are ads purchased in art magazine classified sections. There is no evidence of any notablity in this movement.

<dd>I was working in Art field for many years. I'm German. I know Nadia. I like NeoPR philosophy. I develope idea - "Be Beautiful". It is project "Nutrition for the Masses" We focus on non-animal meat. As I said NeoPR is wider, than just ARTs/painting. It's also health and beauty: We planning distribution by NYC license vendors with decorated hot carts-wagons on the streets &amp; elegant casual dresses. I hired two such vendors to start selling crop meat in strategic popular special places in Manhattan. They'll be working from 9 am to 7 pm. The product purchased from important food US companies, who subsidiaries makes crop meat of all discriptions ready to go &amp; prepared for the vendor and his grill. We'll charge no more than $1.99 for such "hefty minute meal" sandwich, for busy New Yorker. We'll include a fruit drink as well. . It's what we doing for humanity now. Health is beauty. Beauty is NeoPR.</dd>

<p>Please delete this article. There is nothing of substance said about art in the manifesto-like writing in this article, or, for that matter, in the article on Nadia Russ.

<p>Only obfuscation is being employed to defend the inclusion of this article on Wikipedia. What do the referred to New York City licensed decorated vendor carts, elegant dresses, and crop meat products have to do with either art or art movements? The sole defender of the article claims to have worked in the art field for many years. If so, that person should be able to explain a point of view better than is seen in the above entry by User: Well1234567. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Speedy delete</b> This "article" is nonsense. There is no justification for it being here. The gibberish being referred to is supposed to be <i>"wider, than just ARTs/painting."</i> Fine -- then what is it?

<li><b>Comment</b> Apparently, the term "legal wall" is a generic term for this type of thing and is used in places other than Rochester: <a href="http://graffitihurts.org/learn_more/faq.cfm#n6" class="external autonumber" title="http://graffitihurts.org/learn_more/faq.cfm#n6" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> and <a href="http://creativecity.ca/resources/project-profiles/St-John's-Legal-Wall.html" class="external text" title="http://creativecity.ca/resources/project-profiles/St-John's-Legal-Wall.html" rel="nofollow">creativecity.ca</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There's only one source in the article, which is not related to the concept. Also, it seems that the idea of a legal wall for graffiti and a <b>free wall</b> for street art (which is what I was referring to) apparently are not the same thing. At least in <i>my hood</i>, gang graffiti is banned outright from street art exhibits (there's some nice ones), legitimate businesses that allow street art on their walls would never allow actual gang signs. I mean, you're practically asking for street fights and shootings if you let gangs sign. Even the St. John's so-called Legal Graffiti Wall in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> (like Newfies are notorious gangbangers??!) is an art project, not a chalkboard for People and Folks. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 02:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. If the author wants to argue the concept of a legal wall is notable, it might be better to create a new article about the topic <i>in general</i> rather than one specific wall. Even so, a quick Google search doesn't turn anything up but a localized wiki, which isn't a verifiable source. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 03:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> does not strike me as notable in this particular instance. The concept is around here and there, of course, and that has article potential, but could probably suffice as a section in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grafitti.html" title="Grafitti">grafitti</a> for the time being. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First off, there seem to be few or no sources for this. After ignoring that, it really isn't notable enough. Runescape is, of course, but as the edit summary says, this is not Runescape. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 23:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> into Runescape. I could not find sources that discussed DeviousMUD on its own terms, rather than as merely the forerunner to Runescape. Plus the article is so short that at the present time it makes more sense to discuss it as part of the development of Runescape. If the Runescape article's discussion of its predecessor grows to such a point that it is too big for that article, it can be split off at that time. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 23:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> - I found this on rogue subpage patrol. It passed the <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">gameguide</a> tests, but I wasn't sure about notability. It seems to assert <i>some</i>, by being the direct predecessor to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and added it to the templates, lists, etc. to see if it could get some traffic and edits. Otherwise, I would have re-redirected it or prodded it like the clan vanispamcruftisment and non-notable bot I found aswell. To be fair, we could do with better coverage of DevMUD and RSC, if possible. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainVindaloo_b7ba.html" title="User:CaptainVindaloo">CaptainVindaloo</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainVindaloo_30b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainVindaloo">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaptainVindaloo_0228.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaptainVindaloo">c</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CaptainVindaloo_40b4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CaptainVindaloo">e</a></sup> 00:02, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Merge back or delete</b></s> <b>Redirect to RS article</b> Whilst Devious is an important part of RS' development history, if you guys can't find any sources then I'm sure I won't.

In order to stand up as a seperate subject, there needs to be sources demonstrating the fact. There is no new information in this article and sources, the net result of it being the creation of problems where there weren't any. That this article was created is not a problem, it becomes a problem when it is kept for secondary sources which do not exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is/was a seperate game to RS, and deleting it because it is a stub is not good enough. Keep it so we can extend it and improve it. A google search comes up with over 1300 results, Im sure some of them can be of use when it comes to improving this article. Its not cruft because it is a seperate game, as opposed to a part of RuneScape. If it gets to a few months down the line and its still a stub, then reconsider nominating it then. It was only made into a seperate article on the 15th of January. You cant expect it to be a good article after just 4 days - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Giant_Puffin_fb2f.html" title="User:The Giant Puffin"><font face="Franklin Gothic Book" color="orange"><b>• The Giant Puffin •</b></font></a> 15:15, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Failing keep, merge with RuneScape, but this is an example of something that really deserves its own article even if it may have to stay a stub. Notability is provided by its relation to RuneScape. I'll try to find some more information to add, but I doubt anyone not involved with Jagex or who played RuneScape since the very early days will know much. Still, I think it should be kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlternator_2109.html" title="User:Alternator">Alternator</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/t/User_talk%7EAlternator_d159.html" title="User talk:Alternator">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alternator_41b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alternator">contribs</a>) 00:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>Hang on a sec, it can't be a component of RS <i>and</i> a seperate entity, it either forms part of an article which does pass the policies and guidelines or stands on its own two feet and does the same. The creation of this article asserts that it is a seperate entity and therefore can be judged as such. It fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, further expansion is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and will be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, since no further sources are forthcoming. Sources have been looked for before in order to reference the DeviousMUD entry in the RS page, the opportunity for them to manifest has been a lot longer than the lifespan of this article. Sorry but I don't see why this 'deserves' an article when it can never hope to be a full article and pass the afformentioned, especially when the information is all contained on the RS page and we stand to lose nothing from this article being redirected. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 01:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. Holzwarth is almost certainly notable enough for an article (and the unsubstantiated claim by Soltak that this is a vanity article should be removed as defamatory, not least as it also implies that he also vandalized Wikipedia).

<li><b>Keep</b> This organization has been the subject of multiple sources, since their accomplishments have been chronicled online at www.perjuries.com as well as at www.collegemocktrial.org, a website run by the American Mock Trial Association - which has the largest membership of any college activity in the nation. Additionally, the 2006-2007 AMTA case, which was published and distributed to thousands of competitors, was authored by two Columbia Mock Trial students. Also, Columbia University Mock Trial has been featured repeatedly in front-page articles in the Columbia Spectator and in Columbia College Today. Unlike other student groups, Columbia Mock Trial is a nationally ranked team currently in the top ten in the nation and with national visibility.</li>

Even worse is www.perjuries.com, which is an online message board for students and coaches of mock trial and includes several Columbia Mock Trial students &amp; coaches as regular contributors. <i>Those sources do NOT count</i> as they are not independent, reliable, or non-trival.
