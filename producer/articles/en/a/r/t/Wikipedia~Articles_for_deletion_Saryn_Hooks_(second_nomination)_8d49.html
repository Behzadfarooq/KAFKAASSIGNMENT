<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Bear in mind that it isn't simply this young lady's finish that makes her notable, but also the controversy regarding her reinstatement. This latter point is largely unrebutted in the debate by those who favor deletion, and influences my reading of the consensus AfDs have next-to-no precedential value anyway, but this consensus emphatically says nothing about the general notability of non-controversial high-place spelling bee finishers. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 19:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The spelling bee is major notable and nationally televised sport. My understanding is that this year a U.S. network carried it live in primetime. Placing third in such a competition <b>must</b> be at least as notable as being a minor MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL player - and we know that players with even one at-bat etc. on the top level are entitled to WP articles! There are precedents, of course. We had a few AfD's (can't find off hand) for people who've participate in one career NASCAR race decades ago, placing nowhere near the top, and were kept. Surely, this participation is worthy of an article. As to its staying a stub forever, that is not necessarily true, but it's no more true about Hooks than about the NASCAR people. (If anyone can point me to those AfD's, I would appreciate it.) - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 17:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b> as per CrazyRussian and Yanksox; this spelling bee is notable enough to be broadcast nationally, and thus should be considered alongside other sporting events. I'm going with 'weak' here, though, as she is the third-place finisher, and that might be sliding just out of notability. (First place in the national spelling bee is an easy keep; second, in this case, involved the two-time Canadian national champion, which made her worthy of keeping. Third? Perhaps; I lean towards yes.)</s> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(speak)</a></small> 18:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weakish keep</b> (As in, weaker than a keep, but stronger than a weak keep.) I'm completely with Tony Fox. Unlike the winner and the runner-up (who, as stated, is also the back-to-back Canadian nat'l champ), Saryn Hooks' third place finish is just a third place finish. But third place is the bronze medal, and nobody would try to delete an article on a bronze medalist (nor would the article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Barch_9361.html" title="John Barch">John Barch</a>, the third place finisher at the World Series of Poker get deleted). Plus, this was third place in an event televised in primetime on a broadcast network. CrazyRussian and Yanksox also provided good reasons to keep the article on Hooks. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 18:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It is a televised event, and as Kicking said, bronze medalists' articles would not be up for AfD. However, I'd be more comfortable keeping the article if there was some further point of notability, per <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finola_Hackett_804e.html" title="Finola Hackett">Finola Hackett</a> for example. -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain09</a> 18:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> - A third-place finisher, which I don't consider to be inherently notable in the case of spelling bees. I wouldn't have considered Finola notable had she not won the Canadian bees as well. The "<a href="../../../h/e/c/Hechsher.html" title="Hechsher">hechsher</a>" incident is the only thing that might cause me to think otherwise, but since it was caught before it had any impact on the results, it doesn't really enhance her notability. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 19:10, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> clearly. There is absolutely nothing notable whatsoever about this person outside of the controversy over a single spelling bee; this content should be covered in the article which discusses this year's competition. It really doesn't matter a hill of beans how important the competition is, we don't have articles for a lot of unsuccessful runners in political races although <i>those</i> competitions are notable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">WP:BIO</a> requires more than a single appearance in one event, however controversial the outcome, because otherwise what you have is a notable <i>event</i> not a notable <i>person</i>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, we accept articles on politicians who succeed at the state level, but fail federally. She won locally, and competed nationally three times. So, that's more than just one event. Most athletes in a recognized sport, competing at a comperable level would be kept, even if they didn't make it to third place.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that third in a national academic competition is notable performance for an encyclopedia that is not paper. And she is definitely the subject of multiple independent news articles. I don't particularly like this result because it means I am also eligible for an article, but as it was in the pre-web days, I don't expect any of you to go visit the morgue of the appropriate local papers to verify that claim, so I'm safe. I don't know if the reinstatement should be mentioned in the bee article, the editors of that article are the best judge of that. The best academic competitions have a procedure for challenging judgement, so that may or may not be worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:53, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li>So, going forward, you are confident that this third-place finish will be sufficient to gain continuing coverage from reliable sources, yes? That in, say, five years, it will be easy to verify her latest achievements and where she is from the continued coverage that finishing third gains her? Or will she, like an unsuccessful political candidate, appear perhaps one day in a "where are they now" piece? My view is that these people should be merged to a single article until there is some additional claim to notability - otherwise we get the "last heard of selling used cars in Portland, OR" style of article, which is silly. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:20, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Third place just isn't good enough, expecially when that's her only finish of note. Drawing a comparison to the Olympics isn't really fair, since nearly all Olympians are notable in some way. Only the quirk about being returned to competition is interesting, but it belongs more in an article about the event itself than about the person it benefited. There's not even a mention in the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee_d757.html" title="Scripps National Spelling Bee">Scripps National Spelling Bee</a> article or a link from that page to help justify keeping this article. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 20:37, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG MERGE AND DELETE</b> The only notable thing about Sayrn is that she was reinstated.

<li>*<b>Delete</b>If you look at the guidelines, it doesn't seem like this matches up with any category. Also it definitley shouldn't be included because of this test: '100 year test (future speculation) -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?' Will anyone care in 100 years, other than Sayrn herself and her family? Consider this. I'm sure that at this point, the only people actually looking for the article are her friends and family so they can say "OOOOOhhh! I know her!" <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClamster5_9625.html" title="User:Clamster5">Clamster5</a> (<a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClamster5_e4dd.html" title="User talk:Clamster5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clamster5_1324.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clamster5">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>Going by the spirit (if not the letter) of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_people_78e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living people">WP:LIVING</a> seems to give justification for removal of baseless negative statements about a living person, who's the subject of an article. We should have zero tolerance for this sort of sillyness. Note, in particular, this user (under two ids) has made attacks in article space. We're not talking about good faith AFD comments here. Note, my removal wasn't really related to vote-count concerns (as I know, that no admin would count such a vote). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:31, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Problematic AFDs are sometimes blanked after conclusion; however I think it's poor precedent to start removing comments in the middle of an AFD, it just makes for bigger headaches when factchecking at the end. Usual precedent is to indent them. No censure intended on your behavior, I just disagree on what should be done about it. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 22:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
