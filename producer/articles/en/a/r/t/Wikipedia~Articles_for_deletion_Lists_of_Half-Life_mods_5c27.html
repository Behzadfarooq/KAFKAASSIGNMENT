<p>Both have been nominated for deletion before. <i>List of Half-Life mods</i> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Half-Life_mods_96cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Half-Life mods">was deleted two weeks ago</a>, while <i>List of Half-Life 2 mods</i> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Half-Life_2_mods_4980.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Half-Life 2 mods">was kept in February</a>. <i>List of Half-Life mods</i> was created anew shortly after its deletion. It was tagged with db-repost, but de-tagged following this comment:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>This article is not a repost of the <b>original</b> article, in the AfD it was mentioned that it can be created again "if someone wants to turn it into an acceptable article rather than a directory" (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Half-Life_mods_96cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Half-Life mods">source</a>), also an admin said "this needs to be changed significantly before it is reposted" (<a href="../../../p/i/z/User_talk%7EPizzahut2_a523.html" title="User talk:Pizzahut2">source</a>), which I have done - it is changed significantly. Please compare with the <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzahut2_List_of_Half-Life_mods_9afe.html" title="User:Pizzahut2/List of Half-Life mods">original article</a>.

<p>I am opening this discussion in order to achieve a consensus once and for all; should these articles be retained? Both articles, especially <i>List of Half-Life 2 mods</i> still looks more or less like a directory (which Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">not</a>). <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 12:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

One single point we can come to, read about the latest releases, publicly made up to date by Wiki submitters.

<dd>- Yes, because a couple of the mods on the list are big, we should definitly have a huge unmanageabvle list of every mod for HL2 with no limits on who can put their 2-bit never-to-be-finished mod on it. (Irony over.) Seriously, if the mod is big, then people will look for it's article directly, and if the game isn't that big, and doesn't have an article, it should not be included on an indiscriminate list as who would be looking for further information on something they never heard of? And as always, the 'if X and Y have an article then E, H and Z should be mentioned' arguement doesn't hold water. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>- Yes, but the problem is that every time we add a page for a mod that is notable someone post a adf and since there will be always someone that disagres they end up deleted even if we post prof of the notability (there will be always some Admin that disagres and it will delete it) Snewerl 20:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>- It's not an indiscriminate list, the List of Half-Life mods at least only has mods which either gained awards, made it to the Mod Of The Year feature or have their own article. It's easy to change the List of Half-Life 2 mods the same way, infact it's been done already. --<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzahut2_8d0a.html" title="User:Pizzahut2">Pizzahut2</a> 00:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and now that list has only 6 games, 2 with articles, and at least 3 of the others are notable enough to have articles that would be kept, therefore the list is serving no useful purpose because the mods are big enough that people would be looking for the articles directly without the need of the list. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Azure Sheep was only deleted because no-one removed the prod from it, which is lot different from an AfD. As for Sven, I don't quite follow that one.

<dd>Ah, I understand now, thanks for that. The way I see it, a lot of Mods were caught off-guard with that purge a couple of months back and had their pages deleted, but I'm sure that mods like sven could re-create their pages and have them kept, as long as they made sure they paid special attention to establishing notability and providing sources. But I guess we are deviating from the point of this discussion a bit now! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Azure Sheep had at least a review in a computer magazine and other stuff that was reason for notability (not sure what you mean as prod). Point of View had a award from ModDB and other stuff that also were reason for notability. They got deleted just the same. As I said before there will be always some Admin that disagres and it will delete it. Snewerl 09:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Moving indent back a a bit) A <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prod</a> is when someone puts up a tag saying they believe the article should be deleted. If the tag is left untouched for 5 days, the article is deleted without a second thought. This was what happened to Azure Sheep. All that was needed was someone to remove the Prod tag and the article wouldn't have been deleted, although most contested prods usually end up becomming AfDs, but at least people would have had a chance to argue their point. And whether an article is deleted or not is never down to just the admin. All the admin does is look at the arguements and have to decide which side makes the better arguement, and even then there is various appeals processes for people who disagree with a decision. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I admit it's somewhat useless information for some people, but for people who search for a big reference list of Half-Life 2 mods it is very useful. I myself have found some of the best mods/mods in making I know here. It does need some work, maybe a re-do or just dust off a bit of trash, but a definive "Keep" in my opinion.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is the thing, the arguement that this be deleted is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> indiscriminate information, a repository of links or an online directory, but so far the only argument to keep it is 'But I've found this list useful' which I don't really think is a convincing enough arguement for us to ignore a wiki policy (several parts of that poilicy to boot.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a developer of SourceForts, I feel that some may find my opinion on this AfD biased, so I'll refrain from "voting," but I find this article useful and think it should be kept. - 71.233.96.192 10:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm probably also biased as recreator / main contributor. How I can be biased when I voted delete? Because I wasted too much time and energy in this.

<li>I personally don't see a problem with a bias as long as a person states the fact but can still provide a level-headed arguement to back up their point of view.
