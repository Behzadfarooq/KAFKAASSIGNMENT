<li>Quick review: Previously speedy deleted as a db-empty. However, the rationales in the deletion debate leading up to that referred to notability. Notability is still an issue with this version. (And, ya know, you mighta avoided having any problems if you had happened to click on the link, right there, for the original AfD debate instead of trusting what I say all the time.) <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 08:56, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The school project people frequently completely change an article on a school they favor during the nomination period. And I can see they won't do that for this school A business school should not be considered bad or more lowly than a public school. In this world there are all kinds of school to fit the changing population. So the new types of schools can't be notable? This seems strange to me. Jacks 12:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: There are multiple schools by this title, so, first, the article should not stay at this name unless it so completely whomps all the others in fame as to be a national term. it doesn't and isn't. Second, the article says that it is a school for gifted youngsters, which makes it just exactly like thousands of other private schools. The school <i>may</i> have a quality that makes it truly remarkable, but there is absolutely <i>nothing in the article</i> that suggests it. It's not too much to ask that authors of school articles obey the same strictures applicable to <i>every other article</i> on Wikipedia.

<li>Comment: Nope, they can read about them in the Yellow Pages. They just shouldn't be trying to read about them in an <i>encyclopedia,</i> and being an encyclopedia is our <b>first</b> principle. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Yellow Pages does not contain encylopedia articles, and does not aspire too. Also it is not freely available to every human being on the planet. You appear to be prepared to betray our desire to learn about the world in order to us a lesson about where to look things up. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Yellow pages is as accessible as Wikipedia: if you have web access, you have access to the Yellow Pages of any city in the US. If you don't have web access, you don't have Wikipedia. Simply listing where things are is not learning about the world, and all that this article does is say that there is a <i>business</i> out there for education of those who need little. There is no indication, beyond that, that there is anything to describe, to explain. What is the explanatory power of this "article?" It answers the burning question of "What is the particular thing called The Evergreen School <b>in this particular place,</b>" but no more. Is it THE Evergreen School or is it AN Evergreen School? The authors can't even be bothered to name their article accurately, and yet you would fight to preserve a description and call it an explanation? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Article contains multiple assertions of notability. None in and of themselves are that convincing, but having any assertion of notability makes it head and shoulders above the average school article discussed here. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> notable school, allow to develop. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 16:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> a well-written article that should be a model for other schools. If the article is this thorough after one day on Wikipedia, imagine what could be done in a whole week, or maybe even a month or two! <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 22:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Has a nationally ranked chess team and other rewards. Hard to see how it doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
