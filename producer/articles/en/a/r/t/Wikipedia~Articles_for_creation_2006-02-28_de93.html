<p>It is also known as Tuck-In Acquisition. The acquisition of a company made for the sole purpose of merging it into a division of the acquirer is sometimes referred to as "bolt-on acquisitions." Notes: This type of corporate strategy is generally used to acquire companies with technological breakthroughs or comparative advantages at a cost less than implementing the changes themselves. <a href="http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bolt-on+acquisitions(" class="external free" title="http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bolt-on+acquisitions(" rel="nofollow">http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bolt-on+acquisitions(</a>202.122.19.154 07:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Cytochalasins are fungal metabolites that have the ability to bind to actin filaments and block polymerization and the elongation of actin. As a result of the inhibition of actin polymerization, cytochalasins can change cellular morphology, inhibit cellular processes such as cell division, and even cause cells to undergo apoptosis (Haidle and Myers, 2004). Cytochalasins have the ability to permeate cell membranes, prevent cellular translocation and cause cells to enucleate (Cooper, 1987). Cytochalasins can also have an effect on other aspects on biological processes unrelated to actin polymerization. For example, cytochalasins A and B can also inhibit the transport of monosaccharides across the cell membrane (Cooper, 1987), cytochalasin H has been found to regulate plant growth (Cox et al., 1983), cytochalasin D inhibits protein synthesis (Ornelles et al., 1986) and cytochalasin E prevents angiogenesis (Udagawa et al., 2000).</p>

<p>Cytochalasins are known to bind to the barbed, fast growing plus ends of microfilaments, which then blocks both the assembly and disassembly of individual actin monomers from the bound end. Once bound, cytochalasin essentially caps the end of the new actin filament. One cytochalasin will bind to one actin filament (Cooper, 1987). Studies done with Cytochalasin D (CD) have found that the formation of CD-actin dimers, contain ATP bound actin (Goddette and Frieden, 1986). These CD-actin dimers are reduced to CD-actin monomers as a result of ATP hydrolysis. The resulting CD-actin monomer can bind ATP-actin monomer to reform the CD-actin dimer (Cooper, 1987). CD is very effective; only low concentrations (0.2 μM) are needed to prevent membrane ruffling and disrupt treadmilling (Yahara et al., 1982). Yahara et al.

<p>Actin microfilaments have been widely studied using cytochalasins. Due to their chemical nature, cytochalasins can help researchers understand the importance of actin in various biological processes. In addition, cytochalasins have been used as actin binding proteins. The use of cytochalasins have allowed researchers to better understand actin polymerization, cell motility, ruffling, cell division, contraction, and cell stiffness. The use of cytochalasins has been so important to understanding cytoskeletal movement and many other biological processes, researchers have created two synthetic cytochalasins (Haidle and Myers, 2004).</p>

<p>Fast Car Magazine is an UK-based woodpulp publication that has been in circulation since the mid-1980s. Up until recently, the magazine was published by Highbury Leisure, but it - and a series of other publication - was bought up by Future Publishing in mid-2005.</p>
<p>Fast Car Magazine is known as FC or FUK (Fastcar United Kingdom) among friends. It started off as a performance car magazine, but has been through several significant re-vamps and is currently aimed at readers interested in modified cars.</p>
<p>As part of the modified car culture, Fast Car magazine is a 'lads' magazine: It features highly modified vehicles, but is also taking a line involving a lot of lifestyle magazine, including up to three "honeyz" - scantily clad ladies.</p>
<p>Unusual in the magazine-publishing world, Fast Car's tone is very conversational. Fast Car staff are often featured in the magazine themselves, and much of the copy is interjected with comments made by the editor or other members of FC staff. The conversational tone and self-ironic image means that Fast Car is a refreshing read compared to more 'serious' publications.</p>
<p>Fast Car's main UK competitors are Max Power and Red Line. Circulation-wise, the Audited Bureau of Circulation reports that Fast Car sells 100,000 copies of its magazine every year - including a not insignificant international circulation.</p>
<p>The magazine is operating a web-site available on www.fastcar.co.uk.</p>

<p>Along with Jam-Handy, Wilding, and others, the Calvin Company was one of the major industrial film companies in the United States. For nearly half a century it dominated the field in terms of quantity as well as quality. Calvin handled many accounts of the Fortune 500---such companies as Du Pont, Goodyear, Caterpillar, and General Mills. It pioneered the use of 16mm sound technology, of new Kodak processing methods, and of 8mm film. It won more than its share of accolades at trade festivals. It held nationwide sales and training seminars that attracted a who's who of business. Whatever paid, it made---government films, commercials, educationals, industrials, documentaries, and every variety of short subject.</p>
<p>It happened to be headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, because a married couple with energy and enterprise, F. O. Calvin and Betty Calvin, were residents there, and operating an advertising agency during the time America was mucking its way through the Depression and American movies were just beginning to talk.</p>
<p>Betty Calvin managed the business side; F. O. Calvin was the salesman. Together they had the idea of investing in the future of 16mm films as an in-house advertising and promotional tool. The third member of the Calvin leadership was Lloyd Thompson, F. O. Calvin's onetime University of Kansas fraternity brother, and a graduate, as so many of the Calvin higher-ups were, in journalism. Thompson and the Calvins raised the capital and in 1931 began production on a modest scale, taking advantage of Kansas City's proximity to locations, industry, and commerce. They were good at selling the Calvin concept, and they signed up accounts that would stay with the company for three decades.</p>
<p>They took other people's bad, amateurish films and fixed them up so they were serviceable. They made their own movies from scratch---short, inexpensive ones in the studio as well as long, big-budget ones on location in other time zones. They went further: They held entrepreneurial conferences and gave advice on how to use the 16mm medium. They also began to manufacture some equipment and boasted an excellent processing laboratory.</p>
<p>World War II proved a gold mine for the Calvin company. F. O. Calvin was a dollar-a-year man for the Navy in Washington, D.C., where he advised on the running of a filmmaking system similar to the Calvin Company's. The Navy wanted Calvin to move his operations to D.C., but F.O. resisted, and the Calvin personnel remained in Kansas City. In effect, Calvin became a military subcontractor, turning out Navy training films, such as informational ones about boiler-room operations on battleships, maintenance of submarine engines, or the handling of PT boats. This proved extremely lucrative for the company at the same time as it built up contacts, prestige, and goodwill for business after the armistice.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, the Calvin firm was a fixture in Kansas City and known as a brand name of merit across the country.</p>

<p>[Ernestina, Queensland]</p>
<p>Ernestina, Queensland, seems to have been situated between Jundah (but well to the north -- beyond Stonehenge) and Longreach in the Outer Barcoo. At one time, there was a mail coach running between Ernestina and Jundah (probably between Longreach and Jundah via Ernestina). I would very much like to learn more about the history of Ernestina and specifically when the place was first settled. Apparently the settlement no longer exists.</p>

<p>Along with Jam-Handy, Wilding, and others, the Calvin Company was one of the major industrial film companies in the United States. For nearly half a century it dominated the field in terms of quantity as well as quality. Calvin handled many accounts of the Fortune 500---such companies as Du Pont, Goodyear, Caterpillar, and General Mills. It pioneered the use of 16mm sound technology, of new Kodak processing methods, and of 8mm film. It won more than its share of accolades at trade festivals. It held nationwide sales and training seminars that attracted a who's who of business. Whatever paid, it made---government films, commercials, educationals, industrials, documentaries, and every variety of short subject.</p>
<p>It happened to be headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, because a married couple with energy and enterprise, F. O. Calvin and Betty Calvin, were residents there, and operating an advertising agency during the time America was mucking its way through the Depression and American movies were just beginning to talk.</p>
<p>Betty Calvin managed the business side; F. O. Calvin was the salesman. Together they had the idea of investing in the future of 16mm films as an in-house advertising and promotional tool. The third member of the Calvin leadership was Lloyd Thompson, F. O. Calvin's onetime University of Kansas fraternity brother, and a graduate, as so many of the Calvin higher-ups were, in journalism. Thompson and the Calvins raised the capital and in 1931 began production on a modest scale, taking advantage of Kansas City's proximity to locations, industry, and commerce. They were good at selling the Calvin concept, and they signed up accounts that would stay with the company for three decades.</p>
<p>They took other people's bad, amateurish films and fixed them up so they were serviceable. They made their own movies from scratch---short, inexpensive ones in the studio as well as long, big-budget ones on location in other time zones. They went further: They held entrepreneurial conferences and gave advice on how to use the 16mm medium. They also began to manufacture some equipment and boasted an excellent processing laboratory.</p>
<p>In 1935, Calvin produced their first sound film. In 1938, they produced the first industrial film in full sound and full color. In 1940, F. O. Calvin formed the Movie-Mite Corp, a subsidiary that manufactured motion picture projectors and other equipment. Movie-Mite gained prominence through a national award for the use of plastics and manufactured the first desk-sized projector. Hundreds of thousands of Movie-Mite projectors were sold during the 1940s.</p>
<p>World War II proved a gold mine for the Calvin company. F. O. Calvin was a dollar-a-year man for the Navy in Washington, D.C., where he advised on the running of a filmmaking system similar to the Calvin Company's. The Navy wanted Calvin to move his operations to D.C., but F.O. resisted, and the Calvin personnel remained in Kansas City. In effect, Calvin became a military subcontractor, turning out Navy training films, such as informational ones about boiler-room operations on battleships, maintenance of submarine engines, or the handling of PT boats. This proved extremely lucrative for the company at the same time as it built up contacts, prestige, and goodwill for business after the armistice.</p>
<p>By 1947, film equipment that was hard to come by during Calvin's first years of existence were now quite common in the industry thanks to World War II, and F.O. Calvin sensed that this could be a major industry problem. So, the Calvin Company began sponsoring annual "Calvin Workshops" in Kansas City, held to help orient, educate, and improve the work of nontheatrical filmmakers. This workshop attracted over 250 producers and technicians from all over the country every year. Films were produced specially for these workshops by the Calvin people, including "Your Name Here," an intentionally amusing spoof of the generic corporate industrial film that has now gained a devoted cult following thanks to its inclusion on Rick Prelinger's Internet Archive. These films document the culture and consciousness of this industry, about which little has been written.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, the Calvin firm was a fixture in Kansas City and known as a brand name of merit across the country. And the business of making films for businesses was booming. "Calvin turns out 18 million feet of film a year, or enough to make one 16-millimeter strip stretching from Key West to Seattle and part way back," reported one contemporary local newspaper.</p>
<p>The Calvin building was an impressive one. The old New Center Building at Fifteenth and Troost in Kansas City, just east of downtown, had been erected by Robert Altman's grandfather, Frank G. Altman Sr., back in 1907. Frank Sr. had made the mistake of presuming the downtown would spread eastward, which it never did. Consequently, it was one of the few high-rises in the area with plenty of space for a regular staff of two hundred.</p>
<p>The first floor held a magnificent sound stage, 80 by 100 feet with a 30-foot ceiling, converted from the former New Center theatre. The second floor held offices for directors and writers, plus a recording studio. The third and fourth floors were given over to the craft departments---the laboratory, processing, which accounted for at least half of Calvins' income, and printing. The fifth floor held the executive offices. Sixth floor was animation. Seventh floor was the Movie-Mite Corp.</p>
<p>Calvin was also an important venue for the Kansas City arts, employing local acting talent as well as former local bigwigs such as Harry Truman and Walter Cronkite. The Calvin Company was also "home" to every film student and filmmaker in the area for more than 40 years, and many of these local filmmakers and actors went on to have successful careers in Hollywood. Calvin served as the training ground for feature film director Robert Altman, a Kansas City native who also made his first feature film, "The Delinquents," in Kansas City. Prolific television directors Richard Sarafian and Reza Badiyi also got their start at Calvin in the 1950s, as did radio broadcaster turned actor Dick Peabody, the laconic character actor Owen Bush, and Al Christy, an ex-Kansas City insurance man who later became a character actor in California as well. In the 1960s, writer Angelo Bongino, animation artist Richard Corben, and director John Altman got their starts at Calvin, too.</p>
<p>In 1951, Calvin was the first firm licensed by Eastman Kodak to process Kodak's color film. In the mid-1950s, Calvin pioneered the use of 8mm film as well. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Calvin pioneered the use of films in the classroom, and engaged in a pioneering association with the University of Kansas City as Calvin and the university collaborated on educational films for school classrooms, including a widely utilized series on biology in the early Sixties.</p>
<p>It was too good to last, and it didn't. The Calvin organization came under new management in the mid-1950s, and business began to decline thereafter. By the late Sixties, the production staff had been cut drastically. Studios in Louisville, Pittsburgh, and Detroit were sold. Longtime accounts drifted away. Finally, there was only the Calvin operations in Kansas City, where it had all begun, and in the 1980s the company formally dissolved. The seven-story building built by Robert Altman's grandfather at the corner of Truman and Troost stood empty and shimmering. There were newspapers and empty paper cups next to the editing machines, as if people had gotten up and left for a cigarette break.</p>
