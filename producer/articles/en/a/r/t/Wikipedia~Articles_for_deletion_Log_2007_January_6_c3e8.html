<p>Originally prod'ded by myself, de-prod'ed by author. I'm really not sure what this is supposed to be, but it read (and still reads) like the introduction to a seminar on the topic, and never really addresses what the title of the article is supposed to mean. While it has references, all the article does is ask a lot of questions. This is not an encyclopedia article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - The article has been around for about a month and is not a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. A prod to improve the article was met with deletion of the prod rather than improvement of the article. This was not corrected by anyone with an interest in improving the article, which tells me that there is not enough interest in improving the article. Also, the article is headed in the wrong direction since the one reference cited in the article is misleading as it does not support the text to which it is linked. Further, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> requirement requires that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. My own search revealed that there does not exist enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about AAPLAC.

<li><b>Question</b> I know little of this denomination's organization. I get the impression that she is in some way the chief minister for Minnesota. Is a "Conference Minister" something that should be considered analagous to a bishop in other denominations, and if so, is that, in itself sufficient notability? The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conferences_of_the_United_Church_of_Christ_4921.html" title="Conferences of the United Church of Christ">Conferences of the United Church of Christ</a> article has no wikilinks on any name but hers. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know about the relative status of the position, but the fact that she is the only such person with an article, and that the article was created/edited only by Nasellers (<a href="../../../n/a/s/User_talk%7ENasellers_b531.html" title="User talk:Nasellers">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nasellers_08a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nasellers">contribs</a>) (similar surname) makes this seem even more like an <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> violation. --<a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimZalaBim_b724.html" title="User:ZimZalaBim">ZimZalaBim</a> (<a href="../../../z/i/m/User_talk%7EZimZalaBim_f21c.html" title="User talk:ZimZalaBim">talk</a>) 23:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I am not a member of this faith but based upon a visit to their website, firmly believe she has notability as <b>the</b> Conference Minister which would make her akin a bishop. Its companion article, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conferences_of_the_United_Church_of_Christ_4921.html" title="Conferences of the United Church of Christ">Conferences of the United Church of Christ</a> lists over 20 CotUCoC conferences across the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would chime in a hearty "keep" vote if sources could be shown that a couple Heritage guitars have been reviewed in something like <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustic_Guitar_%28magazine%29_2b9c.html" title="Acoustic Guitar (magazine)">Acoustic Guitar (magazine)</a> or <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar_Player_2e10.html" title="Guitar Player">Guitar Player Magazine</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is quite likely that such reviews exist (though not in Acoustic Guitar, as Heritage exclusively or mostly makes electrics, I believe). I will contact the guitarists wikiproject to see if any reviews can be found. However, I do believe that the book coverage of the company is sufficient to establish that this company has been noted. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 16:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Does not seem to be notable enough. The only commentary on the company that I've found so far is all on sites that sell Heritage Guitars, and the comments are very similar to each other, probably based on material supplied by the company. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 15:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Notability is not determined by online sources alone. The company has receieved nontrivial coverage by at least two books unaffiliated with the company (those are just what I found on my own bookshelf--other sources are likely out there). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 16:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have access to those books. They may indeed be reliable sources about the company, but that does not establish notability either. Judging from the titles, both books are about guitars (or electric guitars) in general, and mention in such books does not establish notability. I would be more impressed with a substantial published source (book, feature article in a general-interest magazine or well-established music/guitar magazine, etc.) discussing the company in particular. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 16:43, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think you're setting the bar pretty high for notability. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> states that "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." The two books now cited provide such coverage of the company. That the books are not <i>entirely</i> dedicated to covering the company does not make the coverage trivial. The coverage is more than a mention--the Bacon book provides several historical details about the company's founding, while the Freeth &amp; Alexander book dedicates a two-page spread to the company. I don't see how it is a mark against notability that the company is mentioned in books about guitars. What better place to find information about a guitar-making company than in a book about guitars? I am certain that coverage of the company can be found in well-established music or guitar magazines, but do not have access to such. I have made a request of WikiProject Guitarists to find such coverage. In the meantime, I think that the two book sources provide sufficient reason to keep the article. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 17:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - not to split hairs, but "two" does not equal "multiple". If something is notable enough to be included in WP, it will have been the subject of <i>multiple</i> non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: My dictionaries differ on this. The American Heritage says <i>multiple</i> means more than one, while the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary equates <i>multiple</i> with <i>several</i>, which means more than two. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 21:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have withheld a vote awaiting to see if I could verify the two book sources but I just cannot get hold of them quickly. Therefore, based upon available reviews of the books, I am confident we can assume good faith that the authors of this page have represented the contents of the books accurately and that the current sources in the article are substantial enough to establish notability. I still think further sources can be found; but as a musician I know that laying one's hands on archives of periodicals like <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar_Player_Magazine_4707.html" title="Guitar Player Magazine">Guitar Player Magazine</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician_%28magazine%29.html" title="Musician (magazine)">Musician (magazine)</a> where further sources can be found is a truly daunting and time-consuming task, that usually requires the researcher to travel a significant distance to the archive site. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 10:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Photographer whose main (perhaps only?) claim to notability is tastefully photographing his improbably curvacious girlfriend (who also has a WP article: <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Beauchamp_cd39.html" title="Bianca Beauchamp">Bianca Beauchamp</a>) in latex or bikinis or whatever for magazines of the kinds that I suppose come sealed in cellophane (no evidence supplied) and websites. Mentions of and links to the latter abound. No independent verification is supplied (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) for anything but the websites, there's no hint of notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the article (the interests of whose contributors seem limited to Perreault and Beauchamp) has a whiff of promotion about it. <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>REPLY TO THE ABOVE: This profile is as valid as any other. The above statement is pure discrimination against the work that I do.</p>
<p>My credentials can be easily verified online. A simple search on Google with my name will show articles about my work (notably from eros-zine online) and more searches will show LOTS about model Bianca Beauchamp, who is internationally known. Evidence is supplied many times, on both profiles. Googling any of the two names will provide anyone with more than enough information on the validity of these profiles. Further more, a list of all publications I have done can be found here: <a href="http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html" class="external free" title="http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html</a> . Each editor can be contacted to verify my credentials. Yes, I do shoot my "curvacious girlfriend". An article about someone should not be deleted on the simple fact that a viewer dislikes the art produced by the artist(s). A forum full of people who know about my work can be found here: <a href="http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com" class="external free" title="http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com" rel="nofollow">http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com</a> . This profile is not about self promotion. Fans started this page and I help them fix it with correct details. The same aplpies for profile Bianca Beauchamp, to which I only started contributing lightly very recently, even though her profile has existed for over 2 years. My involvement to both profiles is only to make sure of the validity of the information posted. For example, images users have posted on these two profiles were deleted due to copyright infringement; but by posting the same pictures myself, and by adding the information that I shot them, it makes them legit. The simple fact that my username on Wikipedia is the same as my real name shows that I do not hide behind a false name, like others might do to self promote. My involvement is to make sure the information posted is accurate. I can be contacted on my website www.martinperreault.com or on model BiancaBeauchamp.com website. I invite anyone here to contact the editors of the following magazines to verify the above information: Bizarre Magazine (UK) www.bizarremag.com to which I shot their covers 5 times in 2 years; Skin Two Magazine (UK) www.skintwo.com to which I shot their cover 2 times and featured in them many times. Marquis Magazine (www.marquis.de) for which I shot their cover 2 times in two years, _ many features. Penthouse Australia for which I shot their cover feature last year. Playboy Enterprise (www.playboyse.com) for which I shot a feature in Playboy SE in 2006 with model Bianca Beauchamp (who appeared many times in Playboy SE and on their cover of the Lingerie Edition). I think this should be more than enough to prove the validity of this profile. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinperreault_8633.html" title="User:Martinperreault">Martin Perreault - www.martinperreault.com</a> 04:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article doesn't assert as to why he's notable, and appears to be somewhat autobiographical - possible POV issues, as it were. Excellent photography, though - but as has been demonstrated so many times, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a> is not a good reason to keep.

<li><b>Comment/response</b>: <i>An article about someone should not be deleted on the simple fact that a viewer dislikes the art produced by the artist(s).</i> Strong agreement! And two comments. First, the visual evidence presented here shows that Perreault has a fine sense of light and how to use it; he seems to be an excellent photographer and my guess, fwiw, is that he'll go far. I hope he does. Secondly, while latex doesn't happen to be my thing, I've nothing against photos of pneumatic girls in bikinis, especially when the bikinis are much too small. So as it happens I don't dislike the art. ¶ However, this doesn't (yet) add up to notability or verifiability. It's unusual, to say the least, to say that verification can and should be sought by direct appeal to publishers. For other photographers, the verification is out there on independent, credible websites, in published books, etc. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These aren't "profiles" but "articles", and if there are perceptions that this is anything like myspace or the like than that is certainly incorrect. That being said, while the sources stated <i>may</i> be able to provide validation (although we'll need to cite sources that are accessible to a reader though, as far as I know); I don't believe those are enough to provide notability? Simply being the fact that you were a part of these things doesn't mean you are notable, and while you can personally verify a lot of information, it needs to be verifiable through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party sources</a>. I haven't looked enough at the topic to know if that is possible, but if it is, and it is accomplished, I would have no objection to the article, as it is now, it needs to assert notability and verifiably prove statements. 66.159.174.217 05:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Martin Perreault might not be (yet) a worldwide celebrity, but he’s definitely a world known and one of the most appreciated photographers in a certain (fetish) subculture. To address the issues mentioned above:<br />
<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party sources</a>:With time I believe Wikipedia have grown from a pure scientific encyclopedia to something bigger. There are many articles about politics, art and other fields of human existence, where a reliable source is not as clearly defined as in the guideline targeting mainly science. Still the mentioned magazines and e-magazines – repeated publishing inside them and even being author of several of their covers, so as covers of several books, that all IMHO is a good sign of notability. Another sign of notability should be that several other world famous fetish models worked with Martin Perrault and they include his work in their portfolio. (The links to Internet incarnations of some of the mentioned magazines and models: <a href="http://www.skintwo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.skintwo.com/" rel="nofollow">Skin Two</a>, <a href="http://www.marquis.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.marquis.com/" rel="nofollow">Marquis</a>, <a href="http://www.playboy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.playboy.com/" rel="nofollow">Playboy</a>, <a href="http://www.bizarremag.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bizarremag.com/" rel="nofollow">Bizarre Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.penthouse.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.penthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Penthouse</a>, <a href="http://www.juliestrain.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.juliestrain.com/" rel="nofollow">Julie Strain</a>, <a href="http://www.rubberella.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.rubberella.com/" rel="nofollow">Jean Bardot</a>,<a href="http://www.emilymarilyn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.emilymarilyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Emily Marilyn</a>, <a href="http://www.darenzia.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.darenzia.net/" rel="nofollow">Darenzia</a>, <a href="http://www.tempestnyc.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.tempestnyc.com/" rel="nofollow">Storm</a>, <a href="http://www.suzanwayland.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.suzanwayland.com/" rel="nofollow">Sway</a>, <a href="http://www.masuimimax.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.masuimimax.com/" rel="nofollow">Masuimi Max</a>).<br />
<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>): Isn’t this a catch XXII a little – especially in case of an article about a person. It’s not correct to write a biography about a person until somebody writes a biography about the person. Still in several articles about and/or interviews with him I read his short bio – if it’s enough.<br />
The fact that Martin Perrault contributes to the article himself was addressed already but allow me to repeat it. If you observe his edits, you will notice they serve to accurate some information and to ensure the legal use of photos. Does it fall under <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> – I would say not.<br />
IchiAi being a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> is not true. I know the person, so I can assure you –as far as you will believe me - he contributed to several articles, but created his account only when decided to write a completely new entry to Wikipedia. And something very similar applies to me. Naturally we edit only what is in the field of our interest.<br />
Using word "profile" instead "article": not everybody is a native speaker and/or everyday contributor to Wikipedia (like me for example). Then it can easily happen such person don’t use a best expression.<br />
And a final note to <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a>: Even tough you tell you are not against this kind of photography some of your words in the first paragraph hints otherwise. Why that personal and disparage remarks? <i>.... posted by <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikapt_6c0a.html" title="User:Rikapt">Rikapt</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rikapt_a40c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rikapt">contributions</a>), who didn't sign</i></li>

<li>(i) <i>The links to Internet incarnations of some of the mentioned magazines and models</i>: Links to the websites of the magazines prove nothing. What might be interesting would be links to specific pages on those websites in which Perreault is described as the photographer of this or that. But note <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> on notable photographers: "Published [...] photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work."

(iii)&#160;<i>Why that personal and disparage remarks?</i> What's at issue here is not me but the article. But OK, I'll bite: How were my remarks disparaging?

(i) Such content you required is in payed zone so it can't be linked directly. Does it not count then? And how to prove the appearance in paper versions of the magazines you don't know?<br />
(iii)I am aware it's of lesser or no importance in the issue. Still somebody pointed out Martin to react in <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> way, so maybe he failed to notice your initial style might have initiate that reaction.

<li><b>Keep</b> Martin Perreault is an accomplished photographer and his work impacts not only the fetish world, but the world of, say, gamers - as it was his photography and work with Bianca that allowed her to become the "living model" of Elexis Sinclair in promotion of Ritual's "Sin Episodes" game series. I believe his work has significance and he has credibility and esteem enough to warrant a wiki article, which is why I started an account, so I could add this article. I have been an anonymous contributor to Wiki for some time, and I am a little annoyed that simply because I was required to start an account in order to create a new article, it is assumed that I have not contributed before. Is it not clear from the layout of the page (there was help from others - this too, is evidence that Mr. Perreault has a fan following and deserves a Wiki page) that this is a serious attempt to start an informative, biographical article? How much space does this take from Wiki? Any move against this article is, to my mind, simply puritanical cleansing and censorship. Please reconsider. IchiAi 17:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as it shows no independent verification of the details. It also fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as the <i>only</i> references are to the sites maintained by Bianca Beauchamp and Mr. Perreault (and many of the details of Beauchamp's site require paid registration). Moreover, the article does not demonstrate a claim for notability, only a hallow claim that he is "an accomplished photographer (although I agree, the article does not demonstrate) . . . best known for his work with long time professional and personal partner, Bianca Beauchamp." As an aside (because this is not a fatal flaw), the article reads very much like an autobiography, full of details of interest primarily to one's self and, perhaps, one's mother. ["Perreault was excited by the fabric, but Bianca was a bit nervous about it. As a way of overcoming her fear and showing her affection for Perreault, she purchased the dress in secret and surprised him at a Halloween party. Eventually she posed for him for fun, wearing the latex dress. Although she was nervous at first, Beauchamp quickly came out of her shell and warmed up to the camera."] Delete and when Perreault does meet the standards by accumulating verifiable professional accolades by others, the article can be recreated. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 20:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I will not deny the article about M. Perreault needs work, but no article is born perfect. Deleting it at this poing would be overly draconian. M. Perrault has also been inteviewed about his work in more mainstream media, including French and English Canadian TV chanels - Perhaps these should be added as references to the article. --<a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObserver31_3157.html" title="User:Observer31">Observer31</a> 19:18, 6 January 2007 (EST)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> I see this argument here -- other articles are not notable, so why not let this one pass -- and must say that it is not persuasive to me. Following it to the natural conclusion would be a lowering of Wiki standards for all articles. Or perhaps you are suggesting that we just lower standards for Fetish Photographers? Rather than agreeing to lower standards, I would prefer to work on rooting out the articles that you think are less" well supported than this one."</li>

<li>I disagree, an artist who achieves mass penetration with his works is notable regardless of the field. I did point out that this is an opinion. A magazine is a third party source, the titles mentioned a notable ones. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 04:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Magazines have different covers every month created by literally hundreds of thousands of commercial photographers, some are notable some are not. Wiki policy on photographers notability is as follows: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work"(are considered notable). As far as I can tell no reputable reviews or awards can be cited. Just as an example I read the English car magazine <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evo.html" title="Evo">evo</a> they have 10-15 contributing photographers who have done covers none have Wikipedia articles because they are not notable just as Perreault is not. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li>That argument is a bit weak - Evo is a magazine about cars, not a magazine about car photography. Having one's photos on the cover of Skin Two is, within that field, a much greater achievement.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to state, for the record, that I am not a "sock puppet", nor is Observer or Rikapt. MartinPerreault is indeed the same man the article is about, and he has edited it to correct some small details about his life. Has it ever occured to anyone that perhaps casual wiki readers/anonymous contributors, when they see an article that is about someone whose work they admire marked for deletion, might come out of the woodwork, so to be speak, in order to speak out against it? I find this whole thing ridiculous and a bit disheartening, as I have been an avid supporter and reader of Wikipedia for years.IchiAi 04:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I understand the importance of being careful with inclusion of articles on Wikipedia being a project about archiving knowledge and information. I would like to clarify a few things: I am not posting under multiple usernames like some above have been implying. I know how "first time posters" make it look like that. These first time posters are people that follow Bianca Beauchamp's career on her website. I am very much present on these websites, being that I do all the photography there and more. So these people are very much aware of my work, and notability in the fetish scene worldwide. The article was started by one of them as a matter of fact, which also explains the reason why I came here myself to make minor modifications to the article because some details were wrong. I understand how this may look to many. Further more, as if this didn't look bad enough, one of our server is down at the moment due to a DOS ATTACK. So biancabeauchamp.com and martinperreault.com are have been down for 24 hours and as I write this, they still are down. Sure enough, some might see this as a sign that we are phony. Personally, I question the very odd timing as well for such an attack, but for other reasons. That said, I can certainly only state once more that this whole Wikipedia Article was done with good intention and is not a promo scheme. I understand there are ways and guidelines to follow at Wikipedia, and I am certain they were created to make sure Wikipedia remains a reliable source of information. Therefore, I leave it up to the Wikipedia contributors to make the final decision, and to look at the situation factually and not through eyes of suspicion. I would like to take this opportunity to publically thank the original contributor who started this article. I think you did a very good job and I am honored you thought important to contribute my name to the online encyclopedia.

<dd>In summary, he does appear to be known within his realm, but the reliability of many sources is not sufficiently strong. Although there have been hits about him even in German, a lot of the detail in the article is very personal, and fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. My "week keep" vote change above is sustained by the articles in Fleshbot, Eros.com. We seem to be dredging the bottom of all available links to find articles to properly assert notability, and two articles does not equal "multiple" per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>I agree with Ohconfucius for the most part. The article will probably end up being kept because it is unlikely a delete consensus will be reached as the subject is near the very edge of notablity (IMO on the wrong side of it), but if that is the case it will need clean up to lessen the promotional tone and do away with information coming from autobiographical sources. If it were up to me I would <b>merge</b> with the Beauchamp article a section mentioning her primary photographer is all that is really necessary as there arn't really any good sources for the additional information. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>This isn't about proving that Perreault exists or that he is a photographer, I think we all agree on those points. But there is no link to any article in Marquis, and the article in Skin Two says nothing of significance about him: he is a photographer, he shot 10 pages for the magazine, he was in Los Angeles. How is that notable? If you read a random sample of Wikipedia articles on other photographers to get a better idea of what makes a photographer notable. Here's a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_photographers.html" title="List of photographers">list of photographers</a> to help.<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 18:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The issue here is not the subject matter of the photography, nor the subject matter or context of the few references/links provided, but rather that when you boil the article down to its facts we know only that a fetish/pin-up photographer named Martin Perreault was born in Montreal, possibly studied at Concordia University, has mostly photographed 1 model, has created two websites, and once hosted a fetish ball. How does that information suggest that Perreault is more notable than any of literally millions of photographers or artists around the world? Surely every editor on this page knows first-hand at least a few people with similarly illustrious CVs. I don't believe it's Wikipedia policy but it is common sense that the burden of proof for notablility ought to be on the editors <i>proposing</i> an article for inclusion and not on those who argue for deletion. People like Nan Goldin, Weegee and Robert Mapplethorpe have all photographed subjects belonging to various subcultures (usually with far more scandalous imagery than any of Perreault's images I've looked at) and they are included in Wikipedia because they have been exhibited, books and articles examinging their work have been published, and they have an easily traceable influence on society. The sources cited for Perreault, on the other hand, provide virtually no substantial information, certainly nothing to suggest that he is worthy of an article in a serious encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 17:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pretty much my opinion as well. Now, if any of these fetish magazines had published articles about him or interviews, I'd consider him a notable person within the fetish community - and I know they do publish such articles. Right now, I'd say the time for an article on him has not yet come, if nothing else because there are no good third party sources that say anything significant about him. So far, if anyone's notable, it's his model - she at least gets the recognisability of having been on these magazine covers. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 06:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Pinkville. There simply isn't anything to suggest he is of encyclopaedic notability. GassyGuy 21:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why such oversimplification of M.Pereault's (MP) appearances in the magazines? It's not true he has appeared in magazines only once or twice. As I mentioned at the beginning of the list I included only the referenced material I have access to and also the most notable ones (e.g. covers) and skipped the almost regular feature appearance in them. Secondly, listing more influential photographers to be the reason why MP should not have an article is weird. (Does the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> has an article mean <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Penrose_86ab.html" title="Roger Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> can't have it? Hardly.) The argument MP lacks awards is also weak simply because there are no such awards in fetish photography. So to enrich the list of reference (either by new ones or by adding extended information):<br />
&#160;* A photographer being included in the Fetish Anthology 4 (the last edition) book needs a great degree of notability. Being it a selection of few best artists in the genre is far from trivial<br />
&#160;* In the last issue of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_%28magazine%29.html" title="Marquis (magazine)">Marquis magazine</a> (#40) a (positive) review of the book MP created and published together with his muse <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Beauchamp_cd39.html" title="Bianca Beauchamp">Bianca Beauchamp</a> can be found<br />
&#160;* <a href="http://www.secretmag.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.secretmag.com/" rel="nofollow">Secret magazine</a> ( another fetish magazine, distributed worldwide) brings a color portfolio of MP’s photography. Quote from their webpage (first sentence): <i>Secret Issue #30 has a special color portfolio with Martin Perreault and fetish star/model "Bianca"</i><br />
&#160;* Two leading latex fashion producing companies, Vex and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphe.html" title="Polymorphe">Polymorphe</a> chose MP's work to advertise their creations<br />
The whole latex fashion phenomenon is recently going mainstream. It influences game industry, music, movies, generally all pop-culture, but even haute-couture fashion. We are trying to show you Martin Perreault and his photography, of course in close collaboration with his muse and life partner Bianca, have a strong influence to the fetish movement in recent years and are its trendsetters. They created one of the very first fetish websites. And although there are many other fetish photographers, MP helped develop the "glamour" side of fetish, apart from the classic BDSM art. For that reasons he (also) deserves an article on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikapt_6c0a.html" title="User:Rikapt">Rikapt</a> 12:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The claims you make here for Perreault's influence may be true, but you have not provided any evidence to support them. This is the first mention of a book by him... does it have a title? Is it readily available? so his photos have appeared in various magazines... that's fine but not in itself notable. There are thousands of stock photographers, thousands of perfectly competent or even excellent photographers whose work appears in magazines, yet who aren't notable in any sense that's meaningful for an encyclopaedia. You didn't like the comparison between Perreault and Goldin, Mapplethorpe and Weegee (though I hardly think your Einstein and Penrose comparison is analogous), well how about comparing <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesca_Woodman_89f9.html" title="Francesca Woodman">Francesca Woodman</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Veltri_15a4.html" title="John Veltri">John Veltri</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Scavullo_8ee7.html" title="Francesco Scavullo">Francesco Scavullo</a> with Perreault? Such comparisons are indeed apt, because the photographers I've mentioned <i>do</i> satisfy the criteria for notability, they constitute a basis to judge others. Let's take up your Einstein/Penrose comparison. First, Penrose is a hugely important physicist, so the ostensible contrast in notability between him and Eisntein doesn't actually exist. A more appropriate contrast would be between either Einstein or Penrose and a graduate student in physics. The latter may someday become a great physicist in her/his own right, but at the moment they're just building up a CV. If/when anything sustantive is written about Perreault's photography then a Wikipedia article will be appropriate, but not now. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 15:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your comparison to a "graduate student" is inept - Mr. Perreault is already famous in his field and quite accomplished - he is by no means "starting out" in his career.

<dd>A shame? Frankly, that's a bizarre comment. Every article in Wikipedia is supposed to "dump a list of credentials" to support the subject's claim to notability. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 19:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Credential do not always add up to notablity. All this list really shows is that Perreault is a moderately successful fetish photographer. Many many comercial photographers could post lists many times longer then this one without establishing any notablity. The only things that I can see on this list that might take a step towards being good sources are the two interviews but being the subject of a grand total of three pages of independent material doesn't do much for me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>I think the evidence presented is compelling.

<dd>Of course there are plenty. I list several commercial photographers among my acquaintances. As far as I know they have never sought articles in Wikipedia and it hasn't crossed my mind to make articles for them. This is no criticism of them as photographers or as people: they're excellent photographers and good people. They have much longer lists; and lists that tend to be more varied, though it's true that commercial photographers tend to concentrate on certain areas (cars, interiors, etc.; one of the trickiest is visually compelling piping hot food, from which [genuine!] steam must rise according to popular expectations if not normal reality). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:50, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't really answer my question, I haven't been swayed by any arguments presented here. Four of the magazines in which he has contributed I could buy in my local newsagent off the shelf, his work has clearly been seen by an awful lot of people. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 01:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because many people have seen his work does not make him notable. In order to meet the notablity criteria we need multiple reputable sources asserting his notablity (ie articles about him), as it stands now all we really have is a list of times his photos have appeared in magazines, I want go back to my evo magazine example from above, many of the photographers who contribute to this magazine have much longer resumes, but since non of them have been written about (to my knowledge)none are notable, when some people write articles about Perreault then he can be included, until then he is just another comercial photographer. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

As far as the Evo magazine argument, please see my reply to your prior comment above <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObserver31_3157.html" title="User:Observer31">Observer31</a> 22:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A review of a book by Perreault is a step in the right direction, as for the evo comparison I think it is valid, it is a magazine about cars, the magazines represented above are about fetishs. In both cases the photographer is seprate from the subject and is thus not notable merely for having there photographs on the cover of a magazine. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<p>One notability criterion shared by nearly all of the subject-specific notability guidelines, as well as Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not1, is the criterion that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> because, at the moment, the article's only sources are the party's own site &amp; publication, so notability isn't established, and I think it's fair to say that not every splinter party in the U.S. needs a Wikipedia article.

<p>Prod tag removed, so bringing for consideration here. Similar to the now-deleted Winston Olde English Bulldogge and the still under consideration <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Olde_English_Bulldogge_720d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Olde English Bulldogge">Olde English Bulldogge</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_British_Bulldogge_c639.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/British Bulldogge">British Bulldogge</a>, this is a rather obscure sub-breed of the bulldog that appears to be produced by a single breeder. I get about 560 Google hits for Wilkinson Bulldog, many of them similar to one another and likely submitted to various pages; the article itself states that the breed "appears to be gaining popularity," and is not recognized by a major kennel club. The editor who removed the PROD tag added a link to the Animal Research Foundation as an indication of notability. I frankly can't see this being a notable breed, and feel the article should be <b>delete</b>d (or possibly merged gently into the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldog.html" title="Bulldog">bulldog</a> article) unless someone else comes up with some solid sources. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 03:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Em? Surely that's the right thing to do. If anyone can advise us on the legitimacy of an article, it is going to be those interested in the relevant Wikiproject.

<li>The purpose of the message was to summon users to come and vote a certain way, and it was perceived as such by the recipients, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Keesiewonder&amp;diff=98787087&amp;oldid=98786836" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Keesiewonder&amp;diff=98787087&amp;oldid=98786836" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. In general, this is usually the reason for this sort of mass-messaging, and if spamming were necessary for the deletion process to function properly then every WikiProject should be notified anytime an article within its scope is deleted. That is not feasible and would skew the discussion (and it would be done on the <i>WikiProject</i> talk page, not spam to every participant). Anyone who has the article on his watchlist is already notified of the discussion, and the way to clarify the status of an article is not to ask people to come stack a vote, but to request people at the WikiProject talk page to find reliable sources. Anyway, this comment here is notice to the closing admin to understand what happened when suddenly a dozen users show up and make empty votes, and the {{afdanons}} notice was added at the top to inform those users, if they came, what exactly this is—that it is not some ballot manipulable by a partisan bloc as the mass message would make it seem. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 12:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Come on, everyone. <b>Please assume good faith. No personal attacks. Don't bite the newcomers.</b> If Headphonos is an old user disguised as an old user, no one has pointed that out to me, even though I've said many times the logs show Headphonos has been a user since <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. I can think for myself. I am not a puppet for Headphonos. In fact, if I had to say one way or another, putting words in his/her mouth, (which I should not do, and am not doing, but only providing an example,) I could even venture to say s/he may be sorry s/he contacted me about this topic in the first place. (i.e. I do not vote to keep all dog articles, only the ones that pass my research test.) From feedback I receive from people outside of bulldog debates, I gather that I am a relatively new yet fairly well respected editor. I do not own a bulldog, have never lived with a bulldog, do not like bulldogs, and never intend on having a bulldog. I am often quite good at conducting research. I feel this article should be deleted (maybe properly restored in the future, but currently deleted); I feel the one on Olde English Bulldogge should be kept. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 16:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I do not have the authority to tell them how to vote, I advised them of the process so they can participate. These people are the dog breed project participants and they are the best one's to consult. Surely you are not implying that they would vote to keep a dog breed that is not worthy of an article at Wikipedia. Take note that your template {{{afdanons}}} is referring to ANONymous canvassing, which I did not do. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadphonos_8530.html" title="User:Headphonos">Headphonos</a> 12:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am one of the editors who was informed of this discussion by the above editor and subsequently had that notice removed from my talk page, and I am thankful to him for informing me about this discussion. I regret to say that the sources indicated above do tend to be perhaps a bit less than we would like, as they do tend to uniformly seem to be basing their information on what they are supplied by the breeders themselves. However, verifiability can, and does, change over time, and so I would like to include the provision of reinstating the article if independent verification can be found. Also, I have notified another editor who seems to be better informed about rare breeds of this and the other discussions, and hope to hear from her soon. I reserve the right to change my opinion based on her input. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Strong Delete</b> - Personally, I have not found anything that convinces me about this bulldog - at least not yet. And, I am not the other editor about whom Badbilltucker refers above. I will pass through the article now, inserting {{fact}} where I would like to see a specific citation inserted. What I see in the 'See Also' and 'Reference List' is not adequate for my current discernment of verifiability. I'm looking for page numbers from specific journals or books that are published by major publishers. As I'm sure proponents of the article can understand, I want to tie the resources to the facts in the article. If the article should be kept, this should be a relatively easy task.

<dd>One of the external links on the article's page says the following: "The Original English Bulldogge came to North America in 1946 from the island Inchtavannach in Loch Loman, Scotland, where it had been in the Wilkinson family for generations." Source: <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/grimlea/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.shaw.ca/grimlea/history.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. We already have an article on several other bulldogs that cover the original English Bulldogge. (Please see my talk page at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Keesiewonder#List_of_Bulldog_Breeds_on_Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Keesiewonder#List_of_Bulldog_Breeds_on_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> where I am trying to sort through all the bulldog lineages.) Anyway, the sentence I quoted does not mean that there is a specific line of bulldogs called the Wilkinson Bulldog. It means, to me, that the Wilkinson family worked with a breed of dog called the Original English Bulldogge. If this particular line of dogs became noteworthy for some reason, please provide a complete (page numbers and all) reference that I can check. If proponents of the Wilkinson Bulldog cannot produce this, remember that we cannot have articles on all the other families who may have had bulldogs in or after 1946, such as Scott Bulldog, Smith Bulldog, Walter Bulldog, Brown Bulldog, Henry Bulldog, Phillips Bulldog, Lord Bulldog, etc. If the Wilkinson Bulldog is indeed noteworthy, like the Olde English Bulldogge is, then some good resources and complete citations should be forthcoming. Right? For the record, the Wilkinson Bulldog is not mentioned once in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0789461307/ref=s9_asin_image_1/103-2828077-2412610" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0789461307/ref=s9_asin_image_1/103-2828077-2412610" rel="nofollow">this</a> book.

<li><b>Delete</b> - As webmaster for the Original English Bulldogge site I see no reason for this article to be kept. As with many other articles on Wikipedia there definitely is not enough reference material to justify it. As for A.R.F., this registry was not even created originally as a dog registry. I think while you are looking at this article you should definitely look at the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crofton%2C_British_Columbia_42fa.html" title="Crofton, British Columbia">Crofton, British Columbia</a> article because, being the Archivist for the local museum, I know that most of this article came from one, small, minor publication and local knowledge.

<li>FWIW, I read Cowbonsai's input to mean 's/he was the webmaster for content focused on the Original English Bulldogge site.' We don't know whether as webmaster s/he was owner of or had an opinion on the dogs featured on the web site. S/he could have been hired as a webmaster to create a site for someone else who was a proponent of the Original English Bulldogge. A dog breed that we are not discussing here. We are discussing the Wilkinson Bulldog. From the information provided, Cowbonsai has not had anything to do with a website on the Wilkinson Bulldog. I trust Cowbonsai will correct my interpretation if I'm wrong. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 13:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Actually I didn't create a whole website about the Wilkinson Bulldog and that's the problem. To the best of my knowledge there isn't a Wilkinson Bulldog. Lolly Wilkinson's dogs was how the breed was referred to in "The Story Of the Real Bulldog" on page 81. The breed is registered as the Original English Bulldogge with A.R.F. and that is how Lolly Wilkinson refers to them. My site is the only website dedicated to the Original English Bulldogge and it is authorized by Lolly. There are two other authorized pages, one on Kaare Konradsen's MolosserWorld and the other on A.R.F.'s site. All other references to this breed have been ripped from my site or the other two pages. As to whether I'm me or not, I came to this thread because of an e-mail I got addressed to my contact address on the Original English Bulldogge site. The reason I don't care one way or the other about whether the Original English Bulldogge is on Wikipedia is because of what I can tell from this thread. It is very obvious that the intent is to turn the dog section into a mirror for the A.K.C.. That became very clear when they started talking about major or national registries. I really don't see why what registry a breed belongs to should be a deciding factor of whether a breed gets into Wikipedia or not. Cowbonsai 21:18, 8 January 2007</dd>
<dd>Exactly, it doesn't matter, but because of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiality#Wikiality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiality#Wikiality" rel="nofollow">Wikiality</a>] everybody and his dog has an opinion, ie. if it doesn't belong to a major kennel or the FCI, it shouldn't be in Wikipedia. That is what I call <a href="../../../o/c/h/Ochlocracy.html" title="Ochlocracy">ochlocracy</a>, the mob-rule&#160;! <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadphonos_8530.html" title="User:Headphonos">Headphonos</a> 22:14, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a member of the dog projects on WP, but am not the originator of them. Headphonos (and Cowbonsai), I have not ever said anything anywhere resembling this: "if it doesn't belong to a major kennel or the FCI, it shouldn't be in Wikipedia." I did suggest that Headphonos, and now anyone who is reading this, that if you have concerns about the dog projects, you should contact the projects directly. The response I received from Headphonos on this was that s/he was not interested in all the dog breeds, just certain ones ... and, I guess, with that reasoning, has chosen to not contact the dog projects. If you need me to provide links to my dialogs with Headphonos, I will. I do not feel that the dog projects are being portrayed accurately in this AfD. And, if there are concerns, if you do not raise them with the users who may be able to help, they cannot be addressed. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 23:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If the variation has merit, you may consider merging with another article, but I have to admit that I see little support or evidence for a separate breed, or even a distinct variant. I would also caution that Animal Research Foundation, or ARF, is not a viable source on breeds or even those entries it has registered. Their entry lists traits such as speech (the dogs say "Mumma"?), and eating from a spoon?

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I have no problem with this list (though perhaps it should be titled "List of US Navy slang), as many of the entries are not dicdefs at all, but somewhat well-developed short paragraphs. I only feel strongly enough to&#160;!vote "week keep" because the entries are not verified with citations; however, I'm still&#160;!voting keep because I'd assume that most of the entries are covered by all of the external links. In addition to keeping the article, I would urge a <b>trimming</b> to eliminate any and all unverifiable terms. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is very well referenced in terms of sources, and the result of a great deal of hard work. Ideally each entry would be footnoted to the sources, but this is not an enforced standard to which other WP articles are held, so why should this be singled out. It clearly goes beyond a dictionary as it is a collection of historic and contemporary slang not appropriate to a dictionary. It has potential as a valuable resource. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Prior to this discussion, it had been tagged with the standard prod. I removed the prod and offered to improve the article. Navy and all slang are more than just a dictionary. It reflects military heritage which is not often considered by civilians. And, it can be linked to other articles where the jargon is being used without really being known what it fully means and came from.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonbo76_af91.html" title="User talk:Ronbo76">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ronbo76_dcdd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ronbo76">contribs</a>) 17:53, January 6, 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>While I have the utmost respect for military personnel, a simple list of jargon is not encyclopedic. Perhaps articles could be created for individual terms, if they can be shown to be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, but the list itself really doesn't belong as a seperate Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What really disappoints me about where this article is linked to (<a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">military slang</a> is that no slang exists for the Air Force. I had a brother fly over Vietnam where Falcon Codes, a form of military slang, that evolved into <a href="../../../o/p/s/OPSEC_5ce0.html" title="OPSEC">OPSEC</a> because abbreviated code words were used that the enemy did not know. Kind of like discovering what some knowledgeable Marines developed with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windtalkers.html" title="Windtalkers">Windtalkers</a>. This is just a short history of military slang which goes back to our American Revolution and even when the second caveman raised a club. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 23:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ugh. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">Military slang</a> is a list of lists. That's not good. However, that sounds like a good project: rewrite that article to be about the history and use of military slang, rather than just a list of other articles that are, themselves, dictionary lists. I think such an article would be valuable to Wikipedia, more valuable than a simple dictionary list of the terms. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 23:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>With that rationale (and I am not attacking but posing a question), what about its overall category, Category:Military slang and jargon? We prune here; we might as attack the whole tree. (Please note: I am somewhat a new user here with six months experience; one as a registered contributor and do not know how to make the category show. There are 51 pages on that list.) <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 00:01, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It depends. Should be considered on an article-by-article basis. Some terms, like <a href="../../../a/w/o/AWOL_9edc.html" title="AWOL">AWOL</a> have become so well-known outside military circles they may warrant an article themselves. Others, not so much. It may be that the tree needs heavy pruning, to keep it healthy, but no need to kill it off. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 00:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment to all users in this discussion</b> Military slang is a topic that is huge. It isn't too big to be categorized, but it is tough. What I would suggest is a completely new template (not Wikipedia template, but rather writing outline) for this slang page. Maybe having slang listed by war or by first usage (those that were developed long ago but are still in use could be listed under contemporary). <b><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharkface217_f705.html" title="User:Sharkface217"><span style="background:black;color:red">S h a r k</span></a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharkface217_3b64.html" title="User talk:Sharkface217"><span style="background:black;color:red">f a c e</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sharkface217_34e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sharkface217"><span style="background:black;color:red">2 1 7</span></a></b> 01:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have misunderstood policy. If an article lacks verification, then you should seek to verify it - or mark it as {{unverified}} that another might seek to do so. We only delete articles if they are unverifiABLE, that is they CANNOT be verified. Sure this article may currently be unverifiED, and is a concern we need to fix - but not by deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - As the author of <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbury_Plaza_714d.html" title="Asbury Plaza">Asbury Plaza</a> and a local living 1 mile away, I can say that Asbury Plaza is notable in that it has had an enormous impact on the local economy. It is the largest shopping center in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubuque%2C_Iowa_2ac1.html" title="Dubuque, Iowa">Dubuque</a>, a city of significant regional and historical importance, and is a fine example of major changes taking place in the city. Also, the center itself is merely one part of a much larger commercial expansion in its neighborhood, much of which is only recent, and has yet to be documented. (Example: Sam's Club in Dubuque opens next wk, yet is unlisted on their own website) As Asbury Plaza is a "power center" and not a traditional enclosed shopping mall, these types of complexes tend not to have significant press since they are generally much smaller than A.P. Also, contradicting <a href="http://www.nrbonline.com/IndustryInfo/StateTopTen/State.aspx?id=IA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nrbonline.com/IndustryInfo/StateTopTen/State.aspx?id=IA" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, which says that A.P. is not actively under construction, I can say fairly that this is untrue as well. Last week, another announcement came that a 100,000+ sq. ft. building will be built this year at A.P., likely placing it &gt;1 mil. sq. ft. if it is not there already. <a href="../../../d/b/q/User%7EDBQer_c935.html" title="User:DBQer">DBQer</a> 22:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As far as I can tell, it's just a big shopping center.

<li><b>Delete</b> First off, this doesn't meet any speedy keep criteria, so that's not even a valid option.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> CyberAnth, what exactly do you mean by that? The onus of proof is on the nomination, not on the people trying to fix and/or defend the articles. I am attempting to assume the best of your flood of very simular nominations, but it would be nice if we could work together to fix these articles before reaching for the delete blaster.

<p><b>Comment</b> - I am amazed at how people vote "Keep" in such apparent blatant disregard or ignorance of WP policies. The above "Speedy keep" vote by Johntex is particularly troubling. His vote may be in bad faith and worthy of an incident report because it evidences such apparent disregard or ignorance of plain WP policies. Admins should know much better and are held to a higher standard.</p>

Yeah, as a Brit I confirm that I always use the word 'nookie' where Americans would use 'fuck'.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a rather rambling and disjointed disambig. I have shortened the top entry to match the Wiktionary entry. Any elaboration on that needs to be sourced. Most of the other entries were not sourced here or in the articles they link to, and I have requested citations for them. Just because it's a disambig does not mean that WP:V gets thrown out the window. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a></b> 12:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Without all the pop culture mambo-jumbo, there is the dicdef, a song title, a puppet and a company name. The page now has simply those things. (I've also removed an entry for a possibly non-notable artist/deejay in the process, but is linked from other pages.)

<dd>"Deletion should be used immediately for libelous statements." The term "rice queen" is libel, it defames all people who unwillingly may be given such a description -- through no fault of their own. Sourced scholar work determines it to be offensive and undergoing an elimination. This could technically be a class-action suit based on preferences. Second, "rice queen" is a neologism and that has no place here in Wikipedia, it is an invented term, socially constructed, made up one day by some gay men. It is only the internet that has propagated a term, it has no formal grounds within communities other than evidence of racism. This term is not on par with established derogatory slurs such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">chink</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/g/Faggot.html" title="Faggot">faggot</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavumaya_fe7b.html" title="User:Davumaya">Davumaya</a> 00:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Guided by the Hall of Fame Standard, Sail America has selected 26 boats (in 2004) for induction into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame. These Hall of Fame boats are true American classics, exemplars of the extraordinary skill and ingenuity of American boat builders. They range in size from 8 to 41 feet. Several date to the dawn of the fiberglass era and are considered collector’s items; others are still in production, selling briskly. All have profoundly influenced the sport of sailing. By their sheer excellence, they have made sailing better.</i></li>

<dd>There is no conflict of interest here. I am the one who wrote this entry, not Ulmer, and I did it for the same reason. When preparing to teach a workshop to high school teachers about new media technologies, I turned to Wikipedia for a concise definition of the term and, when I didn't find one, I created the entry myself. This is supposed to be the purpose of the wiki form--collaborative encyclopedia composition. Shortly after creating the entry, I delivered a conference presentation <a href="http://www.masscue.org/conference/2006/6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masscue.org/conference/2006/6.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> with reference to the term and to the wikipedia entry. And I have recently had an essay accepted for publication in the organization's journal, on Cue <a href="http://www.masscue.org/publications/oncue.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masscue.org/publications/oncue.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, in its Winter 2007 issue (forthcoming), in which I reference the term and the wikipedia article as well. A google search on the term yields 22,000+ hits, yet there is no one place to get a concise definition of the term. That was my purpose in writing this entry. <a href="../../../r/s/m/User%7ERsmyth_8789.html" title="User:Rsmyth">Rsmyth</a> 20:30, 6 January 2007 (EST)</dd>

<li>The article disagrees with you. You say "It is not a neologism," but the first words of the article are "Electracy is a neologism...."

<li>With respect The Epopt, WP does not exclude neologisms. NEO clearly states that they can be included if they conform to the two policies of: <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable</a>. I personally have seen hundreds, if not thousands of neologisms in WP, it is impractical to say that any neologism should not be in WP.

<li>I want to add too, in case you didn't get my meaning The Epopt. I said the article was not a 'neologism' as per the qualities set out in the POL. Of course I read the article. Finicky 10:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep IF Edited</b>: I don't understand why the fact that it is a "neologism" is such a problem. "Blog" is a neologism but doesn't say that it is a neologism in the article. Should we remove "Blog" because it is a neologism? The article can easily be edited to remove the term neologism if that is the problem. Finicky's comment is not invalidated because she makes the point that it is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and it is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable</a>. Citations can be added to show that the term has been used by writers other than the author. The entry itself cites a source published by a reliable publisher as well as other scholarly work mentioning the term. For this reason, it is also "verifiable."

<li><b>Keep</b>: I agree that perhaps the article requires some editing or alteration, but I feel that the term is an important one as there is no other term that carries the same connotations as this. I have come to use it in my own work and the arguments against it's status as a neologism are moot, in my opinion, considering that all words were at one time neologisms until they became widely used. That someone has not come across this word in the past 25 years is a ludicrous argument considering that 25 years ago, the word "blog" did not exist either, but no one questions its validity.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Not just "blog" - "wiki" didn't exist either. This discussion about neologisms is really putting me off using wikipedia and recommending it to my students. I want an up-to-date encyclopedia, not one which is embedded in old-fashioned thinking. Who makes these decisions about neologisms? How well read are they? Which disciplines do they come from?

<dd>The section <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> quoted was about "unique hits", and gave as an example the 827 "unique hits" Google identifies with the search term "microsoft" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=820&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=820&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. Note, however, that there are 534,000,000 <i>total</i> hits for the search term "microsoft".</dd>
<dd>For the search term "Jason Sokol", there are 846 <i>total</i> hits, of which Google deems 263 to be unique <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jason+Sokol%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jason+Sokol%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. Which is certainly not a criteria for deletion, and I did not intend it that way. My reason for the deletion nomination is non-notability, which I stated in my first sentence, with a link to the relevant notability guideline. My reference to search engine results was intended to show that I have not just nominated the article for not asserting notability, but have myself tried to find sources that would establish him as notable. I further explain that I do not find the search engine results to establish notability for the author because they are mostly publicity for his one book, thus failing the "multiple, independent, non-trivial" sources criterion.

<li>I agree that the term "bad faith" was inappropriate. I should have said confusing or inaccurate. However, your further explanation makes your intent much clearer. Proposing another authors work for deletion is serious business and the grounds should be clearly stated. It can be inferred from your nomination that 1000 g-hits is some type of critical threshold, and this can be misinterpreted by newer editors seeking easy to understand precedents. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:42, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The book article is stubby, in other words, may be easily merged with the author article. It's more normal for us to have articles on authors than on their books (I would argue that the book is not an exceptional case, more important than its author). If he writes another book, we only have to expand the article. If the book article were a researched article on the book's impact and responses to it and so on and so forth, then it would be appropriate for the book to have its own article (see <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guns%2C_Germs%2C_and_Steel_3114.html" title="Guns, Germs, and Steel">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a>, for example). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 12:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I should been read first articles about Dennisthe2 mentioned but I was little to eager when I noticed <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Point_3af0.html" title="Burning Point">Burning Point</a> article in wikipedia. I immediately noticed that there were missing information (one member missing and discography). My meaning was noble and I just add correct facts. I Did that too in my "personal" Article, I didn´t write autograph, just time of birth, place of birth and reason, why I was already mentioned in wikipedia Burning Point article (bassist, and I add studio engineer) This is already say in above, it should be easy to check links (or google) and noticed notability of Burning Point. I don say anything more about notability of me, that I have been bassist, co producer or studio engineer in several records (released world wide) and I hope, that you evaluate my notability by facts, google and links what I mentioned and do your decision. Thats fine and I´m happy what ever decision are, I´m humble person. Oh, and if decision is <b>keep</b>, I hope, that someone add Burning Point article formal members of band: Jukka Kyrö (1999-2005) Guitar and Toni "Jöpe" Kansanoja (1999-2006) bass <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJujokiko_aee3.html" title="User:Jujokiko">-jj-</a> 21:02, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Could it be possible that the article be <b>kept until a certain deadline</b> for more information to be added? If the article is better after that deadline, the article shall be kept. But if the article is still as mediocre, then it should be deleted...

<li>AFD debates are known to be relisted in order to get a better discussion - there are other reasons available as well. There's a few other ways of doing it as well - you could check with the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_Desk_d83b.html" title="Wikipedia:Help Desk">Wikipedia:Help Desk</a> for alternate methods. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigma_7_b43b.html" title="User:Sigma 7">Sigma 7</a> 18:23, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The AfD process is to decide whether an article's subject is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to be kept, not whether it is mediocre enough to be deleted. We are here to continuously expand and improve articles, not to delete them because they are stubs. If that was the case, Wikipedia would be empty. There is no time limit on improving a notable article. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 19:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>To augment, I'd also suggest keeping a "backup" copy in your userspace somewhere. We're certainly not prejudiced against deletion, but it should be improved before being reposted.

<li><small><b>Comment</b>. Just to nitpick, <i>Brontosaurus</i> was not a chimera, it was a junior subjective synonym of <i>Apatosaurus</i>. The whole "wrong head" story has nothing to do with the naming issue, and is very misleading, since 99% of dinosaur mounts to this day invent speculative body parts (especially skulls) based on known relatives to fill in the gaps of incomplete skeletons. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 23:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small>It is all relative; sure the others caused a much bigger stir but in the end the basic issue is the same; a term which has no validity but there still lies a small story behind it and on the net the term snuck into lists of valid creatures. I have seen rumours and bits of knowledge get blown out of proportion before (I have looked into some other issues with Banksias and fungi - read Tom Volk's page on <i><a href="../../../h/y/g/Hygrocybe_conica.html" title="Hygrocybe conica">Hygrocybe conica</a></i> to see how one small event of quetionable validity in 1930s china sent ripples through modern texts on fungi.

<li><small>Edison, Science is a process and many the value of much is increased by showing the false leads. To ignore these is to reduce science to dogma.

<li><small><b>Keep</b>. All nomina nuda are hollow of definition. By definition, a nomem nudum is any old name that's been made up and/or bandied about carelessly in the literature. Technically, I believe a name has to be followed by <i>gen et sp. nov.</i> to indicate the author is trying to coin a new name, and then if that name is not described properly, it becomes a nomen nudum. A lot of <i>nomina nuda</i> listed on the List of Dinosaurs are not real nomina nuda, they're nicknames that have been picked up by the press and included carelessly in genera lists. That said, Wikiproject dinosaurs has agreed to include both formal and informal nomina nuda in its lists, and this decision means any old name included by any old lunatic in any old list.

<li><small><b>Keep</b> - the arguments against this boil down to: it hasn't been used scientifically, and it was named by a creationist. The second point is more easily dealt with: it's always better to expose errors than to cover them up. The first point has some merit, in that as a <i>nomen nudum</i> there's not much that has been said or can be said. Paleontology is littered with names that aren't in use (at least half of what <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Bakker_d814.html" title="Bob Bakker">Bob Bakker</a> has coined and all of the Stephen Pickering names), misidentifications (<i><a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuvosaurus.html" title="Shuvosaurus">Shuvosaurus</a></i>, anyone?), and combinations (<i><a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachenosaurus.html" title="Aachenosaurus">Aachenosaurus</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/c/Succinodon.html" title="Succinodon">Succinodon</a></i>).

<li><small><b>Keep</b> - if it was just a name made-up by a pseudoscientist and included in some fringe newsletters, that wouldn't be good enough; but the terms seems to have been used in other places as well, and was important enough that a geologist wrote a paper to expose it as a mistake. While it is obviously not <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_man.html" title="Piltdown man">piltdown man</a> on the <i>importance</i> scale, it does seem to establish <i>notability</i>, and it would be helpful to inform people that it does not actually exist. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small><b>Comment to nominator</b> - To explain my vote, I'm maintaining keep for the exact reason you are requesting a deletion. Right now, the problem I'm having is that it's a bit deceptive: whereas your nomination states that it is by all effects a bogus term created under pseudoscience and thusly you assert it should be deleted as such, the article states pretty much the same thing, except that it asserts that it should be <i>kept</i> as such. I honestly fail to see the logic in deleting a term for the exact same reasons it states it should be kept.

<dd><small>It was a made up term without any sources. The article is much different than it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unicerosaurus&amp;diff=99156930&amp;oldid=89069397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unicerosaurus&amp;diff=99156930&amp;oldid=89069397" rel="nofollow">before</a>. There was no scholarly comments on his "dinosaur fossil." As such without proper academic sourcing it should be removed. Review the article in the state it was when I made the nomination; two personal webpages and a "journal?" without page numbers nor properly footnoted. Hence, a highly suspect article. If you fail to "see the logic" then be sure to "see" how the article was and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatriotBible_b2fa.html" title="User:PatriotBible">PatriotBible</a> 02:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>Then consider this: right now, it's less important to consider how the article <i>was</i>, and very important to consider what the article <i>is</i> as of now - and will note the range you cite is covering a period of time ranging about a month and a half with twelve intermediate changes bypassed by the article history link. Just because it was bad doesn't mean it can't change. In its current state, it is, in short, not deletable in my opinion: as I write this, there is a link to Dinosauria.com, two published works referencing ISBN numbers, and two pending such numbers, coming up to five reliable sources. I'm certainly in agreement that personal web pages and blogs in particular are downright horrible for sources (and certainly aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. My vote, however, remains as <i>Keep</i> however, and even more so, as the article, in its current state, has been improved, and at least in my opinion more than meets WP standards. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 02:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</small>

Consider this Google seach for "Hadith of loving and hating"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Hadith+of+loving+and+hating%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Hadith+of+loving+and+hating%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> - all results point back here or to <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Muslim_6c10.html" title="Sahih Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a>, where the creator of this article added it himself<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sahih_Muslim&amp;diff=43431623&amp;oldid=43430753" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sahih_Muslim&amp;diff=43431623&amp;oldid=43430753" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> (the other listed sistes merely drawing content from Wikipedia.) The two sources used here (e.g. www.answering-ansar.org) mention only the verses, but not the phrase "hadith of loving and hating" or any similar concept. Perhaps there is a notable concept here, for which the creator has chosen an unusual translation. If so, it should be sourced and renamed. As it is, I see no evidence that the concept of "Hadith of loving and hating" exists outside Wikipedia.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 19:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe I should explain that I created this title only yesterday. Previously, the article was titled "Hadith of the equality of love and hatred" which is both misleading and horrid English. I merged the article "Hadith of loving and hating Ali" into the article and changed the title into the current one, which is at least a bit better linguistically. However, the title of Ali article seems uncommon as well, if you haven't found anything by that name (with or without Ali). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 21:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>May be you are right. I do not know it because I am sunni. But you should provide strong references (of secondary sources, not primary sources) in the start of the article. Otherwise, it looks like an original research based on some primary sources only. Also I do not understand that why you have to create so many partisan articles? These article are small enough to be merge as section in some other article. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 22:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The start of the article is an original research. It says <i>There are various Hadith that talk about loving or hating someone or something being equal to hating someone or something else. The most famous are the Hadith of loving and Ali.</i> That is the base of the article. Do not you find it an orginal research without good references? One CANNOT have an article only on the bases of primary sources. Secondly we should not create article by grouping some Hadiths. Many hadiths are already group in seperate chapter in their original books. An article should be on real topics instead of topic created by collecting hadiths. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 03:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><strike><b>Week Delete</b></strike> <b>Comment</b> Having an article on Primary source is not wrong but this article lacks secondary sources badly.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Look closely, there are several different traditions referenced here, some of which have no direct relation to the others besides the juxtaposition of "love" against "hate" in relation to Ali. The organization and labelling of them as "Hadith of love and hatred" is a dubious basis for an article. Apparently, Striver has created a number of articles consisting of a single Hadith, e.g. <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Uthman%27s_modesty_4228.html" title="Hadith of Uthman's modesty">Hadith of Uthman's modesty</a>. The trouble is that Striver becomes Wikipedia's de facto interpreter and labeller of Islamic scripture. Because the articles are so short and distributed all over the place, it is difficult for other editors to exercize any oversight, or for readers to find the informtion they're looking for. I was going to suggest merging this one into Shi'a veneration for Ali, only to discover to my amazement that no such article exists. I am also amazed that there is no category for Shi'a Islam. It's desirable that this information is presented, but this method of (dis-)organization is appalling.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - i really don't like having any of these "Hadith of..." articles, if there is a <i>concept</i> meriting discussion then surely it can be done in a manner other than this. i feel that almost all of these "Hadith of..." articles are simply proxies of <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a>: extensions of sunni vs. shia internet polemics (used to 'prove' one set of beliefs over another) which we can do without. it wouldn't be fair, however, to opine "Delete" here whilst dozens of other similar articles currently exist and serve as a precedence for this one. the wider issue of such articles in general must be addressed. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

How can we delete any of them, if the existence of others is the defense for any particular one? Most (if not all) of these are attributable to one particularly energetic editor. The question is, how can we re-channel this energy into a policy-compliant direction? Deleting these articles must be a component of the solution. It's simply unacceptable for Wikipedia to serve as the platform for any one user's exegeses, however good-faith and worthy these might be.</dd>
<dd>While I personally have sympathies with the Shi'a perspective, it does seem that Itaqallah's "proxies" charge has validity. Articles which promote, implicitly or otherwise, any particular religion or religious faction are unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>The author seems well-intended and mostly fair-minded, but it is not up to any of us to designate the Shi'a view vs. the Sunni view, or the Muslim view vs. the non-Muslim view; this is an inherently and needlessly divisive way of structuring articles.

<dd>Well, isnt all hot Shi'a - Sunni topics in one way or another an extension of the Succession to Muhammad? I mean, even the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffin are extension of it, even the succession to Abu Bakr is a extension to that. Why is the list of hadith being addressed as an unaccaptable extension, while all the battle and other controversies are viewed as acceptable? Isn't the point to show notable controvesies? I have already shown with ample evidence that this hadith is notable, and i can do the same with most other hadith i have created. And btw, please do remeber that i am not just "an energetic editor", i am the only active Shi'a editor, and i have the support of every single Shi'a editor on wikipedia. -Striver <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.64.242.133_5811.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.64.242.133">213.64.242.133</a> (talk) 13:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

Her grounds for doing this were: "(persosns is an icorrect grammar pluralisation it is people or a person or a person's rights and carried out a clean up)". I pointed out the error, and reverted. Lucy-marie refused to accept she was wrong and reverted. On the discussion page (now at Talk:Person (American English)) I started a Request for Comment. <s>The only supporter of Lucy-marie has been a friend of hers.</s> One contributor suggested, jokingly, that two separate pages be made, one for American English and one for British English. Lucy-marie has now unilaterally declared the Request for Comment process closed and has totally unnecessarily created these two pages, blanked the original <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> page and turned it into a Redirect. At the top of the Discussion page for each article, she has written "This page was created entirley to resolve a dispute over persons or poeple". The dispute has not been resolved. I am proposing the deletion of these two pages and the restoration of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> until the Request for Comment discusssion is properly concluded. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 10:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a reminder to readers that this is not, strictly speaking, a fork over grammar but more basically whether there is or is not such a word as <b>persons</b> in British or any other form of English. I have provided dictionary quotes before on the relevant Discussion page, but here is a direct quote from Chambers Online Dictionary, about as British as it gets. I think this clinches it:</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>"<b>person</b> <i>noun</i> (<i><b>persons</b></i> or in sense 1 also <i><b>people</b></i>) <b>1</b> an individual human being. <b>2</b> the body, often including clothes • <i>A knife was found hidden on his person</i>. <b>3</b> <i>grammar</i> each of the three classes into which pronouns and verb forms fall, <b>first person</b> denoting the speaker (or the speaker and others, eg <i>I</i> and <i>we</i>), <b>second person</b> the person addressed (with or without others, eg <i>you</i>) and <b>third person</b> the person(s) or thing(s) spoken of (eg <i>she, he, it</i> or <i>they</i>). <b>4 (Person)</b> <i>Christianity</i> any of the three forms or manifestations of God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) that together form the <b>Trinity</b> (sense 2). <b>5</b> <i>in compounds</i> used instead of <i>-man, -woman</i>, etc, to denote a specified activity or office, avoiding illegal or unnecessary discrimination on grounds of sex, eg in job advertisements • <i>chairperson</i> • <i>spokesperson</i>. Compare <b>chairman, chairwoman</b>, <i>etc</i>. <b>be no respecter of persons</b> to make no allowances for rank or status. <b>in person 1</b> actually present oneself • <i>was there in person</i>. <b>2</b> doing something oneself, not asking or allowing others to do it for one."</p>

<p>This is a definition from the online dictionary of the word people.<br />
1.persons indefinitely or collectively; persons in general: to find it easy to talk to people; What will people think?<br />
2. persons, whether men, women, or children, considered as numerable individuals forming a group: Twenty people volunteered to help.<br />
3. human beings, as distinguished from animals or other beings.<br />
4. the entire body of persons who constitute a community, tribe, nation, or other group by virtue of a common culture, history, religion, or the like: the people of Australia; the Jewish people.<br />
5. the persons of any particular group, company, or number (sometimes used in combination): the people of a parish; educated people; salespeople.<br />
6. the ordinary persons, as distinguished from those who have wealth, rank, influence, etc.: a man of the people.<br />
7. the subjects, followers, or subordinates of a ruler, leader, employer, etc.: the king and his people.<br />
8. the body of enfranchised citizens of a state: representatives chosen by the people.<br />
9. a person's family or relatives: My grandmother's people came from Iowa.<br />
10. (used in the possessive in Communist or left-wing countries to indicate that an institution operates under the control of or for the benefit of the people, esp. under Communist leadership): people's republic; people's army.<br />
11. animals of a specified kind: the monkey people of the forest. –verb (used with object)<br />
12. to furnish with people; populate<br />
13. to supply or stock as if with people: a meadow peopled with flowers.<br />
So according to the above definition it can be used to represent a collective and according to the first defintion it can be used to represnt individuals so therefore it can be used to reprersnt both.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 19:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Retain</b> I object to the deletion of this article, my first contribution. Article is accurate, short, and concise, written in a neutral tone. The category into which it falls is entitled List of NJ Traffic Circles. That an included circle be significant or important is neither required nor implied. List does not purport to contain only "remarkable or notable" circles. Cf: the other NJ Traffic Circles in list. Is the nominator a native of NJ? I am. I am also familiar with all of the traffic circles on the list, some of which are/were comparable in size and importance to this one. Those advocating deletion should first consult the list and note the large number of circles there which no longer exist. Existence of circle in present day is not a criterion for inclusion judging by the entries to which the word "defunct" is appended. To those for whom "Highway Jerseyana" is a subject of interest, my contribution adds accurate information by expanding the list. Finally, enlarging the list of NJ Traffic Circles as completely as possible helps to illustrates the initial rapid popularity and subsequent demise of this type of traffic control as posited in the main article about traffic circles. Thanks to the Wikipedia community for helping me learn how the inclusion of articles is debated and resolved.Jeff.schwartz 02:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Retain</b> This is definitely a true and noteworthy fact. The Teaneck Circle at Teaneck Rd. and Cedar Lane/E. Cedar Lane in Teaneck, NJ was something very memorable to many people who lived in that area and remember it well - including myself. This fact should be retained for purposes of completeness and accuracy. <small>— Spmny2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spmny2_287c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spmny2">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>Being a 'fact' or 'noteworthy' does not make a topic encyclopedic. While the article is a nice read, there is no assertion of notability or any encyclopedic content in the article. So that is why it will probably be deleted. It simply does not assert any notability. The best guideline is probably <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> and I'm sure that it does not meet that guidelines for keeping. My suggestion would be to merge. If there are other articles that should be deleted for similar reasons, then list them on AfD. Their existence does not justify keeping similar articles. For the record, I had to rack my brain to see if I ever heard of this. In the end I had, but that does not make it notable for me as a New Jersey native. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Rolling back before what appears to be vandalism, the article is a Croatian bio-stub, with Novak being the first Croatian flyer, which can be seen <a href="http://www.krizevci.net/hr/html/novak.html" class="external text" title="http://www.krizevci.net/hr/html/novak.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (according to my limited Croatian). While he struggles to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (how widely recognised is the first Croatian to fly?), he also has an article in <a href="http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragutin_Novak" class="external text" title="http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragutin_Novak" rel="nofollow">Croatian Wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 13:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yahoo turns up many sites on him, although most are non-english. What I can find list him as the first graduated pilot of croatia. I would assume croatians would find him notable. JN322 13:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It appears from the well-sourced Croatian article that Novak may be almost as notable among Croatians as the Wright Brothers are among Americans. If he's notable in Croatia, he's notable enough for the English language Wikipedia. This should be sent to cleanup but should not be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 13:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nobody is claiming that the club isn't real, but unfortunately it isn't the case that it "is real , so it can have a place in wikipedia" - after all, my son plays for a Sunday morning kids' park team which is indisputedly real but I certainly wouldn't create a Wikipedia article on them.

<li><b>Mild Keep</b> Just to reply, I should point out that I read the discussion and it was not "unanimous" as implied by the nominator. At least one person seemed to disagree, and only three or four people commented. Second, I'll point out that I'm not sure there's a big distinction between tournaments on Smackdown and individual episodes of other television series. How are the Smackdown tournament episodes any less notable than the the episode <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blind_Bandit_8123.html" title="The Blind Bandit">The Blind Bandit</a> of the series <a href="../../../t/h/e/Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_dca9.html" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, or the episode <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motivation_%28episode%29.html" title="Motivation (episode)">Motivation (episode)</a> in <a href="../../../i/_/p/Category%7EI_Pity_the_Fool_episodes_1c5e.html" title="Category:I Pity the Fool episodes">Category:I Pity the Fool episodes</a>, both of which have articles? Basically, if being an episode of a major television series is notable enough to allow that episode to have an article, then why aren't multi-week tournaments on Smackdown or RAW or TNA:Impact likewise notable enough to have articles? Basically these are the equivalent of episodes. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Who disagreed? It was, and still is, unanimous.

<dd>Ah, I stand corrected on Govy's point. Still, that leaves the rest of what I said unaddressed. Namely a) that there doesn't seem to be a fundamental difference between this tournament and an episode or episodes of a television series; and b) that the "unanimous" consent of WP:PW consisted of exactly three editors (Paulley, Hybrid, Govvy). I didn't post there, but obviously I would have posted the same comments there as I did here. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Addressing your nomination, "Cruft" is not a reason for deletion. As far as notability, I gave examples above of a couple of other television series I pulled out of the air that are <i>less</i> notable in terms of viewership than Smackdown episodes but which are apparently considered notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. So again, to rephrase, my question comes down to this - why are Smackdown episode articles held to a different standard than either reality television episode articles or less popular scripted television episode articles? If Smackdown is at least as popular, if not more, than other shows that have complete articles about every episode, then why shouldn't there likewise be articles about main Smackdown episodes or story arcs? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't saying that cruft was a reason for deletion; I was simply driving home the non-notability point. Anyway, there are precedents for deleting synopses of wrestling episodes. They are held to a different standard due to the quantity of them <i>in my opinion</i>. Raw has over 700 episodes, and Smackdown has been going on for a long time now. A summary of every episode is an incredibly large amount of articles to have on any subject. For comparison, more than double the total number of articles on the infamous Pokémon. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 23:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are definitely correct that there are many more episodes in a season of Smackdown or RAW than a typical television, because the shows air once a week every week with no repeats. However, storylines and multi-episode tournaments such as this one take multiple weeks to resolve, so the total number of story- or tourny-related articles wouldn't be any greater than the number of episodes for a scripted series or reality show.</dd>
<dd>In fact, though, this brings up a broader question about how to organize pro-wrestling television show articles in general. Let's assume for the moment that we don't want to include specific articles for individual wrestling show episodes due to the sheer number of episodes involved. What if you were to compact that information into, say, multi-week storyline specific articles (like this one) or month-by-month synopsis timeline articles for a series? Doing that would reduce the number of articles to a more manageable 10-20 articles per year per show.</dd>
<dd>Since it's looking to me like I'm getting into the realm of broader overall discussion of wrestling show articles in general, I'll leave this particular afd nomination up to consensus and instead pose the above questions over at WP:PW. Who knows, maybe in the broader review it'll turn out that there is a way to present episodic-style information about wrestling in a compact enough form to be managable? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Wait and See.</b> I think the nomination for deletion was far too quick as the significance of the tournament has yet to ultimately be revealed. Even now (as the second set of matches is over and Kennedy is the victor), the sprint may be incorporated into a major plotline. The creation of this page may have been hasty, but at least have the decency to wait and see how it all plays out before you destroy it. Even in the very long term, this may be a multi-year thing. How long does a tournament have to go on, or how many times does it have to happen for it to be significant? Aren't all PPVs fancruft, since realistically a title COULD (and has) changed hands at any time, feuds could (and have) been resolved without a PPV, and DVDs also highlight normal matches? I disagree with fancruft. I agree with the fact of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_match_types.html#Beat_the_Clock_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Beat the Clock match article</a>. I agree partially with the point of less significant episodes in a series, but disagree as well because professional wrestling really bears more a comparison to a soap opera, as there are no repeats, multiple feuds, and people that should be dead after getting hit with something aren't. Just <i><b>WAIT</b></i>... the article doesn't have that much size to it (yet) anyway, so wikipedia won't be bogged down terribly if this isn't deleted immediately.

<p>A long-serving and worthy police officer. However, he is only even slightly notable in a local context and holds a relatively junior rank (inspector is approximately equivalent to lieutenant in police forces in the United States and elsewhere and every force has at least dozens of them). He has been awarded the QPM, but this is not a particularly unusual decoration for a long-serving officer and we would not expect entries for every police officer who had been awarded it for meritorious service (although those who were awarded it in the past for bravery may be more notable). As for his international contributions, many British police officers make visits to foreign forces - they don't make him stand out in any great way. Neither do a few appearances on television current affairs programmes to talk about local issues. All in all, an officer who is probably fairly prominent in his local community, but is not notable enough for an encyclopaedia article (meaning no disrespect to the man whatsoever). <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't actually think it is a candidate to be speedied (which is why I didn't). The assertion of notability is plausible enough to disqualify it under the speedy deletion rules and the creator obviously genuinely considers the subject to be notable (as opposed to creating it for advertising or fancruft purposes). I don't consider it meets WP notability criteria, but neither do I think it meets speedy deletion criteria. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Very weak Delete</b>. I somehow feel we're missing something here. Universities generally don't hand out honorary doctorates that freely, so I wonder if his position and his works are actually more notable than his rank would otherwise say. After all, Audie Murphy was only a lieutenant in the US Army. However, as the article stands it doesn't describe the individual as being notable enough for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 15:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Rank is of course irrelevant if one has done something particularly significant (like win the Medal of Honor), but if one just does one's job, however well, then it does have a bearing. British universities usually give a fair proportion of their honorary doctorates to people who are significant locally, not nationally, largely in order to curry favour with the local community - trust me, most people wouldn't have heard of most of the recipients. It is notable that despite the QPM and the honorary doctorate, Baines has not received a national non-police-specific honour, not even an <a href="../../../m/b/e/MBE_1ebb.html" title="MBE">MBE</a> (and I would generally consider a CBE to be a minimum requirement for notability based on one's honours alone). -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 16:31, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In my opinion the article should not be deleted, but heavily overhauled, and only for the reason that he set a precedent for others to follow in the role of community race relations and his work is now followed nationwide as best practice by other Police Forces, and the QPM and honourary doctorate should have been given as examples to illustrate this, not just listed on their own. Unfortunately the creator of the article doesn't really seem to have mentioned this, and just given the impression that the work he did was typical of that done by an ordinary officer at the rank of Inspector 81.178.88.91 19:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that really crappy is not a reason for deletion, why is it always used? Crappy articles are supposed to be tagged and repaired, aren't they?

Another is claimed to be from TV Guide but is in fact another post from Whedonesque.com. The Wizarduniverse.com source doesn't mention this project specifically, merely that "certain [unnamed] characters" are being "saved." The TVguide.com source is apparently dead. The few remaining sources all say in one way or another that this film will not be made. This isn't well-documented, this isn't properly referenced and it's not expected ever to happen by the people who would be directly involved so it's not legitimately an "anticipated" event. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If all the references out there were secondary and there was no primary source to be had, this would merely be speculation, and mere speculation is deletable. That the Whedonesque.com sources are secondary, quoting primary sources, knocks them down a notch in reliable source standards. It does not, however, prevent one from traversing out to the primary sources and verifying that a movie, of this topic and proposed name, has been in discussion and planning by Whedon and crew. This clearly and easily passes the "Is it real or not?" credibility test once those sources are reviewed, which is the most important part of the speculation / crystal ball policies. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or <b>messages left on blogs</b>, should not be used as sources." Pretty clear-cut. A message on a blog to the effect of "I heard Amy Acker say this at a con" is worthless as a source. Stripped of the material that's sourced with non-sources and the speculation, the article would read that there was a movie suggested about Spike, that James Marsters said in passing in an interview he'd play it if it happened within five years and that no one who would be primarily involved in the film thinks it's going to be made. Not even remotely close to meeting basic standards of inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article reads like an advertisement for the F-14 combined with a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>, and it utterly fails <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. I have no particular investment in the Tomcat-vs-Super Hornet controversy at all, but the article does not fairly present it in any sense of the word. Improve at dead bottom minimum, but deletion may well be better. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 16:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> - as per Iceberg3k, this is disgruntled editor placing an advert for the <a href="../../../f/1/4/F14_Tomcat_24d9.html" title="F14 Tomcat">F14 Tomcat</a>. The gist is correct but the article fails <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> miserably and would only survive with a neutral re-write. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 16:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A further problem with the article is that there is no "controversy," at least not on any level that matters. A "controversy" indicates that there is significant debate about it in the real world, which there has not been since before the Super Hornet entered service. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 16:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom. This was a POV fork from the main F-14 article, written in essay form and mostly uncited. Mostly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> even the name is <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 21:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Judgment? This seems to be a pretty straightforward case here, it's POV, badly formatted and uncited. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 19:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's actually nothing to suggest the PGWA itself is notable. It asserts vague notability by claiming to have promoted in more than one country, but I can't verify this from reliable sources. Unless the notability of the PGWA itself can be demonstrated, then all champions can't be assumed to be notable. Leilani Kai is definitely notable, but not for her work in the PGWA. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 10:17, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="../../../o/z/h/User%7EOzhiker_7821.html" title="User:Ozhiker">Ozhiker</a> nailed the relevant notability criteria - <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.
<ul>
<li>There is a subtle, but key difference, between Inc.'s list of the 500 fastest growing companies and a list of the top 500 companies in some field. The article asserts, without sourcing, that the company made the list of fastest growing companies two years in a row. Had it asserted making a list of top companies, that would have met <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but still needed sourcing.</li>
<li>There are no <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent</a> sources cited in the article, although some are mentioned in the text that could potentially be used to write the article.</li>
<li>The only sources here are those introdiced by <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a>. So the discussion boils down to evaluating those two sources. On inspection, each is non-trivial, and we can assume they are independent. But are they reliable? Nobody other than this user discussed these sources, so
<ol>
<li>I find the second, from Australian PC World, to be reliable. They show an editorial staff, publish corrections, and generally look like an online magazine.</li>
<li>The first is about.com. I'm not aware of any prior discussion as to whether they are a reliable source. However, when I look at their recruiting for guides; I find that they do want people with topical expertise. Although owned by the New York Times company, they certainly aren't the <i>New York Times</i>. I'm not sure whether this is reliable to our standards, <i>and nobody discussed it</i>, so I can't say the discussion produced consensus on this point.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>That said, there was clear consensus that the article needs to be cleaned up to adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It probably needs a near total rewrite by someone who goes out, finds, and uses independent sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ammendment: According to WP:CORP, a company article must assert notability of the company as follows:
<dl>
<dd>Providing evidence of any of the following:
<dl>
<dd>1) That the company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.</dd>
<dd>2) That the company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications.3</dd>
<dd>3) That the company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate stock market indices.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As far as I can see, this article lists no references, hence does not provide this evidence, and hence is not currently a valid article. --<a href="../../../o/z/h/User%7EOzhiker_7821.html" title="User:Ozhiker">Ozhiker</a> 11:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hello All, I wanted to join in this discussion before any action was taken as I am the person that maintains this page. I guess I would like to start off with the entire concept of the article being a promotional issue. I see companies constantly being added to wikipedia and do not see how this would be any different. It is hard when you write about any specific company as many would see it as a bias, or promotional article because it is about one specific thing, a company. With regards to the link spamming that is being labeled for the article please allow me to explain my position. At some point a member read the article and indicated that I should link from other relevant articles to this article. I was following the direction of someone who I suspected to have been "in the know" longer than I, so i followed the suggestions. I do not spam, in fact, I have filed an AMA request so I could have someone mediate an issue about that exact thing. I do not think a link spammer would go through the effort of that and also responding to a deletion discussion either. With regards to deleting the "clean up" message, it was form an IP address. Just because someone says "hey it's me" and they are not logged in does not mean that some person that has mal content is not responsible for adding that message. In addition, I think it is only fair to note that I have done more than simply write an article and linked it everywhere. I have taken the time to review each article that I visit with regards to this one and in some instance I have edited other links, added more content that would be relevant to the article and so on. I have joined in on discussions and as you have stated, I have asked for help. I have received very little in the way of help and to be quite honest, why is it that I have not received any follow up's to the AMA i filed, and on the Spectorsoft article discussion? What i receive instead is a label to being a spammer or nomination to delete an article that I put a great deal of time and research in to. I have stated this in the AMA, and also to other people that I have had discussions with, if you can find, or help me find a better solution I am more than willing to discuss it. For example, I have been contemplating adding more content to the article and adding images. When I start to move forward with this, I end up pausing until I can clear up, or discuss any matters regarding the issue. I guess in closing that I would like to say that I am more than willing to work on the article under the guise of specific direction so the article would seem less "promotional", but please understand that bias is going to happen to a certain extent when you are writing about a specific company. I welcome responses. Thank you for your time Techie guru 14:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a final note on the spamming, it is also fair to note that the reverts were done by one specific person, not a group of different people. It’s also important to note that the person that was reverting was also in heated debates with other members for being the self appointed final word on a few articles. I encourage everyone to read up on that and you will see this is the case. Inadvertently because of that, i have been labeled a spammer by that person.Techie guru 14:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article looks entirely promotional and lacks NPOV. A product like this is expected to be controversial, but there is no outside commentary on the wisdom of the monitoring it provides. Also, while outside reviews are alluded to, they are not cited, so there's no way to judge if the statements are correct. There's no way to to tally the 'multiple non-trivial published works' that would be required to establish notability. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 02:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, the term's being absent in the English language is <i>not</i> a valid reason for deletion. I keep seeing this argument on AfD and it's wrong. If there were multiple sources written in any language <i>about</i> the term (rather than just using the term), and these provided a basis to write an article that was more than a dicdef, then the subject would be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and an article on it would be encyclopedic, regardless of the fact that the term is not used in English. There's no such thing as "notable in Ukrainian but not notable in English"; enwiki is an encyclopedia <i>in</i> English, not an encyclopedia <i>of</i> English. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 01:45, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This argument is not wrong. It is not a <b>term</b>, i.e. a thing that refers to some object of notion, possibly unknown in English-speaking world. In your case it is a <i>slang word</i>, i.e., a vulgar <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonym</a> and does not introduce a <b>new notion</b>. We have redirects for English synonyms, unless a synonym has a significant text to write about. But to have articles for all possible slang in all possible languages is quite ridiculous. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 01:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>: <i>Notability is not subjective</i>. Multiple non-trivial instances of coverage = notability. Period. Regardless of language. I guess <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> might be the best way to judge it by; if there are sources which <i>discuss</i> the word (instead of just mentioning the word), then it's notable. In this case, I don't see multiple non-trivial sources which discuss the word; so I agree it's not a notable word; famous authors <i>using</i> the word in their works are just examples of non-trivial coverage. But the fact that it's unknown in English-speaking world doesn't matter. Plenty of articles in enwiki talk about stuff which is otherwise unknown or close to unknown in the English-speaking world, but have sources in other languages proving they're notable. If you applied the same standard to other language, "if this thing is unknown in the Russian/Chinese/Tamil-speaking world, then it's not notable for ruwiki/zhwiki/tawiki", you'd have to delete huge numbers of sourced articles. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 14:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know whether this merits an article here (I suspect it was introduced to balance <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khokhol.html" title="Khokhol">khokhol</a>) but it certainly needs cleaning up and sourcing. The exact same word, <i>kacap</i>, is an insult for Russians in Polish. So what came first, the Ukrainian or the Polish term? Or do they have a common source? Unfortunately, the unreferenced etymologies given in this article just look like guessing. If this term is as notable as is claimed, there should be some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> out there to decide this issue and provide this page with the references it lacks. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or let's delete <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khokhol.html" title="Khokhol">Khokhol</a> as "Wikipedia is not an etymological dictionary of all possible foreign slang" and "the term "Khokhol" is absent in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>" using your own argumentation.--<a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryndza_fa93.html" title="User:Bryndza">Bryndza</a> 13:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree that if this goes, then <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khokhol.html" title="Khokhol">Khokhol</a> (another undersourced article about an ethnic slur) should go too. By the looks of things, the Ukrainian article has sources (though some of them are pretty old) and makes a distinction between the folk etymology of the word and scholarly attempts to find its origin. Bring in more info from the Ukrainian wikipedia and you'll have a stronger case for keeping this page. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 14:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Looks like an autobiography. Is the guy notable? -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 18:53, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well - Criteria apparently satisfied: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field."</p>
<p>"The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries"</li>
</ul>
<p>"Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by LWHero (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LWHero_e479.html" title="Special:Contributions/LWHero">contribs</a>).</small> <small>author of the article</small></p>
<p>Dear god&#160;: I thought it would be "signed" automatically. Terribly sorry. Hardly anonymous though, since you could easily trace it. And yes, I am the author and subject - nothing to hide - several people asked why I wasn't in the English version of Wikipedia when I was in the French (and no I didn't instigate the French article) so I wrote something. Those in the relevant fields are obviously able to change any false information, to add critical reviews or views, etc. What on earth is the problem? Do you dispute that I fulfill one or more of the criteria for "notable"? On what grounds? LWHero 21:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Being a winner of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prix_Ars_Electronica_2272.html" title="Prix Ars Electronica">Prix Ars Electronica</a> is probably sufficient for notability. The article needs to be cleaned up, with the references in standard form (see the various citation templates) and the reviews removed, but I think the subject is notable. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 20:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as Smith has written "prominently" about computer art since before there was much of it at all. <a href="http://www.olats.org/pionniers/pp/lansdown.php" class="external text" title="http://www.olats.org/pionniers/pp/lansdown.php" rel="nofollow">e.g.</a> Satisfies the "enduring historical record" criterion in that respect. LWHero, if you are Prof. Smith, please make yourself aware of our <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">autobiography</a> policies. When you write your own article it is more difficult to judge <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">freedom from bias</a> in the end result. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok thanks to both the above - references templated and reviews grudgingly deleted. Point taken about conflict of interest, but I hope you agree that it is now neutral, and still verifiable. Though I am stunned to note the amount of unverifiable "opinion" in articles I consult daily on here... I had not seen, before, that it is "strongly discouraged" to write one's own article; and can see why. However, as I said this was just an extension of an existing article on French Wikipedia that was not started by me, though I did amend it. LWHero 21:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Per Dhartung I'm convinced on notability; however, there should be some sources referenced from the article to meet WP standards. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 02:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Kevin, can you be more specific about what sources you'd like referenced, and I'll try to do it...LWHero 06:46, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems notable. More explicit references per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would be good. --- <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafemariner_afef.html" title="User:Safemariner">Safemariner</a> 07:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Transwiki'd already. This is an article about a one-liner. I checked the refs, they are actually more or less generic references to U-Haul and would apply equally to anyone with a bad relationship history. I didn't see the exact phrase "u-haul lesbian" in them, although maybe I miseed it. This looks like a distillation of primary sources and a one-line gag combined to make what looks like an article but actually isn't. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The transwiki was bizarre given that phrase "U-Haul Lesbian" is a multi-level and complex phenonmen that goes way beyond a "dictionary definition". The article has made verifiable attempts to cover the term as a sterotype, a description of the dating behavior as well as the GLBT cultural signifigance it has following its orgins in gay humor. The term is given serious treatments in several of the references such as Dr. Pimental-Habib &amp; Christopher Alexander's two books. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 19:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have. The <i>Houston Voice</i> article says <i>nothing</i> about this subject at all. The <i>Metro Weekly</i> article simply repeats the joke without any further analysis of what a U-Haul lesbian is, as do all of the <i>Seattle Weekly</i> article, the first article in <i>The Advocate</i>, the book by Hardin, the book by Stevens (which is actually discussing sexually transmitted diseases), and the book by Alexander (which is actually discussing the subject of "merging in lesbian relationships", per the title in boldface at the top of the page). The second article in <i>The Advocate</i> actually talks about U-Haul <i>trucks</i>, not U-Haul lesbians. The book by Marcus mentions the joke <i>in a two word footnote</i> and proceeds to talk about the reality of couple formation, which it states to be quite different. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sources I examined do mention the joke, but they are not about the concept of "U-Haul lesbians". They are about the feature of some lesbian relationship to which the U-Haul joke is pointing. Whether the woman is using a U-Haul or the back of her pickup is irrelevant. "U-Haul" here means exactly what it means to everyone else in the world; I could easily substitute "moving van" for "U-Haul" or remove the joke altogether and the substantive content of the article would be the same. It seems to me that this substantive content is about lesbian relationships and should therefore be <b>merged to <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">Lesbian</a></b>.

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a>. There is no source material about "U-Haul lesbians". Searching, I haven't found any substantial sources that are any different to the cited ones, and that do more than just repeat the joke. The cited sources are actually discussing topics such as how to broach the subject of STDs with one's new partner (the book by Stevens), how <i>slowly</i> couples moved in with each other (the book by Marcus), and "merging in lesbian relationships" (the book by Alexander). This entire article is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, a novel synthesis of sources in order to define a concept that is solely used in the punchline of a joke. Anything substantive to say about lesbian relationships should be said in an article on that topic. Given that most of the content of this article involves twisting the sources out of shape to discuss the joke stereotype rather than the actual subjects that they are addressing in their text, it seems that there's little content to save with a merger that wouldn't require a significant and almost entire rewrite anyway. About the only content worth saving are the book citations themselves, so that editors can go and read the sources and use them to expand articles on the actual subjects that they discuss. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I see no reason why we shouldn't do articles on lesbian jokes or any other type of humor, particularly when the joke has gained widespread currency over a long period and speaks to deeper sociological issues. The issue is mentioned in numerous books on the subject <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=u+haul+lesbian&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=u+haul+lesbian&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=uhaul+lesbian%20&amp;spell=1&amp;oi=spell" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=uhaul+lesbian%20&amp;spell=1&amp;oi=spell" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>.

<p>(<i>Page restored and added to AfD after discussion with author</i>): Persons claim to fame is being the son of a famous US General. He became Lt.

After his death he had some media coverage due to his famous father. There are two books and one upcoming movie about the battle, and something like 300 google hits for "Terry de la Mesa Allen, Jr." or "Terry Allen, Jr.".

<li>(Please don't place your comments out of order without good reason.) He is <b>a part of</b> (not "the subject of") the Maraniss book, and I am pretty certain that the "War at Home" piece in Texas Monthly was an excerpt from that book, because he was from Texas. It's unclear that his death attracted as much notice as you imply, but I would imagine not. He is used as an example in the PBS show, but that's more about the effect his deployment had on his marriage, so he's being used as an example. As for memorials, please do not argue in terms of whether someone "deserves" an article, as we don't judge worth but notability. Additionally, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not notability</a>, hence the existence of articles you deem less keepable isn't an argument for keeping this one. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 12:57, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Proposed for deletion by another editor, and relisted here to generate further discussion. The article currently has plenty of problems. On the other hand, a related article on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_housing_bubble_6566.html" title="United States housing bubble">United States housing bubble</a> is a former featured article candidate, and could serve as a model for this one.

While it might be possible to write a well sourced, neutral article about the British retail property market, you can't get there from here. Much better to delete this and start over". Over a month ago I left a message on the talk page warning that the article needed work and would be proposed for deletion, with no action taken since. I tried pruning it back to verifiable facts and got down to the title, which itself is deeply and irreversibly <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 21:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I doubt the article title is correct, since the current status of UK house prices may not be a bubble at all. However, the general issue of current UK houseprices is not some non-notable imagining of a few complainers, it is frequently frontpage/national television news and there are several other issues stemming from it. Not least: 'kidults' (many young adults are struggling to move from the family home due to outrageous property prices), the average age of first-time buyers is now in the early thirties, the Deputy Prime Minister proposing extra home-building (when he's not having it off with his secretary that is) causing outcry at the potential loss of green-field sites in Southern England and key workers not able to find affordable housing and therefore being unable to fill teaching/nursing posts etc. etc. I'm quite sympathetic to the nom, the article is a pile of warnings and no references, weasel-wording is not acceptable full-stop. That said, this issue (in a properly named article) is no less worthy than any other which frequently appears and is discussed on countless television programmes, in countless magazines and in other media. Of course, 'countless' makes it even less forgivable that the article contains naff-all refernces. Just bear with me, I'll find some references or at least sources about the overall problem. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 05:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I don't see the point of redirecting to an article that has barely any content, particularly when the US market does have a specific housing bubble article; people would just end up merging the content of this article with the generic UK property market article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a community that is largely ignored, and yet contributes heavily to the world in which we live. This article helps to shine light on the fact that men do contribute to society regardless of their short stature.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> on one hand, I'm insulted that the list goes up to 5'6 because hey, I'm not that short. But overall, this is a pretty harmless list which could be improved to be at the very least properly referenced. Also, all kidding aside, it should probably put the treshold low enough to make the list manageable (say 5'3),&#160;:-) <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and trim</b> per P.T, as I also find some encyclopedic value in the list, but it should be shortened (absolutely no pun intended, I promise) to a more manageable size- 5'5" really is not <i>that</i> short (this coming from a six-footer). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:54, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or move and trim</b> Honestly, "short" is subjective. Maybe rename and trim the list to something like "List of men famous for being short" or something like that. As it is, the list goes on to 5'6", which is already average height where I come from. Right now, it seems to read like a "List of famous people by height up to 5'6" Looking at the list, I have never heard of Bono or Woody Allen being as famous as they are for being "short". At this rate of subjectivity, we could have something like a List of famous ugly people. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unless independent, third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> can be found to assert notability. Most of the assertions don't seem that notable to begin with (having been a free-lance writer, a few computer manuals, some new online video ventures that don't seem to be major yet).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- Slashdot was the first major Geek news site. It was highly innovative and is famouns, notably for the "Slashdot effect." The term "Slashdotted" was coined to describe the effect on a website of being mentioned on Slashdot.(the effect is to overwhelm the site with traffic, usually taking it off the air.) Roblimo is probably the name most associated with slashdot. To Geeks of the years 2000-2004, the name Roblimo is probably one of the top ten most recognized geek celebrities, right up there with Stallman and Thorvalds, and certainly more recognizable than the guy who started Wikipedia (I can't remember his name.) -<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_dude_3aef.html" title="User:Arch dude">Arch dude</a> 03:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If this isn't an outright hoax, it is at least crystal ballery. The album that is claimed to be forthcoming isn't due until october of 2007.

Created by Marciomathers so we are probably looking at a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I ran across this at the DRV, and I think it was handled correctly the first time around. If someone wanted to merge a couple of sentences into <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Gaming_b3d2.html" title="Major League Gaming">Major League Gaming</a> by creating a section on notable participants and convert this page into a redirect, I'd be OK with that, as long as any added material could be sourced properly. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 05:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> As weak as humanly possible. I think we have too much of these non-notable gamers because of systemic bias. Namely that things of interest to techy young men are going to be more notable to Wikipedians, who largely are techy young men, then they will to anyone else on the planet. Still he didn't seem to be any less notable than several other such who just got keep.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><i>Moving against</i> gamer articles? Well, let's hope so, because there are plenty of contributors who haven't yet been upset to learn that a few guys here don't think their area is interesting enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Granted we only have 30 people in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Category%7EElectronic_sports_players_67f5.html" title="Category:Electronic sports players">Category:Electronic sports players</a>, but that's still more than <a href="../../../s/p/e/Category%7ESpellers_7fdd.html" title="Category:Spellers">Category:Spellers</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_pool_players_0af4.html" title="Category:American pool players">Category:American pool players</a> combined.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep</b> per deletion review. It's a serious problem that deletionists insist that sources be the equivalent of the mainstream media. This creates systemic bias. They surely need only be reliable in the correct context? BTW, ColourBurst, if you read this, you severely misunderstand <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. A person who cares about manga doesn't consequently own the articles about it. I can edit them mercilessly. But applying my own lack of caring to consideration of them is wrong.

<dd>I was pondering this position myself for a while. Often times we delete notable topics within a particular field because no sources in that field are considered reliable. However, when I look at this subject from the eyes of a gamer, I don't see much importance. If I had to choose between having a bunch of crap articles about "professional" MLG gamers and having no articles about gamers at all, I would choose the latter. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 08:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Earlier I said that this should be overturned and undeleted, but in retrospect, I don't think that was the best option. Most of the claims of notability within these types of articles are extremely weak. "John Doe is a professional gamer working for <a href="../../../m/l/g/MLG_c3f2.html" title="MLG">MLG</a>. He won some Halo tournaments." This doesn't mean much at all. MLG is not a respected and/or important organization in the world of gaming. Are any of the gamers within the league important? Not really. The sources do seem to be fairly trivial in this case. Will anyone care about this person in 10 years? or 100 years? Not a chance. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 08:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Troll organisation: an organisation of trolls. And?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - ANUS.com started out on the web in 1993 and went into its home at ANUS.com in 1995. It has been written up in SPIN magazine, investigated by the FBI, and reported on in several oblique contexts for its related websites. ANUS is thus an 11-year online presence that has seen many notable mentions and has maintained itself on a high-value domain name without selling out for that time. Only someone horribly bigoted against its content would argue "not notable," and clearly that's the case with "Guy." It is the oldest heavy metal resource on the Internet. Is that "not notable"? Come on, grow up. MouthfulOfFeces 22:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Yes, lets look at the references. The Houston Chronicle awards ANUS.com as being the best Nihilist Website on the web. They directly write about them and it is an award (criterion 3 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). The Wired article is about the exploits of the leader of ANUS. The MTV and Yahoo articles mention ANUS's relation to the Day of Slayer. The Village Voice article credits anus.com with the heavy metal faq. I'm sorry but you can't just pick and choose to ignore sources that are there. To say that none of the external coverage is about ANUS in particular is just false, the Houston Chronicle award is direct coverage and an award. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 05:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>When reading the nom's reasoning, I'm afraid that's the only sourced conclusion one can reach. A mention in the Houston press, a mention in the Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal that is the primary source for the List of Heavy Metal Bands (the entry in the books states the website is "authoritative," if my memorery serves me correctly)...these are reliable and verifiable. Now, as for some sort of thing you can look at without having to buy the book, see Prolog's diif here from the last nomination. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=96580991</a> <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 01:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>From the yahoo article: “Apparently the National Day of Slayer was promoted this year by a website affiliated with the American Nihilist Underground Society, who called on fans to listen to the band's music on June 6.” From the Houston Press article: “Many people who click on Anus.com aren't looking for philosophical treatises, but porn seekers just might end up finding enlightenment. A.N.U.S., an acronym for American Nihilist Underground Society….” Now, that’s the exact opposite of what you said. And you still have no response to the site’s mention in the Encyclopedia….because there isn’t anything to say about it. It’s mentioned in two mainstream press outlets, one of them in passing and one of them as the feature of the article. It is mentioned as a reliable and authoritative source in what’s pretty much the most reliable source aside from EM used for articles related to metal (the afore-mentioned Encyclopedia).

<li>I appreciate how you assume good faith, but to make myself more clear: it was original research before, <i>or</i> once distilled to verifiable claims (which it's really not yet, unless the GNAA became a useful source of commentary), it fails to assert any claim of notability. It fails WP:WEB, having not recieved a bona fide (let alone notable) award, and it doesn't pass WP:ORG any more than any other minimal organization needed to run a website. And yes, the coverage is trivial. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 15:17, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article has been rewritten 3 times already, the first was an obviously ANUS driven article, I wrote the second and Prolog has written the 3rd. Quite frankly each article is completely different from the previous, my article and prolog's articles were sourced and are not Original Research, you can go ahead and make that claim that it is original research but it isn't. Now you claim it hasn't recieved any awards. Yes it has! The Houston article is an award saying ANUS.com is the best nihilist website of 2006. This is reputable houston publication claiming this. There are also multiple article which are news coverage of ANUS pranks. You are welcome to claim there are no sources but there are. You are welcome to claim they are non-notable, but in fact they are. You are welcome to claim anything but just because you do doesn't mean your claim is accurate. I passes WP:WEB, it has multiple secondary sources, it is referenced, they are attributed with maintaining the Heavy Metal FAQ, they have recieved an award (so we have WP:WEB criteria 1 &amp; 2 covered), they are an organization who has recieved media attention for their pranks and have been awarded as such. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 16:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The news stories cited are predominantly not about this alleged organization. They reward it for being a good site (an award which fails WP:WEB because, as I said above, it is not a "notable award"—a random prize from a weekly newpaper's annual Restaurants issue with no independant coverage is not a Webby—the Houston Press "award" is not notable per WP:WEB#2 and WP:V), sources discuss ANUS.com in context of music, but they mostly don't cover the article's topic. That is, the reliable sources don't write about the underground as an actual organization (appart from folks who presumably run a website). The more on-topic the references are, the less reliable they are—a problem that was also suffered by the GNAA. If GNAA had been distilled to bare references like this article has, it would still not merit an article. I believe in the precendent set by GNAA and Jimbo Wales. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 22:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do you keep bringing up GNAA as precedent? It had no external links to any newspaper publication whatsoever. There is no precedent, it is a policy called <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If we read WP:WEB Criterion 2 we see: "The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization.[6]" and footnote 6 contains "Examples of such awards: Eisner Awards, Bloggies or Webby Awards. See Category:Awards for more. Being nominated for an award in multiple years is also considered an indicator of notability.". The award is from an independant houston based publication. That said do you think there are a lot of nihilism related awards? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 23:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I think there have been no <b>notable</b> awards given to anus.com. Notice that WP:WEB#2 even links to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> to stress its point. A non-sequitur sidebar to in a weekly's "best-of" restaurants issue which generates <i>no independant commentary</i> is simply not a notable award.</li>
<li>Actually, the GNAA <i>did</i> have an external link to a reputable daily newspaper, but I remember now that there was a significant difference. See <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=2283732005" class="external text" title="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=2283732005" rel="nofollow">the Scottsman article mentioning GNAA</a>. The Scottsman article was poor because it relied on wikipedia itself as a source, so you are right that this article has more independant verifiability than GNAA. I agree with Prolog that this article satisfies WP:WEB#1. I still believe WP:ORG shouldn't apply when the article's sources primarily refer to an organization in their capacity of maintaining a site. At any rate, <b>keep</b>, but the GNAA reference has got to go. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 00:04, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> in reply to JoshuaZ on my talk page: Criteria 1) The Yahoo and MTV articles mention ANUS relates trolls which were on a national level, Criteria 2) ANUS isn't really local in scope according to the slayer day related articles and the skull related articles and the astronaut bones related article. <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> Notability Requirements 1) They are included in third party materials including some metal encyclopedia, they have been awarded for their website and various sites have written about their exploits. 2) They have some news coverage.

<p>The article Derivative of Secant Function does not seem to add any value to Wikipedia. The derivative of the secant function can be derived in one or two lines using the chain rule, the derivative of cos, and similar standard rules of calculus; it is pointless to derive it from the limit definition of differentiation (which requires much more work and is therefore only used to derive the most basic rules of differentiation).</p>
<p>Are we going to have an article on "Derivative of X" for all <i>X</i> using this pointlessly cumbersome machinery? Possible? Yes (given infinite time). Useful? No.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(I should mention that the proof is also incomplete. It relies on the fact that sin(x)/x goes to 1 as x goes to zero, but needs to also show that (1-cos(x))/x goes to zero.)</dd>

<li><s>First, a riposte to the preceding comment: Wikipedia is expressly *not* for new concepts, it is for concepts that are well established. New concepts are original research, which is not appropriate for Wikipedia. Had we been around a century ago, we wouldn't have accepted an article on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Relativity_1cb0.html" title="Special Relativity">Special Relativity</a> even if ( well, actually, especially if ) it had been posted by <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> himself, if it were not adequately referenced and demonstrably notable.

<li>I figured out what was going on. It is because I have been refreshing my browser after an edit conflict rather than clicking the edit link anew. Apparently, that removes the edit that caused the conflict.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article coming from a charismatic christian, it seems that this expression is mostly used in these closed christian communities and is not known much to laizistic people. Googling gives LOTS of references. Even if the author is notoriously trying to AfD articles describing sexual slang by pretending that there are no sufficient source references, that is no reason to do the same to him (that's just retaliation). I find that article very interesting and vote for keeping.

<li><b>Delete</b> - regardless of how it's ended up on AfD, I can't find evidence that this phrase is used widely enough to justify a keep. Since double standards have been mentioned, I agree that consistency is important, and double standards should be eliminated. But there's a reason that I voted delete here, and keep at "wanker". First, wanker is a much more commonly used term than prairie muffin (over two million Google hits, versus 878). Second, and more importantly, there are reliable dictionary sources that at least define the term "wanker", including saying how it's usage has evolved over the years. I can't find a single dictionary source that even mentions the term "prairie muffin". If you can find one, I'll be happy to reconsider my vote. If "prairie muffin" is really a widely used term among <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_Christians_7cbd.html" title="Evangelical Christians">Evangelical Christians</a>, I wouldn't mind if a small mention of it was made in that article, or somewhere similar. However, if it's only used by a small minority within that community, I don't think it belongs there. In any case, I don't see enough information to justify its own article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 07:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
