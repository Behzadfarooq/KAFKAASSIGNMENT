<p>There is extensive discussion on the talk page which outlines the problems with this article. In a nutshell, it is all based on an article (published ten years ago) by one person. In the past decade absolutely nobody else has ever backed this theory. There have been no scholarly analysis of this theory. It is a new urban legend as the article itself even notes. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 20:56, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article is based on a paper published in a <s>peer reviewed</s> journal, there is no evidence that that paper is wrong, but there is little other work done on ethnic variation in relative toe lengths. There is a fair amount of scientific interest in relative finger lengths as indicators of prenatal hormone exposure, a topic this ought to be related to. There is some recently published work on relative big to second toe lengths as a function of the individual's sex, but none on variation between groups (at least not in humans). The term "Celtic toe" appears to be something of a neologism, and at least one other peer reviewed publication has documented this so-called Celtic toe in another ethnic group (in India). There is no data presented to support the claim that only Celtic descended individuals have this foot shape (and such a claim is not made in the primary source for the article). Likewise, the claim of a dominant Mendelian genetic basis is totally unsupported (and contradicted by other published research). This article could be the basis of an interesting article, or subsection of an article, on ethnic variation in foot morphology, but it doesn't really cut the mustard in it's present form. Much of the material is of real scientific worth, but it's presented on a slant that makes it very OR and subject to verifiability problems. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 22:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Author cited in both Discover Magazine, and Current Archaeology has made the claim that the foot and toe bones of the celts can be distinguished from the Anglo Saxons in the United Kingdom. She has clearly identified the remains at many ancient archealogical bruial sites. Her work is published on the web and in Discover Magazine as well as Current Archaeology. Her work even includes photos of the foot bones where you can clearly see what she is talking about. How can this not be relevant? How can this not be sufficient? Its good enough for Discover Magazine and Current Archaeology, but not Wiki-Pedia, where content is generated by random people on the internet? Please. There is more than enough citations (5) Infact it should have kept with the rather brief article and single citation that it started with. Its more than sufficent. She is both a podiatrist and an archeologist and a far better expert on this matter than any one posting here.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">Britton LaRoche</a> 23:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the number of people believeing in a theory is all you care about and everyone shared your views then Einstein would never have made his theory known, and it would have never been undertsood. Neither would have Gallileo. Besides, I already gave you two, how about Raymond E. Hunter? If he is not good enough, then perhaps he can site the other Archaeologists and podiatrists that worked with Dr. Jackson. I can dig up a third and a fourth, but I'm not going to, there is no need. Her work can stand on its own. Her credentials are sufficent. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">Britton LaRoche</a> 23:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Case in point. Who's credentials are acceptable? Her credentials are. Is Raymond Hunter any comparison? He listed two other podiatrists and additional archeologists in his article. They are out there, but their credentials will be no better than the credentials of Phillis Jackson. In fact, I doubt any one could touch her. How many English podiatrists turned archaeologist / anthropologist currently digging through English cemetaries are there in the world? I'm betting she's the top of the field if not the only subject matter expert.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> the citation given for Phyllis Jackson lacks accademic credentials, even in the article no real evidence for this phenomenon is provided (ie it is not based on research, no data are given as to the the differing frequencies of this phenomenon in England compared to other UK countries), only that she <i>noticed</i> that the foot shape was different. Has she written about this in a peer reviewed article, has she done any <b>real</b> research? Remember <i>Beware false authority.</i> and especially <i>Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence</i> (from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). I do not think this constitutes a Reliable source (and therefore breaches the verifiability policy). The article also doesn't give the alternative POV (and so is in breach of the NPOV policy), which is that English and Non-English British people are really very homogeneous biologically. <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/tcgapdf/capelli-CB-03.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/tcgapdf/capelli-CB-03.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Saxon/Briton question warranted further investigation. Chiropodist Phyllis Jackson's expert examination of the foot bone clarified the mystery - this was a native Briton. Radio carbon dating analysis revealed he died between 340 and 550 AD.</dd>

<dd>Phyllis Jackson has continued her work on foot bones from sites throughout the city. She has now studied over sixty burials, from excavations at Gambier Parry Gardens, London Road, St Oswald's Priory, Blackfriars and Southgate Street. Her research, which looks at the structure of the foot, provides evidence for ethnic and tribal origins, deformity, disease and way of life (for an introduction to Miss Jackson's work see Current Archaeology 144, pp466-70). As always, volunteers and work experience students have provided invaluable assistance with improving the documentation and storage of archaeological material held at the unit. RA</dd>

<dd>I think that there has been no evidence that this phenomenon is specific to non-English British people. One cannot make a definitive statement that English people have different feet to non-English people just through a generalised observation. The archaeological references are irrelevant, as these <i>assume</i> that this is a <i>real</i> phenomenon. Where is the evidence that this is indeed the case? You need an accademic article stating that there is a higher incidence of <i>Celtic toe</i> in the non-English British population than in the English one. This seems to be nothing more than someone making a claim and then applying it to archaeology, with no evidence that the claim is in fact correct. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Merge</b> with Morton’s toe. The problem with this article is that it over cooks the information and tries to make out that there is more to the evidence than their actually is. Because of the way it is worded, when I first stumbled across it I thought this was a recognised medical condition when only closer examination it is an interpretation of anecdotal evidence with one small study. I don’t think that this is an intentional distortion of the data by the author as has been suggested here, just the result of somebody getting to ‘into’ their subject, and not seeing the wood for the trees. We should <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">give them the benefit of the doubt</a>. I should also like to gently remind some of the people on this page of Wikipedia’s policy of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civility.html" title="Civility">civility</a>. You don’t have to agree, but please refrain from verbal attacks and abuse – it spoils it for everyone. Although the article can’t remain in its current state, (there are too many unfounded statements and weasel words) it can’t be denied that a) Celtic toe exists as a concept (even if it is an old wife’s tale) and that b) Somebody has tried to prove it scientifically and published it (regardless of how flawed the study is). I think therefore that this should be moved to a paragraph on Morton’s toe. Ideally I think this should contain a description of the myth, maybe taking a couple of the illustrations and then a couple of lines explaining what the study attempted to show, with the reservations clearly explained <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 12:28, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After what I percieved as a not so nice initiation process to Wiki-Pedia, I stitched my wounds and took some time to reflect on the experience. I'm a firm believer that human nature is basically good. We as people do not tend to misbehave unless we feel we have been mistreated. In genral, it is my opinion that ill will and bad feelings toward another is based on frustration and mis-understanding. It is hard not to let your emotions overide your sense of <b><a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a></b> when you are frustrated and feel you have been mis-treated.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>What Happened?</b> I believe that my bad experience was not due to either my nature or to the nature of the other people working here on Wiki-Pedia. Wiki-Pedia is a great concept and produces a lot of good. I think the reason why I had a bad newbie experience is because the Wiki-Pedia initial submission process could be improved. If we look at the process, Wiki-Pedia's current process is a <b>process of exclusion</b>, not a process of inclusion. Any one can submit, and then another must remove it if its not good enough. This causes pain and strife between those who submit and those who review. A minor change in the Wiki-Pedia process, can save the newbies from what appears to them as a severe bite. On the surface it may seem only a minor change in policy, but underneath it is a major change to the Wiki-Pedia psyche that will affect the well being of all those involved.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Wiki-Pedia, provider of light and wisdom to all for free. How does it work?</b> The concept of Wiki-Pedia is to let anyone contribute. Something is better than nothing. On the whole it works, because on the whole human nature is good. That being said, human nature is not always good. The problem with allowing any one to contribute is that it allows the lesser side, the dark side of human nature to rise and voice its opinion too. This leads to garbage contribution: lies, malicious rumors, untuths, vanity and self glorification posts which have nothing to do with the purpose of Wiki-Pedia. We as contributors, and <b>especially as editors</b> must be vigiliant and constantly clean up these things.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Ouch, Bad newbie! Bad!</b> The problem is that we newbies, good people new to the process, are basically ignorant of how it works. We are bound to make mistakes, and we are sometimes lumped in with the rest of the garabage. Feelings are hurt, and those who have great potential to contribute may leave and never return.</li>

<li><b>Don't Bite, Lick.</b> A suggestion and Possible Solution. Instead of tagging someones article as unverified after someone has spent time working on it, the suggestion is that all articles must start out with an unverified tag, and a note that it can or will be deleted. <b>(This can be accomplished through code or perhaps a default template setting for new users)</b> The editors job is now to remove the tags once they feel it is worthy of being part of Wiki-Pedia. We all mean well. We are all here for the dissemination of the truth, and basically put hard work in for free. We do this because we feel this is right, and because we believe in it. This kind of person should not be abused, either because they are doing their job as an editor, or doing their job as a newbie contributer learning the ropes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Little things add up.</b> A minor change in the process can make a major difference. When the article is first posted it is automatically marked with a tag that it is unverified and subject to deletion, until it has passed editorial review. The newbie has been educated. No ones feelings will be hurt by this. And... the best part is the editors are now viewed as the good guys by the newbies. They newbie hopes that an editor will come along and help him or her remove the tag. The Editors remove the unverified tag... or they submit it for deletion. The editor's main task now is to include the work. <b>The whole of Wiki-Pedia changes from a process of exclusion to a process of inclusion.</b>--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 17:28, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Everything is based on a single study over 10 years ago, which was not peer reviewed as far as I can tell, by an author who has not published anything in peer reviewed articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - OK that does not link to articles but rather a 68 pg document called "Current and Recent Research in Osteoarchaeology: Proceedings of the Third Meeting of the Osteoarchaeological Research Group (The Osteoarchaeological Research Group) (Paperback)" published in 1998 about their meeting in 1995. The ORG seems to be a hobbist organization - "The Osteoarchaeological Research Group (ORG) was set up in 1993 with the intention of bringing together anyone who works with or has an interest in human and/or animal remains. The core function of the group is to provide a forum for the exchange of news and ideas through quarterly newsletters and regular meetings. We are also interested in promoting the provision of careers advice and training in this field, providing information on services for specialists and considering standards for recording/reporting." - I can find no evidence that this organization has been notable in any way or has made any significant contribution to this area of endeavour. A cursory examination also suggests that none of it members are notable (again happy to be corrected and please do). So what we appear to have is a mention of a non-notable person in a non-notable book by a non-notable organization. I still find the evidence of notablity for this person and their claims to be lacking. Those who wish to keep need to provide something more solid than we have seen before. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 17:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><del><b>Keep</b></del> at least while it is still being investigated and reviewed. It will turn out to be a great article that with both promote fact and dispell fiction. My skin is thick now. I intend to correct the article on my own while we review it. I believe this can be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time as I am learning the rules of the game, and what a proper artcile is all about. We have done this because of many good comments and great suggestions given in this discussion. It is no longer one persons article, the feedback will shape it in to proper form through team effort.

<dd>Well, this is pretty near to my research interests, and I havn't heard of it. I've looked hard and can find zero evidence of it beyond the references originally provided by the editor. I do have one paper in my bibliography collection that deals with an ethnic group in India that has about 7 to 10% of the population with the second toe longer than the big toe, other than that I know of one other published study that finds sex differences in the relative lengths of these two toes in undergraduate students in Texas. That's all I'm aware of for humans.
