The Monarchy of Russia was abolished in 1917. The current Pretender is open to debate.</p>
<p>If one accepts H.I.H Grand Duke Vladimir Kyrillovich of Russia's morgantic marriage to H.S.H. Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhranskaya, a member of a junior line of the Bagration family as valid, and overlook his father's treasonous behavior during the Revolution then the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>H.H. Princess Maria Vladimirovna Romanovskaya b. 1953 (H.I.H. Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova of Russia)</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Georg von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1981 (H.I.H. Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov of Russia)</li>

<p>Georg and Maria's Russian styles are disputed hence the parentheses</p>

<p>Descendants of Maria of Leiningen would be excluded due to her morgantic marriage</p>
<p>If one accepts that the descendants of H.M. Nicholas II's sister H.I.H. Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia would be the next dynasts then the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>

<p><b>Ex-Mas Eve</b> is a 2006 film directed by Vsevelod Horodyskyj and produced by his company Silver Edge Films, and was filmed in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The screenplay won the 2005 Visions Film Festival Award, and in 2006 won two additional awards at Visions Film Festival. The movie is about how Rob, his brother Chris, and his best friend Alex all get dumped right before Christmas, and conspires to get back at their exes.</p>
<p>Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.</p>
<p><b>The Opening</b> The movie begins a few days before Christmas as Rob prepares to go to a Sci-Fi convention while Chris prepares to greet his fiancé on their anniversary. Meanwhile, Alex is attempting to contact his girlfriend who refuses to take his calls. As Rob attends the convention, Chris visits his girlfriend (Erica’s) apartment only to discover she isn’t there. Meanwhile, Alex visits his girlfriend (Kristin) who refuses to open the door to him.</p>
<p><b>The Dumping</b> Chris is disturbed that he can’t get in touch with Erica, and begins to believe that she wants nothing to do with him. Meanwhile, Rob returns from the Sci-Fi convention, and proceeds to go on a date with his girlfriend (Sarah). While on their date at a Mexican restaurant, Rob gives Sarah a bracelet, and she promptly dumps him, makes him pay for the meal, and then take her home where another man is waiting for her.</p>
<p><b>The Revenge</b> At breakfast, a frustrated Alex comforts a heartbroken Rob and a confused and saddened Chris, and Alex comes up with a plan to get back at the girls.</p>
<p><b>The Plan</b> Events begin to conspire as Rob is sent to follow Kristin, while Alex finds out more about the mysterious man in Sarah’s life. Chris meanwhile is still struggling with the idea that he and Erica are through. After Alex finds out the name of Sarah’s new beau, he goes to the Quick Print. Rob normally works there, but isn’t present because he’s running an errand for Alex, mainly following Kristin into Church and finding out what book she will be reading to her class of children. Meanwhile at the Quick Print, Jamie, Rob’s co-worker, approaches Alex and asks about Rob. Her interest in Rob is obvious, but Alex doesn’t seem to notice or care. Through an internet search, Alex discovers that Sarah’s new boyfriend is a rich jet-setter named Kyle.</p>
<p><b>The Deception</b> Alex begins leaving fake jewelry for Sarah, signed as a “Secret Admirer”, while Chris finally comes to terms with the fact that Erica wants nothing to do with him. Rob meanwhile keeps running into Father Henry while running errands as a part of Alex’s scheme, and with each encounter, Rob seems to become more and more distraught. Chris meanwhile, at Alex’s suggestion, makes a pair of fake plane tickets to Iceland, and sending them to Erica, making her believe they are going on a romantic vacation. Rob switches the book Kristin was supposed to read with one that has the inside defaced, and when Kristin sees it, she concludes Alex is behind it. Unfortunately, during the switch, Rob bumps into Father Henry, and Father Henry mentions Rob’s name to Kristin. Kristin then proceeds to track Rob down, though Rob gets Chris to meet her in his place. Jamie meanwhile continues expressing interest in Rob, first by giving Rob a Christmas gift, and later by checking out several DVDs of the Sci-Fi series Rob is obsessed with. Finally, Alex encounters and begins seducing Sarah, pretending to be (in an over-the-top accent) a Russian jet-setter. Sarah falls for him, only for Alex to leave her heartbroken, dressed in her best evening gown and ready to see the world.</p>
<p><b>The Resolution</b> Rob, discovering that the hero of his favorite sci-fi series is supposed to be in the area for a special conference, has to try and talk Kristin into helping him, while not revealing his identity. While they’re talking Father Henry walks by and acknowledges Rob, which prompts Kristin’s wrath. Rob admits he was wrong, but stands up for Alex, and defends his friend. In a moment of clarity, Rob realizes he should confess everything to Father Henry, after which Rob returns home. While talking to Chris, Rob picks up a photo of Chris and Erica’s anniversary, reading off the date, which as it turns out, was a day after what Chris thought it was. Chris quickly rushes to meet Erica at the airport while Rob receives a phone call saying that he is invited to the conference. Meanwhile Alex returns from his final date with Sarah, and has a message on his machine from Kristin. Alex goes to Kristin’s apartment, while Chris just misses Erica, who finds out she has been duped. Chris follows Erica back to her apartment where they argue and finally make up. Alex and Kristin also make up, and Kristin forgives Alex for his prank.</p>
<p>Rob goes to the conference only to discover that he was a day late, and returns home to decorate the Christmas tree alone. In one of the movies most powerful scenes, Rob opens Jamie’s gift to discover that it is a rare autograph of Rob’s hero, something that he had never been able to obtain. Rob dashes off to meet Jamie as she’s getting off work and the two ride off as the movie shows Alex and Kristin cuddling on the couch and Chris and Erica visiting the National Christmas Tree.</p>
<p>Spoilers end here.</p>
<p>Vsevelod Horodyskyj originally wrote the script based on his own break-up, and the script was originally supposed to only be about the two brothers. However, as it developed, the character of Alex grew and the story began to be about all three main characters. The project was initially conceived to be Horodyskyj’s Masters Thesis project as a student of American University, but grew to become a feature length film. With a budget of roughly $20,000, the film relied primarily on gifts, donations, and guerilla filmmaking. The actors worked primarily as volunteers and included:</p>
<p>Joshua C. Mims as Rob Motley Jefferson Smith as Chris Motley Bret Terrill as Alex Karlen Lori Lewis as Kristin Jacobs Megan Lee as Erica Tanley Rachael Barainca as Sarah Thomas Randahl N. Lindgren as Father Henry Ann Limberger as Jamie David Sullivan as Kyle Matthew McClain as Ned</p>
<p>The film is now being distributed through Silver Edge Films.</p>
<p>Trivia The series that Rob is obsessed with, Space Cadets, was entirely fictional. All of the merchandise, props, and the set dressings featured in the Sci-Fi convention scene were created for the movie by Vsevelod Horodyskyj. Two short bits of Space Cadets, one a clip from an episode, and another containing the CGI heavy opening intro were created for the movie but were subsequently deleted. They can be found on the deleted scenes.</p>
<p>The book Alex is reading in bed is “The Unofficial Macguyver How-to Handbook” which was co-written by Bret Terrill who plays Alex.</p>

<p>The <b>Société de l'histoire de France</b> (SHF) was established in 1833 at the instigation of the French minister of Public Instruction, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Guizot_842e.html" title="François Guizot">François Guizot</a>, in order to contribute to the renewal of scholarship fuelled by a widespread interest in national history, typical of the Romantic period. Most leading French historians of the 19th and 20th centuries have been elected to its annual presidency, and members have contributed a vast quantity of critical editions of texts and documents relating to French history, mainly chronicles, memoirs, and letters. Its field was initially limited to the period before 1789, but the SHF later absorbed the Société d'histoire contemporaine (1927).</p>
<p>Its series of texts and its periodicals (<i>Bulletin</i> and <i>Annuaire</i>, combined since 1863 under the title <i>Annuaire-Bulletin de la Société de l'histoire de France</i> ABSHF), consist of more than 500 volumes. The SHF gathers twice yearly for a lecture on a historical subject and, on occasions, holds conferences for a wider audience (latest to date, on family archives from medieval times to the present, in 2006).</p>
<p>A large proportion of all volumes published by the SHF up to 1935, including the complete series of its three periodicals, can be accessed on-line through the digital library of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr" class="external text" title="http://gallica.bnf.fr" rel="nofollow">Gallica</a>. The SHF website provides bibliographical resources: the complete catalogue of their publications (with links to Gallica, when relevant), and the general index of articles and documents published in the <i>Annuaire-Bulletin</i> from 1911 to the present.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-23_7c7a.html" title="Edit section: Wendelstein 7-X">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wendelstein 7-X</span></h2>
<p>Wendelstein 7-X is an experimental stellarator currently being bult by the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik (IPP), which will be completed by 2012. It is a further development of Wendelstein 7-AS. The purpose of Wendelstein 7-X is to evaluate the main components of a future fusion reactor built using stellarator technology, even if Wendelstein 7-X itself is not a fusion reactor.<br />
<br />
The goal of fusion research is to produce energy like in the sun. To ignite the fusion, the plasma has to be confined in magnetic fields and heated to 100.000.000 Kelvin. Wendelstein 7-X, when finished the largest fusion reactor using the stellarator concept, will be used to examine the usability for future power plants. It is planned to demonstrate up to 30 minutes of continous operation, demontrating an essetial feature of a future poewer plant: permanent operation.<br />
<br />
The name "Wendelstein" is an allusion to the experiments of the Princeton University, called "Matterhorn".</p>
<p><br />
(i really dont know how to produce a "Contents" section...)<br /></p>
<p><br />
Design and Main Components<br />
<br />
Wendelstein 7-X is mainly a toroid, consisting of 50 planar and 20 non-planar superconducting magnets coils, 3.5 m high, which induce a magnetic field that prevents the plasma to collide with the reactor walls. The 20 non-planar coils are used for adjusting the magnetic field.<br />
The main components are the magnetic coil, kryostat, plasma vessel, divertor and heating systems.<br />
<br />
The coils are arranged around a heat insulting cladding, 16 meters in diameter, the so called kryostat. A cooling device produces enough liquid helium to carry away 5.000W of heating power to cool down the magnets and their carrier (about 425 metric tons) to supercondutivity temperature. The Plasma vessel, built of 20 parts, is on the inside, adjustted to the strange shape of the magnetic field. It has 299 holes for heating anf observing the plasma. The whole plant is built of 5 almost identical modules, which are assembled in the hall of experiments<br />
<br /></p>
<p>2.1 "the hall of experiments": sounds strange.. its more or less the translation but for me (not native english) it does not sound like science, more like "lord of the rings"... please find a better term for that<br />
2.2. articel is NOT complete, but perhaps even without the rest of the german article interesting.<br />
2.3 please add links, i dont know how to do it, it quite late, i am going to bed now...<br />
2.3. maybe its just crap... then dump it!<br />

<p>A tumi is a ceremonial knife used by the Moche, a pre-Incan Peruvian culture. It is considered a national smbol of Peru. On November 21, 2006, archaeologists announced that they had unearthed 22 graves in northern Peru containing a trove of pre-Incan artifacts, including the first "tumi" ceremonial knives ever discovered by archaeologists rather than looted by thieves, according to The Associated Press. <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PERU_ANCIENT_GRAVES?SITE=WAOLY&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" class="external free" title="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PERU_ANCIENT_GRAVES?SITE=WAOLY&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PERU_ANCIENT_GRAVES?SITE=WAOLY&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</a></p>
<p>The tumi was a small crescent-shaped chopping blade, usually made of gold and ornately decorated. It was used for trepanation and ritual sacrifice of prisoners of war. <a href="http://www.inkawasitravel.com/peru-travel-information/peru-travel-history-culture/tumi-peru.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.inkawasitravel.com/peru-travel-information/peru-travel-history-culture/tumi-peru.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inkawasitravel.com/peru-travel-information/peru-travel-history-culture/tumi-peru.htm</a></p>

<p>The <i>Family Restaurant</i> is a reality television show now in its second season on the Food Network and Food Network Canada. It follows the Psalios family in Edmonton, Alberta as they experience the many trials and tribulations of running a restaurant – in their case three of them: Koutouki Taverna (Formally Souvla), Koutouki Ouzeri, Koutouki Taverna (Southside). The first season consisted of 6 episodes while the second has 10 altogether. This season finds the family scrambling to stay on top of business while they plan for a traditional Greek wedding in Cyprus.</p>

<p>Melrose, New York is a state-designated hamlet located within the town of Schaghticoke, in the county of Renssleaer of the state of New York. It is located about 4 miles north of Troy, 14 miles north of Albany, 20 miles from Saratoga, and 30-40 miles from Bennington, Glens Falls, Pittsfield, and Amsterdam. There are 88 redisential homes and four business located in Melrose. These include Esquire Food and Drug, on the corner of Route 40 and Church St; and 'Stuff n' Nonsense', a crafts store, located on the same corner. Getty gasoline, located slightly south on route 40, was open from at least the 80s, and closed in the spring of 2006. 'Meliti's Auto Repair' has been as staple in community for decades. Melrose was the location of a station on the Hudson and Maine railroad until the 1970s. Agriculture has been a significant industrial resource for the hamlet throughout its history. No other major industries have taken hold. Recent legislation has affirmed Melrose's future as rural as opposed to suburban, in stark contrast to its proximity to major cultural and economic centers. The most widely reputed grafitti within the hamlet limits reads "I will always love Lindsay Jones," although this was crossed out in the summer of 2006. Perhaps the love, exclamied by one Joshua Smith, has waned. Melrose is widely recognized as the best town to live in within the Hoosic Valley School District.</p>

<p>A Pricewiki has the idea of reverting the whole online price comparison experience. Instead of having retailers or third-party comparison sites (that often tend to be corrupt, only listing/updating the price of their paying costumers) listing prices of products, why don’t let the users do this themselves. Total prices without any hidden costs or corruption!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howmuchatyourplace.com" class="external text" title="http://www.howmuchatyourplace.com" rel="nofollow">HowMuchAtYourPlace.com</a> is the first example of this new wiki phenomena. While more users adds prices this could eventually grow into an excellent database for comparing cost of living in different countries and strengthening global costumer knowledge.</p>

<p>Pootle is an Open Source translation management system. The aim of a translation management system is to manage the process of translation from work assigment and goal setting to work distribution and validation.</p>
<p>Other features of Pootle include detailed statistics to monitor translation progress, a web-based translation editor and a number of checks to ensure consistant quality.</p>
<p>Pootle is used by a number of software developers to allow easy localisation of their software. Notable users include: Translate.org.za, localising various pieces of Open Source into the 11 official languages of South Africa. Creative Commons localising: ccHost, ccPublisher and ccSearch.</p>
<p>The software is released under the GPL and users are encouraged to host their own Pootle server. The project does host an official server at <a href="http://pootle.wordforge.org/" class="external free" title="http://pootle.wordforge.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pootle.wordforge.org/</a> which is used to translate Pootle itself and is also used to host certain projects or to test new features.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<hr />
<p>Pootle was developed to lower the barrier to entry for localisers. The systems currently employed to localise Open Source software can be very intimidating for skilled translators who are not familiar with Open Source. Thus a simple web-based system to allow easy contribution by new localisers was conceived.</p>
<p>Howver, since localisation is not the same as programming in that others can not easily verify the quality of work, Pootle also embraces systems to allows work to be monitored and checked and instritutes good process management as an aid to increasing quality beyond what localisers in software are currently achieving.</p>
<p><br />
History</p>
<hr />
<p>The software was initially developed by Translate.org.za to allow for the easy management of what they called Transalte@thons, or translation sprints. The software is now developed under the banner of the WordForge project.</p>

<p>In his youth he studied <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg_University_3e97.html" title="St. Petersburg University">St. Petersburg University</a>, and then pursued a career as a composer, studying with <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moritz_Hauptmann_8a18.html" title="Moritz Hauptmann">Moritz Hauptmann</a> at the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leipzig_Conservatory_cb3e.html" title="Leipzig Conservatory">Leipzig Conservatory</a>. He became a full-time cellist in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a> while continuing to compose in his spare time. He later became head of the St Petersburg Conservatory. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> he was given a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stradivarius.html" title="Stradivarius">Stradivarius</a> <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello.html" title="Cello">cello</a>, now <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davydov_Stradivarius_b76b.html" title="Davydov Stradivarius">named for him</a>, by Count Wilhorsky, a patron of the arts.</p>
<p>He intended to write an opera on the subject of <i>Mazeppa</i>. Viktor Burenin wrote a libretto for this purpose in 1880, but when Davydov proved unable to find the time to compose, Burenin offered to libretto to Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p>Note: Despite his links with Tchaikovsky, Karl Davydov was unrelated to that part of the Davydov clan into which Tchaikovsky's sister Alexandra and the composer <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov_f9a5.html" title="Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a> married.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing has recently been touted as an easy way to earn money. ‘No products required, just send traffic to someone else’s page and you get paid’, we are told. We here of affiliate marketers earning tens of thousands of dollars a month sitting at home. So what is affiliate marketing all about?</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing, simply put, is helping others sell their products. When you first sign up for an affiliate program, you are given a unique affiliate link. You then send people to this link. When people buy the product through this link, the one who created the products then pays you a certain percentage of the cost of the product as commission. In short, you get paid when someone buys his product through you.</p>
<p><br />
So how do I get started?</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to go to an affiliate marketing portal and sign up as an affiliate. Examples of such portals are&#160;: • www.clickbank.com<br />
• <a href="http://affiliate-program.amazon.com" class="external free" title="http://affiliate-program.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">http://affiliate-program.amazon.com</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.cj.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.cj.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cj.com/</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.clickbooth.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.clickbooth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickbooth.com/</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.clickxchange.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.clickxchange.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickxchange.com/</a><br />
• <a href="http://network.hydramedia.com/" class="external free" title="http://network.hydramedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://network.hydramedia.com/</a><br /></p>
<p>You will then be assigned a username (selected by you) which will be included in your unique links which will be called hoplinks. You then choose which products to promote, get the relevant hoplinks, and start sending traffic!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deciding which product to promote:</p>
<p>So how do you decide which product to sell? It is entirely up to you. A good way to choose products would be to follow your passion. This is because you will be more knowledgeable about something which you are passionate about and will understand the product better, therefore being able to create better adverts. Following your passion will also mean that you are less likely to give up halfway if you experience difficulties. On top of choosing a sector which you are passionate about, you should also choose one which has high appeal. Such stats will be reflected in the Affiliate marketing portals.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
How do I go about marketing the product?</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to go about doing this.</p>
<p><br />
PPC Advertising</p>
<p>Go to google.com. Enter any word in the search bar. When the search results are out, look on the right. Or you may have seen some ads on certain pages which carry the words ‘Ads by google’. This is an example of PPC or pay per click advertising. Basically you sign up for a PPC account at let’s say, google (<a href="https://adwords.google.com" class="external free" title="https://adwords.google.com" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com</a>). Now you craft an ad for your product. You choose the keywords with which you want your ads to be displayed. Lets say you choose internet as your keyword. Every time someone searches for internet on the search engine, your ad will be shown on the right. You can see the popularity of various keywords at invertory.overture.com. You will have to bid for your keyword. The bid is the amount you are willing to pay every time someone clicks on your ad. The lowest bid price depends on various factors. You can check the prices out at the ad words site. You will also have to choose your daily budget. Once your ad has been clicked such that you daily budget has been reached, google will stop displaying your ads for the day. Effective but can be costly</p>
<p><br />
Viral marketing.</p>
<p>This is an extremely effective form of marketing. You sign up at a viral marketing site. You add your site to the viral marketing site’s database. You then refer people to the site. You are their sponsor. They will be able to add their site to the viral marketing site’s database after they have viewed yours. And when they refer their friends to the site, your site will be shown to them as well. Some sort of a network marketing structure. Your site will eventually be dropped from the list after a certain number of levels, but is certain to have reached many people by then.

Writing Articles</p>
<p>Write articles on the particular SUBJECT MATTER, NOT the product you are selling on. Give a professional write up on that subject matter and place the link to your page at the end of the article. Submit your article to the various article directories.</p>
<p><br />
So how do I get payment?</p>
<p>Your payment arrangement will be made by the various portals.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Protecting yourself</p>
<p>Imagine you set up an affiliate account, choose the product to sell, spend a lot of time and money marketing the product. People go to your site and buy the product. But there is one problem, you did not get the money! Is this possible? Absolutely. Earlier, I mentioned that your affiliate ID will be part of your unique URL. Stealing your commission will not be too difficult. All I have to do is to replace your affiliate ID with mine and I get your money! Not very fair right? But it happens! In this section, I am going to explain how to prevent that from happening. The solution is to cloak or hide your links. How does this work? Let me explain.</p>
<p>You set up a ‘middle page’, a page which the affiliate link brings the customer to when clicked. This page then redirects to the intended sales page. When this happens, the customer will not be able to see the URL of the final destination and will therefore not be able to steal your commission. He will only be able to see the actual URL when he is on the page itself but its too late! Changing the affiliate ID after the page has loaded and refreshing the page will not fool the system. There is wonderful free software (The Relinker) to accomplish this task, also found in <a href="http://internetmarketingres.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://internetmarketingres.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://internetmarketingres.blogspot.com</a> .</p>
<p>Here is how the software works.</p>
<p>1. You enter you affiliate URL ( URL of the destination page) 2. You enter the title of the ‘middle page’ 3. You save the resulting HTML file 4. You upload the HTML file to your personal domain (e.g. www.yourdomain.com) 5. On the page containing the link, you link the affiliate link to the ‘middle page.’</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-23_7c7a.html" title="Edit section: Washington Glass School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Washington Glass School</span></h2>
<p>The Washington Glass School was founded to bring glass art and sculpture to the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States of America. Established in 2001, the Washington Glass School provides education for students, artists and the general public. It encourages research and exploration of new techniques in all aspects of glass (blown, cast, fused, cold worked) as well as other media such as steel, ceramics, lighting and concrete. Tim Tate and Erwin Timmers were the co-founders of the school, and in 2005, Michael Janis joined as Co- Director. Originally located in the Capitol Hill section of Washington, DC, the school relocated to Mt. Rainier, MD after the school was displaced by the District to allow construction of the baseball stadium for the new Washington Nationals baseball stadium. In 2006, American Style Magazine noted the impact the Washington Glass School was having on the studio glass movement (American Style Magazine, Filling Glass With Meaning, June 2006, p 32-37, Lee Lawrence).</p>
<p>Students and artists are encouraged to explore and develop technique and craft, but then to take their work to another level. Exploring content, which can range from narration to emotion, from personal reminiscence to political commentary, from play on words to musterings on faith, death and destiny is the mantra of the school.</p>
<p>Locations and Facilities: The Washington Glass School is located at 3700 Otis Street, Mt Rainier, MD, 20712, website:www.washglass.com</p>
<p>Background of Washington Glass School: Tim Tate is the Co-founder and is the Creative and Marketing Director. He has been working in glass for over a decade, attending classes at Pilchuck Glass School, Penland School of Crafts and the Studio at Corning. He also oversaw a casting production studio in New Orleans for three years. He is a sculptor who has been working in glass, steel, concrete and ceramic since 1989. Tate’s work has been shown in many galleries and museums including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum’s Renwick Gallery and Fraser Gallery.</p>
<p>Erwin Timmers is the Co-founder and is the Studio Director. Originally from Amsterdam, he graduated from Santa Monica College for Design Arts and Architecture. His sculptural artwork has been on display in the Zenith, Neptune, Fraser and Studio Galleries along with a number of private collections and commercial installations. His approach to art is multifaceted, incorporating metalwork, innovative lighting and glass. Timmers teaches glass, lighting, sculpture, and metal work.</p>
<p>Michael Janis is the Director of Architecture and Public Art. His architectural design projects have been published and won numerous national and international awards. Using his multidiscipline background, Janis coordinates studio production and manages the teaching assistants and school volunteers. Janis also teaches cast glass and plate glass techniques in the school, and has been a regular guest lecturer on Architectural Applications of Glass in Interior Design for the Corcoran College of Art and Design.</p>
<p>Examples of Janis and Tate's artwork were recently selected to be part of "50 Distinguished Contemporary Artists in Glass" by Lisa Hoftijzer. As a part of the publication of their book "Stained and Art Glass", authors Judith Neiswander (Fogg Art Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Arts) and Caroline Swash (St Martins College, London) invited over 500 contemporary artists in glass to submit examples of their work. Subsequently, distinguished appraisers in glass chose 50 artists who, in their opinion, represented "the best work of their generation".</p>

<p><b>Stephen Hilder, the man who fell</b></p>
<p>Stephen Hilden died in a skydiving ‘accident’ July 2003, the 20-year-old fell 13000ft to his death at Hibaldstow Airfield, north Lincolnshire while competing in a large skydiving event. To this day no one is sure how Stephen died. This because for every piece of evidence supporting suicide there is more evidence to prove somebody else took his life. It seems the evidence is 50/50.</p>
<p>“Skydiver 'may have taken his own life” “DNA test shows skydiver may have killed himself” “Skydiver death 'not suicide” “Police dismiss skydiver suicide claims” “Family plea over skydiver murder” “Skydiver probe: two freed on bail” “Family plea over skydiver murder”</p>
<p>As you can see the Headlines all give very mixed opinions, yet they are all taken from the same website in a relatively short space of time. Everybody was sure Stephen was murdered and yet nearly all the evidence pointed towards suicide.</p>
<p><b>The Evidence</b> After Humberside Police did a series of forensic tests they a found a pair of scissors in the 20-year-old’s car which had showed they had been used to cut the straps on his parachute "rig" and that only Mr Hilder’s DNA was found on them. The fibres from the cut straps were also found on the scissors.</p>
<p>Mr Andrews (deputy superintendent) said Mr Hilder had been drinking the night before with parachuting friends, but was not drunk. He was not under the influence of drink and drugs at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Mr Hilder had debts of more than £17,000, and thought that he had failed his military exams and that a relationship was coming to an end. There were no clear motives why anyone else would want to kill him though.</p>
<p>He may have tried to make his death look like murder. His girlfriend, Ruth Woodhouse, 25, of Stafford, said the couple had discussed committing the "perfect murder" after watching the film Murder By Numbers.</p>
<p>The death of Mr Hilder was unique – Tony Butler, an accident investigator with the British Parachute Association said he had never come across a total sabotage of a parachute system before. Not only were the main release cords cut but the emergency parachute system was sabotaged aswell.</p>
<p>He had recently converted from Christianity to Cathlolicism, in which case suicide would not have been an option.</p>
<p>Claire Johnson, a former girlfriend, recalled a conversation she had with Mr Hilder in which he spoke about death and his desire not to die young.</p>
<p>Early in the year police said they believed the killer had come from inside Britain’s tightly-knit skydiving community, but no motive was put forward and no-one was charged with his murder. Everbody left their kit in the same room, the doors would not have been locked. People trusted each other with the eqipment.</p>
<p>His most recent girlfriend also said "Even in hindsight I couldn’t find a single thing to suggest that he would have killed himself, or why anyone would kill him."</p>
<p>In a German case, a 31-year-old woman died after a spurned lover tampered with her equipment. He was caught and sentenced to life imprisonment. But in an American incident, in 1996, which was strikingly similar to the Hilder case, the saboteur was not found. An account of this attempted murder was found recently, at the dropzone, in an old issue of an American skydive magazine. Its was one of the few leads the police had.</p>
<p><b>What happened</b></p>
<p>Stephen jumped from the plane with his two friends, David Mason and Adrian Blair. At 4,000 feet the three separated so they could safely release their parachutes. This was the last anybody saw Stephen Hilder alive.</p>
<p>Around 3,000 feet from the ground he would have opened his pilot parachute, this would catch the air and pull a out a pin attached to the main one. Unfortunately the corld attaching the two parachutes had been cut and the pilot parachute simply fell away. The pin holding in the main parachute remain locked.</p>
<p>At about 10 seconds from the ground Stephen deployed his reserve, but all four webbings attaching the parachute to the harness had been cut so this to simply vanised into the sky.</p>
<p>At 750 feet his emergency device automatically tried to release his reserve parachute, Stephen had already manualy activated this device and it was to late.</p>
<p>Stephen did everything correctly. The truth is there was absolutly nothing he could have done to save himself. From the second he stepped off the plane he had no chance, whoever sabbotaged the parachute would have known this.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>To this day the police do not know who took Stephen Hilder life, whether it was an act of murder or suicide. Media interest preasurised the jury and coronor, the police also made vital mistakes.</p>
<p>The death of Stephen Hilder, aged 20 years old, will always remain a mystery.</p>
<p><b>Extra Information</b></p>
<p>The night before his death Stephen drove to petrol station a very long way from his home to buy a bar of chocolate, there were a few more petrol stations much closer to his house he could have drove to. He did not buy any petrol and there is no evidence he stopped any where on the journey to and from his house. There was virtualy no media interest on this fact.</p>
<p>When the police were doing on-site tests on the material used for the parachute straps, a pair of broken scissors were used to try and cut the strap. One officer missinturpreted this and the scissors in back of Stephen’s car were disgaurded as able to cut the strap. It was only till later on that the mistake was resolved. This means the scissors could have been tampered with.</p>

<p>Bang Pop is a sub-genre of urban music music which first emerged in Los Angeles in the mid 2000s, ostensibly a hybrid of Pop, R&amp;B, and Gangster Rap. The music's sound is typified by a production style that is at once Rap/HipHop [or urban] and pop. A Bang Pop song will typically have two vocal styles within a song: pop/rnb singing, and hard rapping.</p>
<p>Lyrical content in Bang Pop music tend to center around typical urban music subject matter: getting and romancing women, sex, gang banging, bragging, street fashion, the drug trade, dissing enemies, gun fetish, archery, expensive jewelery.</p>
<p>The name Bang Pop refers directly to both the lyrical content of the music and the composite nature of the production: Gang Bang + Pop.</p>
<p>The most obvious proto-Bang Pop artists are Nate Dogg, Warren G, and their group 213. Nate Dogg and Warren G's song "Regulate" is considered the piece of music that gave birth to the genre.</p>
<p>The current flag bearing artist for the Bang-Pop is a group called Professional Assassins [Los Angeles] who claim to have invented the sub-genre. Professonal Assassins Bang Pop anthem, "I Want Your Jyne", can be heard in the 2006 film Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny.</p>
