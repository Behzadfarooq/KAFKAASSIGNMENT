<p>2nd nom. I believe <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jonathan_Zizmor_17c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jonathan Zizmor">first AfD</a> was wrongly decided.</p>
<p>Zizmor is a NN dermatologist. Advertises a lot on the subway, so is well known due to weird name and ads plastered in every other train car, but otherwise completely fails the multiple <u>non-trivial</u> published works test. He's just a doctor in Manhattan. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 06:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - no sources cited in article, very little notariaty outside of being 'that guy on the subway signs' in NYC. Very few g-hits that are relevant.

<li>As I basically said above, all this coverage is cute, but trivial. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 06:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Although I would argue the subject easily passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and the published works are not trivial, your opinion of the subject being trivial might not be contended, actually, and alot of people might find something like this <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">interesting</a>. Even "trivial" subjects have a home in WP (<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelyne.html" title="Angelyne">Angelyne</a> cited above is an excellent example). I think write-ups by two of the most prestigious publications in the US is quite a good case for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verification</a> on its interest value. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 07:16, 20 November 2006 (UTC)... (additional comment), In <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "trivial coverage" refers to "newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths." Under WP:BIO's definition, the articles cited are decisively <i>non</i>-trivial. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 15:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable enough for the city's two most important publications (sorry <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>) to feature. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 06:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I don't see how he meets the criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Just because he is a nice bit of trivia for native New Yorkers doesn't mean that he is notable. What has he done to make himself remembered in the field of dermatology other than spending a lot on advertising? <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 11:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He's indeed not notable in the field of dermatology. He is however, apparently, responsible for a particularly famous advertising campaign, so the article should be (and indeed is) written mainly around that. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 12:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> How does that satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Zizmor is famous. It's for something tacky--relentless self-promotion--but I think the argument is being made here that "tacky" equals "trivial to the point of irrelevance". It's very clear the "non-trivial" part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to the depth of content written in articles about the subject, not any editor's opinion about the importance of subject, and that's being ignored here. The <i>New Yorker</i> piece shows his cultural notability--as soon as I saw this AfD I remembered that piece. If you search nytimes.com for "Zizmor" you get 23 hits, 20 of which are about him. In an <i>NYT</i> article about <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshivat_Chovevei_Torah_7052.html" title="Yeshivat Chovevei Torah">Yeshivat Chovevei Torah</a>, which you can read on their <a href="http://www.yctorah.org/content/view/32/11/" class="external text" title="http://www.yctorah.org/content/view/32/11/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the fact that Zizmor's on the board of the school is worthy of mentioning, and not just in a list. There are several other <i>NYT</i> articles that are features about him. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 15:32, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I wouldn't go to him, but he's been a pretty common household name (if at least for comedic value) for awhile now. Press coverage meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 16:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Article asserts notability, this notability is backed up, has significant references in reliable print media. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 16:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable except for TV ads in one city. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The central premise of Zizmor's career is that he advertises in the <i>subway</i>, not on television. Maybe he runs TV ads, I don't know--the article and other contributors don't mention television. Here are Edison's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edison_b596.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edison">contributions</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 18:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>quick comment</b> "... in one city."? Do you mean 8 million-plus populated <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>? --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 20:56, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe Edison was referring to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_metropolitan_area_ab27.html" title="New York metropolitan area">New York metropolitan area</a> instead, with a population of 18,747,320--only a couple million fewer than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 21:06, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> He could be referring to the 18 million in the New York metro area, but i think he was commenting that there are still 282 million that probably haven't heard of him. He spent loads of money on advertising. Does that mean we are now going to say that every guy that has funny car dealership commercials gets to have an article? <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 08:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wonder how many funny used-car dealers have <i>New Yorker</i> articles written about them, have <i>New York Times</i> features written about them? I feel like there are three camps of people arguing this AfD. One group says, he meets the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it is impossible to deny the cultural relevance of America's newspaper of record and, arguably, most award-winning magazine, so the rules are the rules and he passes. Another group says, weak or very weak keep. The article passes, but.... And the last group wants to delete the article, so they ignore the notability rules, or interpret them with a usage of the word "trivial" that ignores <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>'s very clearly stated definition of the word (<i>Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail.</i>) I think that there is an inherent bias in most serious Wikipedians--we don't like self-promotion. If you hang around here, and work on deletion work in particular, you see a slew of folks that want to use WP to promote themselves or their product in an inappropriate fashion. This guy <b>isn't one of those people</b>. He paid cash for his self-promotion, both in money and, more importantly, in dignity. He's a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, a medical doctor who flogs a vastly over-hyped product (fruit-acid peels) to the gullible segment of the middle class, with an affordable payment plan. He's an American archetype, an embarrassment, a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine_show.html" title="Medicine show">medicine show</a> of the late twentieth century. He's been advertising on the train since the 70s, before HMOs got big, when doctors still were looked up to, still got respect just for being doctors. He's an embarrassment to some people in the medical community, an embarrassment to some Jewish people, a creepy airbrushed face grinning down at you with the smugness of the flip side of the American Dream. And he's done it all in New York City, the advertising capital of North America, and is the most notable face of the cheapening of respect for medical doctors in this city. I've got no sources to back me up, but this guy is one of the people who were in the right place at the right time to set the example to the people who design the medical advertising for the entire country, to push its tone in a more commercial direction. No, you don't necessarily know who <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Zizmor_0810.html" title="Jonathan Zizmor">Jonathan Zizmor</a> is, but you've seen advertising for medical doctors that has been influenced by the man. And that's why he gets the coverage in national cultural publications that he most undeniably has received, and also why you don't like him very much. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 20:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
