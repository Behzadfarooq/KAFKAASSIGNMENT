<p>This is an indiscriminate list, contrary to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a>. The list invites continuous addition of entries that violate <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. The fact that these people are bisexual is not why they are notable. The list itself adds up to a major POV conflict. Some of this information is includable, as it is cited, but the place to do that is the persons entry, not such a list. <b>Delete and salt</b>.</p>

<dd>Sourcing is not the problem I have with the articles, per se. Although the articles invite unsourced material, and would require continuous policing. My real problem is the fact that as a collection of names, the list itself is non-notable. whether certain notable people are LGBT or not may be notable for certain people, aI agree... but this article creates a pro (or con) POV slant... and does not by itself provide encyclopedia context.... what next? List of right-handed people? List of people who like turnips? People who...... the list could go on. But not appropriate for wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 03:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you can't tell whether its a pro or con slant, there probably isn't a POV slant at all. The fact that people are gay, lesbian or bisexual is far more significant than that they like turnips. It would be great if we can say sexuality is no big deal. But actually it is. The fact that people come out as gay etc. is a clearly notable fact about them and worthy of being catalogued in an encyclopedia. The examples you cite in comparisson are clearly trivia, this list is not. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I could not disagree with you more. Every time an interviewer asks a celebrity if they are gay, I cringe.... because I actually do not want to know such a personal detail about somebody. If I can live my whole life without needing to catalog all the gay people in the world, why can't everyone? If the Rosie O'Donnell article and the Ellen Degeneres article say that they are lesbians, based on obvious tons of citable reliable sources, I have no problem with it... but what encyclopedic need does a person have who says "I wonder who all the gays are in the world?" <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete and salt</b> Article subject is by nature far too indiscriminate. List of straight people is not specific/notable enough for an article; I don't see why this case is different.

<li>The vast majority of people are straight, making this utterly non-notable. The same reasoning explains why <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_left-handed_people.html" title="List of left-handed people">List of left-handed people</a> exists but List of right-handed people does not. Similarly there is no need to have a list people with the normal number of fingers, but there is a list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_polydactyl_people.html" title="List of polydactyl people">List of polydactyl people</a>.

<dd>aside from inciting an emotional response and inflaming this discussion, what possible purpose could the African American statement above serve? This discussion is not about race, national heritage, or turnip-liking. It is about an indicscriminate list. IF (capitalized on purpose) LGBT people <i>need</i> to know other LGBT people, they do not necessarily <i>need</i> to get that information from wikipedia. Wikipedia inclusion policies are about the encyclopedic content of the articles, not about fulfilling needs of selected groups of readers. If the vast majority of people are to be presumed to be straight as you said, then we can presume that the vast majority of readers will not have the need you described to find this list here.<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

Seriously, the maintainability concern raised by several people above is valid, as more people are willing to openly identify as L, G, or B. It may be impossible to include everyone who fits the criteria. Also, the sourcing for these lists has to be as stringent as possible. But I think the list serves a useful research purpose, and its format allows it to include information that a category can't. (And hopefully no one disputes that the various categories about sexual orientation are useful...) I'm not sure, however, that there's value in maintaining a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bisexual_people.html" title="List of bisexual people">List of bisexual people</a> separate from the other lists; it might be better to <b>merge</b> that one. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 05:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To address Allon's point above, if public figures wish to keep their sexuality a secret, then they can and they aren't on the list.

<dd>Because bisexuality is a separate sexuality from homosexuality, so it deserves its own list for people who want to look up bisexual people: however, when people look up the list of GLB people they're more looking for "not straight" people rather than just gay people. So the distinction's there if people want it, but the GLB list is the main one people look for.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - as one of the people who has worked on this list recently, please keep this. This is hardly an unworthy list, while yes, sometimes sexuality doesn't matter in the lives of people, for many it does (see <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cadmus_868b.html" title="Paul Cadmus">Paul Cadmus</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_of_Finland_c289.html" title="Tom of Finland">Tom of Finland</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Clifford_Barney_8624.html" title="Natalie Clifford Barney">Natalie Clifford Barney</a>.). There is a movement with this list towards making sure that every entry is cited with reliable references and this is on many watchlists to make sure that extraneous and uncited entries are removed. To tell you a little story, when I was just coming out of the closet myself, seeing a similar list (Wikipedia didn't yet exist), helped me adjust to being gay. To be able to see this list gave me something to feel good about: to know that I was in the company of many great men and women. As a gay man, yes this list is important to me, but it's also important information; hardly indescriminate. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 14:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The sexuality of a person considered otherwise famous is, for the most part, trivial information. It's not really something which should be handled via a list like this due to the sheer size of the list which could require massive change at any time. For example, Anne Heche was for a while Gay, then she decided she was Bi, now (IIRC) she's decided she's Straight. So will the list contain people who are LGBT at the moment (which would require DAILY changes of many different entries on the list), or will it include everyone who was once LGBT (which could lead to WP:LIVING violations if the person now objects to the term)?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>While the comparison to left handed people may be correct in terms of the scale of the list, the scope of what is required to maintain the list is entirely different. Someone cannot one day reveal that while they have been pretending to be right handed for years, they actually favor their left. Likewise, switching from right or left handed to ambidexterity requires months of training. Statistically, someone who is left-handed today is going to be left-handed in ten years. The same is not true of a person's sexuality. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 15:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> (by nominator). Thanks Dev920 for what I consider to be the only lucid and productive argument here for keep. Based on your statement "if these lists are kept, I will ensure they all reach the same standard as A-E within this month." I would be willing to concede and withdraw my nom, and give you a chance to do so.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list needs a lot of work, but given how it should look when it's cleaned up, I think it's necssary and encyclopedic. Dev920 has been working like a dog, with myself and a few others chipping in, and the state of the list is gradually improving. Openly LGBT people are a minority, and bisexual people a minority within a minority. To suggest that non-heterosexual orientation is of no consequence amounts to ignoring the contents of every article in <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a>, first and foremost the concept of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">coming out</a>. This needs to be a list more than a category because sourcing is <i>such</i> an important aspect of this (per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>) and because elaboration is needed. While there have been arguments about who should be included in the list (see talk page) I still think this list can and should be on par with Wikipedia's list standards. Don't give up on it yet. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 11:20, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, The list is just as deserving of a place on Wikipedia as any of the other relevants lists such as the lists of African-Americans, Irish-Americans, Left-handed individuals, etc. The requirement was that these individuals are already notable. I believe the list <i>does</i> merit inclusion. Face it, anyone notable identifying as GLBT (like it ot not) makes news. It is obviously of interest to <i>someone</i> if it is till newsworthy. <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 11:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes I have, and let's quote from a few: "Delete and salt", how should we interpret "delete and salt" repeatedly used above? is this an allusion to Sodom and Gomorrah perhaps -- words not chosen at random -- or is it an allusion to Rome's treatment of Carthage after years of bitter warfare? In either instance, it's abusive. Then there's the "Delete with fire", when burning of homosexuals was common. Would anyone seriously entertain analogous phraseology like "lynch this article" if used in relation to an African American subject or "gas and burn this article" when used in relation to a Jewish subject. Then there's a few who write from their hearts: "I like many others am personally uncomfortable with classifying people according to their sexuality, because I think people should be allowed to keep their sexuality a private matter if they want to" Gosh, notable people should be able to keep everything else private too, right? Let's delete all private things, even if they've can be found in a verifiably public source, like all that watergate stuff from Nixon's biography, after all I'm sure he would have prefered to keep that a private matter too.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yeah, <i>right</i>. How about this one from the person who proposed the deletion: "<i>Every time an interviewer asks a celebrity if they are gay, I cringe.... because I actually do not want to know such a personal detail about somebody."</i> That doesn't sound just slightly as though <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">User:Jerry lavoie</a> wants the list gone for . . . personal reasons? <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 20:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misinterpret my words, ExRat, try a small dose of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, it actually tastes good. My point was that when interviewers ask Clay Aiken over and over again if je is gay, after he has definitively stated he is not... I feel bad for him. The same thing happened to Ricky Martin. Not that being gay is bad... being constantly asked about it in public after clearly stating you don't want to be, is humiliating. My worry about these lists is that wikipedia could perpetuate such humiliation by providing such a visible and clearly abused vandal target. As I stated above, since the LGBT wikiproject pledges to patrol these articles, my concern is abated. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 02:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I know there are people who say that lists and categories can exist side-by-side, but I really feel that this is better handled with a category rather than trying to list potentially thousands of people, inviting the addition of NN names as well as the inevitable "let's play a joke on my friend and list him as gay" nonsense. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is an unpleasant undertone of homophobia in the way this list is treated - as if bisexuality were something odd or 'tabloidy' or wrong.
