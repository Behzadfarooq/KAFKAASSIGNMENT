<p>I believe that this is a non-notable messageboard. We don't, for example, have an article about the University of Michigan's forum. Or most university forums for that matter. ~<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazytales56297_dddb.html" title="User:Crazytales56297">crazytales56297</a> - <a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazytales56297_04a5.html" title="User talk:Crazytales56297">t</a>-<font color="green">e</font> 23:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Zeppelin: Who are you to judge what is notable or not. If the University of Michigan forum wishes to have a piece about it then it is not any of my business. The Sin Boards are a great resource for people to interact with in a college setting where they are not judged by their appearance or their position in society but mearly by their words and actions. That is a great thing and something that should be remembered and the community that is created online should be fostered. Not distoyed by someone with an inflated sense of self importance. Also how is this not of note. Reading through the opinion on the board you get the real ideas and thoughts of people in Ireland. For instance of the links is to a debate on Northern Ireland. With sides of the arguement that are never heard outside of Ireland. Have a read of that thread and see if you don't learn something about the conflict in Northern Ireland that you would not hear about in America.

<li>Paddy: Indeed, Zeppelin is right on the ball. With the ever-increasing fees slowly creeping into the Irish third-level education system, the prospect of people being "left behind" in society grows greater each day, i.e. the less well-off members of society. Great strides have been made by the Department of Education and Science in recent years to increase the number of those people from the bottom end of the income ladder who are most at risk of being excluded from receiving a full education. Various initiatives have resulted in totals losers (up to that point), making it through. Now, you may ask how the Sin Boards fits into this? Well, it's like this: on reading the Sin Boards, you will quickly see that the posters on the Sin Boards are nothing more than the dregs of society, scrapped from the bottoms of buckets littered throughout the west of Ireland. These people struggle through the system, not because of the support offered by the insitution itself, but in spite of it. The Sin Boards members collectively provide a full support system for students who fail exams, miss their annual registration, can't find appropriate accommodation within which to base their studies in an already difficult environment, get into serious financial difficulty or just find their housemates to be really annoying. It offers an opportunity for members to discuss the best and worst moments of their day from seeing a nice flower near your house to having to walk to college on a rainy day, similar to how Americans openly discuss their "feelings" and then give out about people prying so deeply into their lives. In addition, it's the oldest and most successful forum in any educational institute in Ireland, some achievement for a small university in the west of Ireland. The forum picks up some three million hits per year. Multiple awards collected over recent years make testament to the success of these Boards. If the University of Michigan chooses not to set up something to support those unfortunate people from the lowest rung of society in their particular area, good for them, but I feel that the Sin Boards are something to be proud of. (And that's all from a neutral, not involved in any way whatsoever, not even a little bit, standpoint.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.203.7.33 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.203.7.33_db9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.203.7.33">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Perspective</b> Most of the posts in favour of deletion are reasonable however a lack of local knowledge is blinding you to the genuine usefulness of the boards. Galway has a population in the region of 80,000 people. The university has a student population in the region of 15,000. I can understand completely that from your perspective, the boards are insignificant but given the size of the university population in relation to the size of Galway as a whole, I can assure you, the boards are more significant than you realise. - Triangler <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.42.29.112 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.42.29.112_4e9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.42.29.112">contribs</a>) 2006-09-20 23:43:36 (UTC)</small>

<li>The size of a university undergraduate population relative to the population of Galway has nothing whatsoever to do with whether Wikipedia should have an article about some discussion fora on a web site. Please base your arguments on our <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>. The relevant ones have already been linked to. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I certainly wouldn't make an article about the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Waterloo_4517.html" title="University of Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a> forums. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo%2C_Ontario_d76e.html" title="Waterloo, Ontario">Waterloo, Ontario</a> has a population of roughly 110,000, about one quarter of which are students. Regardless, the forum doesn't meet criteria in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> All of the forum members attempting to save this article are certantly passionate about the forum, and have established that it serves a purpose. However <i>every</i> message board serves a purpose. As useful as it may be, it is not notable enough for an article per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> While I note that the article itself does not assert its own noteworthyness, I'm sure that if the person who put the content there in the firstplace read the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, they probably would have inserted the necessary proof. However my understanding of Wiki Entries is that initial entries are skelleton entries there for others to add to, and after some of the material from this page is inserted into the main article, then the article will have proven itself noteworthy. as per the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Well it doesn't really matter to regualr users of the boards but a wiki entry could help more people in college in N.U.I.G. find our site and the resources it contains. If you want wiki to be fully comprehensive then leave it. I doubt that it will be left but i ask you: why the hell not? - toiletduck</li>
