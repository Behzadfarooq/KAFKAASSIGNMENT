<li><b>Keep</b>. Freedom of assembly. Surely anything beginning with the "Wikipedia:" prefix doesn't need to meet encyclopedic criteria for notability in any case, because they're not articles, they're internal housekeeping.

<li>And why shouldn't people be allowed to murder? They'll do it anyway.
<ul>
<li>Ah, but this is a different scenario – people associating with one another on the basis of shared affinities does not, in itself, constitute any infringement on anybody else's rights (unlike murder). Given that, the process might as well be open, because secret arrangements are more likely to develop a nefarious character. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartierLatin1968_0d61.html" title="User:QuartierLatin1968"><font style="background: red" color="black">Quartier</font><font style="background: black" color="gold">Latin</font></a> <a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuartierLatin1968_3a4e.html" title="User talk:QuartierLatin1968"><font color="red"><i>1968</i></font></a> 17:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't articles normally start with an explanatory paragraph? I am unwilling to read each users comments to learn what Green means to them.

<li><i>Comment</i>* Comet 7 is fairly well known in the webcomic community and a google search fo "Comet 7 Webcomic" retuned around 3,470 hits and a search for just "Comet 7" returns around 3,170,000 hits <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJCS_ac29.html" title="User:JCS">JCS</a> 22:01, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>WTF? "comic 7 Webcomic" got we one google hit. This page. Are you forgetting the quotes? Anyway <b>delete</b>. Webcomics and blogs, being self-published, need a very high level of notability. This is why we don't include vanity press authors in general. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:55, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Technically, neither of those search strings is useful. <i>Comet 7 webcomic</i> without the quotes will get everything with the word Comet, the number 7, and the word webcomic anywhere in the text; <i>"Comet 7 webcomic"</i> will exclude any mention of "Comet 7" that isn't immediately followed by the word "webcomic" (the phrase "Comet 7 webcomic" doesn't seem like it would be common even if the comic were popular). <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 00:58, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, I wouldn't have even bothered searching "comet 7 webcomic" if it weren't for JCS's unlikely result. I didn't mean to imply that my search was supposed to mean anything, just that his was defective. Certainly <i>comet 7</i> without quotes would yield literally millions of results that have nothing to do with this comic. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:22, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Which is the sole reason I hate it when people use either Alexe og Google to verify if something is "popular" or not. Ex. My site is ranked 600,000 on Alexa but is the biggest Anime and Manga community in Norway, we have well over 1 million hits each month, and for a Norwegian site that's good. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a> 07:52, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, Duke Nukem Forever has been in development for 8 years, I remember I was excited about this game when I was 16 years old.

<li>It seems, then, that it is part of a series of popular games, which would make it highly anticipated. The level of detail of your knowledge of the development of the game would also indicate that it was highly anticipated, even if most people have now lost hope of it coming out.

The disputed page is a strong POV against Islam but the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_Slavery_574a.html" title="Islam and Slavery">Islam and Slavery</a> page is the polar opposite, essentially Islamic propoganda, only a whitewash and quotes from Islamic books. It will be near impossible to create a NPOV article as Itpastorn has said.

<li>Do you have <i>any</i> evidence that they consider their writings to be a 'gospel'? I'd love to keep this article if there's any truth to it, but claiming that they consider their writings to be "a legitimate addition to the canonical gospels" is a very big step from simply asserting that those writings exist. You're right, the activities of WBC are generally extremely public; so if there was a 'Gospel of Westboro' I'd expect it to have been heavily covered in the print and online media; in fact, Google finds no web pages mentioning the term. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 14:31, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Move</b>, good articles and lists are not mutually exclusive. I agree that we should weed out any that have not been widely used by the mainstream press though.

<li><b>Move</b> The first few paragraphs give the list an article to hold on to, so we can allow the list as part of a larger article.

<li>Yes, me too, <i>but</i> whoever went through adding all those 'Googlenews gives nothing' HTML comments didn't do the job properly: Google itself gives easy-peasy hits for at least the handful at the top of the list that I tried. Googlenews is not nearly as authoritative as either Google-proper or a proper news site e.g. the BBC or ABC or CNN -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:37, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_News_26ac.html" title="Google News">Google News</a> <i>is</i> "Google itself", to differentiate it from "Google itself" and to say that it isn't as authoritative as the BBC, ABC, and CNN is to wholly misunderstand what it actually is. I notice that it's that very "handful at the top of the list" that you mention that don't have proper full news citations in the Wikipedia style for such things, unlike the other news citations in the article, but that instead comprise poorly labelled or even wholly unlabelled hyperlinks. I would say that doing "the job properly" is a task that that requires more thoroughness and takes longer than just slapping an unlabelled hyperlink in the article. Perhaps it is less easy-peasy than it seems. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:55, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well I'm afraid I quite disagree. I've barely used Google news, so perhaps my comment on its authoritativeness was also non-authoritative. But that does <i>not</i> change the fact that Google <i>did</i> find easy-peasy hits for the ones I labelled, and Google News, apparently, did not. Searching BBC was pretty straightforward too. I'm not sure what you're after about hyperlinks/wikilinks. I just looked a few up quickly (and easily). I presume you're critcising my rather lazy way of incorporating the information; if you don't like it, {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}. The "job" I referred to was checking the verifiability (which is what I presume was implied by the no-presence-on-google-news commetns) which has <i>not</i> been done properly, because they are easy to verify. The "job" you refer to is typing some words in the space after the hyperlink which probably even easier than searching properly. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 13:23, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I dunno, I'm not on the list, but I guess I'm basically a citizen of the world too.&#160;:-) It's a specific concept or state of mind, not so much a POV, rather more of a specific NPOV-ish stance. It appears to be a common feeling among <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expatriate.html" title="Expatriate">expatriate</a>-type-people. Anyway, the list is in the wikipedia namespace, where this sort of list might reside. It might be a bit dusty though!

<li>I actually dispute that it's an NPOV stance. Wikipedians by nationality is reasonable because your nationality is a fact, but this is different: it's an assertion of lack of interest in nationality, which is a POV. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:31, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>No it is not. A person can think whatever he or she likes and not have not have that declaration labelled as POV.

<ul>
<li>Would not that line of argument allow any classification scheme - eg Wikipedia:Wikipedians who have declared they are anti-semitic? That's an NPOV declaration of a POV stance. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 13:39, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except being anti-semetic is particularly exclusive. "Citizen of the world" is the opposite, and being inclusive. The idea behind anti-nationalism is to refuse judging others by something as "belonging" to some intangible political boundary thought up by power-mongerers. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 15:00, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I suspect anti-Semites are perfectly willing to allow anyone, including Semitic peoples to be anti-Semitic, so the statement that "Citizen of the world" is more inclusive than other labels is a <i>holier than thou</i> kind of statement. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 16:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So a <i>statement</i> declaring my <i>belief</i> exists is NPOV only when I'm saying something nice? Or did I miss something? But who cares if it is POV or not, it's taking up disk space.

<li>I have to agree with the above that, if one allows a group that self-identifies as <i>rejecting powermongers</i> (and I do), one should also allow a group for those who <i>embrace powermongers</i>.

<li>What you seem unaccepting of is the idea that people might choose to identify with a place they do not live, or choose not to identify with where they do. In fact, this happens quite often. Consider, for example, the many Mexican immigrants who choose not to associate with the United States, or Americans who choose to live overseas and yet continue to consider themselves Americans. To say that people can only associate with the country they are legally tied to, the country they are born in, or the country they currently live in is POV because it is to say that people do not have the right to refuse an association with a political entity. Since these lists are voluntary, it should more than anything be at the discretion of the user what that user wishes to describe her or himself as, and would be POV to force onto others ones own concept of nationality. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 03:20, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as unfortunately there is no world state yet. Therefore the term is either meaningless or an association of those who support the POV that there should be a world state. I don't believe a POV should be confused with a religious belief. One can have POV Rastafarian or Muslim beliefs but being a Rasta or a Muslim is not itself a POV belief, and not all Rastas or Muslims believe the same thing, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:01, July 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, and that's precisely why this article should be kept. A religious belief is a POV as much as any other belief. However, the fact that someone is a Muslim is not POV - it's a fact. The same thing goes for 'world citizens': declaring that you hold a certain belief is not POV, it's merely a statement of a fact (which may of course be incorrect, but only in the case you knowingly lie about it). There not being any world state is irrelevant, as having one is not a requirement for an ideology saying that there <i>should</i> be one (but rather on the contrary). Internationalism is an ideology just like any other one (including any religion), and I don't see why religions should be treated any differently. ulayiti 20:43, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It relates strongly indeed. It is simple as me and you here. Nobody knows exactly which citizenship we got; we may have 5 in total between you and me! We may be speaking 10 languages in total as well! But we surely are wikipedians. And Wikipedians can be people who like to spend 2 hours daily in a bathroom or only 15 minutes there. I am just a Wikipedian <i>citizen of the world</i> who likes to spend 30 minutes.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I heard some arguments above that declaring you're a <i>citizen of the world</i> is a POV!!! The real POV is that everybody on this earth is labelled a citizen of a coutry at birth.

<li>This discussion seems to revolve around the neutrality/lack thereof of this article. While we seem to have some, um, interesting views on that, isn't the bar for inclusion in this namespace "Of benefit to the community?" My intention with creating this section is for it to be used to discuss <i>that</i> as opposed to the POV status of this article. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 01:10, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed the question is the benefit to the community. In my view it's not a benefit to the community to allow people who share a particular POV (and however much I may agree with that POV myself) to form an 'association'. It simply invites them to try to put their POV on articles. It is acceptable to have 'noticeboards' for people interested in a topic to be alerted to disputes etc., because the noticeboard can be used by those with any POV. Note that my dislike for this sort of classification does not extent to Meta where Wikipedians can and do gather by POV. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:10, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure why it should be any more acceptable on Meta than here, but otherwise I fully agree with that sentiment. It would be a Good Thing if we had a general policy <i>for</i> groups with shared topical interests, and <i>against</i> groups of the present sort. Political groups will form regardless, but they should not be given the sanction of Wikipedia namespace. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 12:08, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I look at pages like this, and I do not see how Wikipedia benefits. This page is a mere "Sign here if you have this particular POV"; there is nothing this page that talks about a course of action or how to otherwise improve Wikipedia, unlike the more conventional Wikiprojects page. I'd favor a policy deleteing pages like this unless they provided a charter of some sort that stated why the project is necessary. I'm fuzzy on the details, but such a charter would have to be more than having a signup page. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 12:52, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakbox_bac0.html" title="User:Squeakbox">Squeakbox</a>'s comment, who said anything about a world <i>state</i>? Why are we not allowed to believe in the world just because there's no State authorizing us to do so?

How often that happens in fact, I don't know; but for the time being, what's the harm? Look, we <i>are</i> all Wikipedians; by virtue of being here we're committed to collaborating on an encyclopedia from a NPOV. I might hook up with a couple fellow 'world citizens' here and decide there need to be more pages on, I dunno, world literacy. Whatever we do collaborate on together is still going to be subject to the same scrutiny as if we had contributed separately. I don't see what people are panicked about. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartierLatin1968_0d61.html" title="User:QuartierLatin1968"><font style="background: red" color="black">Quartier</font><font style="background: black" color="gold">Latin</font></a> <a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuartierLatin1968_3a4e.html" title="User talk:QuartierLatin1968"><font color="red"><i>1968</i></font></a> 17:53, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Note that, in this part of the world, the word Professor does not merely indicate a teaching member of staff; it indicates someone who has been promoted to a senior (possibly leading) position in their department/faculty (as indicated by the Chair he holds). 'Tenure' is also a shaky term since they just become 'acaedmic staff' or 'lecturers'.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The material looks pretty complete to me, and even if the fiction has not been published entirely "professionally" (does that still matter these days?), it hás at least been published. I'm not saying the language ís notable, but I haven't heard any convincing argument that it's not. Regarding the number of speakers: I'm sick and tired of the constant abuse of that argument in this context; the purpose of an art-lang is NOT to gather a circle of speakers, and therefore, you can NOT judge its success by that criterium. I'm ready to change my vote once more convincing arguments come up. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 18:51, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As far as I can tell, the fiction has not even been self-published or published in amateur zines. I will not quote the email I got from the author without his permission, but it sounds like the stories exist only in manuscript, and only a small part of the language material and world-building background material has been self-published on the author's web site (and Wikipedia article).</dd>
<dd>I agree that an artlang need not have actual speakers to be notable. However, it needs to have some evidence of notability - for instance, citations on other artlanger's sites saying they were influenced in their development of Verisimilian by some nifty features found in Babyish; or some other evidence (e.g. mailing list or BBS threads) that, if not actual speakers, it has a significant number of people who are interested in it or influenced by it. If someone created Wikipedia articles for any my own artlangs I would probably vote to delete them. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Henry_39b3.html" title="User:Jim Henry">Jim Henry</a> | <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Henry_6fb9.html" title="User talk:Jim Henry">Talk</a> 19:41, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article should be deleted as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">Neologism</a>. Besides the many times the term is used on wikipedia itself, the term "star trek expanded universe" (as opposed to star wars expanded universe) does not seem to be used much if at all. Why are Star Wars novels called "an expanded universe" instead of novelizations, fan fiction, adapatations, etc.? Its because of the peculiar attempt at maintaining a continuity with each other above all else. This phenomenon does not occour nearly as much in Star trek derivative fiction, which makes little to no effort to be referential to other works of star trek derivative fiction. Original research: none of the statements cite sources, and seem very suspect to me in terms of being actually based on published books. In addition, I'm sure contradictory explanations of many things in this article were made by different novels, to focus on one implies it being the correct explanation which implies a non neutral POV. Fancruft: this article is fancruft, although absolutely atrocious fancruft articles such as styles of lightsabre combat have been previously kept. -posted by an anon ip user on 12 Jul 2005</p>

<dd>From original proposer of delete: Thanks for everyones comments. I change my proposal from <i>delete</i>, to <i>merge</i> INTO the article "star trek, other storylines". The reason: doing so avoids the neologistic and possibily misleading term "star trek expanded universe". This would then also eliminate the implied opinion of any book or storyline being mentioned in the article as being the "real", "canon", or "in-continuity" version of a story. Some people have been saying that "star trek expanded universe" brings up around 200 hits in google but a large amount are wikipedia mirrors, the second most common is refrence to a pen and paper rpg called "Star trek: expanded universe".

A quick Google search shows several hundred mentions of the phrase "Star Trek Expanded Universe", the vast majority of which do not appear to be direct references or copies of this article in any way, and are legitimate references to the larger body of Star Trek works outside the canonical TV and movie sources, thus the term and this article are encyclopedic and warranted in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 00:52, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: PCC has existed since 1995, meaning it predates other major comics like Sluggy Freelance. On the web, it's been around since 2000, an older presence than Megatokyo. While the article itself may not be very good, I say label it a stub and encourage more refining of it rather than outright deletion.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Historically significant strip, although you could drop link to artist.

In it's early days it was a one panel gag strip, published bi-weekly, featuring the odd couple and their even odder assortment of friends poking fun at the gaming industry."

<li>But the problem is when you redirect there the implication is that they have to be a clinical abnormality because manboobs has redirected to a clinical abnormality. Redirecting to breasts leaves it ambiguous and doesn't exactly say what manboobs are (and it needn't) because the saying, while it may not be a neologism, is definitely not something written about (which is why we can't have an article, it'd be original research). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 04:42, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I understand, but I believe it is equally likely that a "Manboobs" searcher is concerned over whether the condition (in himself or friend/loved one) is clinical or not. The <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynecomastia.html" title="Gynecomastia">Gynecomastia</a> article has, as I said, the additional benefit of actually describing <i>exclusively</i> male boobs, albeit not every (or even most) manboobs. Since I think your point is also a valid one, though, I'd understand deleting, since the likiest redirect may be indeterminable. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:25, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>A musician from Philadelphia--I contend he's not notable. Googling "Matt Canning" gets 512 hits, most irrelevant. Restricting the search to "Matt Canning" +Philadelphia brings only 29 hits.

In addition, the note that he "has also held the title of Diner Lobby Shooting Game Quick Draw Dueling Champion, 18+ Division, from 1999-2005" makes me suspect that this was written by one of his friends or himself.

<li><b>Keep</b> First, I want to point out that this VfD is broken. As of when I went to edit this, the VfD edit link was broken. That said, this is exactly the kind of article that I think strains the analogy of Wikipedia to a dead-tree encyclopedia. There's no particularly good reason to list every pizza store, but older restaurants that are significant in their communities are a part of the local culture, and I <i>hope</i> that over time Wikipedia becomes a place where culture is recorded, not just in the sweeping terms of traditional encyclopedias, but also at a regional level where information is all too often lost. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 17:08, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I live in New Haven county and when I asked a group of people for good places for pizza, Sally's and Pepe's were the recommended places (unfortunately, I prefer thick crusts so I'm not into New Haven style pizza). The part about Doonesbury was added after I made the vote. While it is national recognition I'm not sure one strip in the series is enough to make it notable. I'm just not convinced it has more than local significance. <a href="../../../r/j/f/User%7ERJFJR_0643.html" title="User:RJFJR">RJFJR</a> 18:20, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I did some more research and found that there have been continuing references to Sally's in the Doonesbury comic strip, not just the one they have displayed on the wall in the restaurant. (I'm not a Doonesbury fan so I didn't know this off the top of my head). I just tweaked the text of the article to reflect that it has been mentioned more than once. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.frog_7088.html" title="User:Dr.frog">Dr.frog</a> 22:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Local businesses that have no larger claim to fame are, well, just that. <i>Doonesbury</i> cite and claim to "tourist attraction" status are far more to the point, but insufficient at this point.

<dd>That's obviously a ludicrous strawman argument, so I won't feel bad about letting off a little steam on you now. Restaurant review cites don't help... I'm aware it's a restaurant! It's easy to find information about "tourist attractions" on the web, isn't it? New Haven is a pretty big city, no? With a lot of educated, computer-savvy people, a lot of stuff on the Internet about it, right? Seems like if something was one of New Haven's leading tourist attractions, one would be able to prove that, no? Gimme THAT... and given that you're right about the city being associated with pizza, it's very possible you can... but... prove it. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 00:00, July 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Expecting everyone who contributes an article to Wikipedia to justify its universal relevance and usefulness is a great way to discourage people from contributing, you know. &#160;:-P In any case, here is a link I found randomly on the Yale University admissions site, bragging about the attractions of the city: <a href="http://www.yale.edu/admit/take_it_from_us/eating/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/admit/take_it_from_us/eating/index.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> Quote: "[Wooster Square] is best known for its two world-famous pizzerias: Sally's (est. 1938) and Pepe's (est. 1925). These pizzerias, which are widely considered to be the nation's best, attract pizza lovers from all over the world."

<li>hello? you don't need a vfd for this. Simply <b>redirect</b> to the original, any user can do that. If I remember correctly, we do have a MoS guideline to capitalize celestial bodies like <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> etc. Not that I care, though, clearly one of these needs to be a redirect, never mind which. If people decide they want the article at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_Sun_myth_4d77.html" title="Missing Sun myth">Missing Sun myth</a> after all, the place to go is <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>.</li>

<dd>Only if by "consensus" you mean the original article author and two editors with a proven history making incredibly bad decisions solely to undo changes I made without having any history or knowledge of the articles in question... Now that editors who are willing to actually look at the article have done so, consensus is clearly established showing that you were wrong. You already lost your RfC, you've lost all these other disputes you've caused just to be difficult, isn't it about time you just gave it a rest and stopped your petty harassment for a change? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:53, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>sincve missing sun myth is the origiona;l ., then why isnt missing sun motif the copy paste? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">Gabrielsimon</a> 12:20, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because [[Missing sun motif] wasn't a copy &amp; paste, it was moved, following standard Wikipedia policy concerning moves, taking the article, history and talk file with it. Your copying and pasting the text of the article back erases the history and the edit comments and creates a fork file, which is against Wikipedia policy.</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">User:AI</a> and then <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">User:Elvenscout742</a> requested that I'd vote here, althought I find it rather amusing that the whole thing began about a disagreement about capitalization. Now, in the old <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaterasu.html" title="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaterasu&amp;oldid=1106030" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amaterasu&amp;oldid=1106030" rel="nofollow">edit</a> (couple of years ago) I used the term <i>I am familiar with</i> and, as far as I know, capitalization is irrelevant. However, I know more about history than mythological studies and more about <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Jung_ba49.html" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a> than <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Campbell_2650.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>. If there is another, more scholarly or official term for these mythological tales, I'm afraid that you have to consult people who have <i>majored</i> in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_mythology.html" title="Comparative mythology">comparative mythology</a> and <i>state your sources</i>. My information in that respect is second-hand.</li>
<li>Now, as far as I can see, the article in question is a copy of the other one. Since WP usually tries to preserve the edit history of the original text, the copy-paste <i>should</i> go. Regardless of the final name of the article, at least one version of the "missing sun myth" should stay at least as a <b>redirect</b> (and mentioned in the article), since it is in use at least in the circles I know - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 12:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Welcome! Unfortunately, I don't feel your website is of enyclopedic significance, so I'm voting <b>delete</b>. Your site's Alexa rating is 121,200, and as you can see from <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">one set of (non-binding) guidelines</a>, "having an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or less" or "having been the subject of press attention in a non-local scope" are more the type of thing we are looking for in a website submission. Local TV/radio station <i>websites</i> are virtually never significant (the stations themselves are, not the websites), so outdoing them doesn't say much IMO. Among many other things you can do here, you might enjoy putting your knowledge of the Tampa Bay area to work by editing articles in the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Category%7ETampa%2C_Florida_c290.html" title="Category:Tampa, Florida">Tampa Bay category</a>! <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 22:34, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems someone has been writing a history of their small town, and Artie here was a coroner and merchant, and friend of some other guy. Also a "noted" chronicler and photographer, though "noted" is highly subjective. Google isn't great for guys like this, and both "Artie Phair" and "A W A Phair" got me very few hits, several wikipedia. Those that weren't were generally photo credits, which any professional photographer will have. I don't see anything about this guy that seems at all encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> What's wrong with having entries like this? We can't judge everything by the almighty Google, which seems like all Wikipedians ever do. Who's to say that the history of this small town is less interesting or "encyclopedic" than the history of a town that has info up on the net and will get you Google results? <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyblumy_25ab.html" title="User:Royblumy">royblumy</a> 00:11, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The guy didn't <i>do</i> anything in the town.

<li>My point was that he was a professional photographer (as verified by the google links), so why is that considered "not doing anything" just because the photos were of a relatively unknown small town? In other words, though he might not be a notable photographer, he seems to be a notable part of that town's history. Maybe include him in the Lillooet article instead? <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyblumy_25ab.html" title="User:Royblumy">royblumy</a> 01:13, July 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just don't see how we know he's a "notable part of that town's history." Because this article says he was "noted", with no proof of that within the article or anywhere, and which is a weasel word to begin with? Because he had intellectual-type interests like "historian" and "photographer," instead of being a butcher, baker or candlestick maker? To include, in an article about a city, mention of an everyday working person who lived in that city would be very weird. Giving that guy his own article would be even more weird. Those are what we appear to be dealing with here, IMO. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 02:57, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I got 7,600 Google hits for "borgen project", this is far more notable than many other things here. The hits are from a variety of sources not just listing services. Mainstream media attention is not a good barometer for notability. Within the area of NGO's the Borgen Project seems to be fairly well known. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 17:23, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just one more thing, I agree with the links relating to this group being removed from various articles since they clearly are not major players in the Bush administration policy toward, say, the Sudanese civil war. However, I do think that a lot less notable groups are allowed to maintain an entry, for example see: <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjas_in_Pyjamas_b482.html" title="Ninjas in Pyjamas">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a>. I do not see why a group of people who play video games are more notable than an actual organization that seems to advocate responsible government and good causes, no matter how self-promoting they are. I really have no stake whether Bogen Project stays or goes, I just sense an inconsistent standard here. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 14:34, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm hardly going to defend the notability of a videogamer group; do go ahead and VFD that, and I'll probably vote to delete. That said, I don't see any evidence that this "project" is anything more than one guy's pet project. Regarding mainstream media exposure; I'm sympathetic to the argument that mainstream media shouldn't determine notability, but according to the article the project's "primary focus is generating public pressure on the White House"; this really must produce some sort of result in the media. If it hasn't, then the project is non-notable, because it's highly unlikely that it's been even remotely influential in its primary mission. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 20:41, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>At best this is a neologism; at worst totally original research.

<li>I know. I've been rather distracted from my search today. I have managed to find some usages of the term however.

It's not really a reference, but I did find <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/library/special/libmem.html" class="external text" title="http://www.shef.ac.uk/library/special/libmem.html" rel="nofollow">this from Sheffield University</a> which uses "glass plate" and "Robbins Report" in the couple of sentences; not a direct reference I know. Given all this, I think perhaps a <b>move</b> to plate-glass university might be in order. (My Google search was "Robbins Report" glass plate — but beware the Wikimirrors.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> This article is <b>not</b> original research and is under major construction/reconstruction (as are many articles on the web site) to broaden its focus (as it has been for the last two or three days), and there has been no discussion whatsoever of a VfD in the article discussion. The VfD has been initiated by someone clearly without a knowledge of the subject matter under discussion. (The rationale of usage provided above is utterly shallow and meaningless and has no bearing whatsoever on the cool <i>aesthetic</i>.) Presently, I seem to be the only individual contributing in any substantive manner to this piece, but <i>knowledgeable</i> contributions are more than welcome. IMO, this VfD is premature and ill-considered. Wikipedia has a distinct lack of articles treating black/African cultures -- and a distinct lack of expertise in this regard, as its membership appears to be comprised largely of white males. And while I claim no special (or innate) expertise in this subject based on formal education, ethnicity, or gender, I do at least have some exposure to the essential philosophical underpinnings of "cool" and am familiar with the concept in the African American and pop culture contexts. The stubborn ignorance (no pejorative intended; just naming it for what it is) and obstinacy demonstrated over time by some editors in the development of this piece -- very likely the result of the phenomenon of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_appropriation.html" title="Cultural appropriation">cultural appropriation</a> and assimilation -- is all the more reason it should be given a chance to develop into a quality piece -- particularly given the importance of 'cool' in African societies and its impact on Western and world popular culture via the African American experience. Okay. I've spent far too much time responding to this **@#$%&amp; VfD (time that could have been spent improving the article), and now must attend to some deadlines of my own. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To interject here, thus far, there have been claims of "original research," that there is no evidence of this subject matter in scholarly research, blah, blah, blah -- when the article cites and quotes published sources. In fact, Thompson is, perhaps, the foremost modern (Western) authority on African Art and culture alive today, and has been for more than three decades. And he's <i>white</i>. But because he writes of African and African American cool, he's somehow an "Afrocentrist." No, this is not a referendum on me, my "Afrocentrist" perspectives (which -- news flash -- are not rendered invalid, <i>ipso facto</i>, incidently, by someone merely assigning that presumptively -- in their eyes, at least -- dismissive label to them), or even, really, the content of this article. This is about a bad-faith move to delete an article -- with, again, absolutely no prior mention of such intent in the article discussion page -- because it treats another <b>black</b> subject which some benighted "contributors" assume, in their ignorance, to have other origins. And not only do they <i>assume</i> such, they aggressively have asserted their ignorance as fact -- in the face of clearly articulated information to the contrary, and with the article still under major construction/expansion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, this is a common form of arrogance and pettiness on this website and an attempt at censorship -- and, IMO, a perfect example of the kind of hostility to new information (particularly as it relates to black people and black culture) that challenges fallacious and often inherently racist majority assumptions of the way things are. It is also an example of the ignorance of (relative) youth. Few who lived through or are knowledgeable of the jazz scene from the time it caught fire in the 1920s, with its deep affinity with African culture and sensibilities and the pervasive influence it has had on American popular culture; or few who have lived through the times of the bohemian/beatnik set and its groupie-mentality fascination with African American slang, soul, style and music, would bat an eyelash at the statement that cool is a fundamentally black phenomenon (though they likely would say "African American," rather than "African," because that is the context in which they are familiar with it). But this ignorance (understandable), antagonistic intellectual arrogance (inexcusable) and inherent ethnic bias (pervasive) which is so much a part of Wikipedia is also <i>precisely</i> why I intend to go forward with the article, and with other submissions focusing on black-related topics on this venue. And, no. I'm not charging the people here with racism in its common sense, <i>per se</i> -- though I wouldn't necessarily rule it out across the board. The bias I write of herein relates specifically to a skewed notion of a world where the depth of black culture and history is little known, little understood by the masses -- but also heavily distored/appropriated. So, if people get so exercised/hostile over a little article on the <i>cool aesthetic</i>, gee, just <i>think</i> what'll happen later on down the line. I'm certain we'll find out -- 'cuz I ain't goin' nowhere. The article under discussion here will be a good one if people stop bickering and start doing their research (as I am) and contribute. That <i>is</i>, after all, the Wiki way. Of course, I understand perfectly if the topic is not of sufficient interest to everyone here to do so. My interests are not likely theirs. But if the whiners and grumblers don't do the research, if they <i>admittedly</i> don't know anything about a subject, then, respectfully, they should just shut the hell up, move on and go contribute <i>constructively</i> elsewhere. Now, I've got some <i>real</i> work to do; I've got bills to pay. I'm probably done with this page for a while, but will check back from time to time.

<dd>Being bi-racial myself (african-american father), and therefore classified as "black" by racialist societies and racist individuals, I feel embarrassed how well-meaning people are so easily played by somebody who shares the color of my shell. Bad faith isn't a one way street. And equality starts with an EQUAL treatment. It doesn't help us in our fight for equality to yell "racism" everytime we face constructive criticism. (and Deceevoice has a long history of doing that, see my diffs concerning the wareware case) It doesn't help us to make up "racist" stories either, as it happened just the other day, when deeceecvoice faced critics for her <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">Blackface</a> article, which is a featured article candidate (how could that happen since Wikipedia is allegedly such a racist net-society?) Facing criticism because of the inclusion of the terms "darky" in a section header and "nigger" in the related topics section, <b>she made up a story about a mysterious racist editor</b>, editing the page while she was allegedly blocked from editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Blackface&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19012813" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Blackface&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19012813" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Yet the edit history proves that the "nigger" link was added 2 years before she joined Wikipedia (14:30, 10 December 2002 by Ortolan88 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=477984" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=477984" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>) and that she even "alpha ordered" the links (including the "nigger" link) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7924520" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7924520" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> (scroll down) when she "rewrote" the article and that she inserted the "darky" and "coon" terms herself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7427422" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7427422" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7427485" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7427485" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7434247" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blackface&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=7434247" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> Seriously. if you really want to help us, treat us like anybody else, and exercise "good faith" for anybody, no matter what color they are. And please double check before you accuse your fellow wikipedians of "bad faith", no matter if they are considered to be black or white. Two wrongs doesn't make a right.

<li>Oh, Pharlap, you're embarrassing yourself. First, I was never "under attack" for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">Blackface</a>. It's a quality article which stands on its own. When I became aware of the FAC request for the article, I saw that one person had expressed mild reservations about the use of the words "darky" and "coon" in the article, and I simply explained their usage. I had already deleted the link to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a>. The business about Zwarte Piet was resolved amicably, I thought. I even sent <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">User:Andries</a> a note suggesting how he could improve his rather cryptic add-on by asking a few questions for him to address. I subsequently cleaned it up just a bit, and the resultant language is now part of the article. I did not see the related exchange on the talk page until after the fact, at which time I simply lost my patience with the silliness of it all. Now, with regard to "nigger": Simply because I alpha ordered a list some time ago where the word was included means nothing. I often peruse articles by section -- sometimes editing for content, but often first skimming, looking at an article as simply a copy editor, paying very little attention to content and context. A case in point is the controversy over the inclusion of a racist image in an article on <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermelon.html" title="Watermelon">Watermelon</a>. I first saw no problem with the image because when I first took a look at the article, I was looking at it the image as merely an object, a photo, within a piece. I have a rather large collection of such images, so I don't find them shocking in the least; I'm accustomed to seeing them. My first reaction was that the photo needed to be upsized in relation to the rest of the images on the page -- simply in terms of visual space -- and that it should be staggered. With a background in all aspects of journalism, including page layout, it wasn't good to have a series of photos lined up on a single side of the page. I upsized the photo and staggered it. That was done when I saw the page as a copy editor. I went back later and looked at the page as an editor, and the thing that struck me immediately was that the image was wholly inappropriate in that context. I removed it, stating why -- and have weighed in, in the straw poll conducted on that issue to that effect. After doing that, I also went to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks.html" title="Blacks">Blacks</a> and removed a table I'd seen at least a handful of times (and even copyedited minimally on a few occasions -- again taking a superficial approach) and which I'd been annoyed by to varying degrees over time. It consisted of largely pejorative terms for black people by country. The "watermelon" image and the issue it represented caused me to make the connection that I needed to finally act on that matter, as well. I deleted the table on the same grounds and placed a notice on the discussion page about why and opened the matter up for discussion -- and mentioned it in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Talk%7EWatermelon_aaed.html" title="Talk:Watermelon">Talk: watermelon</a> because, to my way of thinking, it is much the same issue, simply in a different article. So, Pharlap, your baseless insinuations in that regard are just that -- baseless. Next, with regard to my being blocked from editing "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">Blackface</a>" -- unless you have some proof that it did not occur, then I suggest you button it. I was, indeed, blocked from editing the article by another editor because of an "impersonator." I was able to edit everything else, it seems, but not that piece. As a matter of fact, I've been blocked on two or three separate occasions in the last three days, with the block notification listing each time a different IP address. My mention of this situation was, I suppose, a complaint -- but also a kind of defense for my not having responded to the new edits sooner with the article under FAC consideration. And, while I admit I <i>do</i> find the situation at least a <i>little</i> curious, I in no way charged and certainly did not intend to insinuate nefarious goings on -- and certainly not on the part of any specific individual(s). Finally, did I charge <i>any</i> of the people commenting here in favor of this ridiculous VfD with garden-variety racism? Nope. (Did I already I know you're a half-white when I wrote my response? Yep. So, why would I <i>do</i> that? The very idea is absurd!) I no more called the white complainants in this process (or you) garden-variety racists than I insinuated any possible identity issues or self-loathing on your part. Nor will I do so. What I <i>have</i> stressed, however, is what I perceive as a stubborn, ill-informed adherence to preconceived notions about subject matter based on a knowledge base that is itself tainted by ignorant (again, no critical value attached to the word -- just stating it for what it is) presumptions and cultural appropriation/assimilation, and the aggressive, bad-faith action of this VfD. I suggest you, as we say, check your b*tch at the door, because your personal motivations are showing; you're still grinding that axe. Let it go, bwoi. Let it go.&#160;:p. My apologies to others for this lengthy diversion from the matter at hand, but, as in the Wareware RfC and related matters, dragging in unrelated "issues" and making wild accudations/insinuations is Pharlap's modus operandi. I've merely responded. The VfD is still groundless. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 20:13, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I don't see it as original research because there are references, though I'd like to see more inline attribution. For example, where it describes West African ontology: "Apparent opposites, or countervailing constructs, not only meet — as with the Kalunga line, a sacred, underwater line of demarcation where the worlds of the living and of those passed on reconnect and interact — but can and often do inhabit the same space, conceptually or literally," it would be good to see "according to X," and an explanation, with a source, of where the idea of the Kalunga line comes from.

At the time, the word literally meant, "it is cool".</i> <a href="http://mpelembe.mappibiz.com/archives_04/80s_hip_hop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mpelembe.mappibiz.com/archives_04/80s_hip_hop.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></p>
<p>Lets move to the statement that <i>"Cool is feminine energy; it is stillness, calm and strength.... "Heat is masculine energy... "</i> That isn't true either. It's exactly the other way around, which can be easily varified here: <i>"The black male's cultural signature is his cool. It is sometimes the only source of pride, dignity, and worth in the absence of the outward status symbols of materialism and title that mark success in American culture. His status rides on his ability to communicate through human encounters, the most important information about himself: his coolness. Because it is so prized, preserving cool becomes an end in itself. (Majors &amp; Billson)"</i> <a href="http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo2.papers/gause00.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo2.papers/gause00.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> and here <i>"The images here illustrate the masks of strength or the "cool pose" that Richard Majors and Janet Mancini Billson discuss in their landmark 1992 book of the same title. In Cool Pose, they bring the definition of cool up to date. The "cool pose", they write, "is a ritualised form of masculinity that entails behaviour, scripts, physical posturing, impression management, and carefully crafted performances that deliver a single critical message: pride, strength and control". They say that by acting calm, emotionless, fearless, aloof and tough, the African-American male shows both the dominant culture and the black male himself that he is strong and proud."</i><a href="http://mpelembe.mappibiz.com/archives_04/80s_hip_hop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mpelembe.mappibiz.com/archives_04/80s_hip_hop.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671865722/ref=pd_sxp_f/103-0799299-4321441?v=glance&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671865722/ref=pd_sxp_f/103-0799299-4321441?v=glance&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>

And while we are talking about sunglasses: wearing sunglasses indoors has it's origins in China, and is not an invention of African Americans performing in jazz clubs: <i>"The first reason why they darkened glasses was because of smoke tinting, which was held in China before 1430. It was so far back in time, that of coarse their glasses were not of any prescription, and they were not used to protect your eyes from the sun.

<li>As <a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> noted above, it would be a mistake to equate a keep vote with an endorsement of the article's current state. You've changed some of the original research, such as what was the first paragraph of the article, but statements such as "Cool is feminine energy" are still unacceptably unreferenced until they have inline attribution, which was <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>'s general recommendation, given above.</li>
<li>The topic and it's given definition, as you've noted on the talk page,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACool_%28aesthetic%29&amp;diff=18880249&amp;oldid=18875915" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACool_%28aesthetic%29&amp;diff=18880249&amp;oldid=18875915" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> has changed from cool as an aesthetic, to the African aesthetic of cool, and you've expressed plans to rename the article accordingly.

<dd>I repeat, the VfD was groundless. VfDs are <i>not</i> to be used to resolve content disputes. People voted -- and you lost. The scope of the article has been broadened, yes, but its treatment of the cool aesthetic as African in origin has not. Further, the language in the opening paragraph also appears later in the article, so you might want to think again about dropping this "bad-faith VfD" based on some misguided notion on your part that the fundamental assertions of the piece have, or will, change. As far as the article in its present state, you weren't too concerned about jumping to conclusions based on your ignorance of the subject matter and where the article stood a few days ago. As with <i>any</i> article on this web site, it is unfinished -- and was clearly still undergoing major development (and still is) when you initiated this process designed to push your particular point of view, rather than honor the Wiki process. "Non-sequitor claims"? Yeah. Tell it to Thompson. Again, your ignorance and obstinance are showing. *x* But, hey, if you want to just slink away based on the fact that the VfD has been voted down by more than two to one at this point, be my guest.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 02:11, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand that my article may have rubbed few. But it's the truth. I feel that we should address this controversial issue. I mean we have millions of missing people.

Too much fingerpointing and devoted coverage to something that Amber Hagerman a 9-year old who is white go so much media coverage the United States Congress passed the controversial "AMBER" alert. The media is bias, look at CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Each channel was devoted to at least one major story that has coverage on a pretty white woman. So why don't we address this?

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I am the Chairman, but I am a legitimate creater of articles for the benefit of Wikipedia (see my other articles...Cindy Cohn, Preferred Stock, American Alpine Club) and I plan to continue to add to this and articles about other companies with sustainable products and solutions. This Company has patents that appear to change improve sustainability (as do our one or two competitors, which will also be added by me this weekend with issues around sustainable logistics). Why does it matter if the author is related as long as the author discloses themselves (which I have done, by using my actual name as the user). I ask this sincerely, since I intend to spend my time on Wikipedia focusing on the business sections. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonreed_1f27.html" title="User:Ronreed">Ronreed</a> 04:54, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Reviewing the deletion policy, there is no reason stated for "self promotion". There is a reason for vanity, which I tried to avoid by trying to express the facts in a neutral way and to describe the importance of the business to a broader market, as described in the VANITY PAGE discussion. Also, this is not an advertisement, since I specifically tried not to discuss specific products of the Company. If you believe this could be writtin in a more neutral fashion, then perhaps we should edit it accordingly. Lastly, this Company will have additional importance as I focus on Michigan Business, since I intend to develop more information around venture backed companies in Michigan. I started with the one I know well, but intend to develop profiles around others in Michigan (Arbor Text, Supply Tech, Handy Lab, Nephros Therapeutics, Nano Bio, among others). I have proposed to others in Michigan that we use Wikepedia as a place to build our history of venture backed businesses. Please leave comments about my comments, since I am a new user and am eager to learn and want to be a productive contrutor. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonreed_1f27.html" title="User:Ronreed">Ronreed</a> 05:14, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also, I looked in the Company listings and it seems that the more entries in there, the better.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have made some changes that make it less like an advertisement (taking out some of the promotional things about the product and making it more generic).
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, I think no matter how you phrase it, it's not going to matter much because the company simply is not notable. This is really what the "advertisement" shorthand is about, though admittedly it is shorthand: A <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> article by Bill Gates would no doubt be accepted, and if Bill hyped up his company, that could be edited out rather than deleting the article. However, if someone writes an article hyping up a small, unknown company, the assumption that this person is taking advantage of a free opportunity to advertise has usually turned out to be correct. Sometimes, even if evidence of notability is not presented in the article or easily Googled up, it can still be shown... people will cheerfully change their votes in that case, once they're shown it. The rule simply is that the company has to become notable <i>before</i> we write about it. It's an encyclopedia, not a business directory. If you plan to write further articles, please keep this in mind; your insights on business matters in general or on major Michigan businesses will be really valuable; your insights on specific startup companies, probably not so much. It is nothing at all against you or your company, it's just a question of what the project is about. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 06:53, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for your thoughtful comment. I really appreciate the feedback. It sounds like a contributor needs to produce some evidence any company's notablity. Perhaps we could start a conversation about the "notability test or guidelines". Certainly, Microsoft is inutitive at this point, but where did it cross the line from being a little software company started by a few friends to being "notable". I guess the real question is for whom will the Company be notable? I understand the objective of Wikipedia is to focus on an informational resource and not a "pure play" advertising resource, but I suspect we are still in early days here and the Wikicommunity is still relatively small compared to the potential audience that will someday use the resource. Although I've heard about it, I listen to <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> and watch for these kinds of projects. I have a sense, that as Wikipedia matures, Wikipedia will become part of any suject matter expert's tool kit. An expert in any field will someday mention, as part of their creidibility, that they are a wikipedia contributor on a topic. I can envision being at a conference in the next could years and seeing someone introduced as <b>"Ms. So &amp;So is blah, blah blah and noted wikipepdia contributor</b>. The point is that the nature of participation in Wikipedia by experts will become self-promotional. While I think the wikicommunity has to watch this closely, I believe the benefits to the experts will also improve the value of this resource. Further, I believe that some of the information that may seem insignificant to a small group of people today (like a paper pallet company with patents issued in the major industrial countries of the world) may be some of the seeds that draw in an entirely new part of the Community. Therefore, I would be cautious about the "notability test". One person's unnkown company is very possibly the leading emerging player for a new industry that is not yet represented on Wikipedia, but should they be drawn into the Wiki by, say a reference to the site by some of these companies (EcoDuro plans to point to WikiPedia for packaging industry info and to help education people information on the established/emerging standards and technologies).</li>

<dd>I'll try here, to make the case for EcoDuro meeting the notability test. At this point, the Company has been asked to present at three major venture capital conferences in the last fourteen months. The Company has been issued patents (another topic, but should Companies list their patents). Its products have been tested by the two leading packaging in the US (one of which is the leading in the world, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a>). Articles are being written about it by notable sustainability investment writers example <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002422.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002422.html" rel="nofollow">The World is Changing author Jamais Cascio</a>. One of the leading investors, was formerly the Chairman of <a href="../../../m/e/a/MeadWestvaco_e287.html" title="MeadWestvaco">MeadWestvaco</a> who is also helping to drive technology transfer for sustainable packaging and products in other Companies (Pollywood). The Company is in a rapidly changing. "After delays, misfires and more government bureaucracy than most care to remember, 2004 appears to be the year that many major world markets will get serious about implementation and enforcement of the global IPPC standard for solid wood packaging", by Pallet Profile Dec 2003. I imagine this all looks pretty boring to most people, except for a few fun facts.</dd>

<li>Pallets are about an annual $19 Billion industry.</li>
<li>“[Big City Forest] says the national recycling rate for wooden pallets, crates, and packaging is about 10%, with the majority ground into low-value applications like fiber or chips and more than half of the ground wood burned for fuel. BCF estimates that harvesting just the discarded wooden packaging in big U.S. cities would conserve about 300,000 acres of virgin timberland a year. The 88 million pallets discarded annually in the 49 largest urban areas contain about 1.5 billion board feet of usable lumber, or roughly three times the amount of virgin timber used to produce all the hardwood flooring sold in the U.S. every year. -- source: [<a href="http://web.indstate.edu/recycle/9619.html" class="external free" title="http://web.indstate.edu/recycle/9619.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.indstate.edu/recycle/9619.html</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is well-writte, even the author's argument on whether the company is notable or not. As he has pointed out, we don't know if this company "will be the leading emerging player", at this point it isn't and it is not notable. However, I encourage the author to keep writing, I see the quality of his writing, but it is not written in a NPOV, "unique engineered", etc. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 02:56, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I used the word unique due to the patents that are in place. I assumed propose that patents make the pallet "unique" as opposed to other pallets that are "standard" according the GMA (Grocery Manufacturers Association). Standard wood GMA pallets make up most of the 1 billion pallets used in the US. Thanks for your comment by the way, but I still don't know about the "notability standard", but I think it is my challange to pursue this discussion elsewhere on the general VFD pages. We've started the process of creating a Business, Economics &amp; Finance Portal and I believe this issue of notability will emerge again, since I intend to encourage people to put up information about business. I guess the general question for the Wikipedia is "where are the edges of the information that is desired for Wikipedia"?</li>

<p>I'm not sure myself if this page needs to be *deleted*, but as it was created by an anonymous user and is so vague, it's hard to see how to possibly improve it. It's been marked for verification, but so far one user has mentioned attending his concert (with no indication even as to his nationality, really). They mention that the alleged "composer" has not yet published any songs (why I took the liberty of removoing the composer stub and, when moving the page to disambiguate, listed him as a musician). The move from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Wright_2a92.html" title="Ben Wright">Ben Wright</a> and creation of a disambig page out of the latter was because there are at least two other, arguably more notable Ben Wrights: <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Wright_%28actor%29_e84e.html" title="Ben Wright (actor)">One</a> who was a well known British actor in US films, radio, and Disney animated features, and another whose background is more vague but was clearly a major participant in US conflict with the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modoc.html" title="Modoc">Modoc</a> Indian tribes. The most info I've found on a Ben Wright related to music is references as having attended 2002 and 2003 music fests, with not much detail, and a seemingly recent webpage, <a href="http://www.benwrightmusic.com" class="external free" title="http://www.benwrightmusic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.benwrightmusic.com</a> , which may not even belong to the same Ben Wright (and certainly doesn't mention any of the "compositions" listed in the page)!
