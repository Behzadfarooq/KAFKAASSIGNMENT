<p>Completely unsourced, and Google is no help here at all. It's possible that this article actually deals with a real and important topic, but I was unable to confirm anything about it, and since it doesn't provide any references or a time frame or the names of any of the people involved, and is so short as to be almost devoid of context, there's a good chance that the information contained in it is either false, misleading or perhaps even entirely fabricated. Who knows? I can't even confirm that they exist. Unless someone can provide some sort of references here, I'd like to <b>delete</b> it. Note that it's not hard to convince me otherwise here, really -- I don't hate the subject of this article, and in fact I think it <i>should</i> be included even if it's just a minor political party, but I'd just like some confirmation that it, y'know, <i>exists</i>. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It appears to be a roughly-translated article about Pandektis, an upstart political party in Greece also known as the "Greek Union for Democracy". It is primarily active in the seven prefectures of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnese.html" title="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. It is not yet mentioned in the article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Greece_45f9.html" title="Politics of Greece">Politics of Greece</a>. Their <a href="http://www.pandektis.gr/" class="external text" title="http://www.pandektis.gr/" rel="nofollow">Web site</a> (careful, crashes Firefox) is only in Greek so I'm not sure if that's a valid reference for an English article, or if it will satisfy you of its existence. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 23:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it doesn't hurt any, at least! It's a start. I don't read Greek, though, so I have no idea if anything in the Wikipedia article is valid. Is "Union for Democracy in Pelopennese" even a valid English name for this party? I mean, can we be sure that the Wikipedia article is even talking about the same party...? Anyway, this is a step in the right direction; I hope we'll at least get a decent stub out of this one. Thanks, Aguerriero. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One of the pages I went through on the way to discovering this is <a href="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where it refers to the party as "'Pandekis', the Greek Union for Democracy and Law-Making". Do we want to make a judgement that all of these are the same thing? If so, the article should probably be renamed "Greek Union for Democracy". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">contribs</a>)  02:48, 10 May 2006.</small>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that's my point. Can we say that they're the same thing? I mean, <i>I</i> don't know; I'm hardly an expert on Greek domestic politics, so I personally don't feel qualified to make such a judgement at all. Basically, anyone who demonstrates a reasonable knowledge of the subject (as you have) and is willing to make that definitive judgement call gets my support; if you can do that, I'll be happy to withdraw the nomination. It's kind of hard to make these calls when the original article on Wikipedia is so vague... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After doing some more research today, I can't definitively say they are the same thing. Even if they are, there are notability issues since it is practically impossible to find information on this party. They are not listed in any reference of Greek political parties, and I come up blank doing a library search of journals and periodicals. So, I vote <b>delete</b> unless the author is willing to clarify and provide sources. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 19:04, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I left a message on the original author's <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenekos_e1ac.html" title="User talk:Benekos">talk page</a>, but as he's only got eleven edits and he apparently hasn't been active for about a month now, I think there's a good chance that we won't hear from him... but here's hoping that he sees the message and lets us know what's what. We'll see, I guess. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:59, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, so far, nothing. I very seriously doubt that we're going to hear from the guy. It also seems to me that we are not able to confirm much of anything about this article, so let me just make it clear that my original vote to delete still stands, and I would personally infer that Lakhim's and Kchase02's conditional votes don't really count here, as we don't have that confirmation, but obviously determining that is up to the admin who ends up closing the AfD. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. According to the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister's CV (<a href="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), Pantekdis is the "Greek Union for Democracy and Law-Making", not a Peloponnese-specific organisation. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think this has anything to do with Pandektis. See this link: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/arkadolakonika/Union.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/arkadolakonika/Union.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and also this: <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=ai1ebbkt9dsji?tname=union-for-the-democracy-of-peloponnese&amp;method=5&amp;sbid=lc08a&amp;linktext=Union%20for%20the%20Democracy%20of%20Peloponnese" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=ai1ebbkt9dsji?tname=union-for-the-democracy-of-peloponnese&amp;method=5&amp;sbid=lc08a&amp;linktext=Union%20for%20the%20Democracy%20of%20Peloponnese" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.
