<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. This has gone on long enough. Painting in very broad strokes: on the one hand, we have a vast number of editors who argue persuasively that this article does (and must by its nature) consist of unverifiable claims, original research, and no reliable sources. On the other hand, we have a slightly smaller number of editors who argue that this article should be kept for various reasons: (1) That Wikipedia has a duty to not delete articles about any entity criticizing it, (2) that various editors who favor deletion are acting in bad faith, and (3) since we have other articles that are similar to this one, it's unfair to delete this one. Those three "keep" arguments are all spectacularly unpersuasive, and (for the most part) do not address the objections raised to the article other than to assert their falsity. Added to this we have the spectacle of solicitation and/or spamming for keep votes. I have no opinion on Encyclopedia Dramatica — never having heard of it before tonight — but I am using my discretion and bringing this to a close, so we can hopefully all move on. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 05:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whoa, I don't get that implication at all from Netscott's note.

<dd>The difference is that badlydrwnjeff stated on his userpage here at wiki that he is an Admin at ED...there is a distinction.

<dd>Sure I did. I still do, in fact. I;m simply pointing out that you have some fairly selective criteria as to who's "trusted" and who's done good things here at this encyclopedia, to paraphrase a comment elsewhere.

<dd>You want me to assume good faith...you expect me to pretend that your arguments defending this article's inclusion have nothing to do with the fact that you are an admitted administrator at that website... a website that exists partially harass wikipedians and to accuse wikipedians of being pedophiles...get real.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>I</i> want you to assume good faith, given all those things you just said. That means assuming that Badlydrawnjeff really does think Wikipedia is better off and not worse with this article. I find that very easy to believe. I think he has a conflict of interests in this particular AfD, but that doesn't mean he's not trying to improve Wikipedia, as he understands it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 11:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you spent any amount of time looking at my contributions, or to Schmucky's, since I brought him up, you'd figure it out pretty easily. You're unwilling to do that, which is extremely regrettable. If I've personally given you a reason to abandon good faith in this process - and seeing as I had nothing to do with your "attack", can't recall ever crossing paths with you prior, and have a long list of contributions here to my credit, I doubt there is one - then by all means present it. Otherwise, you're simply abandoning good faith for a personal agenda and making an attack on <i>me</i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know if I have main page access, and if I do, I don't know how to change it anyway, but any deletion or change I could have attempted would have been reversed immediately, and I had a personal rule when I contributed at length not to get major involvement in situations concerning real, non-celeb people, instead sticking to well-known articles and web memes. My contributions have been almost exclusively at Wikipedia since the winter, and I've really only been tossing ideas toward direction and situations recently without contributing, although I'd like to get going again. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:18, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>None taken, but I don't base my sense of humor on geography, or on what other people think is appropriate or funny. If there was any possible question that ED was even <i>claiming</i> to represent their content as factual, that would be one story, but they're pretty blatant about the fact they they lie all the time. Come to think of it... I live in the US, and I've seen just about every televised comedian I'm aware of get laughs from auditoriums full of Americans by saying that Michael Jackson is a pedophile. We Americans have a strange and creepy fascination with pedophilia, throwing moral panics over it while continually pushing the envelope as far as sexualization of children in our advertizing. It's disgusting, and it's killing people, and it deserves to be mocked, quckly and repeatedly, because humor is an excellent weapon against social rot. I find the way ED parodies our culture's unhealthy fascination with pedophilia to be smart, incisive, and often hilarious. I am quite proud of the work they're doing there, whether or not you "can imagine" that I feel that way. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 12:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I believe that this concept isn't relevant to a WP:AFD. If an editor votes a particular way in an AFD, the only considerations the closing admin should consider are: (1) the strength of their arguments (if given), and (2) their experience/role in the Wikipedia community (factors to be weighed -- in no particular order -- include level of activity, level of recent activity, adminship/arbcom/mediator/etc., length of time here, quality of contributions, etc.). Whether or not the voter is associated with the website being AFD'ed is in my view irrelevant. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 10:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've admited in previous AfDs that I am also a member of ED. I don't see a need to recuse myself (or for the other ED members here to recuse themselves). Its not just your wikipedia, its OUR wikipedia, and we all have a right to chime in our opinion on the AfD. As <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> said right above me, there are more important considerations to review then if one of the Wiki Editors here has expressed an opinion is also an ED member. Also, if you look at ED, my last real contribution was on February 18, 2006 http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Azathar. Your status isn't as important as your opinion. Its more important to write a logical, rational reason about whether you want to keep or delete an article versus your relationship to the article.

<li>Azathar, although I agree with your point about the AFD, I must take issue with your comment that "Its not just your wikipedia, its OUR wikipedia, and we all have a right to chime in our opinion on the AfD."

<li>The notability of the site is still being debated after the issue was first raised a day or two ago, and this deletion was immediately forced through after editors complained about perceived bias (almost immediately after). Admins do a good job, but this does feel like a retaliatory nomination, especially given the ferocity of people to "get rid of it".

Remember, Encyclopedia Dramatica all started due to Wikipedia's refusal to document internet related activities such as http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Mediacrat the Mediacrat drama. In summary, if this is deleted then so should <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>, but that isn't going to happen, is it?

<li><b>Keep</b> - To respond to the various arguments for deletion presented; <b>OR / RS / V</b> - None of these are reasons for deletion of an article... only for changes to its content. Further, primary sources are valid for verification of non-subjective facts... such as 'creation date' and 'number of users'. Some might insist on phrasing such as, 'Encyclopedia Dramatica <i>claims</i> to have over 8000 users', but the existence of that claim would be verifiable, reliable, and not original research. <b>Attack site / Disruptive / We cannot be unbiased</b> - All possibly true, but not reasons for deletion. We do not exclude <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> because it is difficult to remain unbiased in writing an encyclopedia article on him... or because the page generates disruption... or because the man (and his followers to this day) said and did nasty things.

<dd>Yes, those are all policies... about the <i>content</i> of articles. They have nothing whatsoever to do with deletion. All but a very few Wikipedia articles failed the 'verifiability', 'original research', and/or 'reliable sources' policies when they were first created... indeed, the vast majority of articles <i>still</i> fail those policies. Yet no one is arguing for the deletion of several hundred thousand articles... because those have never been and never will be criteria for deletion. The frequent citation of them on this page is an embarrassing example of searching for a pretext to accomplish a goal founded on entirely different motivations. Lack of <i>notability</i> IS a reason for deletion, and ED is within the (very wide) grey area defined by Wikipedians' wildly differing notability standards... but it seems clear that ED is notable enough that it would be unambiguously kept (like many <i>less</i> notable web-sites are currently) if the subject matter were not so controversial. Which is what this really comes down to in the end... an effort to exclude information on ED because the site is annoying/offensive/obnoxious/et cetera. If it <i>weren't</i> then the page probably never would have been nominated for deletion or, if it were, a handful of 'high notability standards' deletionists would be the only ones voting delete. A few people have been up-front about deleting for these reasons and to prevent strife et cetera... which are valid motivations, but I think outweighed by the importance of impartiality in how we review and maintain articles. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said in my original vote... a good deal of the article IS verifiable. The claim that something can't be verified unless it has been printed in a major newspaper is just silly. The current user count of Wikipedia has been included in the Wikipedia article for years... despite not being stated in a 'verifiable third party source' or, since we got big enough that they <i>did</i> start reporting it, despite contradicting outdated figures in such sources. How is this possible? Are we 'breaking the rules'? No... we're using a <b>primary</b> source. The Wikipedia statistics page and/or list of users can be linked to directly as verification. ED exists. It has users. It has articles. Those articles are on various subjects. All of these things are easily verifiable by any user of Wikipedia... indeed, far more verifiable than references to obscure out of print books, which we accept without controversy. If the ED article were to say, 'ED is the funniest site on the internet' that would be POV. If it were to say, 'Josh Bumblemeyer of the New York Times says ED is the funniest site on the internet', that would be a verifiable opinion from a reliable third party source. If it were to say, 'ED claims to be the funniest site on the internet', that would be a verifiable claim made by the primary source (not that I am suggesting the make this claim - just an example). Verifiable means that there is some way for the reader to check that the info in the article is accurate. For most of this article... there is. Ergo, no... the claim that it can never be verified is just false. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I was asked about this, but reluctant to vote. The discussed site seems to exist for no purpose other than abuse and insult of Wikipedia(ns); and the article itself seemed to be pushed mostly as vanity by editors associated with ED. Nonethless, I had tended to feel the website itself <i>did</i> just barely reache notability guidelines, so didn't feel like I could quite vote delete. However, I had separate occasion to reflect on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>, which seems to suggest several grounds to make this deletable. One is simply that linking to outright libel reflects badly on WP.

I therefore looked it up on Wikipedia, where I found what appears to be a quite accurate article about its content, as well as the link to this discussion about possible deletion.

<dd>This one seems cut and dried for all the disputation it's generating here; perhaps all the other reasons pro and con are muddying the waters. The site's criticism of Wikipedia should not be a factor even if harsh. A Dramatica sysop's involvement is irrelevant since we're voting on an article, not an editor; the devil himself can write an article for all I care if it meets the guidelines. Vanity can get cleaned up and should not be a reason to delete if otherwise notable. Two previous failed AfDs are instructive but do not prove notability (as someone else claimed).

<dd>Replying to Grue, all of the information about ED's content and tone, and most everything about its history that isn't a link to a deletion discussion here, is cited back to ED itself. That's original research, carried out by reading a lot of ED pages, learning about ED, and then writing on Wikipedia what you know about it. Are there any independent reliable sources that talk <i>about</i> ED from the outside, and comment on it, as a noteworthy phenomenon? Are we locating such sources and reporting on what <i>they</i> say is significant about ED? No, because such sources do not yet exist, as far as I can tell, anyway. Until you're doing that, you're doing original research. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, stop spreading the nonsense. An article about some document (be it a book or a website) can and should use the document itself as a source. In fact, it is the most reliable source available.

<dd>Grue, I'd appreciate if you don't speculate about my motivations. I happen to really like ED, have an account there, and think their take on Wikipedia is hilarious. I also agree that, if this article is to exist, it certainly should use ED as <i>a</i> source (obviously we would want to link to examples of what we're talking about), but not as the only one. At that point, it's original research, and there's no difference between using a non-notable website as a source about itself and using some self-published book you wrote yesterday as a source about itself. Independent reliable sources have not yet seen fit to talk about ED and provide us with sourced material yet. I'll be ecstatic when they do; until then, this article doesn't have the kind of sourcing it needs. You can say I'm speaking out of pettiness if you want to drag the conversation to that level, but it won't make it true. I'm speaking out of my belief that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are sound policies that should be followed more strongly and more enthusiastically than they currently are, because they are what will make Wikipedia more trustworthy and more valuable. Now, if you think my argumets are based on ignorance, perhaps you can lead me to better understanding by teaching me what I currently don't know. I'd be quite happy to have that conversation with you. Can we do it quite civilly, though? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>VERY STRONG SMERGE</b>. I've looked over the history of this article, as well as this discussion, and it seems to be breaking out into a war similar to that which happened to Brian Peppers, which ended very controversially. I don't want to see that happen again. Therefore, I am proposing this compromise to stop stupid debates like this once and for all. To my understanding, much of this information is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a>, and thus must be removed. However, there is some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information, at least in the opener that can be written without violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It is also my understanding that both ED regulars and Wikipedia admins are trolling the page and personally attacking each other. Several people even want this deleted because ED bashes Wikipedia. Censoring Wikipedia bashers violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> last time I checked. One person also sarcastically asked if <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Book_2873.html" title="World Book">World Book</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Brittanica_8ec0.html" title="Encyclopedia Brittanica">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a> (sp?) would have this. Well, they wouldn't have articles on a lot of notable stuff we have here, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a paper encyclopedia. However, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox either, which is what about 4/5 of the article is. Also, the fact that so many Wikipedians, including myself (I'm an Uncyclopedian), hate ED, makes this have notability. I ask everyone, especially the extreme keepers and deletionists, to take this argument very seriously. This is one of those debates that went on for <b>an extremely long time</b> and have become <b>flamewars</b>. These debates need to end with all of us giving up a little of what we want to establish a firm community consensus so that doctrine doesn't get forced down our throats. Find a place for the one or two notable, verifiable sentences, and delete the rest of the article. Let's stop the trolling and settle this properly, okay? Thank you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm fairly new to this discussion and have mostly been reading the comments of others, but it seems rather odd to me that we are considering deleting an article on a website which is home to a great deal of negative criticism of Wikipedia. It would not appear very favorable, now would it? I have done some reading of ED's articles on Wikipedia, and I can imagine that the editors of ED would be <i>thrilled</i> to see non-ED'er Wikipedians deleting the article on ED. It would serve to confirm every negative thing they say about Wikipedia. That alone is reason enough to keep, maybe prune it back to a stub, maybe block certain known abusive editors from being involved with it (esp. those cited as ED users above, per WP:vanity), but in general, keep it. Deletion is too draconian a solution. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 01:10, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must admit that I don't understand precisely what the notability and verifiability complaints <i>are</i>. If the article isn't that notable, it should be trimmed back; I feel that at least some mention of ED is warranted, so I suppose it would be fair to characterize my opinion as being that ED is at least minimally notable. As for verifiability, is there a concern that ED pages are being changed and thus cannot be cited? Don't they have permanent page history like WP? If so, just link to the specific revision in which a claim was made rather than the article name, and add a caveat explaining that ED is a wiki and its content may change. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 07:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For me, it has more to do with avoiding original research, which is intimately linked with verifiability. I understand our policy to be: first something exists, then people in the world take enough note of it, someone publishes words about it, and then we get to write a Wikipedia article based on those published words. That gives you notability, verifiability, and the certainty that you're not doing original research, all in one. I don't see that happening with this article. Most of the facts in it just came from people who happen to be familiar with the website, which is pretty much the definition of original research. If we insist on using facts that come from independent, reliable published sources, then we aren't doing our own research. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I can't believe the utterly obvious double standards over web content notability guidelines that exist on Wikipedia. Having trawled through countless trivial and banal entries for webcomics, I can tell you 100% that any webcomic with an Alexa rank of 24,000 would be speedily kept and the nominator slapped on the wrist for a bad faith nomination. There is, and should be one guideline for web material, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, why the page interpretes as very much laxer for webcomics is beyond me. The amount of delete votes here suggest that any web material less notable or popular would be railgunned out of existence forever. This however, is not the case at Wikipedia, as can be seen in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_%282nd_nomination%29_db2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)">this AFD</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greeneyes_89ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes">this AFD</a> and many others.

<dl>
<dd>I can interpret "the lack of independent reliable sources for the contents of the article" in one of two ways -- as referring to verifiability, or to notability. In terms of verifiability, most claims made in the article are verfied through primary sources (i.e. if Wikipedia says "ED says X", a link to a page saying X on ED is verification; in fact, its better verification than a link to a secondary source would be.) There are a few <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, but I don't think that's a major issue. In terms of notability -- when dealing with websites, or Internet memes/phenomena, its not always possible to determine notablity by reference to "mainstream" sources, because this is the kind of stuff mainstream sources tend to ignore. But that doesn't necessarily mean they are unnotable... at the end of the day, notability guidelines (or even "policies") are only guidelines -- they are applied in accordance to consensus. (This AFD is one way of measuring that consensus.) --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 08:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I guess I have this picture of how Wikipedia is supposed to work, and this article and many web-related ones conflict rather badly with that picture. My picture is this: first something exists in the world, then people notice it, and if enough people care enough about it, they start writing about it in published works. After that happens, we get to write an article about it. I got this picture largely from AfD discussions relating to biography articles. It's also reinforced by my conception of an encyclopedia as a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, which relies on reliable and independent secondary sources. They serve as a filter, both in terms of verifiability and notability. In this discussion, I'm seeing people trying to bypass that filter, which is probably not how they see it at all. I guess we're dealing with conflicting visions of what Wikipedia is. I'm not sure how to resolve that. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 08:53, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, "published sources" are inevitably going to exhibit selection biases. And of course, Wikipedia is inevitably going to have selection biases as well. The question is -- what selection bias does Wikipedia want to have? Personally, I think in writing an we need to consider both published sources &amp; the collective experiences of Wikipedians--something can be notable if enough people here agree it is notable, even if published sources have not considered it notable. I think, in part because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper, Wikipedia need not be beholden to published sources. But this is really a question which needs to be answered through Wikipedia's decision making processes (such as this one)... --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 09:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>If enough people here agree it is notable...</i>". I think that's a bad idea. That's a good way to really hard-wire our systematic biases, for one thing. It's a good way to make Wikipedia more about internet culture and less trusted as a source for general information. It's a good way to make Wikipedia more like Encyclopedia Dramatica. I think it should be a matter of pride for us to have high standards for verifiability in independent reliable sources. If we actually get good about that, Wikipedia will be so much stronger. Articles like this erode at that possibility, and that's why I feel compelled to speak up against it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

"Notable" is really a codeword for "people who publish reliable sources have taken note of it, and talked about it in print". A tempest in this teacup means nothing. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 11:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the site is not very notable and in borderline nobility cases, I'm willing to entertain factors that I would not otherwise to make the decision. However, "borderline" is a charitable description in this case, as I have higher standards of notability than most editors. First, I received a spam email concerning the article. Second, the site has attack pages on Wikipedia editors. Third, those who edit the site are extremely interested in having a Wikipedia article and have gone to extraordinary lengths to have the article kept. This is a very bad sign. A notable organization would not care whether it has a Wikipedia article and a good non-notable organization would let the decision be made without trying to influence it, especially in an underhanded manner. Finally, unless an evil site, person or organization is so notable that Wikipedia would be incomplete not to have an article on it, like Charles Manson or the Aryan Nations, it should not have an article. When dealing with topics that are not very notable, Wikipedia can sometimes participate in the topic, increasing its notability, rather than just documenting it. In many cases, this is innocuous. In other cases, such as articles whose subjects are evil, it might not be. Wikipedia should never promote evil, not even a little and not even unintentionally. Based upon the attack pages, and the failure of the site to delete them, I believe that Encyclopædia Dramatica is evil. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment:</b> Actually, even if the main article is deleted, wouldn't a recreation after under parody count as a seperate article? Also, does anyone have any reason under policy that it shouldn't just be moved there NOW to end this nightmare? I now support just moving it RIGHT NOW. I'm tired of this, and if even thinks this won't be a no concensus vote where either a vote to keep or delete won't be met with scorn and appeal all the way up to ArbCom they're not thinking right. Rather than waste EVERYONE's time anymore I say we just move it to the parody section. Some day when (simple law of probability states it will happen... in 5 days, 5 months, 5 years, or 5 decades) when the site gets more notable press it can move back to the main name space. My vote is now to end the AfD, stick it in parody, and be done with it? Even if a truly neutral admin makes it a keep vote someone will just AfD this again and we will indeed have the next <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>.

<p><b>Comment:</b> It must be noted that as of 10am PDT on 7/20/06 Admin name: Zanium is abusively editing the protected article as part of possible bias vs. the subject matter. It has been raised as an issue at AN:I but not addressed yet and he has not reverted. This is biased as 1) no editor can challenge his unilateral edits; 2) its a policy violation; 3) further evidence that as the thing that brought this to the fore was the attack on MONGO by the ED site, there is NO way for this to happen fairly. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 17:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC) <b>Comment</b>: We do, when it seems otherwise reasonable, accept people's statements about themselves and their own field.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Marginally notable at best, but so much dust has been kicked up that it's hard to tell. There are so many blatant contradictions to Wikipedia policies and practices in the discussion that it's pointless to single any out. To keep the article under these circumstances just invites more dust-kicking. So delete the article (again?) for now, which is no great loss (if any). Then if the promotors of the site succeed in making it clearly notable <i>without</i> the help of Wikipedia and our many mirrors, someone <b>unconnected with the site</b> will recreate the article at an appropriate time, and will be able to provide unequivocal references to support notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>, yes this appears to fall short of the WP:WEB guideline, but it has survided two AfDs as "keep" and "no consensus." (The "delete" VfD was very early in the site's existence.) If it were possible to keep stable, it could be a small stub like <a href="../../../o/r/t/OrthodoxWiki_8874.html" title="OrthodoxWiki">OrthodoxWiki</a>. As it is many of the "references" are weak at best, eg. the Washington Post article that "refers to" ED actually refers to a webpage that happens to be on ED - it doesn't refer to ED as a site, nor does it even say "this page at ED." I tend toward delete per Andrewa, but the previous "keep" AfD gives pause. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 14:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Why should this be a stub? ED is similar to <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> (although much funnier) and that has an article filled with useless trivia about the site, with the only references being on the site itself.

<dd>As I've said above, I think the verifiability issue is covered by the provision of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> that allow otherwise unused sources to be acceptable sources on themselves; and these mentions do go some way to establishing notability. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:03, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What do you think of the whole vision of Wikipedia whereby things happen in the world; and then secondary sources write about them because they're notable, and hence noted; and then we report what the secondary sources reported as notable, since we're a tertiary source? At that point, we certainly may link directly to the website, or to otherwise iffy sources, in certain circumstances, but we don't get to just bypass the middle step where people who actually publish words for a living <i>take note</i> of the subject and generate secondary source material. Does that picture of how Wikipedia works seem wrong to you, or how do you see it, that's different? I ask because I feel that I was taught pretty directly in my early experiences here to think of Wikipedia that way, and I'm sometimes surprised that it's not a more widely-held vision. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article thus exists, and by your model is valid to exist? Or does "whereby things happen in the world" have a different standard with websites/online events? As of 2006 I consider the internet to functionally be part of "IRL". When I go out my car, cell phone, laptop, wife's phone, and (if she let me buy it, curse her!) my watch as well, will be 'internets' connected. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 08:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I agree that the fact that ED hosts the <i>tl;dr</i> article is properly cited. Right now, that's the only thing I know of that can be properly cited, besides the Alexa stuff. It's not a basis for an article. I asked Pmanderson the question I did because he seemed to be saying that verifiability doesn't require independent reliable sources, so I wondered if he was operating from a different vision than I was. I may have misunderstood him; if so, I hope I'll be corrected. It's becoming clear to me that we're dealing in this discussion with conflicting visions of what Wikipedia should be, and I think it would be great if we can get to the core of that issue and talk about it directly. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
