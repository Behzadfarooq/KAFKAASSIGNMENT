The blogger has accused Guardian journalist of inventing material in a national newspaper, for which he has supplied no evidence. Violation of copyright laws.

<p>I just don’t think the argument that the site tilts at windmills is fair or accurate. Jews sans frontieres criticises and exposes the arguments of prominent political, media and academic figures&#160;: E.g. Prof Dershowitz, The Jewish Chronicle, Nick Cohen, Jonathan Freedland and David Aaronovitch. Some of the posts are extremely well argued and not found elsewhere. The post on David Aaronvitch’s column on Galloway's libel trial for example identifies what can generously be described as a series of mistakes, distortions and omissions. I think the site is polemical and sometimes hits hard and could be more charitable to some of its targets, but I think the Guardian columnist seemed to be practising a bit of dishonesty. Personally I think generosity to opponents is important, but not everyone shares this view. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Patrickmurphy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patrickmurphy_4940.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patrickmurphy">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Clearly there are some people who wish to see the Jewsansfrontiere blog deleted, not it isn't newsworthy, interesting, provocative etc. but because a Jewish anti-Zionist perspective is unacceptable to them. What they are seeking is censorship of views unpalatable to themselves. Hence the reference to libel, designed to scare the children but a nonsense nonetheless. If the site was libellous it would already have been sued.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Wikipaedia site is going the same way as most media in the United States or affected by the latter. That is why Noam Chomsky can't get a hearing in US papers but is feted in Britain or why the NYT praises veritable forgeries, Dershowitz (Case 4 Israel), Lynn Peters (From Time Immemorial) and then refuses any response, so these forgeries are exposed in Britain and, yes, Israel. The deletion of this page, which is acknowledged as a place where healthy debate takes place, will be at the urging of those to whom censorship is second nature. In Israel they'll lock you up for it, on Wikipaedia they'll only delete what you say. The principle remains the same.</p>
<p>And yes, if Wikipaedia is going to fulfill its function it has to take on board different perspectives including an anti-Zionist Jewish perspective, which Jewssansfrontiere does very well.</p>

<li>It would be a great pity if this blog were deleted, particularly when others equally 'un-noteworthy' remain listed.

<dd>I think there's a serious question here re WP:WEB, which is that, inasmuch as those guidelines (and they <i>are</i> guidelines, not policy, as far as I'm aware) highly privilege citation in the mainstream media, then any blog which is devoted to examining what it sees as a serious consensus, and silencing of voices against that consensus, in said media, is unlikely <i>if that central hypothesis is right</i> to benefit from the citations that WP places such emphasis on. <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogville_7eee.html" title="User:Dogville">Dogville</a> 14:14, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> - The fact that this entry has elicited such violent and abusive responses (on the discussion page) from Mark Elf's political opponents is itself clear evidence of its notability.<a href="../../../r/_/b/User%7ER_Bartholomew_f59f.html" title="User:R Bartholomew">R Bartholomew</a> 19:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Clear error in reasoning. That wikipedians (possibly viewers of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, rather than political opponents or supporters) believe the article should be killed is no evidence of notability at all. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I suggest you look over the nature of the comments before diagnosing "clear error in reasoning". I'm not refering to the discussion above, but to the comments which appear on the discussion page of the "Jews sans Frontieres" entry itself. It's clear that some of these are motivated by extreme political hostility, expressed in vulgar and slanderous terms.<a href="../../../r/_/b/User%7ER_Bartholomew_f59f.html" title="User:R Bartholomew">R Bartholomew</a> 09:56, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> The hostile comments on the discussion page all appear to be from one individual, of a rather demented type. I think the content and style of his remarks have ruled him out for any serious attention on the Wikipedia project. They are nonsense from beginning to end. But there the fact that Mr Elf is being persecuted by an evident nutjob does not mean that on this basis he merits inclusion under the grounds of notability (this date stamp reflects the fact that I've just worked out how to sign my name!) --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobfoster_85b7.html" title="User:Robfoster">Robfoster</a> 06:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)Rob Foster</li>
