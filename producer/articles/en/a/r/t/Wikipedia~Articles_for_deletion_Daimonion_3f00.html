It's not, both in book and in the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_World_d69d.html" title="Real World">Real World</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimonion.html" title="Daimonion">Daimonion</a> is a constrained personality packed in a shell, frozen, marked with a name by which is later <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summon.html" title="Summon">summoned</a> and burned into <b>something</b>, but it does not have to be some nanocomputer embedded in the brain, which technique will reach mass market only in 72 years. There are <b>DOCUMENTED</b> examples of people, who <b>DO NOT SUFFER</b> because of mulltiple personality disorder - contrary-wise! - they are ENCHANCED and happier that before. It' real, real, real!!!</li>
<li><b>The article is not finished</b>. I plan to add at least twice as much and streamline (cleanup) the rest according to your definition of style. Sephira: You seem to avoid putting too many links on a page, perhaps for pragmatic reasons, perhaps for private estetic reasons - in which case I would argue if such law is appropriate in so colourful community.</li>
<li>One can argue about <i>empyrical evidence</i>, but it's little unfair, becase we lack the machinery to read people thoghts and provide a transcript, like telephone wiretap order result. Certainly you agree, that <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_personality_disorder.html" title="Multiple personality disorder">multiple personality disorder</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manic_depression.html" title="Manic depression">manic depression</a> exist and are worthy of describing in the WikiPedia? Ask yourself in presence of <b>evidence</b>, why not?</li>
<li>It's <b>not original research</b>, 90% of the idea is copied directly from the book, I only streamlined it and fixed in places where it didn't <i>click</i>.</li>
<li>I am planning to <b>add quotes from the book</b> to give some reference and flavour (it show very interesting technique of presenting narration, in scenes when Ariste is talking or working with the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimonion.html" title="Daimonion">daimonions</a> and many things happen at the same time). The daimonion concept is a central plot device and is so brilliant <b>I</b>n <b>M</b>y <b>V</b>ery <b>H</b>umble <b>O</b>pinion, that it <b>deserves to be mentioned separate from the book</b>. Hence, <b>it deserves a separate article</b>.</li>
<li>Did Agquarx 12:15, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC) manage to push the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pendulum.html" title="Pendulum">pendulum</a> in You a little toward more balance in balance of power and healty dose of imbalance or maybe you have some contra-arguments? <b>Please be civil and sensible.</b> <b>Please think before you act.</b> <b>Please don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.</b> I propose to discuss more instead of (useless and stupid) hastily and hostile voting before discussing - you are supposed to <b>serve the community</b>, NOT the other way, a a final arbiter and antivandal defence field, am I right? You act too fast - I forgive you, because <b>it's probably because of too much work fighting spamming morons and bots</b>, but don't be fooled that it's OK, it probably <b>did damage in the past and migt do a lot more damage in the future</b>. -Agquarx 12:15, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
