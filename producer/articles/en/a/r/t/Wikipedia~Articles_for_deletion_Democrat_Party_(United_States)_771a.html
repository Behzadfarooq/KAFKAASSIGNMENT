<p>The result of the debate was <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>. OK, this was a tough one. There is a lot to read here and consensus is not clear cut. A careful review of the material in the article itself suggests that there might be SOME value in some of it. By leaving it as a redirect, that material is accessible to people that want to move it to the target article. I have half an expectation that this will go to DRV, which is fine, I may be reading the sense wrong, but that's what it feels like to me. I welcome review by others. --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but cleanup as above.

Terraxos 23:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete &amp; Redirect.</b> Including this article in an encyclopedia dignifies a perjorative talk-radio term that is always used disparagingly. I appreciate the cleanup and NPOV sentiment, but the topic is too controversal to be cleaned up or NPOVed.

<li><b>Keep and edit for POV</b> While I understand the concerns about including pejorative terms, I don't think they're necessarily valid, if the article does not display an overt bias. There are dozens of examples of pejorative terms that probably should be kept in WP, for documentation and to enhance understanding (see: <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Because this is documented, verifiable, and includes references to scholarly material, I think it is hard to argue that this article is, in itself, POV, though some of the material included in it should be reviewed to ensure NPOV stance (it is difficult to maintain such a stance in an inherently POV discussion, but we're not going to remove <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, even if it takes a negative POV toward the use of the word--edit, perhaps, but not remove).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think part of the perceived problem with this article is that it's also very close in name to another article. This is only a problem of perception--if the concepts are distinct (which in this case they are), the articles should be distinct. Merging should not be a course of action, nor is it a good compromise, since the terms are definitely distinct. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 00:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It can be as documented, verifiable, referenced, and scholarly as it wants, but if it's on a subject that isn't noteworthy, it shouldn't be included in this project. The material is already covered quite adequately on the real article on the party. Before material is even considered on grounds of NPOV and Verifiability, it must first pass the test of notability. This does not. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 04:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really? My <b>google check</b> for "Democrat party" and "pejorative" (which in itself is a very limiting term, with many possible synonyms) pulls up <b>999 links</b>. That's not a small number at all, especially (as I said) considering the limiting factor of a term like "pejorative". I'd like to know from what objective basis you derived your claim that this does not pass the notability test. "Democrat party" with "offensive" pulls up <b>187,000 links</b>. Note that a few of these links (especially the latter) also pull up sites that are <i>actively using</i> the term in a pejorative or negative light (saying, coincidentally, that the "democrat party" is doing something offensive, racist, whatever). That's as strong of proof as references to the term. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22democrat+party%22+offensive&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22democrat+party%22+offensive&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 05:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry, I think it's significant. I was "recruited" to vote against this article on my talk page, which is how my attention was brought to it.

<li><s>I am completely lost. What are you talking about?</s> If editors are vote stacking, that's bad. If they are informing a broad base of editors with varying POV, I don't see the conflict. I don't think 'votes for deletion' are the exclusive purview of folks who watch the page. The difference is intent - to slant the results or just to broaden the base of the vote. I don't claim to know the political views of the folks who were contacted, so I can't say it's 'stacking'... but we definitely agree that stacking is certainly bad and not in the interests of WP. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 01:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was told "Our old friend Rjensen is up to his tricks again," or somesuch, presumedly because I had a drawn-out talk discussion on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_3d4e.html" title="American History">American History</a> with Rjensen at some point. I feel that's a very biased way to advertise an AfD, though I don't know for sure it is vote stacking since he did suggest I "weigh in" and not "vote to delete". I wonder if he did a talk page search for Rjensen and contacted everyone who's argued with him?

<li>Hehe. We just edit conflicted on this very phrase. I had the same response to the message on your talk page from Griot that (while clearly indicating his desire to delete) says he 'hope(s) you will weigh in on the topic'. That seems less than an outright attempt to instruct you on how to vote.

<li>The most important thing is whether this article has merits on its own. It is simply an attempt to create another "Democratic Party" article using the perjorative. I would not approve of a Republicrat Party article for the same reason. Neither term is more than dictionary definition that merits inclusion in the main article namely <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> - See my other reasons below. I understand your objections to being recruited - but I wouldn't let that get in the way of looking out for Wikipedia and the project to provide the best information to the public at large we can.

<li>I think that if it is notable enough for scholarly research to have been performed specifically on the subject, it is notable enough for WP.

<li><b>Merge &amp; Redirect</b>. Wikipedia is not a Dictionary. An article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> already exists on Wikipedia and treats the subject in the NPOV manner that it should be treated.

The way the article reads now, it is as if it is about the Democratic Party in the United States and thus is a repeat of that topic. Since there is no Democrat Party and the term directly applies to the Democratic Party in the United States, it should be mentioned in that article and does not warrant an article of its own. Further, users of Wikipedia, especially children may be directed to the wrong article as a result of this article and not typing in the correct spelling. At best there should be a redirect to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>--<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 00:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That depends on the quantity of information available. I think it is a lacking article, but there is a great deal of information to be related, judging from the quantity of work that has apparently been done on the topic. I think the article should remove any similarity between itself and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> to focus on its distinction, however. Since your argument was not at all the rationale behind the nomination, I could not think it appropriate to vote "delete" on its basis, but it is your prerogative, of course.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article isn't an attack on the Democratic Party; it's a report of an attack on the Democratic Party.

I don't favor merger because this particular petty nastiness by the Republicans isn't important enough in the overall history of the Democratic Party to deserve this much detail in the Democratic Party article.

<li>Finally, we disagree. Let the games begin.

<li>I think there's good evidence that there is such information. Additionally, this much information does not need to be placed under the header of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>, as it is not so directly related to the party itself that it should be "required reading" for anyone researching the party itself.

<li>I don't see that the article makes the case it's a significant term. Historically, it seems some have used it as a synonym, some have used it casually.

The Republican party seems to like it, but even they can't really say why, or what, if anything, it means. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I know I am, and I think most others are. This is a badly written article, and a good plan for an article, with substantial information or potential sources of information to include. As for Fan1967: I think there's a good argument that it does mean <i>something</i>, specifically that the Democratic Party is not necessarily democratic. Additionally there is the uh, pun debate (if you can call it a pun)--googling the term brings up a lot of talk of the "DemocRAT Party", a further matter of possible discussion, though I'm not sure that there's as much established material on that specific aspect (there does seem to be on the original point). <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 05:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that this article is badly written, but I think the topic lends itself to bad writing. It strains to have anything to say about this term, as it must, because there isn't really that much to say. The term is used by a handful of Republicans to complain about perceived faults in the Democratic Party. It's really a code word. It is very hard to write an objective article about a code word without using POV. A better place for "Democrat Party" is List of political epithets, where indeed it already is. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGriot_3b50.html" title="User:Griot">Griot</a> 18:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, kizzle, I agree with you that the article must report the attack as opposed to furthering it.

<p><b>Delete or substantially change and shorten</b> If kept, the article should be much shortened to eliminate redundant examples and should elaborate much more clearly the context of this variant name: (1) that it has a long history as an occasionally used name for the party, even by Democrats, (2) that its current usage is largely driven by Republican Party politicians, officials and partisans (aka "talk radio"), who have fastened on promoting this as their preferred name for their opponents, and (3) that almost universally in major reference sources and news media the name "Democratic Party" is standard usage, as it is by the party itself. A non-tendentious article along these lines may be possible, but the present article isn't it.

<dd>I'm going to make a counterintuitive argument now--GOP, being a semi-official name for the party, is <i>more</i> significant and <i>more</i> related to the actual Republican Party article. Thus it makes sense that it's included. While I think this article is sufficiently significant to host on Wikipedia (despite my usual tendency towoard uh, deletionism), it is <i>not</i> closely related to the topic of the party itself due to its use only as a pejorative euphamism. It is historically and politically significant as a reference, but not because it is a major issue relating to the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>. It is a concept in its own right, one that references the party but which should not be included in an overview article of the party's history, platform, etc. As such, while I do not think it should be deleted, I think it is far better that it be deleted than merged. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 02:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>From WP:NOTABILITY: <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</i> The pointed use of, and controversy over, the term "Democrat Party" is not known outside a narrow interest group (devoted political partisans of either side), and has no particular importance or impact. It is about as notable as the term "jigaboo", which you will find redirects, quite appropriately, to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>. Wikipedia has no need to have a separate article for every nasty term and slur someone has ever thought to call someone else. Likewise, there is no need to detail every attack against the Democratic Party which has ever been made with its own article. They have no relevance <i>beyond</i> a discussion of the Democratic Party itself (or possibly within a discussion of the Republican Party's actions regarding their opponents), and therefore the information should be found under the article on the Democratic Party. If it is appropriate to create an article for "Democrat Party", then it is also appropriate to create articles for "spendocrat" and "tax-and-spend liberal" and other pejoratives for Democratic Party members. Since such articles clearly would not be appropriate, we can by analogy safely presume that "Democrat Party" is not either.
<dl>
<dd>Wait. Okay, this means that were the human population to suddenly become stupider and more ill-informed, <i>everything on Wikipedia would lose its notability!</i> Okay, that's a joke--I'm not saying anyone that hasn't heard the term is an idiot, because that is pretty silly. But there is a whole lot of stuff on WP that you (and I) don't know yet. Might not have even heard of it. That doesn't make it worthless... in fact that's what makes it useful to begin with. I think the notability tests prove that this <i>is</i> significant, in that 1,850,000 sites on the Internet were created by people who knew the term, as well as 999 people who specifically stated that it is "pejorative". That far surpasses the notability of a great deal of the material on Wikipedia. I find it damn near impossible to claim this is not notable, as a result. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 02:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. This is the standard term used by the White House for the last 5 years. It has been the subject of scholarly articles and discussions for over 50 years. Will people hear this term on talk radio--or when President Bush gives an address? Yes. If they turn to Wiki they might learn a good deal of history that goes back 75 years. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 05:16, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the White House website gives over 2000 hits for "Democrat" (mostly to Democrat as adjective); it usually saves "democratic" for foreign visitors. Note the adjective is NOT pejorative to all Democreats. Google shows 56,500 hits for "Democrat Club" --the great majority sponsored by Democrats. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As you should know the term "Democrat" is used to describe someone in the Democratic Party, which is the official name of that party and should be honored here at Wikipedia. Further as you should know, any hits for "Democrat" must include description of members. But, the term "Democrat Party" is not widely accepted and when used is used a perjorative by the Republican Party or more so right-wing Republican's on talk radio. The honest thing to do here is redirect to the Democratic Party page and be done with it. As far as "Democrat Clubs" that makes perfect sense because people in the Democratic Party are called Democrats; but the PARTY is called the DEMOCRATIC PARTY and has been OFFICIALLY since JACKSON. This article needs to be redirected to the PROPER PAGE. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 12:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The proper thing is that, when there's substantial evidence of a certain occurance such as this, that we have an article on it. A redirect will not do it justice, and, if you're concerned about an "honest" assessment of the Democratic party, a redirect will only serve to "accept" the pejorative as a normal, unintentional rephrasing. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a very good point that I had not thought to investigate. Especially with Fleischer, it seems the White House used the term repeatedly. The point that should be noted is that it's not pejorative enough to draw attention to itself... it <i>sounds</i> like a mistake. But it's used every time. It seems clear (and research indicates) that the purpose is to produce dissociation between "democratic" and "Democratic" in the listener. E.g. "And I think, frankly, that that's a view -- Senator Miller, for example, was -- noted yesterday that he warned his own party, the Democrat Party, to stay away from that type of argument because he thought it would not work and it would hurt the Democrats."
