<dd>"Oh whoops" yourself, you must have forgotten, for instance, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> which states in great big bold-face letters at the top: <b>"This page is a notability criteria guideline for Wikipedia"</b>. There's an entire category for these policies and guidelines you claim don't exist. It's called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_notability_criteria_535d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia notability criteria">Category:Wikipedia notability criteria</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, User:Some Random IP is right - <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a guideline for music, not for notability. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is neither a policy nor a guideline. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, I <i>know</i> it's a guideline for music, what's your point? It's also about <i>notability</i> in music. Maybe you should remove the giant boldface phrase "notability criteria guideline" from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> then, and several other guidelines as well. And I didn't say anything about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, that's something you brought up. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:33, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point is that its not a guideline for notability - it's a guideline for music. It establishes certain guidelines pretaining to music, and uses the term notability, but doesn't establish any guidelines about notability. There are no notability guidelines. It may be a somewhat semantic point, but the net result is that notability isn't important for P-P-P-Powerbook. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If it doesn't establish any guidelines about notability, why does it say <b>"This page is a notability criteria guideline for Wikipedia"</b>? Why does it go on to say <b>"This page gives some rough guidelines which we might use to decide if a musical topic is notable"</b>? And why does it have a column on the right listing many other articles, under the header <b>"Notability guidelines"</b>? Yes, you do indeed seem to be making an <i>extremely</i> semantic point, as does the anon IP. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The upshot of it is that notability is not, nor is it supposed to be, a grounds for deletion except in specific cases (i.e. where we need to combat spam). Which is why notability is not a criterion for deletion in a huge variety of fields, like math, science and so on. If you think <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is about notability, you've missed the point of it entirely. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
