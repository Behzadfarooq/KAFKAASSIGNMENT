<li>Keep that up, and you're going to get tangled up in your own words and fall on your ass. Oops, I see you already have. Fact is, there is just plain no consensus. Schools do not get deleted not because the keep votes win, but because lack of consensus always defaults to keep. And what is consensus? A two-thirds vote one way or the other. The break just happens to go your way.

<dd>It's the keepers trying to force numbers here. Being unencyclopedic and basicly contentless is a valid reason for deletion. Why don't you spend a little more time on expanding school articles rather than creating (or supporting the creation) of hordes of ugly stubs? If the articles contained more info a lot less people would tend to delete them. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:11, 6 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>School articles are nominated on the basis of being schools and have to be defended on that basis - if this was about a village or a university it would be left in peace. This stub might not be too beautiful, but it has useful and encyclopedic content and should not require defense. Creating stubs is the fastest way to improve wikipedia's coverage, although I might be making stubs about places in Chad if people didn't keep attacking schools. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:02, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, a school is neither a village or a university. And in any case, most articles on villages and universities contain more info than this pathetic little stub. Perhaps instead of supporting these no-name schools, or creating stubs on villages in Chad, you can put your money where your mouth is and add some much-needed content to soem of these school articles you've been so adamant in saving. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:45, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Cop-out, Kappa. Almost all articles face some danger, even if vanishingly small, of deletion. School articles tend, as you have stated several times, to be kept, even in their usually-pathetic state. However, I am not the only deletionist who would vote to keep a school article if it included info that demonstrated notability. You are actually decreasing the likelihood of an article being deleted by adding to it; is that not what you want? Or are you simply voting 'keep' while letting others do the work of ensuring keepability? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:20, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The whole point is that deleting "non-notable" schools destroys wikipedia's coverage of education. Most schools aren't any more notable than average, there isn't anything I can do to the article to change that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I could sure run with that one if I wanted, Kappa. But I'll just leave you to ponder how an article listing a school's location, the name of the principal, the number of students, and the school colors could possibly have anything whatsoever to do with education. This depressing description could be of virtually any of the school articles currently on board. Wikipedia is covering nothing except a school census. And thank you for noting that most schools aren't any more notable than average. That being the case, why are we keeping them? We don't keep "average" anything else. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 05:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.<i>School articles are nominated on the basis of being schools and have to be defended on that basis</i>. No. They are nominated on the basis that they are Not Notable, Not Encyclopedic, or otherwise Not Wikiworthy. Getting into a debate about inherent notability is ridiculous - you should only vote keep if that <i>particular</i> school is notable enough to be in Wikipedia. At the moment, everyone is just voting keep because "it's a school, and we always keep schools". Just look at the reasoning - <i>There's something unique about every school</i>. Come on, there's something unique about <b>everything</b>. Every bus stop, every side street, every person, every house. If that argument were brought out on any other AfD people would be Rolling on the Floor, Laughing. "Keep the article about King Edward Pedestrian Crossing, Namibia, there is something unique about every pedestrian crossing, we should expand it into something interesting".

<li>You've used this argument before, and the response is the same - no one votes to "Keep" an article on a destroyer because "Destroyers are inherently notable".

<li>You've missed the point. If and when a destroyer, or magazine, or pokemon is nominated for AfD, we can have a rational discussion about notability.

<li>That's a ridiculous conclusion. Schools are inheritly not notable - they are just a pile a bricks. Ask yourself, why are the other articles kept and what makes them notable? The answer is it's connection to people plus uniqueness. People almost never go back to a school they go to - and why do they go back when they actually do? Its because of the teachers, not the pile of cement that is the "school". That's why these articles are doomed to be substub articles with a very low quality for eternity - there is no connection to people here, no notability, just the same thing as the last school article. There is no point in having 99% these around, thus the term "schoolcruft" - they are just there to take up server space. Sorry to those who are offended but it's true - and even if you did expand the article it would be no different then any other article about 99% of the schools here. There are some school articles that are worth having - but almost nothing I've seen come here fits that. What we should do is make an article for the school district and give a blurb for the school there - as, quite frankly, these articles are never going to be nothing more than a blurb and table anyway. While we're at it, if we are going to have an article on every school we should have an article on every person too - because even one teacher at a school is generally more notable then the school itself, and it seems silly to keep schools and not teachers. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 03:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>School articles aren't about buildings, they are about organizations which shape everyone's lives. They might all look indentical to you, but you are obviously neither interested in the school itself, nor schools in general, so you aren't really the target audience. If you think schools should be covered in school district articles, you should be voting merge, not delete. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:02, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well now - first off I disagree that they are "organizations which shape everyone's lives" - they teach - that is their function. That's why if there is an article around here its about a sports program or something of the school - because the schools inheritly all do the same thing. The organization does not do the life-shaping - its the people at the organization. The organization recieves a set sum of money to teach/etc. either from a government or a set of people - thus the inherit non-notability. Also, I am interested in a school article and would like to see a good one but this is not it, neither are most of the other ones I've voted on. As for merge, well, no one else is voting merge here and as merge defaults to keep I'd rather see it deleted in that case (that and there's nothing to merge to). Right now 99% of the school articles here are a small collection of trivia, which does not seem to belong here. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 04:14, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>See #Keep, but briefly, as I understand the arguments, schools are <i>public institutions</i> essential to <i>communities</i> and masses of individuals in their formative years. They are generally <i>fixed in location</i>, and often have <i>long histories</i>. They are likely each to attract substantial <i>communities of interest</i> to WP. I don't firmly agree with these points, but I see some value. My high school, for example, was founded in 1970, with an average class size of 1,000 people. It serves a city of 70,000, each citizen likely to know it. It is known across the entire US state, and well-known by adjacent towns, such that I estimate at least 350,000 people know of it and have reason to search for it. In my state, my school <i>is</i> (or was) average (ie. I looked up class size and campus size when enrolled there, and it was in the middle.) 350,000 potential searchers is good enough, arguably. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do <b>firmly believe</b>, however, that these arguments absolutely distinguish schools from boxes, gyms, bars, factories, and all the other general categories to which the are compared by some here. Generally, most students have at least some interest in their school (if only because they are stuck there in young life when they would rather be outside), and I <i>know</i> most parents have an interest in their children's school. The aggregate community attachment to these places, in my experience, far exceeds community concern for other "buildings," as schools are called here in dimunition by some. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sadly, sir, you are quite wrong. <i>Some</i> parents have an interest in their child's school. <i>Most</i> parents do not, though they do have an interest in their child's performance in their school. I speak from many years' experience as a former teacher, attempting to get parental involvement in my school. Good luck. And the higher the grade level, the less likelihood of getting that involvement. Parents are more interested in the local Safeway than in the local school. Laugh if you will, but parents spend more time there, they spend more money there, and they make more decisions regarding groceries than regarding school. It is less likely the Safeway flier will go directly in the recycle bin than the school newsletter.

<li>I will try to say this without yelling. I do not discourage substantial contributions. I <i>welcome</i> substantial contributions. I <i>beg for</i> substantial contributions. Is "Rockford High School is a school in Rockford Ontario. Its principal is Ralph Black. It has 360 students. Its school colors are red and blue" a substantial contribution? Only if your expectations are very low. Mine are not. As a matter of fact, these appear to be very much the "trivial articles" you accuse me of doing nothing to discourage. Seems to me I'm doing everything I can to discourage them. And I beg to differ that I am wasting your time. Surely if your (literally) empty articles are worth keeping, they are worth defending. How is that a waste of time? It is not like <i>I</i> brought these to AfD, and it is not like I am setting out to find school articles to bring before AfD. Furthermore, no article gets a free ride on AfD. Did no one tell you that? What it looks like you want is for me to go away so you can have your own way. If you have made decent school articles, then I congratulate you. If they are decent school articles which contain worthwhile and interesting information about the schools they cover, and they come before AfD, I will vote to keep them. If they are like most of the pathetic pieces of drek that float to the surface here (school articles or otherwise), I will vote to delete them. Frankly, if you were writing dozens of one-line stubs instead of writing these comments to me, you would be contributing nothing much different from a large number of the school articles I've voted to delete. And yes indeed, you would be the spammer then. BTW, you can rest assured that I can always find time to assist anyone, deletionist or inclusionist, to hunt down people like Gateway1997 and dispatch him/her with as much extreme prejudice as Wikipedia allows us to muster.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Xoloz who explain it very well on why keeping school. School is usually much more than just a name, address and principal.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Year-to-date VfD/AfD nominations on schools are 329. 282 of these article have not been deleted. 85% of nominated school articles are not deleted. As far as I'm concerned - that is a concensus not to delete school articles (or stubs) on the basis that they are schools.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 17:49, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No - there is not a consensus to either delete or keep school articles. All this "all school noms are bad-faith" and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nonsense isn't helping the situation either. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 18:22, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never said there was either of those things. I said that an 85% VfD/AfD survival rate over the past 10 months establishes a "concensus 'not to delete'". I agree there is neither a concensus to keep, nor a concensus to delete - but there is clearly a concensus "not to delete".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 19:09, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>, however, as not all keeps (and even fewer deletes) are based on the "all schools" mantra. In addition, opinions here based on that are sometimes disregarded by the closing administrator (see some of the previous AfDs here), which further shoots holes in that theory (remember, AfD is a discussion about particular articles, not groups of articles). So, what we have here is a rather uneasy 55/45 (well, supposively. With schoolwatch etc. it makes it tough to tell how many regulars really want to keep these articles) standoff. In my early days I was a "school inclusionist" too before I realized wikipedia's goals were more towards an encyclopedia and not a wiki, so I can see where they get their opinions from (although some of the recent ones giving opinions of keep due to thinking that there is a consensus to keep these articles or whatever is pretty bizarre in terms of AfD things). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 19:32, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure that someone who looks at the history of school AfDs and sees a ratio of 9:1 "not deleted" and assumes there is some sort of concensus "not to delete schools" is "pretty bizarre". Seems pretty rational to me.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:04, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article which gets 16 votes to delete and 8 votes to keep is kept on the basis of "no consensus" (and please learn how to spell that word). Often, closing admins will require as high as 80 percent votes to be "delete' Before they will close a vote as consensus. An article must get, minimally, 2/3 + 1 votes to delete in order to be deleted, otherwise it is kept. The onus is <i>hugely</i> on the delete side to come up with votes. For consensus, 2/3 + 1 votes is equally required, whether to keep or delete. Since most votes on schools run around 50-50, or maybe 60-40 to keep, there is clearly no consensus for either keep or delete, so please stop trying to convince everyone of your mythical "consensus not to delete". This is not rocket surgery. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 07:12, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
