<p>Non-notable. It has a very nice looking article, but there is nothing notable about the school.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What about <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Delete" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Delete</a>? I fail to see why this school is any more important than any other secondary school in the country. Also, in my opinion, "good article" does not mean "worthy of an article". If the article was not formatted and presented in a nice way, would people be so keen to keep it? I just find it strange that non-notability is a strong deletion criteria, but because the article is on a school, it's considered to be worth keeping. This is not an argument, and it's not going to harm me if the article stays or not, but I'm just trying to get an understanding of the thinking behind the votes. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 17:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Friend, if you haven't noticed, this debate is <i>very, very, very</i> old. For a very detailed explication of my feelings, see <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_Schools_72d3.html" title="User:Xoloz/Schools">this</a>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:57, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I can imagine it's a debate that has gone on for quite some time now. Your article was interesting, and it's good to read something considering both viewpoints. I didn't know there was such a big thing on Wikipedia about school articles. I've stayed away from creating any of my own in the past, because I thought they would be deleted for non-notability. I know better now. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 18:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Disk Cheap time Expensive. Stop nominating schools. You state that "non-notability is a strong deletion criteria." Could you point that out in policies for me? <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 17:55, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't like your tone. I was friendly, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> was friendly in his/her response, but you were not. There's no need for it. "Stop nominating schools" - this is the only school I have nominated. Non-notability is a strong deletion criteria, as most articles that get deleted are because of non-notability (and/or non-encyclopedic content). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 18:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't like your nomination. I was professional but brief. You state again that "Non-notability is a strong deletion criteria," and I repeat "Could you point that out in policies for me?" Look at all this time we're wasting! <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:55, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hipocrite, briefly and professionally, my answer to your request for pointing is: Examine deletion log, any day. Note reasons given. See <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a>. Note also that the recently adopted CSD A7 (though not directly on point) does suggest in its terms that "notability" is a recognizable, important feature of the deletion process. Note CSD A7 adopted by consensus. Thanks <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:46, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>CSD A7, adopted by consensus, reads, in full "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead. For details, see Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles." This does not apply to schools, which are not real people, nor does it have the word "notable" in it. I dispute that de facto notability is a criteria, given the fact that the comment down one from this, mine, and scores of others dispute such a distinction. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 17:33, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I suggested, CSD A7 is not directly on point, but it suggests that "unimportant" or "insignificant" bios are deletable on site -- to claim that this doesn't reach notability (at least for biographies) would be an act of semantic sophistry of the first order. Your dispute is noted. Also note many others accept this de facto use, and so your apparent surprise at Daniel Lawrence's observation was either a fairly strange oversight, or disingenuity on your point. Thanks, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:01, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My disgust at Daniel Lawrence's willingness to dissemble regarding "strong deletion criteria" is disgust at dissembling. Even the strongest deletionists do not call the disputed, possibly "de facto" deletion criteria that has not deleted a school in weeks "strong." <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 13:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I see the reason for your upset, and I apologize for my own hard-line.&#160;:) It has, however, subsequently become apparent that D. Lawrence is a relative newbie to the schools debate, in his defense. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 14:19, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyway there's no consensus to apply non-notability to schools, or metro stations, or hollywood movies, or villages, or pokemons, or warships, so it can't be that strong a criterion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Time is expensive - that also applies to users. Since we're talking generically, my opinion is that we should be considering with school articles if there is enough specific information on a school to warrant a separate article, or whether the information would be better served elsewhere (e.g information on the village's elementary school in the village article). If a school article is long, pretty, and 95% a statement of the obvious then one has to wonder if it is the best way to present the information. For example, although this article is better than a number of the virtual stubs we've had recently, a lot of the organisation described is just mirroring the UK's National Curriculum specification, and therefore will be the same as the vast majority of schools in the UK (although a school psychology department is a new one to me). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 19:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merges do not require a deletion - in fact, a vote for "merge" is a vote for keep (and replace with a redirect). Feel free to go ahead and merge things, and if consensus agrees that things should be merged, then they will remain merged. In fact, if this article were not under AFD, you could go ahead and merge it right now. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:13, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the school, which sounds different from those I'm familiar with (though I guess much of that is just terminology).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Could someone point out this school's claim to notability, <i>without</i> having to resort to inherent properties?

It would have been pleasant if someone had contacted me first. I do hope that something of this article is retained - either as the article itself or as part of the Coventry page. I had hoped people might add the history as this is a non-American school named after an American President.

If it had to be merged somewhere, something like Schools in Coventry would be best, but I don't think it's really appropriate.
