<p>Listcruft. Some (though by no means all) of those on the list have evidence to support their 'notability', but the real question is why should we have such a list at all? It has no particular value in and of itself, and (since it is not included in the main article) does not serve to assist in asserting the 'notability' of LiveJournal itself (not that it is needed for the latter purpose anyway) <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 12:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Livejournal is clearly a notable site. Some of its notability comes from the notable people using it, or from the notable events that have come from it. Thus it is useful for Wikipedia to have that information. There's no vandalism that I could see on this page, no content concerns at all really. At the worst, rename it to something other than notable LJ users, even though I think that's unnecessary to change, I won't object. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:46, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Looking at the article, I don't agree that this can be categorised as "listcruft". The article is of a decent size (not too big, not too small), is well annotated elevating it above the normal "just a list" articles so despised on Wikipedia, certainly verifiable using the external links, and actually quite interesting. It's also a bit ironic that some Wikipedians are saying "classification as notable is NPOV"... on AfD no less! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 16:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Mr. Manticore and Canley. For the record, I think LiveJournal is a waste of everyone's time, but that doesn't stop me from recognizing its notability and the list's usefulness. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 16:46, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe going out and trying to find out if a figure on Wikipedia has a Livejournal does consist of original research on some level. I don't mean guys like Billy Corrigan; smaller figures, such as minor entertainers or politicians who have a blog, might not want others knowing about them and having them linked from this article. If we take <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy</a>, which is an official policy, into account, then unless the user is <i>famous</i> for their Livejournal, I see absolutely no purpose in listing its existence. Given that there really aren't that many people who are famous solely for LiveJournal, I think they could be included in the main article.</dd>

<dd>If we decide to begin including every Wikipedia figure on this list, then we will eventually run into problems with verifiability (ie which blogs are real). As the list grows, there will also be a problem within what "belongs" without violating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which ends up being decidedly non-neutral. As far as I see, this list is just an arbitrary listing of factoids. If the user is notable for their LiveJournal, mention it in the main article. I certainly wouldn't want to see List of MySpace users. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:11, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be confusing "original research" with "looking something up" or "reporting a known fact" . They are quite different. The prohibition against original research is against theories and ideas, not so much against facts (though there are facts that might qualify, this isn't one of them). So, you check to see if somebody famous has a livejournal. That's just "research" and is no different than say, watching a movie, noting who is in it, and putting that information on Wikipedia. Your concerns about privacy are not something that can be addressed here. If a famous person doesn't want their livejournal known to the public at large, they should consider using LJ's privacy features. Besides, that would be more of an individual problem than an article one. Given that as far as I know, none of the famous people listed in this article have tried to hide their livejournal (in fact, several of them link to it from their official websites), I don't see it as an immediate concern. Can't understand why you even begin to suggest including every Wikipedia figure on this list, that would seem to be odd. And I don't know about you, but I could get behind a List of Famous people who use Myspace or some such list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My concern is that it will eventually lead to sleuthing to find LiveJournals. Personally, I wouldn't mind having a list of people who are famous <i>for</i> their LiveJournals- the problem is that this list would be so short that it would be better off in a main article. In my opinion, having a list like this is pretty much the same as having a list of famous people who drive BMWs, or a list of famous people who like toast. Yeah some people might find it interesting, but it's just so trivial. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:47, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Famous people are already searched for, in all sorts of ways and places. If you think Wikipedia is a major factor in that, you might as well be arguing for the deletion of any article on a living person. Yeah, there are things we need to watch out for (like personal phone numbers, addresses (though there are exceptions to this, like <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neverland_Ranch_5297.html" title="Neverland Ranch">Neverland Ranch</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gate%27s_House_3053.html" title="Bill Gate's House">Bill Gate's House</a>) and emails ), but if someone puts their livejournal up publically, and it is found out about, deleting it is iffy, though we could do it if requested and they took obvious steps to make it private. To you, this may be like a list of famous people who drive BMWs, but perhaps you might want to look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_people.html" title="Lists of people">lists of people</a>. There's a fair number of lists in there which I would regard as more important than this. At least, until everybody and their brother gets a livejournal account. In which case, this list could indeed be deleted, and replaced with a list of folks without one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're making a bit of a stretch there by equating my position on this article to my position on every biography article we have. The only thing I'm concerned about privacy-wise is that it creates the possibility for editors to go out and find LiveJournals that haven't been declared publicly. Regarding the "lists of people article": The way I see this is list is it's just completely arbitrary in what the criteria for inclusion is, and it's essentially trivial information. This doesn't touch on the fact that it acts as a directory of famous peoples' LiveJournals too by simply listing their name, profession, and URL. I can't see List of people with websites being any different. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:48, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry if I'm being unclear, but I trying to point out that you could potentially make the same argument about having biographical information about any living person. You can't make a broad statement that it could be a problem and blindly act on that, you have to make the decision on the individual case. If people want to go out and find non-public livejournals, I doubt they'll be inspired by Wikipedia. They'll do it, because they want to do it any way. Not because they want to put some information on Wikipedia. Even if they did, deleting this article would't help, they could still put it on the individual person's article. That's why I don't find that aspect of your argument convincing. Taken to its logical conclusion, it produces something absurd. Even if you limit it to just concerns about livejournals, it doesn't work too well. There are many celebs who publicize their livejournals. As such, including them would be appropriate. If there are any that request privacy, again, I say the first burden is on them to just Livejournal's privacy tools. If for some reason that doesn't work, then we can see about it when that does happen, on an individual scale. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now as for the second part, that's much more of an argument. Indeed, I don't think an article of lists of people with websites would be workable. That's too broad a category. Though I think this is a useful category Category:Celebrities who personally authored their official sites. Now Livejournal is a website, but it's a subset that is reasonably particular. Currently. For example, if you look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_people.html" title="Lists of people">lists of people</a>, of similar content. Take a good honest look at it, and all the sublists. Like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrity_guest_stars_on_Sesame_Street_d11b.html" title="List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street">List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street</a>. Perhaps one day that'll change, but not so far. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment -- Upon first reading the debate, I was gonna say Speedy Delete easily, due to POV issues. But, I think the articles name needs to be changed.
