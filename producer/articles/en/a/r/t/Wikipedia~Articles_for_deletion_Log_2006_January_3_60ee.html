<p>Advertising.

<li>Eee... that's not 100% correct. There are a several options. The simplest would be to copy paste the history into the talk of the target page, but that one's a bit of a grey area. The next easiest would be for someone to validate all the information <i>themselves</i> and type it in <i>themselves</i>, which would have the added advantage of double checking <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and would be on solid ground.

<li>Mostly correct though. You can't retain an edit history if it's been deleted. It needs to be retained in some form when merged and redirecting provides the least work as it doesn't involve admin intervention. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:21, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As both the author and subject of this biographical sketch, there was no intent to deceive anyone in its submission, as one commentator insinuates above. This is the sketch that appears on my own website and in my books. And it is hardly "stupid" to submit such a sketch by oneself provided the statements are factual and verifiable. Isn't that the transparency you want in such matters? Should one use a disguised name as the comment above suggests? That would be the height of stupidity and also unethical would it not? It may be on WebMD because I wrote it and they asked my permission to use it with reference to articles I assisted them with about ADHD any myself. All statements in the biographical sketch are statements of fact and readily verifiable. Submission of a curriculum vitae can be provided to provide verification, unless you are implying that I have fabricated my vita. Remove the entry if you wish, but entering my name into Google results in more than 80,000 hits. Should not Wikipedia have at least some entry? Kindly tell me, despite all hyperbole, what statements in the sketch are not statements of fact. My education? My professional positions? My 200 pubications? My more than 20 books? My professional awards? My TV and other appearances? Your snide comments aside, make your case with specifics. Russell A.

<li>Prof. Barkley (assuming it is you), after doing a google search, I have no doubt on your notability (I changed my position after initially thinking the article as a hoax). An article on you is definitely possible. However, the article you created was directly copied from WebMD, and there was no clear proof of the copyright permission from WebMD. The <a href="http://www.webmd.com/content/biography/8/95770" class="external text" title="http://www.webmd.com/content/biography/8/95770" rel="nofollow">page</a> where it was taken from shows a copyright notice from WebMD and that all rights are reserved.

As for your question of creating the entry, it is common for people to become suspicious when someone creates an entry for them. Wikipedias official guidelines discourage people from writing about themselves.

<li><b>Reply</b> Thanks, Ragib. I am the Russell Barkley in the bio. that was submitted. Your information is helpful in understanding this decision. I had not read the specific requirements under Autobiography and therefore would have understood this issue better. I appreciate your thoughtful and courteous response and the details on which it is based rather than the earlier sarcasm that seemed to permeate other comments. And I would not want copyright to be violated even though I am the author of the WebMD bio. sketch as well. Let's just withdraw the submission. By the way, self-promotion was not the issue (I am nearly retired now so that is of less consequence to me). Instead, I had read of the misrepresented bio sketch at Wikipedia for Siegenthaler and how it had been altered erroneously about him by others (as a joke, no less). I have my own critics, as you are no doubt aware if you searched the web about me, including Scientologists so the bio I submitted was more as a pre-emptive effort to place correct information before the public. I will continue to update your ADHD entries as time permits in hopes of giving them more accuracy and balance. The initial entry I read was a bit lopsided around supporting nutritional solutions for ADHD, which are not well-supported, and was rather naive about the recent findings concerning neuro-imaging and genetics. Thanks again for your reply. Russ Barkley, Ph.D.</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. all it needs is a fix in the title and a major copyedit. google shows that russell barkley is a controversial figure in the world of ADHD. he's been interviewed by Frontline and he's written books on the subject. i see no reason why an article shouldn't exist about him. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 06:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, Alexa rankings have got quite a lot to do with Wikipedia. If you would look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">our guidelines for website notability</a>, you would see point #3 under "General guidelines for websites" which states: "<i>A website's impact can be demonstrated by...(h)aving an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or better.</i>" Alexa rankings are generally accurate when they are taken outside of specifics. One can't honestly argue that one website is more visited than another simply because it is ranked a few spots ahead of another, but the difference between 10,000 and "No rank" (as your website has) is several million websites. Wikipedia doesn't even have 1,000,000 articles yet, and no more than 2-3% of those are websites. So getting above ~30,000 is an achievement, but still not notable enough for this website. Those are the guidelines to which we adhere for various reasons (for example, check out "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28numbers%29_3077.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)">Wikipediea is not infinite</a>"). <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 05:46, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Before the board crashed two months ago, it had 300+ members, most of whom left the AnimeNation forums. It led to considerable changes on the AN forums, including the changing of moderators, updated policies regarding linking to other sites, and even deletion of large sections of the AN forums. I am a 2+ year member of AN, and I would consider it the single most important thing that happened on those forums while I have been there. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamurai_Drifter_1414.html" title="User:Samurai Drifter">Samurai_Drifter</a>

<li>The <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeNation_ff4e.html" title="AnimeNation">AnimeNation</a> article doesn't even mention its forum community, though, so I'm not sure how to proceed with a merge.

<li>I for one wouldn't mind at all; as it's one of the most important forums in the online anime community it definitely deserves a section in the Wikipedia entry. I'll get some other AN members to contribute, and if it succeeds this can be easily merged. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamurai_Drifter_1414.html" title="User:Samurai Drifter">Samurai_Drifter</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please do not vote more than once. Is it a <b>keep</b> or a <b>merge</b>? Also, please refer to Wikipedia's guideline's for inclusion or deletion as linked above instead of debating the importance of the website. This is not a debate on the philosophical or sociological importance of AE Forum, it is a "trial" by user consensus to see if it passes our already agreed-upon guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Please do not vote more than once." Odd, according to the notification at the top of this page I could have sworn that this was not a vote. However, I chose the option "merge" and deleted my first comment. "By all accounts, this website doesn't deserve inclusion into any article on Wikipedia." Obviously not all accounts, as I see at least several Keeps and Merges on this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm sorry, my terminology was a bit off, especially for a user new to this process. I understand that this is technically not a "vote," but administrators need to come along to these AfD candidates later on, and it only confuses things for them when you put up multiple <b>bolded suggestions</b> for the article. I also said "By all accounts..." when I probably should have said, "According to all the guidelines...", but I changed the language because I had said the word "guidelines" about fifteen times already. Like I said, this forum exhibits not even a shred of verifiable notability. I don't see a reason to merge it into the other article until you show exactly where on the Anime forum this issue was such a big deal.

A7 doesn't apply for disputed claims, but only for cases where no claim is made. <s>BTW, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Brian+Mallon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Brian+Mallon" rel="nofollow">last speedy</a> was for a 16-year old, not this person.</s> --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:48, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, "<i>is the popular author of books such as</i>" is indeed a claim of notability, but a totally moot one if the existence of the books cannot be proven. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a "moot" only for the "AFD", not the CSD:A7, where's its critical. This claim could well just be somebody's prank (the titles sound suspiscious), but there's been a consensus that we aught to give claims of notability their 5-days in the sun. Personally, I would love to see 100%-unsourced articles (like this and many others) deleted just like copyvio, without an AFD, but that's not happening. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Thivierr</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/i/User_talk%7EThivierr_9885.html" title="User talk:Thivierr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thivierr_b49e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thivierr">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>You're probably right to be suspiscious. I think the big remaining question to be settled is whether this is written by Brian, Liz, or a mutual friend at school. There's is actually a comic called <i>Adventures of Hickey</i> though (printed in the U of C's Gauntlet), but I'm guessing that's not what's be referred to. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:30, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy keep</b>. This nomination resulted from the application of a speedy deletion tag to the article by 68.75.171.218 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.75.171.218_cb75.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.75.171.218">contribs</a>). Given that user's other contributions today, it is possible that it was not a good faith nomination. The unanimous consensus to keep (the nomination being a purely procedural one) will only continue, given past precedent.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The author conducts an excellent 'defence' however, which almost persuaded me by itself. However, the consensus is clearly against him, presumably because this particular flash has yet to entrench itself in the internet psyche yet. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><del><b>Neutral</b></del>: Not long enough to warrant a dedicated article. If it were longer, and the Flash had been around longer, maybe it would warrante something...but then again, the random hunk of bad animation that is The Demented Cartoon Movie has its own article...why that, and not this? What's the difference?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep -- I'm the original author of the article and am in no way affiliated with the flash's creators.</b> , I made it as a genuine effort and am in no way associated with the people who made the flash. It has skyrocketed to the top of newgrounds, is being spread around, and has been hailed as one of the best flashes ever. It has probably over 30 references to American culture (if you watch the flash this will be very obvious). I was surprised that nobody had made an article for it already, so thought I'd start one. I obviously did not make it long enough or detailed enough. I _WANTED_ to mark it as a stub when I finished, but had not figured out how yet (I'm new). Just now, I had came back to see if others had added to it, and found this instead. I really do categorize this as in the same category as "all your base" and the star warz gangster rap as well as several other flashes that are so popular as to merit their own page. Are we to say that the Desperate Housewives TV show or the Colbert Report doesn't merit an entry just because it's still on? No. I looked at the deletion policies, and as far as I can tell, this should be marked as a stub and expanded. I'd really like to see it expanded and to see someone take the time to actually mark down all the references that are in it (American culture references). Everything from the back to the future car, to the terminator, to Bill &amp; Ted, to the Power Rangers, and Chuck Norris and Indiana Jones. I'm a chemistry PhD student, and I really don't have time for it - or rather, I don't have time for everything that I want to do. If you guys want to delete it then fine, I obviously can't do anything about it. But I think it's the wrong decision. I'm not sure if how I'm posting my "defense" here is correct or not. I couldn't see a vote box, but I guess editing this page is the right thing to do. And for the record, this is not one of my favorite flashes on newgrounds, it's not even in my top 10. But it's the only one that I thought merited its own article. Cynical Smirk refers to it as "Check out this Flash cartoon with more pop culture references than you can shake a stick at." I think it ought to have a proper article with links to all the pop culture references - including <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_on_a_plane.html" title="Snakes on a plane">snakes on a plane</a> which I hadn't even heard of and a friend explained it to me - because it's a reference from a movie that's not even out yet! And yet lots of people noticed that and commented on it. At any rate, you get the idea. I believe this deserves its own entry, it's not some random flash in my books. It's ranked as #1 in Newgrounds, and has had over 500,000 views even though it's only been out for 2 weeks. People have even suggested giving it its own award. I feel like I'm facing some sort of stupid culture clash, the "conservative right versus the radical left." Only this time it's a bias just because the link is from newgrounds. Or at least that's what it _looks_ like from my end. I believe the articles' only crime is not being marked as a stub. Which isn't the article's fault. It's mine, and yours. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshi_Starshade_743d.html" title="User:Ashi Starshade">Ashi_Starshade</a>. Note: just because something's new doesn't mean it should not have an article. And I also want to note that I didn't just sign up for wikipedia to make this. I've made perhaps 5 other edits before this (science and even literature related), some from before we had to create logins.</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, perhaps pending <b>move</b> or <b>merger</b>. Most of the external links are broken, through no fault of the author's: they go to some site with a fascist external link script. Some, however, are valid, and they do seem at first glimpse to verify some of the assertions made in the article, which would appear to concern a Calvinist revival among Latin American Protestants. This is plausible, and if actual seems noteworthy. This would certainly be worthy of mention somewhere, if confirmed by folks whose Spanish is more surefooted than my own. Might be best handled by being merged into a more general article on Protestantism in Latin America. Until such an article exists, I wouldn't just delete this material.

<li>I agree with that. I can't think of how you could possibly reduce the scope of a general list of heroes. If we divide it, we'd just end up with a list of characters by game, movie, book, or whatever. I don't think a centralised list would work.

<dd>Thought so, but then that would be a list/category by itself.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Besides the previous comments, there's a large element of POV involved. The term "war hero" requires that a wide segment of the public acknowledge the subject as such, and that's not often verifiable fictionally.

<dd>Good point, although those characters are never referred to as war heroes in Star Wars. On the other hand, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were widely regarded as war heroes in the Republic.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not convinced that "large scope" is a valid reason for deletion. I'm also not swayed by the POV argument, as these are *fictional* people, so it only requires that the author create the person as a war hero. I'd support a better worded criteria on the page.

<dd>It certainly does require that the author create the person as a war hero; I just question that -- using that list as a guide -- the authors actually did so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:02, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I should also point out that it isn't uncommon for authors to understate a character's heroism or completely omit any direct mention of heroism. For example, in the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomorrow_series.html" title="Tomorrow series">Tomorrow series</a>, the character Ellie Linton is responsible for many deeds of daring and bravery, but she is never hailed as a hero by her friends or any other character. There's also the ambiguity of what defines a "hero" (see: <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_hero.html" title="War hero">war hero</a>), and I don't often see probable heroes being cited as such. There's also the case of authors portraying non-heroes as being heroic (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a> portrays Napoleon has being a war hero, even though he never actually did anything heroic). Ultimately, when it comes to stating someone as a hero, it all comes down to their actions, and that tends to be difficult to interpret. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 16:10, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Let me explain myself. I did not just put down all the LOTR and Star Wars characters I could think off. If I did do that, I would have put down Admiral Piett. The LOTR characters (Aragon, Legolas, Gimili) were instrumental in the War of the Ring. The <i>Star Wars</i> characters: Luke destroyed the Death Star, Han helped capture the shield generator on Endor, Lando destroyed the second Death Star. General Grievous was considered a hero in the Confederacy. Personally, I think a war hero should be someone instrumental in battle and someone who helps boost morale.- <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustPhil_d649.html" title="User:JustPhil">JustPhil</a> 18:27, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: They killed approximate 30 orcs each, probably the highest kill count at the Hornburg. There is no evidence of them scoring any kills at the Pelennor, though it can only be assumed. However, killing a lot of Orcs does not necessarily make someone a hero, and they were hardly significant in the whole War of the Ring. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 13:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beyond that, the definition of a "war hero" doesn't encompass someone who does heroic or great deeds. It's about someone who is <i>publically acclaimed</i> for having done heroic or great deeds ... whether or not that someone actually did them.

<li>Comment: If there's enough verifiable information, then this school should be kept. However, at the moment, there's a real problem that the sole source is just a free web host of the school, and there's no independent source cited yet. I'm awfully suspiscious of a free web host for a school. I'm also suspiscious of the reason for providing a English site without an obvious non-English *main* version (presumably Bengali), and then having an application form not in English (Bengali?). I would assume you normally have a web site that's mainly in the local language (Bengali?), and then secondarly may have some parts in English. This looks fishy (but I have no real evidence anything is wrong). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:04, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is the issue that, particularly in the upper/educated classes in countries like Bangladesh, India, etc., English <i>is</i> the predominant language in education. Most everyone will speak a local language, but why bother when English is the language of the educated classes and the school likely isn't catering to the common people? -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 14:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good points, which I previously considered. However, the application for the school is non-English, so if they're catering to English, they would logically give an English application form (at least as one option in an otherwise-English web site). It's the combination of the almost purely-English website with a purelly non-English application form, that seems pecular. Normally you are a) 100% in one language or b) you provide at least some text in both languages. This company uses two languages, but never both for the same thing. Plus, if they're catering to the upper classes, I'm sure they would be available to afford $5/month for web hosting, and not rely on a free web host. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I'm not arguing against your points, though here in Texas, for example, I would not be surprised at all to find a place with everything in English and solely an application form in Spanish. It's a different example, of course, but I don't know if either of us have enough knowledge to argue either way. I really don't have any first-hand experience with how languages work over there, though; all I know is that it is nothing like the foreign language education and usage that I've seen in the U.S. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 18:55, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the contrary I follow your point entirely, however, there are three criteria at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> by which a school may have its own article. If it does not meet any of those criteria (one of which being verifiability apart from the schools own website) then the guideline states "If it meets none of these criteria, <b><u>it should be merged</u></b> into the appropriate district (or other higher-level article such as city or education in that city or region, if private), preserving all relevant content, and be redirected." The school is only mentioned in its own website and one other site (at the moment) so is not "verifiable" in the Wikipedia sense, although it does seem to exist. My vote and my succeeding comments merely reflect this guideline, as they would for any of the elementary schools in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> or come to that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albrighton.html" title="Albrighton">Albrighton</a>. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 00:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, just tell me why perhaps the 10,000th school (in terms of notability) should get a mention before 9,999 other schools, just because the school's founders were crafty enough to create an entry here? The school's only claim to fame is the article, and the discussion in this page, other than that, a very small number of people in Bangladesh know or care about the school (try finding any reference to it anywhere). Just because someone add's their own 5 month old school here doesn't mean the city article needs to be stuffed with free adverts. I'd be happy to add notable schools or colleges to <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, but again, there is no reason an obscure school need to be forcefully merged into a city of 12 million people. This school article, even if it can ever be verified, can be linked or merged with a list of schools in Dhaka (which would contain thousands of schools and would be totally unmaintainable) but your proposal of merging it with the main city article is not viable or fair at all to the other, 1000 times notable schools. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 00:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

If we kept this article now, and it still wasn't verified weeks later, would you want yet another AFD, all over again?

<li>Well, I took steps to try and verify it *before* voting. If it was sufficiently verified, I would vote keep. If I needed more time, I would wait to vote.

<li>In the unlikely event this school is verified, I think anybody wishing a merger has to come up with a merge target (e.g. name it, link to it, and justify it). I've gone along with a number of mergers, for the sake of compromise, but in this case, no serious merge target has been named. I suspect most people here don't even know if there are the equivelent of US-style school districts in the country. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is good basis for compromise, but it was developed mainly by Americans, for American schools, and when it comes to merges, often (not always) falls apart outside that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:32, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seeing as this appears to be a private school I would suggest a merge with the city it is in. A once or two sentence blurb would do in the education section of said city.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the city has twelve million people in it (millions more than NYC). As said above, there are probably 3000+ schools. A huge number are probably private. Just naming each private school would be problematic. Plus, while <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> isn't a large article now, it can be expected to become very large, to reflect the size and signficance of a major national capital. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then create a schools subpage for <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> if and when the list gets too long. However in this case it is probably moot since the school fails any measure of verifiability and should be summarily deleted unless people start bucking policy.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Frankly, merger with <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> or any other article is not possible!! <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> is a mega city, with more than 10 million people, and *thousands* (5000+) of more notable schools. Let me explain something: In <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, private schools and kindergartens are not strictly regulated, and all it takes to open a private school is a house with a few rooms in it. In most cases, these schools have about 40-50 students. Among several thousands of schools in Dhaka, this is again in no way notable (look at the opening date and the lack of references). There ARE good, notable schools in <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, and I'd often try very hard to improve those articles, but in no way you can add this to the <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> article. To put things into perspective, it's like adding a recently opened news stand as a major commercial company of New York city.

<li>In cases like that we can examine case by case. If a school is run by nothing but a mother in her house then it probably violates <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Also I doubt any such schools are verifiable. The size of the city however should have no bearing on whether we merge acceptable merge candidates (per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>) or not as we can work around such issues by creating a city school list or city schools page.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:01, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The larger the merge target the harder it is to make a proper article. Making proper article for a large school district or "Schools in X"-type article is not trivial. If only a small number of verifiable schools have articles in <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> the time/effort of making the larger/composite (merge target) article would be many times the effort of mainting the individual school articles (as such an article would have to do more than just list a few schools). It's extremely difficult researching the school system of a non-English country, and it's to easy for editors to make gross oversimplifying assumptions about a large foreign school system. But it's often quite easy finding adquate info for a single school (just not in this particular, frustrating case). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, browsing their school website it appears this "school" is little more then a glorified daycare with a flashy name.

<li>reply: They do claim to do more then preschool. On their application deadline page they mention class I-VIII, which I presume means grades 1-8 (primary+middle school). I interpret "Play" and "Prepatory" to be "Pre-Kindergarten" and "Kindergarten". Also, in their <a href="http://www.deshijobs.com/jobs_details.php?id=6307&amp;cid=" class="external text" title="http://www.deshijobs.com/jobs_details.php?id=6307&amp;cid=" rel="nofollow">job add</a> they seek "<i>Full time teaching for Play Group to Eighth grade</i>". Also, I don't think many preschools require their teachers have an M.A. (I assume that's a masters of arts). This is all unverified of course, which is why I support deletion still. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:47, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>From translation of the admissions leaflet, the school does not have any students in classes <s>5</s> 6 to 8, though they claim to have plans to open those sections. Also, I took a look at their school building, which is actually a residential house with a few floors given to the school. I don't see any evidence of their number of students being beyond the few kids shown in the website (Why are the same kids shown in every photo? This makes me doubt whether they have more than 30 - 50 or so. Also, the admission leaflet says that they opened the school in 2005 with the name "Genius Home", and renamed it to the current name recently. Other than that, I can't find any other information from the translation of the admission leaflet.

<li>According to their website (look under "Features") they clearly *claim* to *currently* teach up to grade eight. They even state when class starts and stops for grades up to eight. There's multiple places where they mention grades up to eight in their web site. They also state they have 10 classrooms, which is consistent with teaching up to grade eight (such a small school probably wouldn't have more than one room per grade). It's only the non-English application leaflet, which says they stop at grade four. Anyway, it's all unverfiable, and that's really all that counts. Personally, I suspect the person who wrote the web site, and the person who wrote the leaflet, do not speak the same language (literally). There is no way you can reconcile those two versions of reality. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:42, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Seconded. Twice. If this is kept I, for one, fully intend on replacing the current article with "Genius home collegiate school is a website which claims to be for a school", that being the only fact that is even remotely verifiable. Encyclopaedias do not reprint subjects' claims about how great they are, unless reputable third parties pay special attention to those claims (e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> claiming to be bigger than Jesus is a notable fact: me claiming to be shorter than Jesus is not), so those should all be removed. In fact, an editor would be fully justified under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in replacing the article with "The 'Genius home collegiate school' does not exist". At least then we could remove the factual accuracy tags. Everything is, after all, non-existent until proven otherwise - it is impossible under the laws of this universe to prove something <i>doesn't</i> exist, so the alternative is unsustainable. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:18, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Quite an interesting use of web resources (Geocities and Wikipedia). This is a difficult decision to make, because on the one hand it appears that this article was originally created as a means of advertising (read: spam), in which case it should be deleted. Then, on the other hand, it has been transformed by our fellow editors into an honest and straight forward article which informs the potential reader that this genius school is not accredited, nor does it appear to be licensed by their government. There is some value to that, so <s><b>keep</b></s> as rewritten. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 07:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would agree with you *if* we had verifiable independent information that the school wasn't accredited or licensed. The reason for wanting accrediation isn't the accrediation per se, it's the inherent verifiability that goes with accreditation (or government licensing). Currently, nothing in the article, is known to be true. The simple statement of existence, can not be verified. Wikipedia does have some legitimate article on verifiably non-accredited schools, but this is not one of them. In fact, I fear, the school may legitmately complain our article (that I rewrote) unfairly depicts them, and we couldn't defend ourselves, as we can't claim to know what we're writing about. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:39, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think there are huge numbers of bio articles of people who have been speedy deleted under A7, even though nobody can tell if they're real or not (but claim to be real). Yet A7 does exclude fictional characters. And non-verifiability is not (yet) a speedy criterion. Also, there's no dispute as to which rule is more important. We all agree <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is more important. I'm just arguing that when applying category-specific rules (music,bio,schools,websites) you apply *those* criteria based on the claimed category. If the claim is not verifiable, then you delete. You don't (shouldn't) ever switch categories in mid-AFD, as doing so constitutes the creation of entirely new unrelated article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:59, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Very minor <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> power. About ten-fifteen seconds of screentime in the movies, occasional mentions in the books.

<li>I can't agree with that. Blogs indicate that people are talking about it, and this make it notable. Even discarding the blogs, 811 is still a significant number and at least satisfies the criteria for not being a neologism ("realistic evidence of existence"). <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 17:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The term shouldnt be thrown out simply because its meaning is vulgar, but should instead be presented with definitions and links and historical reference (I beleive that HBO's Mr.Show was the first to popularize this term) that ARE NOT vulgar.

<li><b>comment</b> I suppose so. A more-common usage of the word as opposed to the antiquated usage is moreso how I see it.

<li>Please google this term if you think it is a neologism. I am sure you will find ample sources to insure you that it is an established and widley used term (if only in the U.S.). If you care to look you will find web sites dealing with Taint centered sexual fetishes, Taint humor (if it's funny is a matter of opinion) and a Taint magazine.I had suggested that a disambiguation page that would link to wikitonary for the older useage and a catergory on sexual slang for the newer (non-neologism) term. This would allow a place for articles such as Taint or choad. I think that this would benifit wikipedia by eleminating the temptation to post a joke article some seem to feel when they see the page is nonexisten. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECenestrad_3f23.html" title="User talk:Cenestrad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cenestrad_b1d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cenestrad">contribs</a>).</small>

Thus, disambig - one to the traditional word, one as a link to the new one via perineum. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 17:31, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with redirecting this term to perineum is that it retains the meaning of the word but not the context. It is true that the perineum and the Taint are the same part of the body anatomically speaking but Taint is a vulgar term as opposed to a medical term and that needs to be noted. Also this eliminates the potential for the articles growth in regards to cultural references. As I mentioned above the term Taint is employed in American pop culture having been referenced by several television shows and comedians. Also it is the center of some individual’s sexual fetishes. All of this could add to a valid article which would be much more than a dictionary definition and go well beyond what a person would expect to find in an article on the perineum.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 17:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to apologize for forgetting to sign a comment I added earlier. Dwilke seems to think that this is a major issue and posted four edits concerning one unsigned comment. The apex for me was his elation of "It appears to be Censtrad!" Way to go Colombo but next time just ask me and I'll tell you if I was the author of a comment. This is the second time you have accused me of sockpuppeting and I am more than a little irritated. If I were to use such a trick don't you suppose I would log out first? I would also like to note that the comment in question was made as a post script to my vote on this subject earlier and did not contain a vote of its own. From now on I'll be more careful to sign my comments.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 18:57, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I really don't think Dan was accusing you of sock-puppeting. He was only marking your comment as having been made by you. Please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. He has made no accusations of sock-puppetry that I have seen. As to needing four edits: that might imply he needs help with the "show preview" button, but it doesn't accuse you of sock-puppetry. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 22:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Had he only mentioned an unsigned article possibly being mine once I would have assumed good faith. However on an unsigned comment previously posted Dan had added “I wonder if this is the author?” (It was not.) I have no problem assuming good faith and being civil but a veiled accusation of sock puppeting could tip the balance in this debate and that I do have a problem with that.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 23:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I apologise if I insulted you. I was only slightly angry since I had to spend an inordinate amount of time, and edits trying to work out who had written that (and another unsigned edit). Sockpuppetry did not at all enter my head, in fact I was commenting that I wasn't expecting it to be a registered user who forgot to sign a post as per [[WP:~~~~]]. Also, I had no idea at the time that the person who had previously commented, unsigned whilst not even signed in, was not the author. Nor did I know it was you. Finally, "tip the balance"! Ridiculous. I would never consider doing something so, well, petty. I do not consider this article so important (nor would I ever give the author the pleasure), as to risk my own name using illicit means to get it deleted. In fact it seems that that is where it is destined anyway according to the consensus of the community. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 15:24, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>My only problem with the wikipedia is not a dictionary argument is that it seems we are singling out this word before it even has a chance to expand. As I pointed out earlier the word "an" contains nothing BUT several definitions on its wikipedia page, whereas this site offers some historical backing as to the words origins, as well as a few links to other sites, and certainly has great POTENTIAL to grow. It seems as though the word has been continually deleted almost out of habit. If wikipedia is going to be hell bent on removing all articles that are JUST definitions it would seem a better policy to start with "an" and move down the list of other words/terms that have been there for a while and haven’t grown. Deleting this page will just result in some kid putting up a comedic response so why not instead start with a better suited article and instead allow it to grow. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPickelbarrel_3c4d.html" title="User talk:Pickelbarrel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pickelbarrel_7b43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pickelbarrel">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Wrong in quite a number of ways:
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a> does <i>not</i> comprise "nothing but definitions". It comprises a list of hyperlinks to articles which would, by themselves, either be at <a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">aN</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/_/An.html" title="An">an</a> or have a redirect from there.</li>
<li>"Historical backing as to the word's origins" <i>belongs in the dictionary</i>. Etymology is exactly what the dictionary is for. There are even etymology sections in the dictionary article already. Expanding an encyclopaedia article with such things is contrary to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy and a dilution of effort, to boot.</li>
<li>You are thinking of this article as an article about a word. ("It seems as though the word ...") Dictionary articles are about words. Encyclopaedia articles are about concepts/people/places/things/events. An encyclopaedia article by this title would be about taints, <i>not</i> about the word "taint". We already have <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taint" class="extiw" title="wikt:taint">taint</a> for that.</li>
<li>This article has <i>not</i> been "continally deleted". It hasn't ever been deleted at all. It has been replaced with a soft redirect encouraging editors to write an encyclopaedia article about taints if there is one, but to use the dictionary otherwise. The article as it currently stands is not an encyclopaedia article about taints, and is simply a bad duplicate of the dictionary article about the word "taint" that is in Wiktionary. A soft redirect is better than that.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a> is a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> article. It <i>shouldn't</i> grow into a dictionary article. That it hasn't is, therefore, a <i>good</i> thing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finally: <i>why not instead start with a better suited article?</i> — Because it has yet to be demonstrated that there is an encyclopaedia article about taints to be had. <i>At most</i>, therefore, this is a disambiguation article between <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perineum.html" title="Perineum">perineum</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corruption.html" title="Corruption">corruption</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoilage.html" title="Spoilage">spoilage</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:35, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>wow uncle g. as a newbie to using wikipedia I cant believe how interested Ive gotten in "the great taint debate" of 2006. I was worried that perhaps Id lost my mind and might end up outside of wikipedias headquarters holding a SAVE THE TAINT sign. Its nice to see others on the opposing side are as fanatical in their beliefs(I wonder what will become of us when the agument is finally decided).<br />
Let me ask this then if as is okay because it contains ONLY hyperlinks to articles that stand on their own, why not offer hyperlinks to other articles in THIS entry to choad and or perinium. My point on the article continually being deleted is that while of cours THIS article hasnt been deleted(otherwise we wouldnt be having this discussion) the word HAS had several entries over the last few months (my favorite being the one where it is stated "men have taints so they dont shit on their balls") This entry seems at least a ligitamit place to start as it does INCLUDE a hyperlink that can stand on its own.<br />
otherwise Uncle g , you have made very valid points, perhaps you may yet sway my vote and we will be seen and perhaps one day we will be seen arms locked chanting "WIKIPEDIA HAS NO TAINT" in triumphant victory <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPickelbarrel_3c4d.html" title="User talk:Pickelbarrel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pickelbarrel_7b43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pickelbarrel">contribs</a>) 2006-01-05 16:34:47.</small></li>

Taint piercing is considered very popular in some goth and/or metal band circles.

<li><b>Comment</b> At this point I would like to request that any votes cast claiming the term is a neologism should be discarded. That argument has been made and rebutted and anyone still calling the term a neologism has not done one bit of research. They are simply labeling the term a neologism because they are not familiar with it. It seems fairly obvious that the point of an encyclopedia is to help familiarize a person with new terms and concepts as an encyclopedia containing only things you already know would be pointless. Secondly I would like to suggest that people have a look at the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a> article. This term is a reference to the anus but asshole deserves a separate article because it is different in context. If I called a person an anus I most likely would only get quizzical looks. On the other hand if I dubbed them an “Asshole” they would surely demand satisfaction. The same is true for perineum and Taint.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 19:13, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <i>concept</i> denoted by the slang sense of "taint" is exactly the same concept denoted by "perineum". There's no need to have two separate encyclopaedia articles for the same concept. The fact that "taint" can denote other concepts (specifically <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corruption.html" title="Corruption">corruption</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoilage.html" title="Spoilage">spoilage</a>) is why this should be a disambiguation article <i>amongst those three concepts</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

Still think we need to disambig between this, the "old fashioned" usage, the term "tainted data" in programming, and maybe a link to <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tainted_Love_bfb2.html" title="Tainted Love">Tainted Love</a>, too. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 19:16, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>People don't type in "taint" when they're looking for <i>tainted love</i>, so it wouldn't make a dab page... Thanks/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 19:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>like the added material, hopefully it will continue to grow. I was talking with my grandmother( a ninety-plus year old political activist who encouraged me to get my nose pierced) about the irony of this article and its discussion page being longer than the actual article, and she told me about a phrase I had never heard "The smell of his taint". Apparently her parents used to use it to refer to scotsmen and black people(apparently her parents were very racist even though my grand mother is NOT at all). They would talk about the smell of a certain scotsmans taint(they were both full blooded irish) being lifted after he carried their daughter Ima home from an accident which probably saved Ima's life. My grandmother didnt know weather this is an irish term, a local term or one just my great grand parent used, but I thought someone here might. I also thought it would be interesting to know if this was in fact a play on the two different meanings of the words, as this might offer some info into the amount of time the latter difintion has been around.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> 21:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, if taint really can be expanded as a body part slang term, should a dab be made here and a new article called <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taint_%28slang%29.html" title="Taint (slang)">taint (slang)</a> be created? Im still thinking redirect and expanding the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perineum.html" title="Perineum">perineum</a> article. Main concern with doing something other than a redirect would set a precendent for the creation and survival of article like fleshy fun bridge or chin rest. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 03:35, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. The term Taint is well known and widely used giving it cultural relevance. The term Perineum should be concerned with gross anatomy not sexual fetish, comedy routines or homosexual slang. The terms like fleshy fun bridge or chin rest could not be expanded upon beyond a dict. def. I would suggest you look at the article for both <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choad.html" title="Choad">choad</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 03:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> of slang. That's Wiktionary's job, <i>and it is doing it</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then why does the catagory <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> exist? I don't think you can reasonably argue that what I wrote is a dict. def or that it belongs on the perineum page. Again I suggest that you take a look at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a> and it's AFD page and the reason it was kept. Also look at <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choad.html" title="Choad">choad</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pussy.html" title="Pussy">pussy</a>. Again these are anatomical terms that but the context of these articles don't belong on the coresponding anatomical page.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 05:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>[[[question]]] for all those that have been wikipedia is not a dictionaring this term, I would like to ask them to go to the satanic entry and tell me if that is not JUST A DEFINTION, I am still learning about wikipedia. The article does NOT have a snub listing next to it, and I cant tell why it is allowed to stay. I put the question on the discussion page but have not gotten a response. I have been going over the rules since wangi sent them to me, but have yet to find a reason why this has seemingly slipped through the cracks. I dont want to put it up for deletion though if it IS legitimate.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> 18:12, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Oppose Deletion</b>: As it is, the article is a mere collection of Bible passages, but this could be a starting point for a better article; I'd never give up hope. Hospitality <i>is</i> an important subject for en encyclopedia; after all, it is an important cultural value, less so today and in the West perhaps, but much more in Oriental countries (and in Greece, obviously).

<li>You didn't appreciate why I said it was needless. I didn't vote a simple keep, I voted merge/redirect. You can place a redirect without an AFD. If this was List of Jo Blough Remixes, an AFD would be warranted. You could put in a redirect by youself, in under a minute. Instead, you'll waste 5-days, and several peoples time. Also, next time you do an AFD, be sure to put the text "AFD" in the edit summary, so watchers of the article are aware of what you've done. Also, as deletion is not "minor" please don't mark the addition of the AFD tag as a "minor edit", as you did. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:03, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete/merge</b> is certainly reasonable. This is not, and doesn't look like it even could be, an encyclopedia article. I'm not sure I agree that the Afd is pointless tho. It gives us the chance to come to the conclusion that this list should not be an entire article by itself. I've no prejudice against some of the content being merged elsewhere, as appropriate. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. BTW, depending how the Afd goes, it might make it harder to merge. There seems to be a growing feeling that a prior Afd prevents merging after it's over. I don't agree with this even a little bit, but many other editors apparently think that way. Also, I'm not sure this is useful as a redirect, so even if merging is the main goal, the deletion question probably still needs to be resolved. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:42, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I though generally merge+delete (combined) is not an option, due to GFDL, which requies retention of edit history of old article, if its content are used in another article, in order to ensure attribution requirements are met. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:54, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Could be, I'm far from an expert on licensing issues. At any rate, there's no actual content here, so maybe it's not an issue in this case? If the names of notable remixes get used elsewhere, who's to say that it came from this article and not from a CD jacket or somewhere else? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This page is apparently the project of an anonymous user who is using it to push his own POV. Earlier versions of the article were in clear violation of NOR and NPOV. The author claimed that he was presenting an established anthropological theory. I used several search-engines, for anthropology, medical, social sciences, and biological sciences databases, to look for articles on "virago." I found none, with the exception of a few biology journals that discussed a species of fly called "virago" (in these cases, virago was neither a concept nor a concept applied to humans, merely the latin name of a species of fly). I have found no evidence whatsoever to support the author's claims, and conclude that he is pushing original research. On the discussion page he has suggested that the "suppression" of theories of "virago" were the result of a Jewish conspiracy. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 23:18, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and lock.</b> Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but encyclopedic articles about interesting words are abundant and desirable. "Virago" qualifies as an interesting word, because 1) it had formerly a positive connotation, then for a long time a negative one, until it was reclaimed as positive by feminists; 2) it was the original name of Eve in the Bible. These facts are not suitable for Wiktionary.<br />
It appears that people want to delete this article as an easy way to deal with a persistent anonymous POV-pusher/racist/sexist. The proper way to deal with this problem is to block or lock, not to delete an otherwise worthy article. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 22:46, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Axel, what is your evidence thaat Virago was the original name for Eve in the Bible? I know of no such evidence. It is used in the Latin Vulgate (by no means the "original" Bible) as a translation for the Hebrew word <i>Isha</i>. In Hebrew, "man" is "Ish" and Genesis 2:23 says Adam called woman "woman" because she came out of "man" (called "isha" "isha" because she came out of "ish") - the Vulgate translates "isha" as <i>verago</i> in order to maintain the pun, a word for woman that has within it the word for man. It is a clever translation (of <i>woman</i>, not the "name" for Eve), nothing more. It certainly is not being used as some "concept." "Isha" in the Hebrew Bible, "Virago" in the Latin translation of the Bible, and "Woman" in the English translation of the Bible, all mean the same thing: generic "woman." Once again the author of this article has made up out of thin air, or misconstrued and distorted, something to suit his own POV arguments.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I have no knowledge of the connection of Eve and Virago beyond what's in the article right now. What you write above is interesting to me, and deserves to be put in the article. It appears as if "virago" is simply the Latin word for "woman" then? If the current version of the article is POV, then it needs to be fixed, not deleted. I don't know whether and I am not claiming that there is any "concept" known as "Virago", but there certainly is a word "Virago", and there are plenty of worthwhile things to be said about that word. One could even mention that some racist/sexist anthropologists use(d) the word to denote a (fictional/discredited) concept [if that is true, which I don't know]. So I'll modify my vote above to <b>Keep, edit, and lock.</b> <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Read it on www.sciforums.com, Mr.Rubenstein. But please open your eyes before. Dixitque Adam: “Haec nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea! Haec vocabitur Virago, quoniam de viro sumpta est haec."</p>
<p>If you are not Axel, please sign your name. You quote the Vulgate. So what? What is your point? Here is the verse in Hebrew: וַיֹּאמֶר, הָאָדָם, זֹאת הַפַּעַם עֶצֶם"מֵעֲצָמַי, וּבָשָׂר מִבְּשָׂרִי; לְזֹאת יִקָּרֵא אִשָּׁה, כִּי מֵאִישׁ לֻקְחָה-זֹּאת. And here is the verse in English "And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.'" So what is your point? The Latin word for man is "viro" and the Latin word for woman is "virago." So what? It is just a translation. What bearing does your quote have on this discussion? Should we have an article on "ossibus" and "carne?" They appear in the same verse, why not have articles that provide us with the translation of these words? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Axel, my main point is tht the anonymous contributor keeps adding false material. He does it again, in the above quote from the Vulgate. Yes, it uses the word "virago." <b>No</b>, it is not using "virago" to mean "Eve" (the proper name). Eve in Hebrew is Hava; woman is isha. The Vulgate is using "virago" as a translation for isha (woman) not for Eve. Look at the verse in any English Bible and you will see Adam saying that he will call it "woman." Just like the English word "woman" has <i>within it</i> the word "man," (or, the English word "female" has <i>within it</i> the word "male") and just as the Hebrew word for woman, "isha" has <i>within it</i> the Hebrew word for man, "ish," the translator wanted a Latin word for woman that had within it a root for man. The root is "vir" from which we get "virile." But it is also the source of the word "virgo" (meaning, a maiden or virgin female). Now, Axel, do you really think we should have an article on the latin word for "woman?" Should we have an article on all Latin words? The Vulgate uses the word "virago" to mean "woman" because that is what the word means. The problem with the anonymous user's material is not so much tht it is POV (although it is), but it is all original research that contradicts verifible sources. Axel, if you remove all the original research and non-verifiable claims from the article, <i>nothing is left but a definition!</i> And Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a dictionary! <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:36, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fact that the anonymous editor keeps adding false/original/POV/non-verifiable material is a reason to block or lock, but not to delete the article altogether. I disagree with the claim that the only worthwhile thing to be said about this word is its definition. You yourself have said plenty of interesting things about it on this very page, including the reason of its use in the vulgate (was it invented for that purpose?) -- after all, Latin has at least two other, more common words for "woman". Furthermore, the word is used in English and its various connotations trace out an interesting history. None of this is suitable for Wiktionary. But I'm repeating myself. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 20:45, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Axel, please check virago in the Martin -Saller -Knußmann manual which has been setting t h e world standard since 1914 for physical anthropology.This is no joke. It is a sad thing that Mr.Rubenstein wants to present me as Anti-Semitic, but I am only anti-nitwit.I am a professor of anthropology with 45 years of experience. I travelled all 5 continents and made important contributions to anthropology. One anthropological journal elected me one of the most influential 200 anthropologists of all times .Virago is an important concept being at least 3500 years old inclusively its racial implications. Every statement of mine is true and correct. The old article was not racist or sexist.It e.g. contained positive statements about the Mongolid race. Please, Axel, check the Babylonian " salzikrum " concept in the Codex Hammurapi and all the other sources. Mr. Rubenstein is obviously not able to read German scientific literature.Mr. Rubenstein is only confusing you with the vulgate stuff Sunray or Wilmcw have introduced later on.</p>

<li>For those of you who want to know what Mr. Famous-but-Nameless is talking about, Martin, Saller, and Knußmann provide methods for measuring human morphology, such as skeletal remains. Such data can be very useful in determining the sex and age of the deceased and, in combination with other data, can be useful in determining other factors involving the health of the deceased. By the way, most scientists think there are seven continents, not five. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:29, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please, Axel read the manuals, read Weininger (he contributed the "m-f-scale"), the Prussian Max Hartmann who gained world fame for his three laws of sexuality, read the previous version of this article, google "Lesbian+iq" for the higher IQ of Lesbians,you will find charts including races, too, read about the racial implications of masculinity and feminity in Knußman, read about the pedomorphous feminity of the Sanid race in John Randal Baker's "Race"(Oxford University Press,1974)etc.Especially Antarctica is important for anthropology. Hahaha! Mr.Rubenstein presents Knußmann et al. as ridiculous "bonemen" (macabre connotation).Mr. Rubenstein must take not of the fact that the overwhelming percentage is not about sceletal measuring in each of the about 10 classics I cited. He is obviously not able to understand German like Durova who according to her own statements can understand only easy German.Read the passages about virago and read about her aggressiveness, less heterosexual libido,higher homosexual libido, less fertility,proneness to leftist ideologies (Durova is the best example, as a soldier and virago according to her own statements who according to US military manuals explicitly should have an aggressive character ).Mr. Rubenstein and Durova can be called lays in some respects as they have not enough language skills that would enable them e.g. to get in Felix Moos's secret service projects and to read difficult German literature.I myself speak 7 languages fluently and including Russian , Mandarin,French,Spanish and Dutch, I started to learn Russian due to be a prisoner of war in the Second World War where I lost 2 fingers in the battle of Stalingrad as a lieutenant.Durova should not be too self-confident in her physical skills which she threatened to use against me (see discussion page) as I gained a close-combat medal in Russia during my service in the German Wehrmacht. Especially Mr.Rubenstein's bibliograpghical skills are deficient what you, Axel can easily detect. Axel,please check the sources and you will see that Mr. Rubenstein is wrong. He uses manipulative tactics,too, called "deception by only focussing on unimportant details.".His behaviour reflects a lack of experience due to his young age.Whether there are 5, 6 ot 7 continents e.g. is not important. I meant of course the classical account&#160;:Europe,Asia, Africa, America,Australia.Axel, let's do it as you and I have proposed. Let us write some sentences about the anthropological concept in a very critical form Mr. Rubenstein can also be happy with (if he r e a d s the sources). B u t the concept has been an important concept, being in the 1996 world standard manual, and must be included here&#160;!80.138.130.218 14:00, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was tagged for speedy deletion for having "no encyclopedic content." At first glance, I thought it was another band vanity, but claims that newspaper articles have been written about them in The Sun, so I brought it to AfD instead.

<li>They have a collaboration with a Gorillaz member who is IN the encyclopaedia also, so this might give the entry some more weight. As for band vanity, I would assume that if this was the case - they have not included pictures or media content - so I assume it's not that. The articles all check out and I do work in the industry (music journalist) and they have featured in the NME and Q for example. I am assuming someone has put them on the map here as they are mooted as one of the 'next big things'. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.209.115.246 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.209.115.246_a413.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.209.115.246">contribs</a>) 10:42, 4 January 2006 (UTC).</small>
