<li><b>Userfy</b> if at all possible. I have developed the following theory on vanity pages: they're mostly people who are (a) getting their feet wet in Wikipedia, (b) don't know the criteria for notability, and (c) would be just as happy being able to present the information posted here on a user-page, if they were offered that opportunity before having their contribution chewed up and spat out in the vfd process. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD</font><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">Abram</font><font style="background: darkgreen" color="#FFC000">son</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">thi</font><font color="red"><b>m</b></font><font color="DarkGreen">k</font></sup></a> 01:53, 2005 May 13 (UTC)

<li>Agreed (hence the qualification, "if at all possible").

<p>This article is about a 'secret' organization. Since secret organizations can not be verified they are generally considered non-encyclopedic. Google hits=0 for most of the material (the acronym B.D.C. has several unrelated meanings), I tried several forms without success. Page was created by an anon and this is the IP's only edit.

<p>Original research, not encyclopedic. The term "banana wolfing" returns zero hits on google. There is little scientific evidence to support most of the article's claims, except for the statement "Bananas, being high in <a href="../../../t/r/y/Tryptophan.html" title="Tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, have the potential of being a relaxant." Thus, the rest of the article is original research.

<p>Hilarious. Not only is the title POV, but the list deserves a place on the list of shortest articles (entire text was "Spevack"). This either needs retitling and greatly extending, or getting rid of (and since we already have various lists of surnames by nationality, I'd favour the latter). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 03:13, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think there's a surname on the planet that can not be fit into a more precise list of surnames by nationality or similar affiliation (except maybe fanciful surnames, such as where gadflys legally change their name to a number).

<li><b>Keep</b>. – mildly notable for his good share of the vote, but even so, I can't see any reason why standing in a parliamentary election does not justify an article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a lost cause, but I have to protest at this notabilizing of everybody who ever ran for public office. <i>Millions</i> of people do this <i>every year</i>. Most of them have fewer accomplishments than are listed on our typical vanity page created by a high school sophomore. It's absurd that we reject successful businesspeople as "self-advertisers" and people with some community stature as "vanity", but carefully list every idiot who got 100 people to sign their candidacy petition! ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 02:17, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Running for parliament is not the same as running for a local council, so "millions of people" doesn't apply to this case. The concept of "notable" should not get in the way of "verifiable and important to users". If wikipedia is doing its job of explaining national politics, it needs to cover these <s>idiots</s> minor party candidates. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can I just point out an error in Isaac R's comment? It's not 100 signatures needed to run for UK Parliament. It's ten. Oh, and 500 quid for the deposit. Oh, and you can't be bankrupt, a judge, a bishop, a peer or in the army. That's about it really. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:42, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sanders, however, also received the Green Party nomination for his office, if I understand the facts. Getting that nomination presumably took more than 10 signatures. This is still borderline notable IMO, but the family connection with a quite notable USA politician makes this entry interesting (should be expanded though). The fact politics "runs in the family" and so on. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:21, 2005 May 14 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who said anything about local elections? There are about a hundred national legislatures on this planet, with a collective membership of maybe 20,000. I guess I was overestimating when I said that millions run for these 20,000 seats every year, but it's gotta be in the high six figures. Is every single one of these people notable?

<dd>I have now read these linked articles, and I stand by my vote to <b>delete</b>. There are over 600 seats in the UK House of Commons, an article for every MP in recent years (which I am prepared to go along with) already takes us into 4 figures. An article for every candidate, or even every one from the dozen or so semi-serious parties with significant representation in elected authorities must take us into 5 figures.

<li><b>Comment</b> My apologies if I was too quick for you. If one is editing an article, it helps if the article isn't saved until it is more complete. Otherwise mistakes like this can happen. All too often such skeleton articles <i>aren't</i> actively being edited and a vfd may be justified.

<li>I agree that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_Sion_9df8.html" title="Priory of Sion">Priory of Sion</a> is quite possibly not the historic body it is often seen to be - thanks for drawing that to our attention. But the existence of a substantial article about that body demonstrates the point that concrete reality is not a pre-requisite of notability. <b>Cutting of the elm</b>, like the Priory, is a notable tale of a legendary event - and, real or unreal, its notability is what we must consider. For examples of what I mean, see here <a href="http://karchner.com/blog/archives/2003/03/30/the_cutting_of_the_elm_at_baghdad/" class="external autonumber" title="http://karchner.com/blog/archives/2003/03/30/the_cutting_of_the_elm_at_baghdad/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> where the mythical event is used, rather feebly, as a simile about the Iraq war; and here <a href="http://www.danzigandwoolley.com/key_lyrics.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.danzigandwoolley.com/key_lyrics.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> where it appears in the lyrics of a folk song.

<li><b>Strong keep and clean-up</b> The incident is well documented and appears on Google in many places retold in different ways, albeit that these may have a common source. It may be apocryphal but is certainly of significance and has its own name. Reason enough for an article.

<dd>It's not significant in this context whether or not the story is true or verifiable. It probably is not - but then neither are most myths and legends. The question is whether it is notable. This clearly is notable for some people, with over 600 Google hits for a search on 'Gisors Elm', most of which are different and almost all of which refer to this tale.

<li><b>Keep</b>. An editor can be found, but with time this article will improve. I think you need to give it a better chance. Also, just because it does not return any results from google, I do not believe that to be a valid reason for deletion; the guy just does not have any pages made about him! In addition, what do you consider to be 'vanity'? Are not all biographies made for vanity? NO, the purpose of them is to inform you on a person's life, which is excatly what this is doing!

Although Macarro is supposed to be notable (according to this article) as a scholar, the article has virtually no information about his scholarly career and, as stated above, Google yields no information about Macarro as a scholar. Also note that the cause and place of his death is given, but no date of death, which leads me to wonder whether Daniel Macarro as described in this article actually existed.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Though the article is massive, and in poor condition, in perusing the talk page, it appears that there are those working to clean it up, and respond to critique that the article is too large. It's been a few days since the last edit, but it looks like it is being worked on fairly often. As far as it being original research, those in favor of moving it to Wikisource may be correct, but I do not support deletion. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a>

<li>On this view, it could be better to move the current text to Kambojas/Temp, and then keep a basic stub until it is cleaned up. This page isn't that you want to see on random page. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 22:20, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The only possible solution is a complete rewrite from scratch, rather than cleanup. Of course, the material may be preserved, but not in the main article space. Heck, from the article it is even not clear whether Kambojas live today or not (or I am just too lazy to find it in the article). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 22:37, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear Mikkalai, of course, <i>you are too lazy</i>. The Kambojas still live in northern India, mainly in Panjab (Kamboj/Kambohs) and also in Afghanistan as Siyaposh tribes( Kamoz/Camojes/Kams). Though their numbers have greatly dwindled, and currently, total population still known by their ancient name(s) is etimated to be about 1.5 million approx. pl read: Kambojas and Kambohs section under Kambojas.<a href="../../../k/l/s/KLS_429c.html" title="KLS">KLS</a>
<ul>
<li>I admit I am lazy, but not very "too". I am just an average reader. The section you refer me to is not only the very last one, it is some 50 pages down thru heaps and heaps of quotations from ancient texts in sanscrit. What you have written here belong not here, but in the very first lines of the article. I can only explain this by complete disregard of potential readers.

<li>I do agree that topic is a genuine one and wikipedia should have an article on this, actually I wanted to clean up (my comments on article' talk page), but I gave up, as I found that any cleanup will require a massive re-write, days of efforts, and saying goodbye to a lot of raw data. I suggest editors who placed these materials to remove certain sections and redo the remaining portions.

<li><b>Keep</b>, it is a worthwhile subject but the references are way too many and too un-structured. I just cleaned up the Alexander and Mauryan Empire parts.

<li>Please notice that my move was against the <b>content</b>, which is to be deleted, because we are not writing research papers here.

<li>I do agree completely with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> - I did a cleanup of two sections and merged them into one. The entire cleanup is a massive task, and a lot of info will have to be made compact.

<li><b>Keep</b>- I record a formal vote to keep, though earlier I had given comments here as well as on article discussion page. My only worry is that the size of the article should be made a bit compact, references may be rationalized and duplication should be avoided.

<li><b>Keep</b>: no evidence that Feldman wrote the article himself, looks like it's by a Cambridge student/graduate/enthusiast to me. In the British university system, unlike in the US, the title "Prof" is only given to senior academics, so a Prof at Cambridge is a pretty senior position. A google shows he's also contributed to books and been a legal advisor to the Houses of Parliament. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 20:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
