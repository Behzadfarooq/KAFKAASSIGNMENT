How does the arrest of two minor terror suspects make them more significant than those caught in the arrest of 17 minor terror suspects? (I'm using minor in comparison to major terrorist figures obviously, not the seriousness of their suspected plans). (btw, How on earth is this a "maybe vanity" article?) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:18, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to WikiNews. Too many "according to"'s and "allegedly" and general speculation to be an encyclopedia article yet.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> what implication? the police reportedly abandoned the "aim for the head" policy here due to the de Menezes scandal, and aimed for the upper body instead. I find the way the article puts the shooting allegation above everything else a little strange and POV incidentally. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is news to me, could you please point me to a reliable source reporting that the Met have officially abandoned shoot to kill? You may want to add it to the de Menezes article. I'm very interested. Thanks. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 16:35, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyway, to answer your question. De Menezes, bad intelligence. Alpizar, no intelligence. Kahar, potentially very significant implications. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 19:40, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to this Independent article, the headshot/lethal force policy is only for suspected suicide bombers. Otherwise its a shot to a torso <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece" class="external free" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece" rel="nofollow">http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece</a> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:15, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...thus confirming that shoot to kill has never been abandoned, especially not because of the de Menezes incident. Not surprised to be honest. The reason to keep STK is clearly political, the day STK goes, Ian Blair goes. Anyway, point taken about Kahar arguably not falling in the category for which STK is applicable, though I'd disagree. Let's see what happens. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 05:54, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Every news event doesn't need an article of its own on wikipedia. That's what wikinews is for. Wikipedia can have "many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news" (from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) but is this event historically significant? Remember, "Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete." (also from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 18:39, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> ok, well can we get a consensus on combining with forest gate or moving to an article about all the events? i don't think at the moment it warrants its own article. We could place it all on forest gate and see if it evolves into something significant. I feel this is important enough to warrant some entries on the forest gate page at least <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPluke_18fc.html" title="User:Pluke">Pluke</a> 18:50, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, a separate article is badly needed, as some info doesn't really belong to either <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Gate_387c.html" title="Forest Gate">Forest Gate</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Abdul_Kahar_7271.html" title="Mohammed Abdul Kahar">Mohammed Abdul Kahar</a>, e.g. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,,1790427,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,,1790427,00.html" rel="nofollow">this reference</a>. I'm fine with the proposed article name.

<dd>I think that would not solve the concerns I (and I believe others) had, in that this is too fluid with sources that are too liable to change, hence the transwiki to news. Simply moving the same information into a separate article doesn't address that in my view, as it's the fluid information than needs transikifiying, not the article title.

<li><b>Keep</b>, pending further information on the case. Personally, I don't think this affects the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Kratos_38ba.html" title="Operation Kratos">Met's shoot-to-kill policy</a> at all, as Kahar was shot during a police raid. He also was shot in the shoulder, not in the head; he is a terror suspect, not, like De Menzies, a victim of circumstances (and, of course, of the Met's decision to implement Kratos).</li>
