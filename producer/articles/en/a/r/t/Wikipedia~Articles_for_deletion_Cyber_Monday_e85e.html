<p>I tried to flesh it out a bit; however, this seems like a completely new term invented this year - I haven't seen a source anywhere. At the very least, I think at least a year (until next "Cyber Monday") is needed to see if it actually establishes itself as a real term. -<a href="../../../t/e/j/User%7ETejastheory_c89d.html" title="User:Tejastheory">Tejastheory</a> 00:30, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would support the merge with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_29ef.html" title="Black Friday">Black Friday</a>'s entry. It's been well used (as BD2412 points out) in media outlets this past week. It doesn't seem likely that the internet or internet shopping will go away anytime soon. Note: Cyber Monday, as NPR and others have explained is due to the fact people shop online from work on Monday because broadband access is not yet universal. With the continued decline of dialup and increase of cable/dsl it is likely that "Cyber Monday" will only remain as a historical term used for a short period of time. Could be that next year enough people have broadband at home (and don't need to use the resource at work) and the Cyber Monday effect will be greatly reduced.Jon@bostonist.com 19:07, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not a usual poster here, and I'm not sure if I'm posting correctly on this page - but I'm a television producer with the FOX owned station in Greensboro, NC. I've spoken with Scott Krugman, a PR guy with the National Retail Federation's website shop.org. Krugman told me the Executive Director of shop.org coined the phrase 3 months ago to describe a trend first noticed last year. I pressed Krugman about "Cyber Monday" being completely manufactured by the NRF. He says NRF is hesitant to talk about coining the phrase, because it doesn't want "Cyber Monday" to appear to be a "Hallmark Holiday." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.237.209.32 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.237.209.32.html" title="User talk:216.237.209.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.237.209.32_7a9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.237.209.32">contribs</a>) 19:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

As I have never heard of this term prior to this year, it seems like its some random term coined by the major retailers to have an excuse for a sale. I think wikipedia should take a stance against this and just merge it with Black Friday. The faster it dies, the better. We don't need more holidays to dilute the already diluted Black Friday Sale. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 169.233.22.95 (<a href="../../../1/6/9/User_talk%7E169.233.22.95.html" title="User talk:169.233.22.95">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_169.233.22.95_9f96.html" title="Special:Contributions/169.233.22.95">contribs</a>) 23:35, 28 November 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, only because I've heard it so many times in the past few hours alone - it's certainly a neologism, but i've seen it everywhere from cnet and yahoo news to gizmodo and cbs news and usa today...a merge with Black Friday seems best, and the wikipedia page seems to be among the top 20 or so Google results <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplegoddess_1a4f.html" title="User:Applegoddess">janey the crazy</a> 09:37, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>, Cyber Monday is a valid term. While it was coined by marketers, it is becoming part of the vernacular, unlike many things on Urban Dictionary. However, I don't think it's deserving of an article of its own, so I feel that it should be merged with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_%28shopping%29_f994.html" title="Black Friday (shopping)">Black Friday (shopping)</a>. --<a href="../../../b/h/t/User%7EBhtooefr_ddc9.html" title="User:Bhtooefr">Bhtooefr</a> 13:49, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, We were discussing this term at the office, and Wikipedia was the first reliable source we cound find on its origins. Even if it's not a real phoenomenon, it's a real phrase people use and the article should reflect that.</li>
<li><b><strike>Weak Keep or</strike> Strong Delete and Merge</b>, I hadn't heard of it until a forum posting about a day ago, then a Slashdot article today. Regardless of the media/retailers picking it up, it just hasn't passed into common phrase yet. You don't hear everyone talking about Cyber Monday sales. Most of what you find online about it is people discussing this new term. I say it be merged with the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_%28shopping%29_f994.html" title="Black Friday (shopping)">Black Friday</a> entry and put in a small section.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is a flash-in-the-pan term that only has legs <i>this year</i>, because of an easily rebroadcast story in the media. It's a fake meme, based on the faulty assertion that shoppers are flocking to online sales after they return to work. <i>No one has even substantiated that the phenomenon actually exists</i>. This to me is a red herring marketing term that has no reality outside the stupid media story that generated it. This is especially clear from ludicrously dated use of <i>cyber</i> which itself is deprecated among the online community. Wikipedia should delete this one with extreme prejudice. <a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcharman_55dc.html" title="User:Rcharman">Rcharman</a> 17:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rcharman, it is precisely BECAUSE this meme has grown so quickly and so fast that Wikipedia must address it. I for one only learned Cyber Monday was a gimmick from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Unfortunately this term has legs, and because of its...*sigh* notoriety we'll have to hear about it until the end of the year.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can it be proven that it will stick around? Other internet-coined turns have since gone the way of the Dodo (Information Superhighway anyone?).

<li>It's a name taken from a already widely used name. It's trying to play off the popularity of Black Friday. That's the connection. That and the fact that they're so close together, apparently as this is now a holiday. -<a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a> 22:16, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know what to say... they're clearly not the same actual day, but they're also clearly closely related. 2/3rds of news articles that mention Cyber Monday also mention Black Friday. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=usa&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=cyber-monday+black-friday&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=usa&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=cyber-monday+black-friday&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=usa&amp;q=cyber-monday&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=usa&amp;q=cyber-monday&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 22:27, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
