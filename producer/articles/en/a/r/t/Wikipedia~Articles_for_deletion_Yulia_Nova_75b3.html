<li><b>EDIT</b>.

I would personally hope that this is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but I will for now assume good faith. In any case, Yulia Nova is a famous softcore porn model in Japan.

<ul>
<li>I see. I will still say '<i>keep</i>, since I see it as notable in Japan. However, I am wondering what should we do for Japanese based porn stars, since In japan, there's no such thing as "independent"? I am asking this not mainly for this article, but for future references. This is because everything in Japan has no such thing as independent, and even referencing Gundam, if not from approval from Sunrise/bandai, can onyl be done in "similarities" method. I am not saying I am blaming this on Wikipedia, but whether we should accomodate Japan's many unwritten rules that dominates their business (which they have a habit on, such as the restriction on HP in cars, which can't be higher then 280), or whether we let Japanese people knows that this is Wikipedia's policy. On a sidenote, is this good idea to delete relevant pages on Japan, for example? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 20:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just want to make sure you know what I mean by independant. If a non-pornographic magazine featured an article on a porn star, that would count as independant coverage and would establish her notability. For example, Jenna Jameson is a very notable porn star as she regurlarly appears in non-pornographic newspapers. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you want to make a proper argument for keeping that will hold water, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that this person has been documented in depth in multiple published works by people independent of Yulia Nova. Currently, the article cites no such sources, it only pointing to the subject's own web site, and you haven't cited any in this AFD discussion either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The independence requirement is that the sources be <i>independent of the subject xyrself and of each other</i>, as explained at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. In other words, it excludes autobiographies, advertising, press releases, and so forth. It doesn't exclude biographies written by other people, although such biographies may be excluded for being unreliable (as the potted biographies that accompany picture sets in pornographic magazines notoriously are). The important thing is not where this person's pictures have appeared, because that provides no source material for an encyclopaedia article. The important thing is how much is reliably and independently documented about this person's life and work in already published material. It has yet to be demonstrated that anything at all has been. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess the problem is the difference of culture between Japan and here, and how they will as impotant and what not. Oh well, AFD still have 4 days left, so we will see. Even if it got deleted, I guess it's "cie la vie" <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 23:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Importance has nothing to do with it. The issue is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>, and that is demonstrated by multiple non-trivial published works from sources independent of the subject.

Tokyo Topless is a major big-bust website in Japan which updates about once a month, and features ethnic Japanese models almost exclusively, yet has featured Yulia Nova. She was also the subject of a minor news item when her photographer lobbied against Google. Multiple video appearances, multiple magazine appearances, this is an article on a celebrity, not a vanity page.

<li>Not every movie star, fashion model, etc is notable.

<ul>
<li>No. I think it depends on the magazines and/or movies, and the context. The larger the circulation, the more the magazine or movie contributes to that person's notability. Thus, being in an internationally distributed magazine and/or pornographic movie (such as Playboy, Voluptuous, etc) would contribute to a person's notability the same as an internationally distributed movie would. If they were in a movie that had significant impact or circulation in their country, then they are obviously notable. If you had bothered to look, you'd know that WP:ALLORNOTHING is an <i>invalid argument</i>. In summary, everything contributes to notability... <i>even pornographic works</i>. However, the impact depends on their circulation and acclaim. â€”<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 05:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
