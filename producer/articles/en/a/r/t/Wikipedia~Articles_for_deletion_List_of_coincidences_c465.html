<li>What I had in mind (in creating this article) was that it should only list coincidences which are significant, e.g. surrounding historical events. (Rubric at the start of the article could set out what would count.) There are many notable historical examples of remarkable coincidences, some of which had important consequences (and are worthy of collection in one place). I know the article doesn't have much of this yet, but I only created it a few minutes ago! Re the encyclopedic point, if <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_coincidence.html" title="Mathematical coincidence">Mathematical coincidence</a> is legitimate (effectively a list of mathematical coincidences) then surely a more general list of coincidences (including reference to the mathematical ones) also should be. <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfinn_cf83.html" title="User:Bfinn">Ben Finn</a> 00:59, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> ne and unmaintanable. The 'coincidences' in mathematics and physics are matters of absolute, immutable fact. They are not really coincidences; they're just dressed up that way in the lay press. The maths ones in particular are actually useful <i>approximations</i> for the most part.

<li>Well the maths coincidences aren't in the List of coincidences article (just linked to from it).

<li>That's not what I said at all. I was making the point that you were defending this page of genuine coincidences on the basis that there was another page of coincidence, which the maths page is not all. The maths 'coincidences' are not coincidences at all, but hard facts, and approximations of encyc value because they are widely used within the numerate-sciences. See the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Talk%7EMathematical_coincidence_4a24.html" title="Talk:Mathematical coincidence">talk</a> page for some others' feelings on this point.

<li><b>Keep</b> Amazon lists over 350 BOOKS on the subject and Google yields over five million hits; obviously there is a strong interest in this topic that nothing else in Wiki satisfies. I think the problem is that the article at this point is nothing but a stub. Once people begin improving it, it should be a fine addition to the Wikipedia. Anyway, the poor thing has only been alive for a few hours, IMHO you’re being a little quick on the trigger in trying to quash it, and pretty viscous on the attacks. The jibes about soup on Saturday and girlfriends calling are the same as deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_dogs.html" title="List of famous dogs">List of famous dogs</a> because none of my dachshunds are listed, or deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_American_houses_4dd5.html" title="List of famous American houses">List of famous American houses</a> because Jimmy Wales’ house didn’t make the cut. Wiki is chock full of trivial lists with arbitrary “lower limits” on what is or is not included (570 just that start with ‘a’), and NONE of them mention your girlfriend or your soup. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin Wells</a> 01:43, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I might consider keeping a page about books about coincidences because that would be maintainable for a start. This page is simply not — there can be no justification for excluding any coincidence - just try applying a notability criterion to coincidences - some people would deny they even happened, or that they were coincidental.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:09, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>When I do it, an Amazon "Books" search for "list of coincidences" returns <i>just 16</i> books, not 350, including books which are quite obviously not about this topic at all such as <i>Murder List&#160;: A Novel</i>, <i>Arco Reading Lists for College-Bound Students (Reading Lists for College-Bound Students)</i>, <i>Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists</i>, and <i>The A List: The National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> – as the devil's advocate, or maybe Badukuk's, I propose there are no coincidences. Seriously - this is far more about the concept of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a>. I'd say a list of well-known synchronistic events (such as some of the ones on this not well-named list), would most definitely be encyclopedic. See references at <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a>. I don't agree that this is a silly, unmaintainable list or ridiculous proposition at all.

<li>The fact that some people believe there is no such thing as a coincidence, and that apparent coincidences are a result of some underlying cause, makes it all the more important for an NPOV encyclopedia to cover them. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:37, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> My final word on all this (having done a little more beefing up on the article) is that while I don't claim a list of coincidences would be of great <i>academic</i> worth (which is I think what is meant by the 'not encyclopedic' criticism), it would be of considerable <i>curiosity</i> value, which is a legitimate (though admittedly lesser) purpose of quite a few existing Wikipedia articles. I cite as examples of this the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_strange_units_of_measurement.html" title="List of strange units of measurement">List of strange units of measurement</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaths_by_accidental_drug_overdose.html" title="List of deaths by accidental drug overdose">List of deaths by accidental drug overdose</a>, which have little academic value but considerable curiosity value. And I argue that a list of coincidences would be of greater interest to many readers than some of the existing lists. I am happy to spend time myself adding to and maintaining it (as I have already done on the curiosity-value <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_premature_obituaries.html" title="List of premature obituaries">List of premature obituaries</a> which I started recently). The existing <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coincidence.html" title="Coincidence">Coincidence</a> article cites a couple of <i>examples</i> of coincidences (which could be moved to this new page), and links to some See Also topics, but is not itself a <i>list</i> of coincidences. Finally, I think the few examples I've put in so far demonstrate that the page would be more than a mere list of trivia, as aside from its intrinsic interest it would (when fleshed out with more instances) link to and encourage browsing of a wide range of people, events and topics. <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfinn_cf83.html" title="User:Bfinn">Ben Finn</a> 13:41, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
