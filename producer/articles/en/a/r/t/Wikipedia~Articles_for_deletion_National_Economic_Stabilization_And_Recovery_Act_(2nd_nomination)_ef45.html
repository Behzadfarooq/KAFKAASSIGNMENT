<p>A summary of nesara.org, which is about a non-notable fringe legislative proposal with a single secondary source that's significantly shorter than the article. No citable criticism of the proposal seems to exist. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomP_ea0d.html" title="User:RandomP">RandomP</a> 03:45, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I edit this article once in a while. I have no interest in the plan itself from a political standpoint. I understand this is a fringe proposal with little or no legislative action. Thus there is little criticism or documentation. However, I don't know if that is reason enough to delete it. It seems to be a real plan with some small support. Perhaps it's a waste of space - doesn't bother me much either way. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorphh_f32d.html" title="User:Morphh">Morphh</a> 04:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Could you provide a link? All I can find is about NESARA the scam, which is not the same as NESARA the legislative proposal (I'm not sure about their relationship. They seem to have different expansions of the acronym, and the scam is quite notable while the legislative proposal is not.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the SECOND time this article has been put it up for deletion. It survived once. It should survive again. It IS notable, notably in DISTANCING the legitimate version from the well-known hoax. It is a valid proposal that has merits against the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Tax_c6cb.html" title="Flat Tax">Flat Tax</a>, and other tax proposals. It is also a valid proposal that has merits against the Moneteray Reform Act, and other monetary reform proposals. It is based on a published book. It is cited by several sources, and not just the nesara.org page. Further, it is informative to those interested in knowing what the difference is between the hoax version and the NESARA Institute's version. There is a link on both the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a> linking both to the other so as to present the information seperately, clearly, and distinctly. I am not from NESARA, I do not work for NESARA. I just happened to find out about it while reading a news article about it, and also by reading an interview with its author, by a notable news source. I believe that to delete this article would violate the founding principles of wikipedia - namely it would mean deleting NOTABLE information from the public view. Those unfamiliar with the topic often don't take the time to look into it before forming their own opinions about it, especially since the hoax version is so noticiable, and has already "poisened the well" in its receipt by those in Congress. With the death of the author last May, it has been even harder to fight the credibility issues the hoax version has created for the NESARA Institute. This article helps then to give people an OBJECTIVE view of Dr. Barnard's legislative proposal, as compared to other reform proposals that already are notable for inclusion in wikipedia. I ask that the administrator consider the fact that a real NESARA exists as opposed to the fake hoax one - one that doesn't even look like the original but attempts to steal the name of the original. I also ask that the administrator consider the fact that the public wants objective information about the non hoax version of NESARA. This article is also not original research, any more than <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Tax_c6cb.html" title="Flat Tax">Flat Tax</a> is. It is just as notable as other tax reform proposals that have been listed on wikipedia. I agree the article needs clean up, but to delete it altogether would be unfair to the effort at seperating the two NESARAs for the public view, and the intention of the editors of both <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 14:45, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
