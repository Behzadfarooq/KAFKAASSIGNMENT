<li><b>Keep</b> - appears to be a verifiable individual with encyclopaedic content to his name. Ghits are a terrible measure for people, places or things with names that don't use the Roman alphabet. It seems he did receive the highest military honour in Sri Lanka, which certainly takes him past the infamous <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>On that basis, I find him verifiable. I find him notable based on his receiving the highest honor his country awards. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but specifically, it's the "highest award for bravery". Hundreds of thousands of such medals have been awarded by all the countries in human history - are we going to give them all articles? Also, the newspaper article and this article aren't saying the same things. The newspaper article starts by saying this man sacrificed his life, but then goes on to say that he's classified MIA, and that his body was never recovered, and that some say "he was alive, but captured by the enemy". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, dead or alive doesn't matter to notability. If there are discrepancies in the article that's a reason for improving the article, not deleting it. Secondly there are not hundreds of thousands of such medals awarded. There are only a thousand or so VCs awarded, and it's been around longer than most such medals. Thirdly <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. There are probably fewer soldiers like this than high schools. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I bring up the "dead or alive" matter not to question notability on that basis, but to point out that the article's lone source doesn't seem to be sure what it is reporting. Just because Wikipedia is not paper doesn't mean anything goes or that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is out the window, otherwise I'd make an article about my Uncle Ned. Any why are you specifically talking about "VC"s? I wasn't. I'm talking about <i>any</i> country's "highest award for bravery", period. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And long-established precedent says that anyone who receives the VC or Congressional Medal of Honor is automatically considered notable. By extension, that clearly should apply to any country's highest military honor. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Very noble and altruistic, but I can't agree with the logic of that extension. Without naming controversial names, there have been countries where, during certain times, "highest medals for bravery" have been churned out en masse and practically given to anyone who petitioned for one, and many more who didn't. (I won't go as far as <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> and say that some countries are more important than others, but I <i>will</i> venture that some countries' <i>medals</i> are more important than others.) Aside from all that, anyway, my main concern is the lack of verifiable info about the subject of this article from quality sources. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:10, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
