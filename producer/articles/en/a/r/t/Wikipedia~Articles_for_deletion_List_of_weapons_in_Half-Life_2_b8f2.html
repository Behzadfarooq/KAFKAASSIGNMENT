<ul>
<li>Doesn't fit into Wikipedia. A list of info that is only helpful to a person who plays or has played Half-Life 2. Similar lists have been deleted in the past. All relevant info is found within the main article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, it is unfair to keep this entry up when other lists made for titles such as, for example, the Battlefield series and Halo are taken down on the same grounds. Half-Life 2 should not be kept exempt when other games are having their lists deleted for similar reasons. I propose we <b>Delete</b> it. --Gazdakka Gizbang 00:58, 28 October 2006 (EST)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> HL has cult status with mass following. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 15:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>- As do most of the other games that have had all of their lists deleted. Popularity should not contribute to whether this article remains. If it did, then most of the titles would never have had their work deleted in the first place. --Gazdakka Gizbang 01:11, 28 October 2006 (EST)</p>

<dd>Article is very informative, it would be extremely useful for people interested in computer gaming.<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 15:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>- As is every other previously deleted article, but as you said, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> applies. --Gazdakka Gizbang 01:49, 28 October 2006 (EST)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I know that popularity should not contribute to the debate. When I look at an article for deletion, I look at WP policies but I also ask myself, if I wanted information on this topic, would I come here? I dont play the game but if I wanted some more information on the game, I would probably come here and search it out. So, I gotta go with keep. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 15:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>- Note to be made: Anyone who wants information on weaponry for *insert game here* would find this site useful if the article for it is up. If this article remains then I must inquire: Why is it that this entry remains when the others are taken away, yet they accomplish the same purpose of providing useful information on the matter? Just the wrong deletion reviewing crowd? --Gazdakka Gizbang 01:18, 28 October 2006 (EST)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is not run by precedent law, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> says "Wikipedia is inconsistent". <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 15:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>- Point taken. Shall wait for remainder of votes to be cast. --Gazdakka Gizbang 01:35, 28 October 2006 (EST)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Hm. Part of me wants to say "There's plenty of sites that cover the weapons in HL2", but I dunno. Maybe merge it with the HL2 article? For now I'll <b>abstain</b>. Also, has anybody noticed that this AfD is displayed in two different places on the AfD page? But clicking on the "edit" link for the second one takes me to a blank page. Is it just my browser, or what? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward_Wakelin_dd5e.html" title="User:Edward Wakelin">Edward Wakelin</a> 15:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>- I noticed that too. The second link has been deleted --Gazdakka Gizbang 01:57, 28 October 2006 (EST)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Keep</b> it, it's an useful reference for anyone interested in the HL2 world, compiling all known data about the weapons in one spot. Besides, the information it provides is very inlikely to be found on game sites (such as design discrepancies, cut weapons, their construction etc.) EDIT: Wait, is this vote cast because Halo's list got offed? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 16:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because various articles relating to list-based information for games have been deleted in the past. Halo was merely an example, you should know that. --Gazdakka Gizbang 02:48, 28 October 2006 (EST)
<dl>
<dd>This is not a rule, because there is no precedence laws on Wikipedia - The Half-Life 2 article covers an analysis of the weaponry, including information not found elsewhere on the web (where would you find, that Tri Nguyen designed the OSIPR basing on the MG-42?) and is useful to anybody interested in the Half-Life 2 subject, while Halo articles would appeal only to Halo fanboys&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Seriously though, there is no basis for deleting the article, as it has existed for a long time, and has grown very large and comprehensive. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 18:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You know, I just figured this kind of deletion spree would happen when I started to see this sort of thing crop up a few days ago. However, regardless of one's feelings about this article, or the others, I think that at least some of this information should be <b>merged</b> elsewhere. The Gravity Gun, for example, is unique enough to deserve its own article even if this is deleted, and the information about Annabell merged to <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Grigori_c43e.html" title="Father Grigori">Father Grigori</a>. Maybe others, I don't know. Oh well, let's hope we don't have another cookie episode. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - If we break the article down into each of the elements that indivudally seem important, i bet that those article would all pop up for deletion. Maybye the article could use some slimming down, but as mentioned, it does appear that there is some content of value. The trick is sorting it out. To reitterate what <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> said, wikipedia is not run on precedence like law. It would appear that the halo argument is not helping the overall argument at hand, but instead opening the door for more arguments that will not help solve this issue. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 17:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I certainly agree that this article is a keeper, heck, I felt the same way about the Halo, BF, and other articles, but I could tell when I first saw them that it wouldn't be worth arguing about. That said, even if we did accept that this article as a whole isn't a keeper, I do think it is obvious there are keepable elements in there. (And note that section on the alyx gun is in the <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyx_Vance_fbdb.html" title="Alyx Vance">Alyx Vance</a> article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'd like to keep this article, along with all the other ones deleted from other games, but it doesn't fit in, as stated before. If it HAS to be deleted, perhaps we should incorporate into the main article? I believe there is a weapons list in the Halo article.--Satanator 18:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The weapons in Half-Life 2 are quite significant to the game, and are very notable in their own right. For example, the crowbar and gravity gun have become synonymous with the name Half-Life. The gravity gun, in particular, has received a lot of attention due to its uniqueness and its perceived "revolutionary" it has achieved in the genre. In terms of being the best weapon ever, it was voted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSdKF5Fd38" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSdKF5Fd38" rel="nofollow">number one</a> by <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameTrailers_fbde.html" title="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>. However, something like weapons and vehicles in Battlefield 2 are generic and hardly specific to the game itself. It's highly unlikely that someone would get Antlion pheropods and the Combine pulse rifle confused with another game. If the article needs to be cut down, the "Deleted weapons" section can be trimmed quite heavily. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 21:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Mostly original research, game guide and per arguments reasons put forth in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_weapons_in_Halo_2_0bee.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of weapons in Halo 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of weapons in Halo 2</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 21:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The information here is verifiable through the Half-Life 2 Official Prima Game Guide or Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar, both of which cover the game's weapons quite extensively. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 22:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> a game guide. This most clearly and obviously is a game guide that fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Plus there are OR issues. Crowbars are not "synonymous with the name Half-Life". They are synonymous with "metal tool for opening crates". Gravity gun can be mentioned (probably already is) in the main game article. This long list of pistols and grenades and rayguns and whatnot and how to find them in the game and use them effectively is not acceptable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The crowbar has indeed become quite synonymous with Half-Life in popular culture. This is even acknowledged in the article here on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowbar_%28tool%29.html" title="Crowbar (tool)">crowbars</a>. The gravity gun is only passively mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a> article. However, I'm positive that adding one big paragraph solely dedicated to the weapon will break the very fine balance of this article's current featured status. Hence, the reason why this article in question was created. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 22:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, wikipedia is not a game guide, but it is a game encylopedia, and this contributes quite nicely to that function. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:48, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'm not sure why the article on Halo 2's weapons was deleted. In fact, I'm not sure why video game articles are so frequently killed through AfD. The weapons in this game are notable on their own, and they deserve their own page on WP. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I think the article is a fairly useful and informative resource, though I will admit it has gotten quite bloated and contains a lot of unnecessary information. The article could definitely use some extensive scaling down and editing. If it should be deleted, then I suggest moving some of the more notable content to appropriate places, perhaps incorporate certain characters' trademark weapons into their respective pages (crowbar/gravity gun to Gordon, Alyxgun to Alyx, Annabelle to Grigori etc.). Combine weapons can be and already are incorporated into the Combine Combat Technology article, and a Rebel Combat Tech article may be a useful for categorizing the crossbow, dune buggy and airboat.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShabby_a2ea.html" title="User:Shabby">Shabby</a> 20:47, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This reads like a section from a game manual, not an encyclopedia entry. All barely relevant data is already included in the various Half Life related articles. This also seems to have a serious <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem on top of it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a game guide</a>. With absolutely no sourcing, there looks to be a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem, but Half-Life 2 is popular enough that there <i>might</i> be published reliable sources for significant portions of the page. But those sources probably would be game guides, making it very hard for this article to be anything but a game guide. 198.22.153.9 18:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> because I frequently looked at this article prior to buying Half-Life 2. I wanted to see whether the weapons remained loyal to the original and if there were and unique weapons like the egon from HL1. I also used it check whether I'd be playing half the game without a shotgun or if that gravity gun everyone was talking about was a end-of-game only weapon. This article really helped me decide whether or not to buy Half-Life 2 as opposed to something else. And you can't say that this article should be deleted because other articles were deleted. Maybe no one who had read the Halo 2 weapons article showed up to vote against its deletion. Maybe the Battlefield and Halo articles <i>shouldn't</i> have been deleted after all. I might make a case against, for example, Counter-Strike weapons, because you could make the case that articles for the real-world guns already exist. Since these weapons are all unique, information on them would be unavailable anywhere else. Plus, this is useful for anyone (like me) who like to see how much damage their weapons do so they can plan battles in advance, or want some extra information that they didn't know about their gun like the instant-kill for man-sized foe. For example, I thought that since the orbs did 100 damage and poison zombies have 150 health, that the former wouldn't kill the latter in 1 hit but the opposite is true. 68.44.212.188 22:16, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
