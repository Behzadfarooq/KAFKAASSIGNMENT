<p><b>Delete</b> Most (if not all) the articles for Home And Away are very short and the characters wouldn't pass the "google test" if they were real people, much less characters on this TV show. The vast majority's #1 hit is their respective WP article that has very little information. A concise page listing all the characters would be the best way to handle this on WP, if necessary at all. <a href="../../../d/b/c/User%7EDbchip_8c18.html" title="User:Dbchip">Dbchip</a> 16:06, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Article <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merger</a> does not involve deletion at any stage. If you want to merge articles, merge them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:42, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The merger document doesn't seem to cover a scenario where you're merging multiple pages into one and don't intend to keep the originating pages. For example, these articles don't have any inbound links besides eachother and aren't necessary to keep or redirect. <a href="../../../d/b/c/User%7EDbchip_8c18.html" title="User:Dbchip">Dbchip</a> 16:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's because such a scenario isn't permissible. If you want the text merged, the source articles may not be deleted. If you want the source articles deleted, you may not merge the text.

<li>I note that the original articles could have been turned into <i>redirects</i> and these merged into one big article with no need for AfD intervention.

<li>Lacking any history to preserve and unnecessary clutter of the namespace in my opinon. Still needs to be notable to warrant a redirect. <a href="../../../d/b/c/User%7EDbchip_8c18.html" title="User:Dbchip">Dbchip</a> 18:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd say we should hold off the deletion yet until someone with indepth knowledge of H&amp;A could come and merge the details either into the character section of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_and_Away_4142.html" title="Home and Away">Home and Away</a> or else their own article, say, Characters of Home and Away. I'd like to point out how <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> has done this. They have a families and other characters section on their page detailing current characters, with a separate article for past characters. I think H&amp;A should go along similar lines. Afterwards I think we should deleted what remains of the articles. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 19:24, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't know that the two are comparable or that the precedent of other shows changes the fact that most of these characters are not notable and have only a handful of google hits with the WP article being #1. <a href="../../../d/b/c/User%7EDbchip_8c18.html" title="User:Dbchip">Dbchip</a> 20:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Hunter_fc67.html" title="Beth Hunter">Beth Hunter</a> article is detailed and would be useful to someone wanting to know about the series.

<dd>I would also accept <b>Merge</b> in support of <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a>'s work. Either way works for me. As <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonbicot_fd59.html" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> writes below, this is information that is actively interesting to millions of people now (interesting enough for hundreds of them to make pages about it!) and will still be interesting to hundreds of people -- all over the world, not just in the neighborhood of one parking garage -- researching the show after it goes off the air. That's as much as you can say about any encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 15:08, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Potential for being useful isn't a metric for inclusion on WP.

You can find the article at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Home_and_Away_characters_9aa3.html" title="Current Home and Away characters">Current Home and Away characters</a>. You can see it is rather a rough effort and some characters would need to be expanded while others seriously cut back (we don't need details of every story every characters has been involved with). I also propose a second article, <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past_Home_and_Away_characters_0c30.html" title="Past Home and Away characters">Past Home and Away characters</a> to which this information is moved if/when a character leaves. I feel it is better to have all this in one article as it compares H&amp;a WITH EUALLY POPULAR SOAPS (LIKE neighbours) rather than comparing it with soaps which have much higher global viewing figures or are more widely known about (like Easterners and Coronation Street). It also provides an easily comparable source detailing info on all characters in one place, rather than having many different articles with very little info in each. If we want to keep thi article, we would need to make a link on the main article page, do some serious work on improving the content and I propose a box on the page detailing and ranking the episode and order characters first appeared (like in the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> article. My vote for these articles is then <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Home_and_Away_characters_9aa3.html" title="Current Home and Away characters">Current Home and Away characters</a>.<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 12:38, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> - H&amp;A is one of the most popular and succesful shows in Australian history and has a <b>HUGE</b> fan base and following outside AU. With much more viewers than stale old unimportant shows like Eastenders and Coronation street - two shows that not a single soul outside the UK cares about. The Idea of deletion is anopther example of the <b>UGLINESS of colinalism</b> and bigotry- one thinks only American characters from buffy should be allowd to saty and a british poster thinks someone actually cares about Eastenders and CS' who's number of viewers outside the UK (combined) is not even a quarter of the H&amp;A viewers.</p>
