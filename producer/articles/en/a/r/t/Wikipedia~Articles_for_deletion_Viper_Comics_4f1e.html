<p>There's no indication that this publisher is notable per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, i.e., that they are the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself, and reliable. I'm not speedy deleting this article outright per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> because, who knows, such sources may still turn up during this discussion. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>For one because they're 4 days old, and in development. Just consider that my reasoning for the strong keep&#160;;-) Viper Comics is a company that, among other, publishes webcomics. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 20:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> is also up for deletion. It is also a product of Viper Comics, not a source covering Viper Comics, and thus does not by itself provide notability. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Incorrect. <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> is itself not a product of Viper Comics; Viper only publishs it in print form, at the cartoonist's discretion. This <i>does</i> provide notability. Furthermore, Ugly Hill is only up for deletion because you personally nominated it; hardly unbiased on your part. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Forcide_edea.html" title="User:Master Forcide">Master Forcide</a> 02:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not a report, but a press release by Viper Comics themselves, as it says at the top. Press releases are not independent sources under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and its derivative guidelines. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I used to work at a Barnes and Noble and would constantly see their books on the shelves. Since their books are carried in major brick and mortar retail chains I wouldn't go around calling them some tiny, unnotable business that is run out of the owner's basement.--Stranger Dan 23:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your memory is not an independent reliable source as required for notability purposes. Whether or not retailers carry their books is also not relevant under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:33, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I certainly didn't imagine that their comics like <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780975419328&amp;itm=1" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780975419328&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">Daisy Kutter</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780977788323&amp;itm=1" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780977788323&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">Emily Edison</a>, and <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780977788309&amp;itm=1" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780977788309&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">Oddly Normal</a> are published and carried in major retailors. I've seen them in Waldenbooks too. So tell me what is it that makes them any less notable than a company like <a href="../../../i/d/w/IDW_Publishing_39c9.html" title="IDW Publishing">IDW Publishing</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Shelf_Productions_49d5.html" title="Top Shelf Productions">Top Shelf Productions</a>, or <a href="../../../o/n/i/Oni_Press_08fd.html" title="Oni Press">Oni Press</a>?--Stranger Dan 23:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I'm still trying to feel my way through this notability thing. It's a publisher, so not something that will be reviewed. I mean, take the company Dark Horse, I've read a lot of articles about Dark Horse's comics, but not many about Dark Horse itself. Most of what I read about Dark Horse came from them. So to me, if the comics a publsiher has are getting meantioned, with the publisher's name attached, then it's notable. For example, Viper Comics is mentioned in this article from Newsaramma, a well know comic site. <a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749" class="external free" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749" rel="nofollow">http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749</a> It got a mention in Best Surprise. Also, this publisher is particpating in the 2007 Free Comic Book Day <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp</a>. To me that is notable. Just because it's a small independent publisher, doesn't mean it is not notable. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediAutobot_53a9.html" title="User:JediAutobot">JediAutobot</a> 18:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Adding to above, I did find this review of the publisher from 2003 <a href="http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html</a> <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediAutobot_53a9.html" title="User:JediAutobot">JediAutobot</a> 18:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> The only reason anyone nominated this article for deletion is to make it easier to delete the Ugly Hill page.Lessthankate</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This habit of deleting anything related to webcomics is getting out of hand. Come on people, Viper Comics? What next, Penny Arcade? -- <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 22:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's Viper freakin' Comics! They publish many popular books! Just because they're independant doesn't make them "not notable." -- <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakerWiggin_50e3.html" title="User:SpeakerWiggin">S</a></li>
<li>Comment: it took me a while, but I was able finally to find several somewhat small coverages in one reliable source <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28magazine%29.html" title="Wizard (magazine)">Wizard (magazine)</a> and several more sizable coverages in more borderline-reliable sources online. On the other hand, tcj.com The Comics Journal seems to never once have mentioned Viper. The article itself contains information sourced from the vipercomics home page, rather than the sources - the sources say Viper first published in 2003, whether or not the company was "founded" in 2001. It seems to me to be teetering on the edge of notability. The article, however, makes no actual claims of notability. And I wasn't able to find enough reliable information that I felt confident in adding such myself. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelisse_a0f3.html" title="User:Felisse">Felisse</a> 07:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Just because a publishing company has decided to publish a few webcomics does not make them non-notable. It has <a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685366p1.html" class="external text" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685366p1.html" rel="nofollow">well reviewed</a> works, and the only way that the publisher of those works would not be notable is if none of it's works are notable. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord CyberSkull</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 23:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Viper Comics is notable, if only due to the fact that as an "independant" publisher, they compete successfully with mainstream comic publishers. I agree with Lessthankate - by being able to delete the publisher, it makes it easier to delete <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> too. Just like the ill advised deletion of the WCCA opened the floodgates to the current webcomic purge. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 12:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
