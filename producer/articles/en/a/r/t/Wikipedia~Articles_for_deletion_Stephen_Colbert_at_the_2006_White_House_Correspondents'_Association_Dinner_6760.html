<p>OK, now a few things to mention first. One: the editors who have put this page together have done a good job, and should be congratualted for it. It is nicely laid out, and well referenced. But please do not consider the quality of the article; at AFD we must consider whether or not the <i>subject</i> of the article is encyclopaedic with regards <i>only</i> to the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. Two: this is not a "bad faith nom"; I said I would do this when it was at WP:FAC because I want to see what other people think. I think this page is an important example of what is currently happening a lot on Wikipedia: short-term (often US-centric) phenomenon that get extensive pages, with almost all web-based sources, because they are recent and well-covered. However, I think we should resort to ten year test (I would prefer one hundred, but I am willing to be disagreed with). Will anyone remember - or want to remember - this event in ten years? It was a comedian, doing a comedy routine. That happens <i>all the time</i>. It is not anything special, not notable and in a few years no-one will care. Thus I urge a delete. This could act as a litmus for a whole lot of other pages, so please think hard, vote wisely (whichever way you vote), and let's have a nice, harmonious discussion. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 09:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Tricky one this. A well put argument from Batmanand which goes to the heart of what wikipedia is. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and from that definition this type of article doesn't fit, this is a news article and not a encyclopedia entry. However, perhaps part of the joy of wikipedia is that the articles can go beyond what is normal strict encyclopedia content, the impact of a slightly out-of-place article may be felt insignificant due to the format of wikipedia. But, then where do you draw the line? There have to be firm rules. So, after much consideration, I vote <b>delete</b>. This is an event which gives a good news story, but it is not an encyclopedic article. I know there are lots of other comparable topics on here that have not been deleted, but that is not an argument to keep this one. As Batmanand states, each article must be considered only against the deletion policy. Well done Batmanand, you've raised a good topic. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/c/o/User_talk%7EKcordina_5ecd.html" title="User talk:Kcordina">Talk</a></sup> 10:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I repect Batmanand's argument, but I think this is a well written and well referenced article on a verifiable and notable topic. It's a keeper -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 10:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or it should be merged to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Cobert_c9c1.html" title="Stephen Cobert">Stephen Cobert</a> page.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a WikiNews story, not an encyclopedia entry. It's a news event in one country out of over 200, and the precedent that articles like this set is difficult. I appreciate that Wikipedia is not paper, and can accomodate a near-infinite amount of information. However, at some point editors have to exercise <i>judgement and selectivity</i>. This raw mass of citations and data should have been placed within the Stephen Colbert article, and pruned down massively to take account of the ten year test. I agree with Batmanand where he says "It is not anything special, not notable and in a few years no-one will care." A record could still be kept, but on the Colbert pages (and maybe on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a> page, as a small footnote, and as an anecdote on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_53cf.html" title="White House Correspondents' Association">White House Correspondents Association Dinner</a> article).<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:50, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Normally I would vote merge but given the length and detail of this article I support spinning it off in to it's own article. As for Batmanand's argument, I agree that in future peeople will be less interested in it but I'm not sure that should be a reason to delete it. It is a notable subject now but in the future it won't cease to have <i>been</i> a notable event it will just cease <i>being</i> a notable event. Pretty much the same as any current event. <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 10:55, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete with applause</b>. Well put. For one thing, keeping articles like this for extended periods of time is US-centric bias, and should not be allowed to flourish unfettered. To be frank, from where I'm sitting, topical jokes based on individual heads of state are nowhere near worthy of inclusion.--<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgamemnon2_ee6b.html" title="User:Agamemnon2">Agamemnon2</a> 11:03, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> various reasons - obviously notable event, at very least in the context of the colbert report because that one event shot up, at least initially, its ratings by 30%.

<li><b>Delete</b> I do not think that this performance will be very notable in a few months. Once the "OMG DID YOU SEE THAT?!" factor dies out in a bit, it will be memorable each correpondents' dinner as a litimus test: "Oh, he was funny, but not on the Colbert scale." It's just like the opening monologue of the Oscars or something, we don't have individual articles on each performance by an Oscars host, just mentions of it in their own articles. See <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Rock_9c5d.html" title="Chris Rock">Chris Rock</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Stewart_101d.html" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 12:05, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The nub of the argument in favour of deletion is that, in the future, it will be non-notable. Clearly, the article on <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_53cf.html" title="White House Correspondents' Association">White House Correspondents' Associations</a> contradicts this. If the event will be non-notable ten years after the event, why is it that the article notes that Al Fraken presented it ten years ago? Why, indeed, does it have more than just a name for Bill Clinton's bit in 2000 or Richard Nixon's in 1969? Surely, if it is non-notable, nobody would remember. That editors do remember (or have evidence of it) proves that it <i>is</i> notable, and will remain so into the future. Why it has a long article is quite another matter, but an article it must definitely should have. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that the <i>fact</i> that Stephen Colbert was the speaker at this particular occasion is notable. The question is: why does <i>this particular</i> appearance deserve a separate article, instead of the usual few lines at <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_53cf.html" title="White House Correspondents' Association">White House Correspondents' Association</a>, and a mention in his own article? Your examples, on this basis, surely only support my argument? <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 12:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My comparison to Nixon/Clinton/Franken was not a necessary condition of it deserving an article. However, you asked the question, "Will anyone remember - or want to remember - this event in ten years?" Perhaps people won't remember - or want to remember - the ratings boost to the Colbert Report or to its Google ranking, but they will want to remember that he did the gig, and the approximate content of it. Hence, in my opinion, it fits the notability criterion. As long as the WHCA holds a dinner and invites comedians to perform, people will want to remember Stephen Colbert's performance. Perhaps that's because (as an inclusionist), I believe that each and every WHCAD performance should have an article (if it has enough information), or maybe it's because Colbert's was one of the most notable in the history of the event. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Great, so Al Franken hosted this dinner ten years ago. That's a factoid deserving of about as many words as I just used. Deciding that this particular comic's routine at some minor event is worthy of a full scale article? That's like writing an article based around Nixon's post-Watergate resignation speech -- something which surely has an order of magnitude more historical significance -- for which I'm sure I could dredge up five hundred contemporary quotes parsing every particular, and which surely is remembered. (No such article exists, needless to say.) Great, so the blogosphere went mental in the forty-eight hours after the act, but the only difference between Colbert's gig and Jay Leno is that the President was present and Leno does it every night. The nom is exactly right; this is pop culture ephemera no one will remember six months from now. I like the "ten year" rule myself. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:52, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Even now, I had to go and read the article to remind myself what this was about. In 6 months I am sure noone will remember at all. This does not deserve its own article. Should either be merged to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, or a general article about the White House Correspondent's dinner. If it cannot be merged, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrjeff_93a8.html" title="User:Mrjeff">Mrjeff</a> 13:03, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge or delete</b> per Mrjeff. Humourous political commentary happens frequently; while this may have been a good sample (and acknowleding the effort the editor/s have put into writing the article), I don't see what makes it <i>so</i> notable beyond that of other similar events as to warrant its own entry in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 14:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I don't buy this whole "US-centric bias" argument. If it's notable in the U.S., it's notable period, regardless of what the rest of the world thinks. This is a demonstrably notable and highly-publicized event, and articles like these are precisely what make Wikipedia great. If you were to hear about this event, where else would you go to get such an in-depth description of it other than Wikipedia? <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 14:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is something that is notable in any other country thus automatically notable?

<dd>That is not what I said. I said that, unless one considers all events that are notable in any country to be automatically notable enough for Wikipedia (to which I suppose I should perhaps ad the caveat that the country has to be of a sufficient size to make it notable to lots of people - say a country of more than ten million people or something like that), then one is automatically being US-centric. I am <i>not</i> some sort of US-phobe. I am simply saying that it is clear double standards to give the US a lower burden of "notability" proof. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 08:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very interesting discussion from my point of view, and I can understand both sides to a certain extent. Personally, I believe that the core question (as it has been pointed out) restated is: <i>will be this speech important in the course of the history?</i>. Well, in my opinion, we can't possibly know at the moment. In order to answer to this question we should look back on it in the <i>far</i> future, we don't have now enough context to judge the historical impact of the speech. However, we can say it has been a remarkable event at the moment and, given the quality of the article is relatively high, why don't we leave it and let the future contributors (with enough context) judge the importance of it?. <a href="../../../p/a/f/User%7EPafmon_8f73.html" title="User:Pafmon">Pafmon</a> 17:31, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> - This is the very definition of an invented news story. Remember when Jon Stewart delivered that blistering attack on Crossfire last year? Me neither. That's why it only merits a section on the Jon Stewart article. Just as this only deserves a section in the Colbert article. This story gained traction because the blogging community (a lot of whom happen to be in Colbert's target demographic) made a stink over it. The increase in ratings his show got is nice, but I would remind people that if his show aired on a non-cable network its low ratings would've led to it being cancelled a long time ago. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> 20:30, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

I think that the dinner as an event is notable, given the tradition of Presidents attending and the usual element of satirical presentations.

<dd>Two things. Firstly, in answer to the point made by Kizzle, we delete things all the time as non-notable, even though there is no policy on notability.

To Brian.fsm, I quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "News reports.

Please explain to me how this is an event of historical significance. If not, then by your own terms you should surely vote to delete. Oh, and as for this idea that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> has no bearing on deletion, that is plainly absurd.

<dd>Justifying deletion because "we delete things all the time as non-notable" is a fallacy; just because it happens doesn't mean it's right. If you want to delete a page, <i>it is incumbant on you to provide why this page fits criteria within the deletion policy</i>, not your subjective implications based upon things that aren't policy. I re-assert my stance that you are misusing policy by not providing the specific criteria within the deletion policy that this applies to (and no, it's not a "breaking news story"). Finally, for those people who say that comedic routines like this happen all the time, you're entirely missing the point. How many of those examples given on this page, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and other stand-up comedians, say such commentary with the president sitting 10 feet away? This is why its notable, not because it's just another comedic routine, but that it was right in front of the president. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 22:51, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, you have misrepresented what I said. You seemed to be saying that, because we do not currently have a policy on notability, I should not be using notability as an argument for the deletion of this page. I said that that is patently ridiculous, because a) it <i>does</i> say in <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> that "They [participants in the deletion process] should bear in mind <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>"; and that in WP:NOT, the guidelines on news stories say that only ones on events of historical significance should be kept; and b) that if we never deleted anything on the basis of notability, at least half of all deletions would not happen. I am unsure how familiar you are with AfD, so I will assume you are unfamiliar, because if you look at any random day, the number of "Delete, nn"-type comments is enormous. Unless you believe that they are all invalid - in which case I fear you will find yourself in a very small minority - then you surely have to accept that the <i>principle</i> of notability is central to AfD, even if the <i>policy</i> is not yet fully formed. Then this argument becomes about whether or not this event is notable enough, which is an argument I am more than willing to have. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 08:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Arguing whether this page should be kept based upon other pages, whether its all the random pages such as television episodes that get kept or the pages that get deleted because of notability, is a bad argument. You're correct in saying that I'm not familliar with AfD, but I <i>am</i> familliar with <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, and so far you haven't shown this page to fit any criteria within that policy. One cannot gauge historical significance from an event only 3 weeks ago, and just because you seem to think the event is trivial, the sheer amount of keeps on this page seem to imply this event has a little bit more significance than you'd like to believe. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 16:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Batmanand -- above, in response to my comment, you argue that every tropical storm in the Atlantic and every episode of the Simpsons is notable because it's related to something notable. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year.<sup id="_ref-time-100_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time-100" title="">[2]</a></sup> Surely, the biggest speech of his career is also notable. -- Brian.fsm 21:00, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is a big difference between hurricanes and a speech. Hurricanes are individual, unique, touch millions of people in many countries. The Atlantic Hurricane season, under any conception of notability, is a keeper. An individual member of it deserves its own article because each event in the whole season also has substantial long-term effects. Each speech that a comedian makes does not have this effect. Again, I beg the question: should everyone that Time magazine rates as the 100 most influential people of the year (who obviously all deserve articles) have every detail that can be acquired about them be added? Of course not. There is some material that is not needed or wanted on Wikipedia. The colour of George W Bush's underwear is one of them. A minor speech by a comedian, that is effectively one of many that happen every day, that will be forgotten in a few weeks, is another. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 21:16, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It's significant, notable, and encyclopedic. The references have already been made.

Removing an actual event that affects politics and news, and puts people like Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame in the same room with the current president that is presently trying to reconstruct the CIA and the power of the president is more than just a news headline, much less one that for sports "writers" to jabber about for a week or 2 because someone might win a championship of uselessness.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> Well-made, but belongs on Wikinews. An encyclopedia article on one performance by one comedian? <i>Come on.</i> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 16:56, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well-researched, in-depth article depicting a notable event, for not only the performance itself, but the reaction illustrating the U.S. political climate and the accusations of self-censorship against the U.S. print media, as well as the internet phenomenon it became. It is also well used in the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> article to illustrate <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html#Roman_irony" title="Irony">Roman irony</a> in a modern context. A merge into the 'Stephen Colbert' article would simply force the article to split due to size.</li>

<dd>Furthermore, I argue against the apparent belief that something is 'US-centric' simply because it documents an event within the U.S., and believe that simply attempting to deny notable events in the U.S. because other countries do not feature comparable coverage, and to test notability by the number of people who know about it, is fallacious. One must remember that conditions besides just population affect internet coverage of a country, such as the sizes and types of groups with internet access. If more coverage of events in countries besides the U.S. is wanted, then more people with knowledge of such events should contribute. I am well aware of the technical constraints of inclusionist policy, but these must be balanced against the informational constraints of deletionism. -- <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> 22:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>US-centricism works two ways. Of course, the US has more coverage than most countries simply because (in percentage terms and in also in raw numbers) the US has more people with internet access, and as such more Wikipedians (it helps that the Government doesn't block or censor the site either...). But if the criteria that we compare things against for notability are lower - either explicitly or implicity - for the US than for other countries, then we are compounding the problem. IMO we fail this second part of the test; although it appears that I do not share the consensus view. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 22:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seeing as its pretty clear what the concensus is, can we close it to get the deletion message off of the article page? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:31, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
