<li><b>Keep</b>. It's an important entry of reference that people not convinced of the Wiki idea (especially thos used to traditional encyclopedia usage) can be pointed to. martin 8 December 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Should be an independent subject.. KrisR 4 December 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's too large to fit nicely within the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 02:46, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is a very valuable resource, and a fascinating social experiement, but many, if not most of these points are right-on. The only argument I could see for not keeping this is that it is POV, but that would be somewhat disingenuous. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 03:06, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Does anyone have an actual <i>reason</i> to delete or merge this?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has become a case study in all kinds of debates about knowledge and democracy. This page documents some of that. (Comment: If this was intended as just another VfD/AfD I think you'd be right. I guess this is intended to settle the keep vs. merge question... but I agree, it feels like this has been done and done.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 03:32, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem is that we need to determine whether enough people believe it should be merged or not. That's the main reason for this AfD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's an important subject, as much as any other current event. --QubitOtaku 10:40, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. I don't understand why it's up for AFD again seeing as it's been kept the previous times. Wikipedia has to include the bad with the good and while I disagree with Agamemnon2's statement about "eventual undoing" I think it's articles like this that make Wikipedia worthwhile. I don't recall seeing an article in Britannica devoted to people who don't like it. Just as long as this article retains NPOV, I'm all for it, even if I don't always agree with it. In fact, deleting this article would play into the hands of some of the critics who accuse Wikipedia of censoring any criticism about it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To be objective and unbiased, me do need some critics. However, the article could needs some edit, because i think it is slightly POV</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is highly notable these days, and thus fair game for criticism; it also shouldn't put itself in the position of appearing to censor its critics. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 17:48, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Too big to merge, and the last thing anyone would want to do is justify the complaining of people like <a href="http://wikipediareview.proboards78.com/index.cgi?board=general" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.proboards78.com/index.cgi?board=general" rel="nofollow">these</a>.

<li>I agree with karmafist. I tried to ask them for some constructive criticism, but they have none. Apparently I was "trolling" using the power of my "hive mind" (and other such personal attacks). With critics like that, we're actually in a pretty good position (they just look - and they are! - unreasonable). For instance, they criticise us for being in the top 10 of clusty.com (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>'s recommended search engine) - surely they should be criticising the search engine and not us? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 21:12, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though when I say "as is", I don't mean the article as it is at this instant.

<li>Um. Are you suggesting that our <i>only</i> real reason for wanting to keep the article as-is is to stave off being criticized by criticizing ourselves first, and that it's only by being (at least to some extent) illogical and irrational, only by treating this article preferentially and being biased enough to deal differently with this article than we would with any other article, that we can possibly argue for this article's existence? That's nonsense, I'd argue the same for any Criticism article about a major subject that has had a large number of significant criticisms. We already <i>have</i> a page called <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticisms_f20b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticisms">Wikipedia:Criticisms</a>, which is a page for the purpose of Wikipedia editors to read over, discuss, and try to address relevant critiques of Wikipedia. The purpose of <i>this</i> article, on the other hand, is for our <i>readers</i>. Many people will no doubt be interested and fascinated to see some of the main criticisms of Wikipedia (and the significant responses)—all the more so, yes, because the page happens to be <i>on</i> Wikipedia, but even if it wasn't, the topic's significant enough that we shouldn't attack such a well-written article. We should do the same thing we do with any other article: try to improve it, fix its biases, bring it up to shape. Endless VfDs don't improve the article, they just lead to us spending more time arguing back and forth, back and forth, then actually working on the article itself (which is, in fact, the case with this article, from what I can see). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sick of seeing this thing, frankly. I disagree with this and all other pages titled <b>Criticism of X</b>; I would much rather like to see <b>Evaluations of X</b> or perhaps <b>Critical evaluations of X</b>. Doesn't anybody wonder why we don't have <b>Praise of X</b> or <b>Positive opinions on X</b> articles? Articles like these are ways to exile negative POVs to places where they can do less damage. That has some value, but it's still a poor compromise of our NPOV policy. Opposing viewpoints should be integrated, not separated. These articles attract huge amounts of unverifiable statements and irrelevant fluff as a result of their unquestioning titles.<br />
That said, I suppose this is just an issue of practicality that is not going to resolve any time soon. Until and if I can finally find the strength to rewrite this thing into <b>Evaluations of Wikipedia</b> and hope it's so great that nobody wants to undo it, I'll leave it alone. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 12:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With a dictionary in hand, you may be perfectly correct. Looking at the content of these pages, though, it's clear that most editors do not in fact have a dictionary in hand when editing. "Criticism" is a strongly negative term, regardless of what it can mean or ought to mean in a scholarly context. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:26, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The distinction doesn't run exactly like that, please stuff the scholarly context back in the <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_tower.html" title="Ivory tower">closet</a>. "Criticism" and "critic" can be quite neutral, and with words like "bible", "literary", "movie", "theatre", or such in front of them, they are. "Literary criticism" is book reviewing, and "biblical criticism" is about analyzing the bible, not about pointing out weaknesses in it. But "Criticism <b>of</b> X" is negative regardless of context. "Criticism of the bible" <i>would</i> mean pointing out perceived weaknesses in the bible. Therefore, assuming nobody would want to coin a horror like "Wikipedian criticism", a neutral article would indeed need to be called something like "Critical evaluations of Wikipedia". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>AFD is not the place for solving the problem with this article, since doing so doesn't involve <i>deletion</i> at all.

<p><a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> is exactly right. "Criticism of X" pages are inherently non-neutral, since they only present one side of a debate, contrary to our policy. They are a short route to perennial and unresolvable neutrality disputes. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">Criticism of Mormonism</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_communism.html" title="Criticisms of communism">Criticisms of communism</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hinduism_fedc.html" title="Criticism of Hinduism">Criticism of Hinduism</a> <i>all</i> sport neutrality disputes, <i>all</i> because either the scope of the article implies that the only discussion of the subject that exists is negative or the scope of the article inherently advocates the negative point of view. As I wrote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_Bigfoot_dce6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot</a>, the way to resolve this problem is to have a single article that encompasses the <i>entire</i> debate, but this is not a matter for AFD, since <i>deletion</i> is not required in order to achieve this.

<dd>I agree with that last remark. Which is why I in fact have done this once already. Neither the talk page nor an RFC had any effect, and I strongly suspect nothing short of actually <i>going ahead with the rewrite</i> will. But that's only going to stick if you produce a brilliant article from the start, since otherwise people are going to say you're "acting unilaterally" and "against consensus", which in this case just means you're violating the status quo, and people don't like that. It's pretty hopeless, really. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that "criticism of..." pages are inherently non-neutral. The way to make them neutral, obviously, is to list all the noteworthy criticisms (citing them all), and then to list noteworthy <i>rebuttals</i> to all of those criticisms where they exist (citing them all), and counter-rebuttals if <i>those</i> are noteworthy, etc. "Criticism of..." articles aren't just a place <i>for</i> criticism, they're a place <i>about</i> criticism—the history of criticism of communism, for example, or Christianity, would belong in those articles, not <i>just</i> the criticism itself. The fact that an article is too POVed currently does not mean that the topic is <i>inherently</i> POVed. In this case, all it means is that it's unusually <i>difficult</i> to get the article NPOV—though far from impossible, since many of the "Criticism of..." articles (including this one) <i>don't</i> have NPOV stickers on them. Separating Criticism into its own article is only a "POV fork" if (1) no criticism is mentioned as well on the article's main page, even where appropriate, and (2) no responses to criticism are allowed on the criticism page. Those two requirements may not be satisfied quite yet for some of the pages, but they certainly can be in the future. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:15, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's a nice idea in theory (and I do not believe in "inherently non-neutral" articles either), but the point-counterpoint style is not a very good instance of NPOV either. I am not convinced that criticism of any topic (as opposed to critical evaluations, which is not quite the same thing) should be separated, when endorsement, encouragement or neutral reactions never get split off. In most cases the criticism of a topic is not interesting <i>in and of itself</i>, but in context of the topic. The present structure encourages articles of the form "<b>Topic</b>. X, Y and Z. Oh, but <b>Criticism of Topic</b>." "<b>Criticism of Topic</b>. X is bogus, Y is bogus, Z is bogus." It should be "<b>Topic</b>. X, but maybe X is bogus. Y, but maybe Y is bogus. Z, but maybe Z is bogus." The individual parts can get separate articles again, but it should be <i>unusual</i> and <i>undesirable</i> for (unqualified) criticism to be a topic in and of itself. It makes things unnecessarily hard and obscures the broad picture. It's an easy way to split up an article, but I'd argue it's a suboptimal one. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 19:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A number of the articles caught up in previous edit wars -- especially religious articles -- seemed to settle down after a "Criticism of..." section was created. (Examples: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>.) The reasoning here seemed to satisfy both the proponents and opponents of the "critics" of these groups. Those who wanted to place negative information about the groups were generally content that they were able to keep their information and links in the spotlight, with prominent links to their article on the main page; meanwhile, supporters of the groups in question were largely free to add their own information to the main page while letting the critics have their say in the "criticism" article. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 13:08, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't dispute that this will help stop edit wars for controversial topics. It is a compromise, a truce of sorts, a way to prevent you from having to face the harsh and complex demands of NPOV. Splitting up an article in an unbiased/pro part and a contra part is <i>not</i> neutral. Our job is <i>not</i> to keep editors con\tent, but to provide an integral story to our readers. Basically, NPOV is hard, tough noogies. Why not <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_George_W._Bush_9d5e.html" title="Criticism of George W. Bush">Criticism of George W. Bush</a>? Sure would cool some edit wars. No. That's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>'s modus operandi, not ours. By doing this we give up, saying "maybe NPOV is just impossible/not worth it".</dd>
<dd>And besides—we're talking <i>Wikipedia</i> here, not religion. Do we really think Wikipedia editors will be unable to exercise restraint when faced with criticism of "their" encyclopedia?
