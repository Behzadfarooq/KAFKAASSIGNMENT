<p>Article contains <b>no</b> factual arguments, rather is literally full of selective quotes. Cited single POV arguments are based on the biased and innacurate assumption that Fascists had their own economic ideology distinct from both "capitalism" and "socialism and communism." This assumption is used like a straw man to attack the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> and government intervention as "fascist." Article does not address correlations between Fascist economic policies, it is simply a tool for ideological smearing. In the interest of accuracy and NPOV, Economics of Fascism needs to be deleted.--<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESansvoix_3bd6.html" title="User:Sansvoix">sansvoix</a> 20:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia definitely needs an article on the economic policies that existed in fascism (an article distinct from generalized <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>). The article is well sourced and NPOV. The article doesn't assert anything, but presents sourced assertions. Note that even the father of fascism, Mussolini, said that the economic system was distinct from capitalism and communism. The New Deal section must be in there because it's a notable view; it's been attacked since its inception as being modeled on fascist economics (if it seems like a large section, it's only because the rest of the article still awaits further development). I think the article, now in its infancy, has a great future. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:01, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. The term has rarely been used as anything other than a slur, and there is no agreement whatsoever between different authors on the proper definition of "economic fascism". The economic aspects of fascism can be discussed over in the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> article. The various assertions regarding "economic fascism" by different authors can be discussed in the articles dealing with those authors and their respective ideologies (since the term has almost always been used as an ideological stick with which to beat one's enemies). -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos (f.k.a.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: What "term"? "Economics of fascism"? That's a slur? Nonsense. That's just a generic phrase.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Yes there is. Since fascism refers to a specific kind of political regime, an article on the "economics of fascism" makes as much sense as articles on the <b>economics of monarchy</b>, <b>economics of republics</b> or <b>economics of federal states</b>. Given the vague nature of the term "fascism", I might even add economics of countries whose names end in -ia. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos (f.k.a.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It's only widespread because of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_stigma.html" title="Social stigma">stigma</a> associated with the word "fascism".

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I do not believe there is such a thing as "fascism" (in the sense of a distinct political or economic system, or even a coherent ideology). Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany did not have a unique political or economic system - they were just your average nationalist dictatorships. The fact that Hitler happened to kill more people than your average dictator doesn't change anything. And fascist ideology was never clear and coherent, not even to the fascists themselves. But this is off-topic... The point is not what <b>I</b> think, the point is what the majority of people think and the stigma they associate with fascism. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos (f.k.a.

<li><b>Keep subject to cleanup</b>. There is scope for useful discussion on Wikipedia of the nature of economics under fascism. This doesn't necessarily need a separate article from <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a> but it may be helpful. However, in its current form the article isn't terribly helpful as a discussion of the topic. There's some confusion with the previous name of this article, "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>", which appears to be a term and theory of the relationship between fascism and economics specific to certain theorists. Presented as such, properly sourced, this is not a problem - the difficulty is if this theory dominates the article. One solution would be to give it a separate article (<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>), which could be devoted to describing that theory and its development. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 01:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:I think you're misguided on that. "Economic fascism" is just another way of saying "fascist economics." You see a few libertarians using the term "economic fascism" in their articles and it's throwing you off (note that socialists also use the term). It's a commnon phrasing, as in "economic individualism," "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_nationalism.html" title="Economic nationalism">economic nationalism</a>," and a term that is not used much anymore "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22economic+socialism%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22economic+socialism%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">economic socialism</a>." There is no need for a seperate article. Everyone is talking about the same thing ...the economic practices in fascism. Also, it certainly does need a seperate article from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporativism.html" title="Corporativism">corporativism</a>, as there is more to the economics of fascism than corporativism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot agree that <i>"Economic fascism" is just another way of saying "fascist economics."</i>. Look at the people who mostly use the former term: it's primarily designed to allow "fascism" to be used to describe economic policy in democratic states, by driving a notional wedge between fascism and the political sphere (which contradicts the essence of fascism, which is political). There's also the linguistic issue: economic fascism is no more the same as fascist economics than lemon coke is the same as a coke lemon. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The topic is definitely notable, and the article is well-written and well-sourced. It's true that it's a subtopic of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, but it's a common, accepted practice to give lengthy discussions of subtopics their own articles, and I think there's enough material here to justify it being in a separate article. However, I do think it needs to address more of the "other side" that argues the New Deal is distinct from fascism. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, the article doesn't even tell you why the New Deal is "fascist!"
