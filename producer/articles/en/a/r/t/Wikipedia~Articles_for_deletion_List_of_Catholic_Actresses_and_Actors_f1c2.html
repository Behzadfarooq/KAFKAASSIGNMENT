<p>No more notable than List of Catholic Criminals, which is already up for VfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is just a rehash of the debate just finished. We had a VfD for the comprehensive list of Catholics: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Roman_Catholics_c703.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics">Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics</a>. The article was kept, but many wanted to break it up into smaller articles. This article was a section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a>, and was recently split off into a separate article, as were many other sections. If it gets deleted it will just be returned as a section of the original article. We might as well keep the smaller lists, but in the greater scheme of things, it doesn't matter, the information will end up somewhere. We are just going over the same tired old ground here. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 06:20, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Slightly more NPOV than List of Catholic Criminals, but still a list that is non-encyclopedic and would take forever to compile all actors and actresses who are Catholic (that list is big, but by no means is it complete, I'm sure.) <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 16:22, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not even close to completion, it would be impossible, there are alot of Catholics, and alot of actors and actresses. In countries like France and Italy, almost everyone is Catholic, so in theory over 90 percent of their actors and actresses should be on this list, 25 percent of American actors and actresses, and many from the many other largely Catholic places in the world. It might be different if Catholisism was a small unpopular religion; it isn't. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUber_nemo_c380.html" title="User:Uber nemo"><font color="black">→ubεr nεmo</font><font color="#3399FF">→</font></a> <a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUber_nemo_e4f4.html" title="User talk:Uber nemo"><sup><font color="#EEEEEE">lóquï</font></sup></a> 16:37, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We may need to set some guidelines on the validity of lists of people existing on Wikipedia, because it appears that some just don't like them, period. In addition to all the actor-related lists you listed, there are dozens of Catholic lists, Jewish lists, Muslim lists, and on and on. Should we VfD each in turn? It seems to be the trend. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 17:18, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have wanted to say, “delete” for the past few days, but I have changed my mind. I wanted to see the value of such a list. What value could it have?
<ul>
<li><i><b>VALUE</b></i>: Let's say you are an 11-year-old school child and wanted to write a paper for class of prominent Catholic entertainers, or are a reporter for the Bumpkintown News and wanted to write an article about prominent Jewish physicists. You might want to include a list, and/or work off of one to create your assignment.</li>
<li><i><b>MORE VALUE</b></i>: I would like to see the list have even more value by placing more information into the list. Instead of just a list of names, it would be move valuable if it contained useful information. I would like to see notes added in parentheses after a name entry: “(practicing)”; “(born into Catholic family)”; “(served as alter boy)”; “(converted at age 69)”; “(non-practicing)”; etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for the list becoming long: that is for the people who contribute to it regularly to worry about. They can start filtering by prominence later, as they see fit. You don’t need every Sean, Carlos, and Mario on the list, if the list gets to big, you can make it prominent actors.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> we can have infinite lists of 'people who are in category X, who are also in category Y' (e.g. 'List of blue-eyes sportsmen<i>). Unless the two categories are likely to impinge on each other (e.g. 'Catholic philosophers', 'Afro-American politicians') or we are dealing with a minority cross-sections, which have otherwise become notable in debates (e.g. 'List of American actors who were professing communists'), I would always say delete --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:45, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> To Doc's point, I think we can legitimately establish that a list identifying some remarkable condition (i.e. being from Quebec) warrants a presence, if only to satisfy the lust of listmongers. In this case, however, Catholic seems too universal a category to be of much interest or value. Also, on a different note, isn't 'actor' now gender neutral? <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 18:11, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It's kinda bizarre one has to resort to quoting himself, but, as Ned Kelly had said: "Such is life.". So:</li>
<li>1.Having read the "delete answers", I've come to a unanimous (hehheh..) conclusion: the list <b>must be kept</b>. Arguments for deletion go something like this: <i>yeah, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html" title="List of Buddhists">List of Buddhists</a>, .., too.</i>. It won't happen. These list will not be deleted. So- <b>either all or not a single one</b>. Since the former option is out of question- the RCC list must stay (albet radically modified in not a few features). Since I was the one who has been, initially, the most suspicious about the RCC list, I can ask with some authority: why is this list here at all&#160;? <b>Not accompanied by other fellow lists</b>&#160;?

<li><b>Comment</b> - List could be relevant if it would include actors and actresses whose career is closely linked to their catholicism, that is, who have played prominent roles in movies or plays with strongly catholic themes or who are outspoken catholics.

<li><b>Keep.</b> (AGAIN-AS I ALREADY VOTED, BUT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING)-Skysmith--do you mean fanatics like Mel Gibson; trampy hypocrites like Loretta Young and Grace Kelly; IRA supporters like Morrissey, Mickey Rourke, Eddie Dowling; nuns like Dolores Hart (and formerly June Haver); Peter Boyle, a former Irish Christian Brother; horrible/sadistic/reactionary folks like Bing Crosby, Arthur Godfrey, Pat O'Brien; converts like Jane Wyman, the Barrymores (child converts), Sir Alec Guinness; et al--the list is fascinating and should be kept. Why is Zoe allowed to reopen a previously closed subject, particularly AFTER some of us have spent a lot of time, energy and money to update (the list was already in existence before I ever edited, added or deleted anything) this list. Yes, in theory, it could go on forever, but nobody is going to put down unknown, minor or cameo actors from predominantly Catholic foreign countries, and if someone were stupid enough to do that, those entries could be culled from the list by any editor or member of the Wikipedia community paying attention, as someone always is, as I have learned. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.100.55.13.html" title="User:67.100.55.13">67.100.55.13</a> 18:11, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>First, I think this comment is at least bit out of line. Second, most of those people are not famous for their religion but for their other endeavors. Based on this comment, you plan to fill the list with inappropriate POV commentary about them and that would constitute vandalism. Third, WP has large number of articles about "foreign" people (IP comes from California so I presume that you refer to non-Americans) - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 19:45, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think on a page like this POV is not only OK, but essential to the decision of whether or not to keep the list, on which I have spent a lot of time and money and thus have an investment. I don't think I was out of line, but I apologize to anyone who was offended. I used the above examples as examples of how interesting the list can be with surprises and personal details and yes, exposing the hypocrisies and false images of people in the public eye who may not be what they pretend to be, and the Catholic church is a great place to start--it lends itself more to that aspect than say, Methodism or Presbyterianism--given its history of censorship and condemnation. And I don't plan to include POV about them, as it would most likely be removed anyway and would get me blocked, but I think given the subject matter some POV is inevitable, as opposed to other areas (science, technology, mathematics, geography, astronomy, etc.) where POV is wholly unnecessary and should be punished.</p>

<dd>Again- the discussion on the validity of this list is completely out of touch with reality. We got actors who are Lutherans, born-again Christians,..(they're incorporated in denominations' lists, for instance: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lutherans_0d51.html" title="List of Lutherans">List_of_Lutherans</a>, List_of_born-again_Christian_laypeople,<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latter-day_Saints_df82.html#Actors" title="List of Latter-day Saints">List_of_Latter-day_Saints#Actors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html#Celebrity_Buddhists" title="List of Buddhists">List_of_Buddhists#Celebrity_Buddhists</a>,...). This is a list of people who are nominally Catholics (as is the case with Lutherans or Mormons/LDS people). As I see it, we got here double standards. Catholics should not be discriminated against in such harmless fun stuff as lists just because they are majority, numerically strong minority or what not. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 18:26, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Skysmith - Who is committing the "intended surreptitious advocacy, and what does it mean?? Am I the screw up again?? Or are you referring to Mir Haven?? Why is it OK to have lists of Lutherans, Mormons, Jews, Buddhists, Christian laypeople, et al and NOT Catholics?? I think Mir Haven destroyed his own talking points with illogic. WikiDon and NoSeptember, who seem to be the "leaders of the pack" (if you will) have it right. And again, why was Zoe pemitted to reopen this debate which was fairly settled and finalized--isn't that kind of sabotage and willful disregard for the norms of the debate and a respectful acceptance of the will of the majority (why usually goes AGAINST me, by the way) a violation of Wikipedia Netiquette?? If Zoe is an editor then she should be penalized for causing this kind of dissension and turmoil. By the way, Skysmith, why would I care what religion you are?? I am Jewish if you want to know. I look forward to everyone's responses, once again, in this infernal, endless, pointless waste of time, debate, which as far as I am concerned was already settled once. Are Zoe and her allies just looking to keep counting the ballots again and again (shades of Florida 2000) until the count goes her way??

<li>To put it simply, POV is <i>not</i> okay. Your comments referred to strong opinions of some famous people and unfortunately number or others have tried to insert their POV into various articles in the past. Also, I am not referring to <i>my</i> sect here since I am not catholic. Also note that I have mostly commented, having <b>no vote</b> but I think that someone's religion is relevant only if they are famous for it (in this case, Mel Gibson <i>would</i> fit the bill). As for your choice of rhetoric, calm down. - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 19:26, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm personaly not too bothered which way this debate goes - but, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and stop trolling --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:56, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>POV is unavoidable, we are humans not machines. Again, what is "intended surreptitious advocacy" (you spelled "surreptitious" wrong, by the way, Skysmith)?? What is "trolling"?? Why was Zoe allowed to reopen this debate and threaten all the time, money, work, effort that I have spent on this project, which for whatever reason, it doesn't matter why, is interesting and is something I look forward to. I also contibute to the Jewish show business figures page, but admittedly, not as much. NoSeptember promised that the lists would remain, albeit configured differently. Regrettably I cannot "assume good faith", Doc glasgow. <a href="../../../r/m/s/User%7ERms125a%40hotmail.com_3ce9.html" title="User:Rms125a@hotmail.com">Rms125a@hotmail.com</a> 00:06, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
