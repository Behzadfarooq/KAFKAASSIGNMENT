Last I heard Wikipedia was <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>. No grounds given for deletion of a referenced article.

What part of this article do you consider to be religious propaganda, and if so why not correct the article? <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">08-25</a> 10:27Z</small></i></span></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. They're conspiracy theories, but they're <i>notable</i> conspiracy theories. The article needs significant revision, of course, as "Censorship" is a different topic and this article has far too little detail on the actual process of secularization. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 14:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Powers. It was the religion-related <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause_celebre.html" title="Cause celebre">cause celebre</a> last winter and received signifcant media coverage. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 22:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Nomination amounts to a claim that the article does not have a NPOV. The article does have a NPOV tag on it at present. If we look at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecularization_of_Christmas_bb85.html#Highly_Questionable_NPOV" title="Talk:Secularization of Christmas">Talk:Secularization of Christmas#Highly Questionable NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecularization_of_Christmas_bb85.html#POV" title="Talk:Secularization of Christmas">Talk:Secularization of Christmas#POV</a>, the former is more properly a citation/reference issue and the latter is to my eyes a legitimate decision based on the time horizon. Even if there were current major POV issues, having a POV issue is not a reason for deletion unless the article is irredeemably biased, which this is not. There are plenty of sources out there folks, just very little attention is paid outside the holiday season. I see no other eason for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/b/User_talk%7EGRBerry_d7ba.html" title="User talk:GRBerry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GRBerry_c9d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GRBerry">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Reluctant keep</b>. I still think the article needs serious revision, but I will admit that having <i>some</i> article on this topic is good.

<li><b>Keep</b> Nomination amounts to a claim that the article lacks a NPOV. However, the article lacks such a tag and there has been no discussion about the issue recently. There was on June 30 a claim that the title was inherently lacing in a NPOV, but not one that convices me, given that the title is the proper noun for what the article is about. Currently lacking a NPOV would not be a reason for deletion, only irredeemable bias would be, and that is not an issue with this article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>CindyLooWho is correct that <i>actual</i> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">AFD precedent</a> has traditionally permitted city councillors of major metropolitan cities such as <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, while generally going <i>against</i> councillors in smaller cities. Precedent, of course, isn't the same thing as policy, so this isn't necessarily binding in all circumstances — and in this case, because pre-merger Etobicoke is in a bit of a grey area as effectively both a smaller city and Toronto at the same time, either precedent could be invoked with equal validity.

<li><b>delete</b>. Electioneering. Where's your objectivity gone???? The subject is no more than a politician of a minor conurbation, however you look at it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Although all opinions expressed here should be considered, I think it should be pointed out that there are 5 users here who can be identified as being from Canada and who would likely have a <i>much, much</i> greater understanding of what 'Etobicoke' really is, it's population size, the number of people that an Etobicoke city councillor would represent (the real deciding factor in my mind), and the city's pre and post-merger relationship to and within Toronto. Of those 5 users, the opinions expressed are currently 3 keeps and 2 deletes (one of those deletes being the nominator). BTW, I don't know the exact number of people that a former Etobicoke councillor would represent, but it would be in the tens of thousands - not anything like 1,000 which would be a 'small city' BIO-unworthy councillor in my opinion. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 04:55, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To give a better idea, Etobicoke would have had over 320,000 citizens at the end of Robertson's era. <i>If</i> there were, say, 6 councillors (the same amount they have on the current Toronto city council), that would mean he was representing 53,333+ people. If there were 8 councillors, that would equal 40,000+ constituents. I doubt the old city of Etobicoke would have had more councillors than that (if anyone has the actual number let me know). Combined with the city's officially-unofficial position within Toronto, those are big city level representation numbers that I think qualify for keep under <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">AFD precedent</a>. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 05:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> is right in that, on the municipal level, Canadian politicians do not run under a party banner. However, many politicians do have a known history supporting one or another federal/provincial party as does this one (a fact that I only know from reading his Wiki page). I'd just like to point out that I live in Toronto but not in Etobicoke, I do not know Robertson personally and I am neither a supporter or a non-supporter of the party that he supports outside of the municipal level. I am voting for keep here based on unbiased grounds so if there is a "partisan interest in the Canadian votes" its not coming from me. Also, I never said that 'number of people represented' was the <i>only</i> factor. It is <i>a</i> deciding factor for me because, as someone who lives here, I already know that the former city of Etobicoke <i>was</i> (for an intents and purposes) <i>the city of Toronto</i> (so he already meets the 'big city' criteria in my mind). Pre-merger, 70% of all city services (police, ambulance, transit, etc) in Etobicoke were provided through Toronto. <a href="../../../s/u/t/User%7ESuttungr_f732.html" title="User:Suttungr">Suttungr</a>, my judgement is not based on some "colloquial local standard". Having City of Toronto police and ambulances on your streets and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Transit_Commission_aca4.html" title="Toronto Transit Commission">TTC</a> busses on your streets (along with a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Transit_Commission_aca4.html" title="Toronto Transit Commission">TTC</a> subway line below them) <i>means you live in Toronto</i>. Etobicoke was far more Toronto than it was Etobicoke and an Etobicoke city councillor would, in a way, be just as much a Toronto city councillor as they would have a degree of power over those "Toronto"-wide services. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 15:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was referring to your reference to voters you identified as Canadian - these being somehow worth more than non-Canadian votes. Wikipedia votes are co-equal, by my count it's 8-3 in favour of deletion (Strong keep, doesn't count as double). That being said, none of your points has anything to do with David Robertson. Let the article stand (or fall) on his merits, not on the relative importance of Etobicoke. <a href="../../../s/u/t/User%7ESuttungr_f732.html" title="User:Suttungr">Suttungr</a> 16:18, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>1. I didn't count 'strong keep' as double. 2. AfD is not a vote. Majority does not necessarily win. If 5 people say delete and back it up with poor or no reasoning and 1 person says keep and backs it up with very solid reasoning, keep can "pass". Regardless, as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">AFD precedent</a> has already said that 'big city' councillors "pass" and should not be deleted, that is what I am basing my case on. I believe non-Canadians are very unlikely to have sufficient knowledge of Etobicoke/Toronto to know that Etobicoke <i>is and was</i> part of Toronto (a big city) and therefore, as a past concillor, the Robertson page passes under <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">AFD precedent</a> without needing to provide <i>any</i> more citation of notability regarding Robertson as an individual. Also keep in mind that AfD etiquette suggests Wikipedians should "consider not participating in a AfD discussion if a nomination involves a topic with which you are unfamiliar." Although the issue might look clear cut to non-Canadians, I have pointed out that the people who presumably have stronger knowledge of the specific subject matter (not just general AfD policy as <i>everyone here</i> has) generally find this page to be in a very grey area re: deletion policy and currently are slightly supporting 'keep' over 'delete'. I don't think there is anything wrong with pointing that out. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 18:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are confusing a POV subject matter (which is perfectly acceptable in WP) with a POV presentation of the subject matter.

Since you closed the deletion discussion for (or speedy-deleted) this article, your reasons on how or why you did so will be greatly appreciated in the above review.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Undelete</b>. This is a nomination for undeletion. This article is not a hoax or an attempt to self promote. Thank you to all the editors who have help this article to look and appear better. Please continue your efforts. Arte Mecco is in its adolescent stage as with other genres of art throughout history (Art Deco, Cubism, Avant-Garde, etc.). It is recognized by several art associations and artists. Never in the history of art has an artist fully documented a concept which uses natural pigments and theories. This is the reason many viewers see the article on Arte Mecco as a cognitive method for explaining an art genre during their time and their research. A special thanks to the editor(s) who has change the name: History of Arte Mecco to Arte Mecco to make for better Wikipedia research. You are true troopers.Hugeaux 06:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>One thing which you can do to assist other Wikipedia editors is, if you already maintain a personal website, please ensure that any information that you want in your Wikipedia article is already on your own website. As long as it's not involving grandiose claims like, "I was the first to create this widget," or "My book was the biggest seller that year," a personal website can be used as a reference for general biographical information. As the Wikipedia Verifiability policy states: Self-published sources and other published sources of dubious reliability may be used as sources in articles about themselves . . . so long as the information is notable, not unduly self-aggrandizing, and not contradicted by other published sources.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Now, call me a math major, but this is the stupidest damn thing I've ever seen. First of all, even if it wasn't made up, one should surely realize that this "law" being only for two-digit numbers makes no sense, as multiplying xxx3 by xxx4 will always result in xxxx2, no matter how many other digits are involved. In addition, this nonexistent law doesn't work for 6, as the terrible article states- 2x6=12, 4x6=24, 6x6=36, 8x6=48.

<li><b>Reply</b> - United-SF was written in order to inform the public and to give an example of a groups and parties that are trying to organize. United-SF is a party I know in particular and its very active in the Somali Community in the Twin Cities here in Minnesota. I don't think it should be deleted, however, I think it should be removed as an example in the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> article as an example. I do not know how to verfiy this group actually exisits since they have not decided to create a website or something of that nature.</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete —</b> I'm not convinced the webpage is referring to the same group as the last two external links. They seem to be just one of many armed groups in control of the <i>independent</i> state of Somaliland but I can't find any information on them except that they're small and don't seem to have any significant news mentions - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 11:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> -- I am sure its not part of any Somaliland group. Actually I think the United-SF is part of a variety of new Somali Groups/Parties like <a href="http://www.ssup.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.ssup.org/" rel="nofollow">Somali Social Union Party</a> which is based over in Europe. I have decided to call one of the members of the United-SF here in Minnesota to contact him about the party. he told me they were still working but were not as active. Perharps we can use the Somali Social Union Party. I forgot to add, The Leader of the group, he told me, was a guy in Somalia named Samantar Jabar Ahmed --<a href="../../../h/i/i/User%7EHiiraan_5900.html" title="User:Hiiraan">Samantar Abdirisaq</a> 05:11, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> being written by a supporter of the group does not make it vanity, and almost any armed political group is notible.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> A Google search of "United Somali Front" brings up several mentions of the organization in a variety of websites, but nothing in the news- probably due to Somalia not being big news in North America though. However, the organization certainly appears to be known around the world. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> This should be <b>renamed</b> to United Somali Front - who would look for United-SF? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 20:27, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Clarify</b> From what I can tell the United Somali Front is a completely different organisation from the United-SF. The former is an armed group based in Somaliland (which probably does deserve an article), the latter an unarmed group with nothing but a website which doesn't even name the leader! Thanks for doing the research, Samantar, but please remember the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a> policy when it comes to wikipedia content. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewRT_58ab.html" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a> 20:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>In that case it should be <b>deleted</b> since the references provided are all to the United Somali Front and this would be in effect unverifiable. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 21:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Phil Gray has recieved Centenary Medal (awarded by Federal Government), has streets named after him, and has demonstrated awards and services - how is this not a notable person? He's one of the most decorated non-military persons in the Gold Coast and Hinterland region. Search Hansard for citation in Parliament regarding his services. Has various monuments to him in stone and bronze in Studio Village/Helensvale region (Northern Gold Coast).

<p>After looking at the WP:BIO policy, I find 61 links from Google on him ("Phil Gray" Helensvale), including links to all the major TV channels (7, 9MSN, ABC and 10) Newspaper articles from as far afield as Townsville and Newcastle (1500 and 800km away each - not everyone gets noticed that far from home!), Sydney newspapers (different State!). I didnt include his entire record in Education - he has been a major voice in policy and standar disation in Queensland over a 38 year period. He has impacted on the lives of at least 100,000 people directly, and about 6 million indirectly. I'd also point out that the WP:BIO tests are as follows:</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having been witness to the creative and impressive planning and execution of the Tour de Kits I would argue that events like this do deserve to be where people can access and learn more about the feats of its participants. The Tour is a challenging adventure that can really only be described as a Journey for those who participate. It ultimately comes down to mixing the achievement of personal goals with the emotional and intellectual bonding between men and women of all backgrounds and beliefs. The participants listed are only a few of the many people who have participated in the event at various stages, sharing in the successes and travails of those biking. The Tour de Kits exemplifies the kinds of challenges that go beyond drunken nights with random acts of ridiculous behavious. The Tour de Kits is an impressively executed race at which only true athletic intellectuals will find themselves victorious. ~Tour Enthusiast~ <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.82.21.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.82.21.122_1748.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.82.21.122">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree the present tone of the text is a little brochure-ish, but in terms of notability I don't think there's any question. Northstar-at-Tahoe (it usually has those dashes) is a massive, long-established winter resort, one of the most popular of its kind in Northern California. It was particularly notable for being one of the first resorts to embrace snowboarders, at a time when others were kicking them off of the slopes. As a result, Northstar is often referenced in writings on snowboarding. It's also a regular venue for competitions, and is frequently in the media. I just got 276,000 ghits on a quick search. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 21:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Link one is an entry in the STB's website about the East Coast range of eateries as a tourism site. A country's tourism agency bothers to have one page just for one hawker centre (and not for most others). I would like to see you arguing the non-notability of small countries next, I suppose. The Sunday Times article talks about "disputes" between eateries in a very sought after location, even when rents where increased almost two-fold. You appear to ignore every other comment on the location in the entire article which repeatedly underscores its popularity and notability at lease in the local context and to tourists.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 05:25, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now these are the kind of refs that might establish this place as a notable tourist destination.<br />
I would consider withdrawing the nom but for Huaiwei's attitude, particularly as expressed above. First, the burden is and always has been on those advocating keep to supply references supporting a claim to notability. Second, to complain about this is something I fully expect (and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Frantix_59e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Frantix">have gotten</a>) from single-purpose accounts with no interest in Wikipedia beyond getting their article about some subject of dubious notability on, or people who <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">make things up in school one day</a>, but to see it from a veteran, established editor is particularly dismaying to me. It's conduct unbecoming a Wikipedian IMO.<br />
Those who have been asked to supply sources in AfD discussions have earned respect by doing so without complaint. Here, instead, Huaiwei sulks resentfully and seems to be more interested in getting in anti-deletionist jabs than reaching a consensus, suplied refs notwithstanding. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 21:34, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Daniel, I'm not sure that's a helpful characterisation, even if true. I agree that someone who cares enough about this article ought to be adding the refs, true, but there's no need for anyone participating to be upset about the process, you, Huaiwei, anyone... I'll add them myself if I have time and no one beats me to it. Making an article useful and preservable is more important than proving a point.

<dd>I have added the references given to the article, it was just a quick cut and paste job so maybe they could be further improved. Many of the references I spot checked were one or two line mentions in an article about Singaporean cuisine reather than in depth articles about this facility, but the guide book entries are more comprehensive and focus on the facility.

<li>I came to Singapore as a tourist (although technically on business I did get some time to enjoy things) in 2005. Many many people told me I needed to go to ECSC to try the food there. That's anecdotal evidence and not admissable, but does suggest refs for notability are out there if one tries to find them. And Huaiwei has... I see above that Huaiwei has no less then 5 apparent references, some from very notable sources. Let's get those vetted (as more than brief mentions) and actually INTO the article (a pet peeve of mine is that info developed during the course of an AfD doesn't always make it) and then this clearly is a <b>Keep</b>.

His latest book, "Mapping development" reviewed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a>, a respected newspaper. If a one-time MLA or a high court judge is notable for purposes of WP, Kirit Shelat, given his experience of over 40 years in administration as an IAS officer and in authoring books would be notable enough.

<dd>Verifiability is not the issue, notability is. As I noted below, he is not an IAS officer, but a Gujarat service officer. WE cannot assume that the thousands of state administrative officers across India are notable simply for serving out their careers. That his book is reviewed in the Hindu is not as indicative as it could be, because the book page of the Hindu relies on submitted rather than commissioned reviews. THe review was written by a former teacher at an Ahmedabad college, and is one of only two reviews by him. The book itself is not on record as being possessed by any library in the WorldCat system - an theres no systemic bias here, thousands of locally published Indian books turn up in academic libraries across the world - and is not available for sale at any major Indian online bookstore. He simply does not meet notability criteria, and is not a senior enough government official to be encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The publisher of his book on development is the same as the publisher of his book on Yug Purush Swami Maharaj - and doesnt seem to have any record on the web of having published anything else. He's not an IAS officer, but a <i>Gujarat</i> Administrative Service officer, which means he has to do something more than serve his tenure to be as notable as an HC judge. However, if he's <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narendra_Modi_d1c1.html" title="Narendra Modi">Narendra Modi</a>'s advisor, which has been added without citation to the article in the last few minutes, then he may- repeat may- pass over some bar of notability, as Modi himself is so very very encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per TruthbringerToronto. I found a few things about her and added them.

<li><b>Srong Keep</b> per EarthPerson. The Helen Sharman parallel is very fitting.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - East Coast Swing was probably the most popular style of swing dance during the swing dance fad of the late 1990s, and it remains a staple in most U.S. dance studios. I would venture as far as to say that the large majority of people who learned swing dancing in the past couple of decades probably started out with East Coast Swing. That seems pretty notable to me. The article as it is written is very poor, but that's reason to improve it, not to delete it. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 14:01, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the article currently sucks, but the topic, East Coast Swing, is still a cornerstone of swing dancing around the world. The only reason to delete it would be to re-incarnate the article with a fresh start. Everyone who take swing or ballroom dance classes learns ECS, there should be a Wikipedia article on it (though, a better one than there is now).--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill.i.am_6529.html" title="User:Will.i.am">Will.i.am</a> 00:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Why is this even under discussion? If it's a poor article then fix it, but deleting it would be seriously moronic given its popularity. Ninti 07:31, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - As Cswrye already pointed out, nearly everyone who has learned any amount of swing in the past ten years started out by learning East Coast. This article is very notable to the social dance scene, it's sad to see this even under discussion. <a href="../../../u/t/o/User%7EUtopianheaven_c587.html" title="User:Utopianheaven">Utopianheaven</a> 19:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was an 11Kb section in the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> article.

<dd>In that case, I instead support a <b>Move</b> to <i>Fachhochschule Wiener Neustadt</i> or some other official German name. That's what confused me. Apparently, almost nobody calls it the <i>University of Applied Sciences for Business and Technology</i> and there is no need to translate the name for the purposes of the article title. Other then that, it seems like a good candidate for translation from the de -pedia. <span style="background-color:#000000"><font color="white">(|--</font></span> <span style="background-color:#CCCCCC"><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltimus_c12a.html" title="User talk:Ultimus"><font color="red"><b>UlT</b></font><b><font color="green">i</font><font color="blue">MuS</font></b></a></span> 18:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can see arguments for both sides. I think Fachhochschule Wiener Neustadt is not notable enough for English speakers to put its English name in Google search results, but still easily notable enough to merit a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technical_University_of_Berlin_bcf6.html" title="Technical University of Berlin">Technical University of Berlin</a> is named by the English translation (compare the 200,000 Google hits for <tt>"Technical University of Berlin"</tt> to the millions of Google hits for <tt>"Technische Universität Berlin"</tt>. On the other hand, <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technische_Universit%C3%A4t_Braunschweig_cd40.html" title="Technische Universität Braunschweig">Technische Universität Braunschweig</a> is named by its German name (there are a couple in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_in_Germany_9468.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges in Germany">Category:Universities and colleges in Germany</a> with German article names). All articles in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversities_and_colleges_in_Austria_cce7.html" title="Category:Universities and colleges in Austria">Category:Universities and colleges in Austria</a> have English names. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">08-26</a> 09:16Z</small></i></span></li>

<li>First of all, this is a public school, not a company! The quasi-official translation "university of applied science" for <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fachhochschule.html" title="Fachhochschule">Fachhochschule</a> is very unfortunate IMO because in German, a Fachhochschule is clearly distinct from a "Universität". It would probably be better to call it something like a "technical college". In any case, I think the article should be kept, but the title should be changed. It is completely unknown under this name in Austria! It should either be "Fachhochschule Wiener Neustadt" or "University of Applied Sciences Wiener Neustadt" (this is also how it is called on the English version of its website <a href="http://www.fhwn.ac.at/desktopdefault.aspx?pageid=407&amp;lang=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fhwn.ac.at/desktopdefault.aspx?pageid=407&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>).

<li><b>weak delete</b>. I had contemplated putting an AfD on this one, but the fact that she won half a mill made me reconsider. However, how many lotto winners do we have listed in wiki? Thinking about it a bit more, I'm inclined to go for a delete as she was only part of a successful TV show, and <s>she was not the main winner of the round</s>. Her main field is an ER nurse and she's probably the only one without a huge mortgage. Not known outside BB. Her entry could be merged into BB6, along with the rest of them. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 22:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Could you please clarify what you meant by "<i>she was not the main winner of the round</i>"? How are you using hte term "<i>round</i>" here? I think of a "round", as one of multiple parts in a competition (e.g. ten rounds in a boxing match). In Big Brother, a week or broadcast episode could be seen as a "round" (e.g. each opportunity for elimination). She surivived all the weeks/episodes/rounds up until the final one, which she was <i>the</i> winner (2nd prize being a tenth in size). At the end, there were only two contestants, which millions of people tuned to see. She wasn't just another part of the show. As for lotto winners, I suppose if a TV show was dedicated to a loto winner, giving them top prime time coverage, for an entire season of episodes, with millions of people following their every move, with lots of independent coverage, then maybe they should get an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:56, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Rationale for nomination:</b> This is a term that appeared in an article in <i>Newsweek</i> magazine LAST WEEK. <b>I don't believe it has been around suffienciently long enough to be inherently notable</b>. It is pretty much a marketing gimmick Newsweek does to sell magazines, so this time, instead of calling the article "Hottest Schools" like they usually do, they named it "New Ivies." Thus, it's technically a <b><a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">neologism</a></b> This is not a group of schools like the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_colleges.html" title="Colonial colleges">Colonial colleges</a> that have been around for a long time and as such the term and their association becomes notable. This is a term invented last week, and aside from one magazine article (reported also by their coverage partner MSNBC), it has no longevity backing it up. If this were an article titled "Hottest Schools", it undoubtedly would be deleted. This is <b>academic boosterism</b>. Lastly, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> intended to be <i>a collection of lists</i> of loosely associated stuff, a <i>reporter of news</i> (since we're just pushing forward Newsweek's article), and considering <b>we are not here to haruscupate, extrapolate, speculate, etc.,</b> we should not be determining right now by giving this article credence, whether this term "New Ivies" will experience longevity or be a new force in higher education. How do we know next year's list won't be "Newer Ivies"? If it's not a "flash in the pan" after a few years, the article would be more than welcome. Right now, it's a newborn, and unless the newborn were the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Coming_%28Shotgun_Messiah_album%29_29a9.html" title="Second Coming (Shotgun Messiah album)">Second Coming of the Messiah</a>, or the next <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchen_Lama_a9d7.html" title="Panchen Lama">Panchen Lama</a>, this enumeration of "New Ivies" hasn't been around long enough to do something worth noting here. —06:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Now, I apologise if I get the next section wrong, but it's difficult to fully understand the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> based on the way it's written. Because 88MPH has only published comics in collected and singular form, that they haven't been commented greatly outside of online news sites and 'blogs', and that it isn't a chain then it fails the guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and as such isn't deserving of it's own Wiki page? I think the link to Adam Nichol's DeviantArt page as that's the place where he proved something. I would like it if he hd a more official place for posting it but some of this stuff isn't made hugely public. 88MPH has bee involved in a number of serious issues, and the full removal of the article will only serve to make things worse. Please give a list of criteria that needs to be filled so that the 88MPH page can be retained.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 13:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article continues to be trimmed and reworked to meet Wiki standards, and is a valuable piece of information as a publisher of independent comic books. There is still work to be done, but this is a company who has released several products commerically. To delete this page would be akin to deleting <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamwave_Productions_d154.html" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave Productions</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/w/NOW_Comics_bb18.html" title="NOW Comics">NOW Comics</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevRaven_4b17.html" title="User:RevRaven">Reverend Raven</a> 19:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is important to be retained for those who wish to find out what has been going on with 88MPH Studios Inc. With little updates on the news page and a mountain of posts on the company forum a site browser can easily look up the page and find out what exactly has happened. Despite the issues 88MPH Studios has released a number of products and it is yet to file Chapter 7 bankruptsy so, even in it's state it is still technically in business. There is also a ongoing legal case which can be reported here as soon as a result has been reached.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 20:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <i>Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.</i> Unfortunately, a company's own website and forum are first-party sources. The reason this caveat exists is because it is not too difficult for someone to spend five minutes writing a website in the hopes of getting a vanity mention on Wikipedia. (I'm not accusing you of this, of course... merely trying to provide examples of the potential abuse that could exist if <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> was not policy.) You should check out that policy, along with the recommendations at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, in order to see what can be used to properly source the article. It is entirely possible that an article on this company would encyclopedic, and I have no prejudice toward changing my recommendation if it can be properly sourced.

<p>This article was previously deleted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Syed_Ahmed_2e96.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Syed Ahmed">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Syed Ahmed</a> with the consensus of all nine participants to the discussion. It now seems to have been re-created without a deletion review (in clear violation of our policies) and amazingly has survived a subsequent AfD at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Syed_Ahmed2_b759.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Syed Ahmed2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Syed Ahmed2</a>.</p>
<p>Syed was a contestant on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_%28UK_series_2%29_9b9a.html" title="The Apprentice (UK series 2)">The Apprentice (UK series 2)</a>, and a perfectly adequate biography of him is provided in that article. He was not the winner, nor has he obtained (to my mind) any notability outside of the TV show. Media coverage of Syed seems limited to media speculation about his private life (almost exclusively in the Tabloids). Our precedent for shows such as Big Brother, whose contestants also received such media coverage, is to include a biography only on the programme's page. I therefore propose a <b>delete and redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_%28UK_series_2%29_9b9a.html" title="The Apprentice (UK series 2)">The Apprentice (UK series 2)</a></b>. <sub>└</sub> <sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 07:02, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Comment</i>: I think it's doubtful that the OR problems can be addressed by other sources when the people involved have 0 Google hits. As an aside, I find this a somewhat interesting topic... but I also find it to be so esoteric as to be cruft.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see multiple non-trivial coverage. The deadmalls.com site looks like a blog, not a reliable source, so I discount it completely. The <i>Business First of Buffalo</i> article looks like trivial coverage to me, and at most a barely worked over reprint of a press release, so I don't count it as independent, non-trivial coverage. (That reprint requirement is very hard to test, we essentially have to use a "sniff test", which is part of the reason that I think WP:CORP could be improved.) The last, <i>Niagra Gazette</i> article does look like an independent non-trivial article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand that other people don't believe WP:CORP; I seem to be the strongest advocate of that position, as I rarely see it referenced in a Mall AFD discussion before I arrive. That is part of why I usually include an explanation of why it does apply. I also don't see what other standard too apply. I've seen articles for strip malls, and when we count those things there are about as many around as there are schools (in developed countries at least), so we need some standard. WP:CORP isn't perfect, either for suitability to malls or as a general standard for companies, but it does apply better than anything else we have, at least in my opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Strong Keep: I authored this article with assistance from the Dally in the Alley coordinator, Connie Mangalin, employing materials supplied by the Dally in the Alley committee. All of the artists list are easily found in web searches, and at least one of the artists listed wrote his own article, which was chopped. This was Stephen Goodfellow, and if you've seen his work, you would understand how important he is as an artist. BTW: This article has stood one year. So why now the rush to ruin the work of several ernest, Detroit based people. I simply cannot understand how a person can attend the Dally and overlook its signficance. It is an example of a festival that has quite literally saved the community in which it takes place from the wrecking ball. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 22:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> Their home page is here: <a href="http://www.straightway.tc/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.straightway.tc/" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Not sure why that's not in the article. It seems like they <i>ought</i> to be notable, but there's very little web chatter. The only real claims to notability are two letters of commendation from the last two governors of Texas (which politicians hand out like party favors). This is very likely the kind of organization (homeless people, teen mothers, etc.) that doesn't really cross path with the web very much, so I'm inclined to cut them some slack, but not <i>this</i> much. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> is the issue. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 22:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You did not mention that one of the "former governors" of Texas is the current president of the United States, and the other one is the CURRENT GOVERNOR of Texas. That seems to hold a decent level of verification. Because an organization is not validated through a google search--does this now mean that they are non-notable? The StraightWay ministry is the one which led Karla Faye Tucker to Christ 12 years before her execution. The director has been interviewed by Larry King about the ministry. Several Houston-based news stations have aired reports about StraightWay. Carter89fifteen 06:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> is the issue. What was the air date of the Larry King episode? How long was his segment? The Karla Faye Tucker conversion isn't notable in my book (religious conversion on death row is very common and generally suspect). And again, a commendation from a governor (even a president to be) is nothing to write home about. Follow this link for a reason why: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/legal/desalvo.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snopes.com/legal/desalvo.asp" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 06:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The bulk of the media coverage was done in 1997, before the execution of Ms. Tucker. The main issue reported was in regards to the organization's ideological opposition of the death penalty. Also... my facts about the Larry King interview were not straight (in fact, they were downright wrong). I apologize for that. While King covered the issue, an interview was not conducted. There were, however, several networks that interviewed Mr. Kirschke (SW director) about the issue because of how controversial it was, including MSNBC. It placed StraightWay very much in the limelight because it was their organization that brought Karla to a place of Christian conversion. Thank you for withdrawing your "weak delete" vote. I appreciate your willingness to admit your lack of objectivity when it comes to evangelical programs, but I am confused about your prejudice against these programs (which you say "raise your hackles"). My question is: If you are a liberal, who by definition is one who is an open-minded person and freethinker, as I am, why are you so intolerant of those of a different persuasion, even if it is Christian-based? To me, that seems to be quite a narrow-minded approach and philosophy to have.-Carter89fifteen 16:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Look, don't get personal, please. In order to show that the organization is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> enough, all you need to do is cite your sources, and provide references that other people can go to and see for themselves why the organization is important enough to merit an article.

<dd>OwenX,</dd>
<dd>Please understand that I wrote this article in part based on my direct experience, but to a large extent based on secondary research with the original intent to aggregate information about the subject of car dealer auctions that is not readily available to the public. I tried to keep personal opinion out and still believe in the informational, educational and encyclopedic nature of this article. I'd be happy to provide links to my outside sources, if you think this would strengthen my position, and I would also gladly edit any parts that may sound "not suitable for an article" to you or to other potential readers. I'm hoping that in time other automotive experts will expand and improve on what I originally wrote. I humbly ask that you reconsider deleting it and provide constructive feedback that will be in the interest of the community at large.</dd>

<li>The problems are several here: first, there doesn't appear to be any sourcing in the article, which are necessary for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>; second, policy states that articles must not be previously unpublished. Check out <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a> for details.

<dd>Thank you for clarifying. I think two of my sources actually meet the criteria from the policy. I'm not sure how best to source them in the article, but here they are:</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> it. This is just plain petty. Scores of fan clubs enjoy uncontested Wikipedia entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a peek at an exemplary wikipedia fan club entry: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doyle_Fan_Club" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doyle_Fan_Club" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>] There's something odd about this one. This entry has no sources and doesn't even contain correct grammar, yet I don't see any deletion request. I don't see Nlu calling the entry's notability into question, and yet I can't imagine how THE DOYLE FAN CLUB has more members worldwide than www.niketalk.com. As I don't read any poorly dittoed fright rock "zines," I can't recall the last time THE DOYLE FAN CLUB has ever breached the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I could accept a style critique. The article, while constantly vandalized, was not well written to begin with, and I'm aware that this site's pedantic gatekeepers typically require that each entry be uniformly encoded in pretentious academic jargon - using as many cute latin phrases as possible so as to more accurately indulge the fantasy of actually participating in a real academic journal. If you want to condense this entry down to a banal recitation of verifiable facts regarding the site's traffic, history, and external mentions - go hog wild. We can all live with that.</p>
<p>What irks me is that this has, for whatever reason, become a personal crusade for a wikipedia administrator. Nlu, you really destroyed any shred of objectivity by continually railing against NikeTalk.com's "notability." How did this site require FURTHER proof of notability than VERIFIED mentions in Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal? The site's popularity may be verified simply by viewing the independently collected web stats. Since I doubt you've ever visited the site, let me give you a hand: [<a href="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=ntjordan" class="external free" title="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=ntjordan" rel="nofollow">http://extremetracking.com/open?login=ntjordan</a> ] Currently, the site receives between 70,000 and 90,000 unique visitors per day - and this is off peak. Over 4.6 million unique visitors viewed the site in January of this year alone. If that is not notable, you have a hell of a lot of entries to delete.</p>
<p>What's more, you've obviously attempted to narrow the scope of this debate in order to railroad this entry from wikipedia. <b>You DELETED several "keep" votes</b> - which in no way violated wikipedia standards - and then blocked all new and unregistered users from participating in this forum and prevented a TRUE public hearing. The NikeTalk entry has been vandalized on probably hundreds of occasions, and yet after ONE miscreant violates this topic you place it under security? Your motives here are transparent. I honestly can't imagine what your problem is with a harmless online community for sneaker fans sharing wikipedia space with millions of other articles, but you've clearly demonstrated a subjective bias against this entry. You've abused what little "power" you possess. And for what? To keep a sneaker message board from "contaminating" an encyclopedia that enshrines, among other things, warcraft mods and testicle cuffs? This is a resource that is, supposedly, open to the general public.</p>
<p>There is NO standard violated by this entry that has not been violated a thousand times over by entries you continue to allow. If this entry is spam, what of the entry for www.newegg.com? Does anyone really need a wikipedia entry to detail the history of a web store? If this entry is not notable, then what of The Doyle Fan Club or any of the thousands upon thousands of other equally obscure entries?</p>
<p>Look, wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia for the people. It's intended to include topics that stodgy "formal" encyclopedias wouldn't deign to include. www.niketalk.com is the largest online community for sneaker collectors in the world today. Whether that's important to you or not is utterly subjective - and your standards are SUPPOSED to be OBjective. The entry should exist for those all those who might seek it. <b>If you can abide an entry for the Cinderella Stamp Club, (600 members) I'm sure there's a place for the world's largest community of sneaker fans.</b></p>
<p>Wikipedia users, I'm not asking you to LOVE this entry. I am asking you to be fair - and in this case most of the criticism levied against this entry has been inconsistent and superficial at best. --RakimAllah 03:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the records, I reverted to a pre-vandalism version because these anons/newly registered users removed valid delete votes and defaced the AfD discussion itself. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/NikeTalk_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/NikeTalk_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of the AfD</a>. Since those votes would have been disregarded anyway (not only as vandalism but also as votes by users who were too new), there is no loss. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 05:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still more hypocrisy from Nlu... First of all, unless you have IP records PROVING that all of those individuals were responsible for vandalizing the site you have NO basis for removing their valid "keep" votes. You have to admit, it all looks both petty and suspect to have cut off ALL "keep" votes and restored all "delete" votes. Altering or deleting votes makes a mockery of Wikipedia's "honor system" - and it appears you're every bit as guilty as those you consider "vandals" in this instance. Even though I clearly want the article kept, ultimately I respect the integrity of wikipedia enough to acknowledge and respect votes that go against my cause. You can't make the same claim - and you're an administrator. What does that say?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Simply because they are new users, you don't feel they have a say in the matter? MOST wikipedia users do NOT register for this site. Shouldn't all wikipedia viewers have a say? If an article is important to someone, shouldn't they be able to voice their opinions and contribute to the discussion? What you're attempting to accomplish is to limit this debate to those who have little to no understanding of the subject matter. Imagine if we put one of your prized articles on Chinese historical figures up for a deletion debate and allowed only Alabamian Klansmen to vote. Do you think they'd consider your subjects "notable?" You appear to have no respect for or understanding of the subject matter - and it's clearly biased your judgment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look at the quality of arguments tethered to these "delete" votes. How well supported are these sputtered fragments? "Spam" How so? If this is spam, you have thousands and thousands of other articles that would seemingly fit the same criteria. Wikipedia hosts hundreds of articles promoting businesses both online and off. Is it only spam if the author veils her or his bias behind third person objective? Not that it matters, but NikeTalk.com isn't even a business. All ad revenue above and beyond the site's hosting costs goes to various charities. It's a community that holds a unique position of influence within the sneaker industry, as indicated by all of those sources you fail to acknowledge. If someone can type "newegg" into your search engine and find an article that reads like a brochure, why is it that a sneaker fan cannot type in NikeTalk to find more information? If vandalism weren't such a pervasive problem here, perhaps there'd be a better core article for those interested to update. As it stands, the article can take one step forward and three steps back. Yet you clearly care more about the vandalism of your prized "delete" votes than the vandalism of actual CONTENT. How fair is it that people who have no real interest in this article, yet enjoy feeling as though they're really "editors" of something as ostensibly intellectual as an encyclopedia, are able to impose snap judgments in this space - yet those who actually care the most about the subject of this article are locked out because they had no reason to open an account in the past? Aren't they still wikipedia users? You're simply afraid of opening up the floor because you know that you'll never achieve a consensus delete under such conditions - so you JUMPED at the chance to manipulate the process to engineer your desired result. That's pathetic. You could've simply reinstated the lost "delete" votes, since you're following this so closely.</dd>

<dd>You have NO case with regard to notability - and you know that. How many other entries are asked to CONSTANTLY add new sources merely to prove their notability over and over again? The site was just mentioned in Time magazine in March. While the EASILY verifiable traffic and membership figures and previous mainstream media mentions should have been MORE than sufficient, the site has since been mentioned in the LA Times and Adbusters magazine. What more do you want? How is it that a stamp collectors club with 600 mentions is notable, but a community with over 50,000 members and 70,000+ regular visitors that has received international media attention is not? What, exactly, remains unproven about the site's notability? Have ezboard.com, extreme web tracking, Time magazine, Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, the LA Times, the Washington Post, Adbusters, Details, Strength, etc. etc. ALL fallen for some "hoax" here? Visit the freaking site. ONCE. You'll find a community with 50,000 plus members - just as ALL of these sources claim. What more can you POSSIBLY ask for to demonstrate notability?</dd>

<dd>Compare the NikeTalk entry to other fan club entries. There are NO SOURCES in any number of unchallenged fan club entries - not ONE. There's no source to verify its content. You have XBox live "clans" with wikipedia articles for crying out loud. Go bully them. This article contains verifiable sources from some of the most respected mainstream periodicals in the world and that's suddenly not enough to "prove notability?" You have to acknowledge that you're being a little inconsistent here, to say the very least. While you may prefer starcraft mods, testicle cuffs, fright rock, and stamp collectors to sneakers - that's no reason to try and run a site off what should be a public resource. As with any encyclopedia, wikipedia ought to have the potential to BROADEN one's horizons a bit. Take advantage. It's not just about what interests YOU. --RakimAllah 08:14, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether those users were vandalizing or not is open to public judgment. I've posted the link to the history of the discussion. I don't think anyone can seriously dispute that they <i>did</i> vandalize this discussion. Your attacks on me just, I think, shows the lack of case for keep (at least prior to Pixelface's rewrite). Even after Pixelface's rewrite, however, I believe this is still a spam magnet.</dd>
<dd>As for the strawman argument of "but there are other articles more deserving of deletion!" it should be noted that you can propose articles for deletion, too, and if you think that those other articles don't belong, propose to delete them. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:43, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Your claim that the site isn't "notable enough" for wikipedia remains indefensible.</b> That you've repeatedly asserted this claim only proves your bias. Even so, let's prove your bias a few more times for the benefit of those who haven't yet been totally disillusioned. If the revised NikeTalk entry is spam, surely the article for www.newegg.com is spam. For crying out loud, go look at the entry. They're using it to advertise their upcoming 'regional expansions.' The whole entry reads like an advertisement. So, what's the difference? Please, tell me. IF you were a person of principle, I imagine you'd wish to apply the SAME standards to every single entry. IF you were a person of principle, you'd vote to DELETE the entry for www.newegg.com on these same grounds. If it is NOT deleted and "fails to improve" even after the community allows it to stay, I would then expect you to HOUND this entry with future delete requests until a "consensus" decision is reached. Otherwise, you're PROVING that you're treating this particular entry differently than others. Of course, I shouldn't have to be the one to propose the article for deletion. Now that you, an administrator, are aware of another spam entry like www.newegg.com - YOU will be the one to propose and argue for the article's deletion. It's your goal to remove all spam articles that you're aware of, is it not? Or, are you going to admit that you're only interested in removing "spam" articles if they somehow irk you? So much for your objectivity. This isn't a campaign against spam. You just have beef with this entry - and it's now obvious to all. At least have the integrity to own up to it and explain why you'll tolerate "spam" from newegg and thousands of other sites - even after they've been brought to your attention - but you're willing to wage this little crusade against niketalk's entry.</dd>

The moment the NikeTalk entry was cleaned up, your claims were nullified. The subject is obviously notable. The entry has been scrubbed to the bone. That you continue to press for deletion only indicts you further. Stop the bleeding. Sadly, it all reflects poorly on wikipedia since you're so flagrantly misusing your administrative access.

As it stands the list is partially useful, but personally I think if there isn't a list of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29_42e5.html" title="Chris Morris (satirist)">morrisisms</a>, Colbert doesn't warrant one for his less imaginative word-mashings. -- <b><a href="../../../d/r/r/User%7EDrrngrvy_092d.html" title="User:Drrngrvy">drrngrvy</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../d/r/r/User_talk%7EDrrngrvy_8d28.html" title="User talk:Drrngrvy"><font color="black"><u><i><b>tlk</b></i></u></font></a></sup> <b>@</b> 15:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A lot of the neologisms Colbert uses seem to become rather popular, and the list is certainly verifiable and expandable. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 20:27, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Be really nice to have a clearinghouse for the Colbertisms that people keep creating articles for. Maybe having this page here will save some of those neologism articles from being created in the first place. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 16:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - both to prevent cluttering up the rest of the main namespace, and because, quite frankly, as one of America's leading media personalities (somehow), what he says carries some significant weight. This list serves to further illustrate and expand upon the coverage of Colbert's tendency to coin neologisms, which has been elsewhere reported on. I'm not his hugest fan, and I would say that an individual article for each neologism would be overkill, but a single, easily-maintained list (citing sources) is very appropriate for a show of this size and influence. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable "glossary" of one of America's more popular shows.

<li>Which part of "Wikipedia is not a dictionary" do you not understand? We do not include glossaries.

<li><b>Burn it</b>, I actually was coming to the page to nominate it. Why you ask? They are less notable than episodes and are often one-time gags. Come on, he makes a new one almost every show. Wikipedia is NOT a glossary. Lets give the notable terms (or should I say term) an article and leave the rest to wither away. If a term can't establish itself outside of the show, it does not deserve to exist. Could the people voting keep see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (avoid neologisms and never use protologisms [ie. all the content on this page])? This article isn't needed to keep out clutter. Why not just create a short limited list of examples of his neologism on the show's page? The main argument for this seems to be that it will prevent articles about the terms...why can't we just delete them when they come? <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><i>B</i>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><i>S</i>egue</a> 22:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia does not include <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a>, and having a list of them does not stop them being excluded. Truthiness is one thing, but we already <i>have</i> a perfectly good article on that. Words like "jazzebration" and "wikiality", meanwhile, have zero currency outside very specific references to very specific items on this show, and thus have no place in an encyclopedia. Discuss very notable examples in their own articles; discuss less notable examples in the main article on the show; don't discuss non-notable examples at all. There's no place for this list. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am sorry if I have created a page which violates some Wikipedia policy. For the record, this article does not claim the intention to add content later, and it was not originally empty. It was moved in order to become part of a larger Wikibook project. At the time that I moved the original article's content, I asked for advice in the Village Pump, and was told that a "soft redirect" would be appropriate. Is there some dispute over the validity of redirecting pages that have moved to a new location? Did I have some renegade advising me in the Village Pump? A full article existed under this name for more than a year, and several external sites link to it. Would it not be a courtesy to users of Wikipedia to leave behind redirects whenever something moves? --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritzlein_9463.html" title="User:Fritzlein">Fritzlein</a> 17:01, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is the podcast that has frequently been referred to as the "podcast for the serious Lost fan" by the Lost community and even by other popular Lost podcasters. This is not a podcast that is based on reviewing episodes and entertaining (and there are some excellent podcasts which do those things very well;) this is the one podcast that deals with Lost mythology and literary references on a deep level. It involves considerable time and research by these intelligent and dedicated podcasters who also inspire their listeners to research the mythological and literary references within Lost. This podcast was one of the very first Lost podcasts and has remained a pillar of the Lost community. That alone makes them noteworthy. Then add to that, their distinction as the podcast that created the standard for the "grad school level Lost podcast" and their "notability" within the Lost community is cemented. These podcasters put a lot of time and research into each show (often quoting wikipedia; thereby boosting the popularity and growth of Wikipedia.) Their i-tunes standing testifies to this. How can they be considered anything but one of the most outstanding and noteworthy of all Lost podcasts? }This is my first post on Wikipedia. However it is not a single purpose account. I have frequently used Wikipedia (and yes, I learned about it from LostCasts) for research. It is the first place I turn to find answers or to learn about something. I think Wikipedia is as close to a universal all *purpose library as this world can ever know. I have never posted before because I never felt like I had anything important to add. I do today. LostCasts is an excellent podcast and deserves to be noted as an important part of the Lost community. I am proud to make this my first post.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This podcast is the best Lost podcast to date. It holds discussions on theories, themes and characters along with book discussions. It is intelligent and a major contributor to the Lost community. This podcast is better than most because it delves deeper into literary themes than any other Lost podcast. I have known people who, through listening to Lostcasts, have become interested in different kids of literature. My neice who previously hated to read, became interested in reading because the podcast mentioned several books that have a relationship to Lost. She has since read Watership Down and loved it and is now reading other books. And podcast that inspires children to read cannot be bad and others should have a chance to learn about it on Wikipedia.Laureletsage 04:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Laureletsage (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Laureletsage_7c78.html" title="Special:Contributions/Laureletsage">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is notable through general information, biography, and popularity within ABC's Lost pod casting community. This discussion is stalling any new information that would make this a more informative and indepth article. If being one of the most educational, informative, and popular media out there doesn't deserve notoriety, then wikipedia needs some serious spring cleaning. Please explain yourself in more depth, instead of just writing "not notable". Also, noting on people's non-activity, does not render their opinion "non notable" either, wether they heard it on a forum or not.

<li><b>Keep</b> (don't edit this thankyou): The uniqueness of the format is sufficiently noteworthy. If it were the 10th template copy of an established format and addednothign new then yes, it would not meet the standard, but it is patently a groundbreaking approach to online interaction on a topic that itself warrants inclusion. The context of the subject proves this: there are many LOST podcasts, but the vast majority are templated 'fan review' offerings. This podcast is primarily a review and critique of online reaction to the initial medium. It was the first to use this approach. This is precisely the reason why entries such as the one for <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucker_Max_6cdf.html" title="Tucker Max">Tucker Max</a> don't attract delete campaigns. Tucker Max really is unnoteworthy as a participant in his chosen area of activity (online media, with apparant sidelines into fornication, alcoholism and getting sued) but is noteworthy because he was a principal pioneer/early developer (but, interestingly, not even the inventor) of the 'fratire' literary genre. If the LOSTCasts entry were allowed sufficient time to mature, the uniqueness of the format could be properly documented and explained, as could its impact on other on line activities. The fact that it is also very popular is not a disqualifying factor. Many of the 'delete' entries assume (quite wrongly) that popularity of itself raises a presumption in favour of deletion. If that were true, huge chunks of Wikipedia should be cut right now. At the very least, a decision on deletion should be deferred for the balance of this year to allow the question to be reviewed after development of the entry. The entry is far too new and underdeveloped to allow a final decision on deletion at this time. In addition, one really has to ask if this delete campaign has any merit at all? It appears to be based on borderline, subjective views about noteworthiness that really have no means by which they can be tested, and therefore can't provide the rigorous basis required to apply the relevant policies in this case. Besides all that, no one on the Internet has a bullet proof ego, and I certainly include myself in that thought. My point being: would this delete campaign have been prosecuted so viciously if the word 'clueless' had not been used on the LOSTCasts website to refer to some Wikipedia contributors to begin with?--60.227.230.22 12:53, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Encyclopedia is defined as a comprehensive reference work having articles on a broad range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a given field, usually qarranged alphabetically. Encyclopedic is defined as of or typical of an encyclopedia; embracing many subjectives; and comprehensive.

<li><b>Comment:</b>For what it's worth, the wikipedia page wasn't set up for advertising purposes. The podcasters directed attention to its deletion, which is pretty borderline, but they never set it up. Personally, I think there's a difference between the average fansite, which features recaps, pictures, etc, and the podcasting LOSTcasts does. Podcasting is an inherently more personal, creative endeavor than a regular fansite. It goes beyond a reflection of the original and becomes unique. It's the difference between a photograph and a painting. Does that make this important enough to deserve it's own page? I have no idea. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunkyrice_13_9440.html" title="User:Chunkyrice 13">Chunkyrice 13</a> 02:04, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

These podcasters have given up a great deal of time to try and offer an entertaining resource that has at times overlapped with the actual production of LOST. The nomination for deletion of this article is spiteful and obviously from someone that wants to be a petty irritant rather than genuinely being concerned with the accurracy of content on wikipedia. I suggest the folks in favor of deletion subscribe to other podcasts and allow the great many listeners to be more than enough validation for an entry here. This entry is not a mere plug for a podcast. This podcast is as valid as a television or radio program and for me is a fabulous wealth of information. Devaluing this by stating it is made by fans is ridiculous. You want people producing a podcast about LOST to love the show enough to do their best. Please do not delete this entry!

<li><b>Keep</b> We're big fans of Wikipedia. Anyone who's listened to our podcasts knows that we often use it as a resource, from The Philadelphia Experiment to Aldous Huxley. I have always had great faith in the concept of Wikipedia, and have defended it on many occasions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's why we were honored when, on August 14th, a commenter on our site (Loren), posted that she'd created a Wikipedia entry for us. You can see that comment here. Just a few days ago, a comment on our site let us know that the entry was up for deletion. The reason was that several Wikipedia editors said our podcast was "non-notable."</dd>
<dd>Yeah, that upset us. We know that we're one of the top LOST fan podcasts out there, but I don't expect everyone to be familiar with us. In defense of the Wikipedia editors, if they had not heard of us, they would have no basis by which to judge our "notability."</dd>
<dd>I started some bad blood by calling the Wikipedia editors "clueless", which was irresponsible. In fact, Wikipedia editors spend their free time doing something they're passionate about, with no compensation. This is something we can identify with, because that's what we do. But we have to make an argument for our notability. Here's a shot at it:
<ul>
<li>LOSTCasts has appeared regularly in the iTunes top 100 podcasts. We were consistently in the list when season 2 was on the US, beginning in November 2005. Of course, during the off-season, this has been intermittent. One additional item of note is that the iTunes top 100 is not based on total number of subscribers, but on the number of new subscribers within a given amount of time. We'll breach this top 100 again when season 3 starts.</li>
<li>Most podcasters don't publish subscriber statistics, but we do have a glimpse from an AP article published in May of 2006. LOSTCasts is also cited in this article. In terms of numbers, The Jay and Jack podcast subscribers are cited in this AP article at 13,000 subscribers. In the month of May, our subscribers started the month at 18,000 and grew to 22,000. This would make us the most popular LOST fan podcast being published at that time. Of course, this is the only window since that we've had into other LOST podcast subscriber numbers. But everyone would agree that once the Transmission left, it was really just us, and Jay and Jack.</li>
<li>ABC and LOST listen to us. As noted in the articles of deletion, Jorge Garcia, who plays "Hurley", is a regular listener and has called into the show numerous times. As well, we have been personally contacted by a number of other official LOST folks.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As I said, we're honored to have had a Wikipedia article written for us, and we'd love to see it stay. But it's up to the Wikipedia community to accept or reject claims of notability.</dd>
<dd>If you are going to comment on the articles for deletion, make it a logical argument for notability, not a flame. If you don't believe we're Wikipedia material, then say so! That's your right... and it's what makes Wikipedia great.</dd>
<dd>The outcome won't affect the future of LOSTCasts. We validate our notability through the voice of our listeners. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.136.57.214 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.136.57.214.html" title="User talk:69.136.57.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.136.57.214_1e34.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.136.57.214">contribs</a>) .</small><small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 69.136.57.214 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.136.57.214.html" title="User talk:69.136.57.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.136.57.214_1e34.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.136.57.214">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> re: podcast notability: It appears that podcasts have a disadvantage under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as a fairly new medium that is relatively rarely featured as content articles in the traditional press, thereby decreasing chances for notability. 1) WP:WEB notes that <a href="../../../a/w/a/Category%7EAwards_ea71.html" title="Category:Awards">Category:Awards</a> may suggest notability, but there are no podcast-specific award categories, (and if any are added, they should be added to WP:WEB IMHO). 2) Traffic ranking sites such as Alexa (used in older versions of WP:WEB) also do not accurately reflect podcast traffic, which may be directly downloaded by music applications rather than web browsers. In general, I am left wondering if discussion for a WP:PODCAST article would be of merit (but I'm too lazy to embark on that endeavor), but consider that if one were to exist, it seems that an iTunes Top 100 ranking would be a reasonable criterion for podcast notability, a criterion that does not exist for other media in the umbrella category of WP:WEB. Yes this vote has attracted an array of single-purpose accounts and puppets voting "strong keep", but look beyond that and consider what podcast-specific criteria you would choose for notability. <small>(My previous comment moved here with minor copy edit)</small> --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 20:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: For everyone out there who is unfamiliar with this pdocast, <i>Lostcasts</i> is one of the best podcasts out there for the hit drama "Lost". They have been called the "Thinking Man's Lost podcast" and I strongly agree with that description. Starting way back in September of 2005, they were already delving into possible mythological connections with the constellation Apollo and eastern religious connections to the usage of Dharma and the phrase "Namaste". If anything, <i>this</i> Lost podcast deserves a page, and due to the visibility caused by this deletion attempt, I believe many of us can add much more content to the page now.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This podcast should definatly have it's own page. I listen to many different Lost podcasts and LOSTcasts is a very strong contendor. It always has a very high level of discussion, think of it as a 500 level Masters class opposed to an 100 level Undergrad class. I think that if this podcast gets any negativity associated with it, the reason is that it may be above their heads and people are lashing out.

<li><b>Keep - possible merge</b>: This is a great podcast which goes beyond just fanboy drooling. For heavens sakes, they are doing book reviews of books seen in the show and discussing how the creators drew inspiration from them. They've had cast memebers sorta on the show. This is not just another "Gee...I hope Jack and Kate hookup" cast.

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't realize I'd stir up a hornet's nest like this in regards to this AfD. With that being said, new contributors are always welcome in Wikipedia, but not in the respect that it's to prove a point or to save an article simply because you've been asked to. Whethere an article exists about your podcast or not does not make it any less of a good program, it's just not worthy of mention on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 15:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Really a question. In Wiki articles about entertainment entities, in this case a podcast, are the editors judging the entertainment value of the podcast? Using another example, if I were to post an article about the 70s band The Goodrats, would editors remove it because they think it was an non-notable band because they never heard of it? If so, then so be it. But if not, I don't understand why you want to remove this article. It is a podcast. Some people enjoy it. Ten years from now, long after the Podcast is gone, somebody will turn to their friend and say - hey, what was that podcast we used to listen to with the great theories about lost, and that friend will turn to Wiki. Isnt that what Wiki is for?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sadly, I don't quite see how murder victims fall into becoming notable people unless ther are notable <u>prior to</u> their murder. By definition, a person's murder can only happen once, so any press that is generated by the murder would only count as one event and on coverage per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The event may be notable, but the person may not, and we should be clear about it. I suppuse someone could create a list of "victims of suspected racially motivated attacks", but that would be too subjective and could include every person who is murdered in a location where they were not of the same ethnic origin as the local community there. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:05, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - seems insufficiently notable, but I could be persuaded to change my mind. Maybe I just can't believe that someone I've nearly met (John is a friend of a friend; we were once invited to the same dinner) could really be notable for inclusion on WP. Whatever the case, keep or delete, we need to thwack those anons who keep messing up the talk page. I honestly can't be bothered to keep it straight; they remove and insert comments like crazy, even if those comments don't belong to them like *cough* mine. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I set up a redirect which has been undone by the creator. This is a nice looking article but it is completely unsourced with much POV. The parts of the article that I haven't merged are unencyclopaedic detail about activities and internal organisation, effectively a recruitment brochure.

<dd>This article was not written with the objective of recruiting new members or serving as an advertisement. <b>Lac Marois Country Club does not actively seek new membership</b> as residents of that city know of the existence of LMCC, and residents of other cities cannot be members.</dd>
<dd>First, i agree that there are some elements that do not have a neutral POV. As a goal of making this article conform to Wikipedia standards, <b>I have begun removing all non-encyclopedic entries</b>, like names of the current staff members and all comments that do not directly describe the Lac Marois Country Club or its activities.</dd>
<dd>As there are articles written on every subject in Wikipedia by those who are passionate about them, this article is intended to present readers about LMCC's activities and events. For those who search about Country clubs, Lac Marois is certainly a good find, as it does not conform to the pragmatic view of what is a Country Club. Furthermore, the activities presented are valuable to anyone in need of inspiration for events and these events are described here since they form the foundation of what LMCC is.</dd>
<dd>Once we can all agree that this entry is encyclopedic in nature, then I can see no reason that it should not be included in Wikipedia. MzK 2:37, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I appreciate your attachment to an an article that you created however it is simply not encyclopaedic.

<dd>Obviously this is my first article submission, and this is all really confusing. I gathered the information on the company from their website. Also on their website are the listings of the magazines they have appeared in and awards they have received. Not only is the magazine listed, but actual scans of the article are also linked. I thought the article would be significant because they were the first LEED certified architect firm in New Jersey. And sustainable architecture seems to be a hot topic right now, including research for school projects. I wanted to save other people time on their research by including this company as a resource. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Backburnercomics (<a href="../../../b/a/c/User_talk%7EBackburnercomics_f4c6.html" title="User talk:Backburnercomics">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Backburnercomics_fa28.html" title="Special:Contributions/Backburnercomics">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>It's not enough to just have a link to the company's website in the article. If there is verifiable information about the company on its website that supports its notability, please include that in the article (without, of course, doing a straight cut-and-paste from the site, which would be a copyright violation).

<dd>PS - just as a suggestion, a far better way of grabbing traffic would be to write a blog on your site with interesting content about photography. Places like Technorati will pick this up, and if users value your service, they will start using it. Also, search for terms like 'photography' on Google, and contact the owners of those websites to discuss putting links on their site.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> Ironically, the latest RS update has changed the graphics of several generic monsters AND the kalphite queen. I've not seen how drastic these changes are but the two KQ animations may now be out-of-date, and I'm struggling to see what few sentences could be ported. It may will be there's nada to take except a the KBD image and perhaps a few others. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 22:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've still not seen the new KQ, but the giants and demons are profoundly different and improved compared to their old incarnations.

<p>Doesn't seem particularly encyclopedic. Does a list of predictions by a psychic qualify as encyclopedic? I tend to believe no. Further, I wonder if having this list of her predictions violates any of her copyright on the lists (like having the Newsweek Top 1200 High Schools was found to be copyright infringement I believe). Delete as unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 19:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s><b>weak keep</b> maybe <b>merge?</b></s> the more notable ones with her main article? I think this was broken off from the main article when it had gotten too large. Also since the list isnt taken from any one place there isn't any copyright issue. Since Brown is a notable psychic a people pay attention to her predictions certainly some of them have notability, such as those she made on Larry King Live about the mining accident (but I think that's covered in her main article anyways). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is "encyclopdic" its a list of predictions that are believed to have been made, its information. That's what an encyclopedia is for information, reference.

<p>I'm proposing this and two other articles by the same author for deletion, because they are either extremely non notable neologisms, or otherwise plain and simple hoaxes. Author (of the neologisms, and of the articles) calls himself "noted", but is extremely invisible on Google. Neologisms are equally unused, and seem to fail at least two Wikipedia policies, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:14, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To quote the wikipedia standards you cite in your proposition for deletion: Self-published and dubious sources in articles about themselves: Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, <b>may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves</b>, so long as:</p>
<p>It is relevant to the person's or organization's notability; It is not contentious; It is not unduly self-serving; It does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; There is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it.</p>
<p><br />
Clearly every single article I submitted meets these criteria, and therefore my articles should not be deleted. Sillsm</p>
<dl>
<dd>Go to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and read the section: <b>What is excluded</b>. The section you quote is irrelevant, as a) the article is not about yourself, but about some idea you supposedly launched, and b) there are no <b>sources</b> given. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:50, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
To rebut your interpretation of the wikipedia criteria: a) The article is clearly about myself as my name is in it and it cites me as a source. b) All material considered for deletion has been self-published, and distributed in a university setting. Therefore I am the authoritative source to cite on these ideas. And this does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, because all ideas presented here are at least a year old. Sillsm</p>

<p>Kinu I suggest you read <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> more carefully. I have here cited a relevant passage to clarify its meaning. As you have begun to edit and mame my defense, I believe you are no longer an impartial third party. The merits of my articles should be judged by the community as a whole, and not single partial editors.</p>
<p>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of articles, for instance see Template:IncGuide). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There is no point in continuing this discussion. <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> also says <i>Wikipedia's policy on verifiability prohibits the inclusion of things that are not verifiable from independent sources.</i> Unless you can satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is policy, this article will be deleted.

<p>Where is the proof that the two authors mentioned in the articles are currently enrolled in high school? There are no credentials accredited to the two authors except notoriety in their respective fields, which is subjective. There is only the mention of the ideas being distributed in a university setting. Where is the proof for that?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As far as I can tell, there is no proof of <i>anything</i>, including the theories mentioned in the article, which is why those who have commented on this AfD have argued for deletion. Yes, notoriety is subjective, but passing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not. (FYI, Wikipedia policy says to remove personal attacks in AfDs, but saying that the author is a high school student does not, in my opinion, fall into that category, which is why I have warned you twice for removing the above comment.) --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 05:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The theories in the articles are exactly that- theories. They are new ideas derived from literary criticism, and stand on their own legs. There is no truth or falsehood to a theory or concept. The articles don't make any claims at all, just explain the use of critical tools and give examples for their possible usage.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Yeah, I can't tell if this is supposed to be in support of the article or in support of deletion either. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 22:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> After deleting the "likely drivers" and "likely tracks" sections from the Mario kart article (where did they get that information from?), there is absolutely no substance. Just an introduction that basically says "this game might have been mentioned in passing in an interview from months ago, but we don't know. No official announcement has been made that they're actually making this game yet" and the external links. It's absolutely useless.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> TTA is one of the best efforts of a flash series I've actually seen. Alot of guys can make really good single-productions, but for a number of people to work on an interactive long-standing series? That's almost as hard as producing your own cartoon show. This flash is immensely-watch and immensely popular not just in the place it's hosted or the message board it's linked to, but all over the internet, a phenomenon that can be attributed the same power as Snakes On A Plane, 8-Bit Theater, and other notable online entertainments that are hosted elsewhere but cited about here. This is Wikipedia, ladies and gentleman. You document information of significant impact here, and this is significant enough. Remove it and you'll have to say the same for all the online comics and such-like, of which their fans will fight tooth and nail against. Thank you much, and if A Man In Black is watching... *Grins and waves* Hi there. 204.215.200.80 22:33, 25 August 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an excellent example of flash spriting. Sprite comics have their own section, and in that section there is a link to the main site this project is displayed on. This series is no different then having a cartoon series posted here. There are other web-toons strewn throughout Wikipedia that are sleeper hits, just as this one is. I vote for staying. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.144.155.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.144.155.183_4b2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.144.155.183">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Let the record show, I am only saying this to show how asinine the grounds for this article's potential deletion is. First, its claimed that the TTA article does not have reliable sources. I strongly beg to differ: <a href="http://tta.fireball20xl.com/" class="external text" title="http://tta.fireball20xl.com/" rel="nofollow">The main site</a>, <a href="http://invisionfree.com/forums/The_Fallout_Shelter/index.php?showforum=122" class="external text" title="http://invisionfree.com/forums/The_Fallout_Shelter/index.php?showforum=122" rel="nofollow">the forum/message board</a>, and <a href="http://kirbopher15.deviantart.com/" class="external text" title="http://kirbopher15.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">Chris Niosi's deviantART profile and gallery</a> contain all the information and details that make up the article. If you were unaware of this, you were either too lazy to look through even <i>part</i> of the links in the article that led to those places, or you don't seem to care whether you have legit reasons to delete this article (which wouldn't be the first time on this site). Second, you claim that because there are little Google hits, the article should be deleted. Once again, had you looked at the main TTA site itself, you would have noticed that almost the <i>entire</i> subdomain has almost nothing that a Google search would pick up, specifically, the fact that loosely 90+ percent of the site is done entirely in Flash. In fact, the only page that isn't is the FAQ page. Therefore, the only way most Google searches would be able to find the site is if the search query had "TTA", "The Series", or some words or phrases from the FAQ page, and even <i>then</i>, given how broad the results of all but the most precise search queries would end up being, many people would more likely than not have moved on to a different activity by the time they find the Google link. Last, TTA is labeled as a "non-notable flash animation series". In the first point, nice grammar. Please enlighten me as to why Wikipedians use "non-notable" as apposed to something that <i>doesn't</i> sound like it came from a high school drop-out, or at least is in a standard dictionary, like perhaps "unremarkable"? Or why not just use a phrase like "<i>not</i> notable", or maybe just "in violation of Wikipedia's notability criteria"? And then there's the glaring fact that you neglected to capitalize "Flash", but I digress. Apparently, you do not seem to know that notability is relative. In case you need a reminder, something that is "relative" is something that is difficult to or otherwise incomparable to something else. For example, there are a large number of people who have heard of and/or seen the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestar_Runner_f289.html" title="Homestar Runner">Homestar Runner</a> cartoons. In fact, I have met a lot of people off the internet who have seen some of them and enjoy them. Yet those same people have not heard of 8-Bit Theater, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, VG Cats, Penny Arcade, or are familiar with webcomics in general. The same applies here. Just because <i>you</i> haven't heard of TTA does not mean that anyone else has. As it has been stated before in this discussion, there is a large following of the series and of Chris Niosi, not just on its forum, but with many other (and, according to Wikipedia, notable) individuals and groups (<a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonus_Stage_3f9a.html" title="Bonus Stage">Matt Wilson</a> for example). From what I can see, there is only one person who nominates articles for deletion. That being said, if each article nominated for deletion <i>was</i> deleted just because the Wikipedian that suggested the deletion hadn't heard of it, then it would eventually get to the point where all of Wikipeadia would be deleted. I think I have made my point by this time. Were you able to follow all of that, or did I use too many big words for your brain to comprehend? Cukeman 00:25, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been a member of this web based database for an extended period of time. I am not a single purpose account, I was simply unaware my account had not been signed in. Despite the fact that two people have argued, and one had made an angered attack out of frustration does not hinder the points made. Despite the fact the sprite based series was not exceedingly well known does not mean it does not have a following, or is situated in truth. Infact, I, among many others, use Wikipedia to look up information on things we don't know too terribly much about. Isn't that the entire point of an encyclopedic database?

<ul>
<li>So, to boil it down to the simplest terms, all you want is proof of existence as a source of information prior to being HERE in WIki (Verifiability) and proof of having some sort of reaonable impact according to your code (Notability), right? Fair enough. I will begin with Verifiability. Simply spoken, anything that has an existence prior to being mentioned here, on Wiki, is an external existence that can be looked up and found to exist somewhere else but here. If I look up TTA on Google, the first thing I'm going to find is not its Wikipedia entry. It has a site, and there is information and media, therefore it's verified. The link's right in the page. Have a look and enjoy yourself. NOW, I will hit notability. Heh heh heh... I've been looking around this place, especially at flash cartoon references and online comics. You've got quite a list here. I'm impressed. There's a whole lot here that I haven't even heard of. I guess, knowing that, I'd certainly want their pages to remain afloat if I wanted to look up stuff about it without hassle. The case you're creating would eliminate that for TTA, thus creating a gap of information. TTA is, largely enough, no different from popular sprite comics or flash cartoons that you have listed there. Actually, I'd say it's better than some. Are you trying to say Peanut Butter Jelly Time is some how more important than an excellent show with a plot? Hardly... That banana's just a repeated meme. And having lost an arguement about a meme here earlier (See <i>A Man In Black</i> about "Objection!"), the thought that that would deserve to be here - nay, alot of the other stuff here - more than TTA strictly confounds me. To me, it would stink of hypocrasy. And that's my arguement. Have a nice day. 204.215.201.47 14:01, 28 August 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>

<li>Sorry, but I don't buy that, Mr. Admin. Your definition is ever so slightly askew, and if this whole site operates under that principle, then you are the caretaker to a swiss cheese factory.

<li>Actually, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says, and I quote, "Web specific-content is notable if it meets <i>any <b>one</b></i> of the following criteria..." As such, as long as TTA has at least <i>one</i> of those three items, it's defines as notable. The third criterion is read as follows: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Unless I am mistaken, Fireball20xl, the host, constitutes as "distribution of the content", and all staff members of the site are completely independant of Chris Niosi, unless "being friends with" is a reason to say otherwise, which is preposterous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cukeman (<a href="../../../c/u/k/User_talk%7ECukeman_ff1d.html" title="User talk:Cukeman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cukeman_d861.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cukeman">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>(Points to previous comment.) Dodging the issue of the site's shortcomings in reliability does not make you right. By quoting an inefficient and outdated standard, you are not actually proving anything. You have a responsibility to make available the flow of information both important and not. As long as it isn't total crap, it should be alright. Reliability means that it's not hearsay. That's all. Putting a halt to this is like shirking responsibility. You're not thinking of right or wrong, because there's certainly nothing wrong with this page or site attached. You're being rather petty just because <i>you</i> don't think this has any impact on people. Except, of course, that that cannot be true if it is maintained and kept intact by the people who like it. Lemme tell ya. A bunch of fans may not necessarily equal the power of your Admin status, but your status as that Admin does not make you right by default. Go hunt after something with harmful content and REAL questionable material. This isn't the droid- Errr, page you're looking for. 130.49.145.110 20:43, 28 August 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>
<li>On the other hand, surely you can admit that it's quite difficult to have a third-party with something as an animation series. You claim that the forums that holds the TTA forum is not third-party, you claim that Psyguy, the webmaster of Fireball20xl (who, at the time he began hosting Kirbopher, only hosted his friends who needed and wanted a host), is not third-party, and you claim that (and this is a <i>very</i> wild guess here) about 5,000 people (including TFS forum members, deviantART and Sheezy Art members, and a couple miscellanious forums) who all support the information in the article is not third-party, so what is third-party? Or are you going to stop giving partial bullshit and give us pure bullshit (and if you think I'm being uncivil, I haven't gotten started)? Cukeman 20:59, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third-party would consist of separate publications, from something like <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_%28magazine%29.html" title="Wired (magazine)">Wired</a>, <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, or some online news source. All information has to be previously <i>published</i> for it to be a part of Wikipedia per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Basically, a third-party source is a publication that would be generally considered accountable and trustworthy and is not associated with the subject at all.

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> Yes, this is what I have been speaking of. You, the Admin of Wikipedia, may not be actually making a personal attack, but you are, in fact, creating its evil cousin known as "gross negligence". Under normal circumstances, your reasoning would make sense, except that the situation is not cut and dry, not black and white. I will say a person is not reliable information. <i>One</i> person. Several dozen? Tons more? Different story. What you don't realize here is that we live in an age where people with a common goal can create <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_on_a_Plane_6177.html" title="Snakes on a Plane">something from nothing</a> by sheer force of will and desire alone. Therefore, a people (as in many more than one) can have a notable, verifiable, reliable effect on things. Mewchu, here, sums up everything I've been saying. TTA belongs here as much as anything else, in fact more so than alot of other stuff. I wager roughly one-third of the information made here is a waste of time by being total trash in the first place. Furthermore, I have not seen a satisfactory answer to quite a large number of good points made here. So, on top of Mewchu's statement, I place another. If you feel the need to delete this place in the line of duty, that's one thing, but to come here and open a discussion and then pay almost no real attention to what's being <i>said</i> is <b>not acceptable</b>. If you're going to discuss something, discuss it. Make your counter-statements heard systematically and well-thought in response. Thus far, I find little in this debate to dissuade me from my arguements. 204.215.201.101 03:21, 29 August 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre, Displeased.</li>

<li>I would like to get more opinions from other editors outside of those of us currently in debate. I would suggest that if the closing admin finds validity in both sides of the argument, they relist this to attempt to form a consesus. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, pay attention. You see all the nice big paragraphs with opinions expressed and claims made in full relevance to the topic at hand? This is not a vote. This is a <i>discussion</i>. It even says so up top, so don't even use that word in reference to this subject. 130.49.145.125 14:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>
<li>Uh, no duh? You're acting insanely uncivil-- of all the deletion discussions I've read on level with articles like these, yours has to be the most heated. If I ever had an article I didn't want deleted, I doubt I'd be insulting the intellect of Wikipedia administrators and the average Wikipedian like you've all been. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrEmmDee_a207.html" title="User:ArrEmmDee">ArrEmmDee</a> 17:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Now that's only Cukeman, and I don't condone what he's been saying (at least not HOW he's been saying it). Just because he's being inflamitory doesn't mean you shouldn't read everyone else's thoughts, I've been trying very hard to keep things intellectual and agreeable in MY entries. Honestly I can't do anything more than that--<a href="../../../m/e/w/User%7EMewchu11_db0b.html" title="User:Mewchu11">Mewchu11</a> 19:55, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>In my defense, Wickethewok was not thinking or being objective, as he completely ignored half of our arguments. Furthermore, if "be an ass-kiss to the people in charge or shut up" is the rule of the road as opposed to "open discussion, in the sense that we are all equal here", then, well, you may as well delete any article nominated for deletion, since the defenders of the article can't really say anything to defend their argument. All I'm doing is being more forceful in my opinion and my showing how the way Wikipedia is run is not on a level playing field, so to speak. Cukeman 20:57, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, Cuke, I'm getting the message across just fine while still maintaining my bad attitude and not even stepping on the staff guy's toes. However, that does not mean I have to be all nice about it, which I won't. This is not my beutiful house. This is not my beautiful wife. Same as it every was...and so on. What my big issue is, right now, is that my opposition can't formulate an opinion without pulling out a red herring, making a hasty - very hasty - generalization, or avoids the statement at hand when faced with rebuttal. How utterly aggravating to find a communication on the part of the aggressors... 130.49.145.116 20:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's an article about a series of Flash animations, so you'd expect it to show up on google, yet it gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tvtome-adventures%22" class="extiw" title="google:&quot;tvtome-adventures&quot;">39 unique hits</a> (from wikipedia mirrors and message boards). The site it's on has an alexa rank of around 40,000, yet the traffic ranking shows that this particular series gets less than 1% of those hits. There's no notability shown above, just lots of shouting, and there are no reliable sources independent of the site that even mention it. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 10:18, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nice try, but no dice there. A rehashed argument that's been debunked can't possibly hold any meaning here. By default, your words can't be true if it's already gotten shot down. You either have to come up with something new or come up with some sort of rebuttal. Recycling it doesn't make it better. Face it. You have no real reason to go through with this. It's all fluff, showmanship. I can think of plenty of reasons to keep TTA, as I have already, but not one single reason to drop it that makes any sort of rational sense. 204.215.200.37 01:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC) The Lord Massacre</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe she should have some fame outside of who she is related to. As far as the reference to June Carter Cash singing the song about her that could be put as a footnote in a June Carter Cash discography article. If anything it appears on google that the song may be more well known than the actual individual. Results for <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Anastasia_Lowe_7d5c.html" title="Tiffany Anastasia Lowe">TAL</a> herself are links to her father-in-law's webpage and her myspace page. Finally if she is a notable singer, etc. where is her discography? If this article isn't deleted it severely needs to be rewritten to the point that half of the article doesn't contain her lineage. Jaedza 06:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Is the song (rather than the girl) famous enough to have its own page? If not, a bullet point on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Carter_Cash_3f00.html" title="June Carter Cash">June Carter Cash</a> is enough. <a href="../../../d/y/b/User%7EDybryd_6f7d.html" title="User:Dybryd">Dybryd</a> 08:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>If this article is merged it might be most appropriate in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Carter_5d3b.html" title="Carlene Carter">Carlene Carter</a> article since she is biologically the closest person to <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Anastasia_Lowe_7d5c.html" title="Tiffany Anastasia Lowe">TAL</a>. The way it reads is that <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Lowe_19aa.html" title="Nick Lowe">Nick Lowe</a> adopted TAL and is not her biological father. I think it would be a great idea and I would be willing to research the family life of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Carter_5d3b.html" title="Carlene Carter">Carlene Carter</a>. According to the bio that is on the aformeantioned page she had two children of which TAL must be one of them. Oh on a side note I calculated her birth date on the basis of the fact that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Carter_5d3b.html" title="Carlene Carter">Carlene Carter</a> was born on 26 Sept 1955 so we can assume that TAL was born between 26 Sept 1971 and 25 Sept 1972.

<li><b>Delete</b> - big-brother-cruft. From what I can see, the subject of the article is only credited with being runner-up on series 3 - and the winner of that series doesn't even have an article, so how can Danielle Reyes be notable enough? Her notability is not asserted in the article - a key requirement of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information - and WP does not need articles on every single big brother contestant (as in appears things are starting to go).

<li><b>Keep</b> Signficant involvement on a hit show, in two seasons. Unless we apply a double standard to reality TV, versus other types of TV shows, there's no justification for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> realitycrufts per JPS. I've previously pondered this one and consider her pretty borderline. The fact that she was invited back counts in her favour, but it's doesn't contribute to her life outside BB. 334 Ghits out of 17,300 for "danielle reyes". Easy to miss important stuff, as the hits include a vast majority of porno sites, blog entries, and a number of others related to BB. Then there are also a number of other Daninelle Reyeses, including varsity basketball player, Notre Dame dancer, Wisconsin U person, and daniellereyes.com, which is a girl's amateur nudity site. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Like hall monitors.</p>
<p>Oh, and User DS, don't be bolding "delete" in front of me! Man, learn some manners! I am going to find a page that understands me. Not like WIKEPEDIA, the home for stupid delete monitors. Shesh!

<li><b>Comment</b> It's far easier to delete an article than to create it- we're not really wasting any time. However, if you repost it, it will be deleted and probably <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">protected</a>. Also, the reason he bolded "delete" is because we're supposed to- this way people can quickly see our opinions.

You can use <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_pages.html" title="Google pages">Google pages</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">geocities</a> for stuff like that.

The FaxTalk name has been used since 1989 and was one of the original PC based fax applications and I thought that it was important that the term be listed.

<li>Sir, Terra Online has been a popular website for a while. It had just shut down about 2 years ago, and it is merging back up. The reason it is not on google is because the URL has changed. This is just a temporary URL for now. Give it some time. (Exoma 00:36, 26 August 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In this case, it still isn't allowed because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Basically, you can't write articles about topics that "will" be notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Terra Online is already quite notable though. But let me get this straight...once this website is on a website, for example, like google, then it would be able to obtain an article of its own? Even if numurous users already contribute to the article without being on google? (I don't mean to change the subject, but I saw you're a leafs fan. Good job, sir.

<li>No, we judge websites by how many <i>thousands</i> of links there are from other sites, which show up on google.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. The creator of this article is a known pedophile and uses Wikipedia as a venue to attract potential victims.

Moral issues aside, his website is non-notable and does not meet the criteria for inclusion at Wikipedia. He has also abused Wikipedia by deleting opposing discussion.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Terra Online was shut down two years previously because of the claims of its shady practices with illegal pornography distribution.

<li><b>Keep</b> Claiming Eric Jackson isn't notable enough for Wikipedia is like saying Jimbo isn't important enough.

<dd>Another comment: Jackson would be notable if all he'd done was be a vice president of PayPal (when it was a startup). Now he's also the publisher of the Minuteman book (Corsi and Gilchrist), which means he and his authors are in the news constantly.

The sum of his achievements could perhaps justify his inclusion. His edited book 'Thank you mr bush' has an A-rank in the 572k; his authored book "Man of Destiny: The Fall And Rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger" is in the 2.2 millionth. No sign of multiple independent reviews of either. There appears to be a consensus view here at wiki that editorships do not confer notability.

<dd>There is no reliable source that demonstrates that Rod Martin played any management role at Paypal. He is not mentioned in any PayPal histories that I have seen. You need to familiarize yourself with Wikipedia rules on reliable sources. Furthermore, being one of the fifty or so members of the Arlington Group is not inherently noteworthy. You are not seriously contending that all the groups listed on the Arlington Group's website are noteworthy, are you? (TeenMania? New Yorkers for Constitutional Rights?) Finally, he is not the leader of a consequential organization, he is the programmer for a self-promoting website. You seem to continue to avoid the point that no claim that the website makes about its own achievements is independently verifiable. The verbal games you are playing here illustrate why Wikipedia needs to be more than a group of articles that refer to each other; rather, they need to refer to something real and verifiable in the outside world.</dd>

The membership of CNP is secret; its existence as such is not. As usual, DelosHarriman is confusing two things that are entirely different. Finally, what is your citation for the idea that we are required to accept politicians' claims about themselves and not apply any scrutiny to them? Please provide the wikipedia rule. This has nothing to do with "not liking" Rod Martin, and I do not respect your attempt to divert attention away from the rule that content must be verifiable.</dd>
