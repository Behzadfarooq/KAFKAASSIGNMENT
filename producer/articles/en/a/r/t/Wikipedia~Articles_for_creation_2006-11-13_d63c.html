<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>Chosen as president and chief executive officer on November 27, 2000, Jon R. Wallace, DBA, immediately began building upon the legacy of his predecessors and envisioning the next level of God-honoring excellence for <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azusa_Pacific_University_9cbc.html" title="Azusa Pacific University">Azusa Pacific University</a>.</p>
<p>Strong leadership from President Wallace and the Board of Trustees facilitated an efficient team focused on education and enrichment. A new provost and the reorganization of that office propelled the university’s goal to recruit, retain, and develop the highest quality professors in every discipline. Wallace provided additional resources for these incoming faculty members and the subsequent enrollment increase by overseeing the completion of the Duke Academic Complex which houses Haggard School of Theology and Stamps Theological Library, as well as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Hall_c89d.html" title="Trinity Hall">Trinity Hall</a>, accommodating 350 student residents.</p>
<p>Focusing on developing a highly qualified faculty; maintaining academic quality and transformational scholarship; integrating faith and learning; ensuring academic and institutional service and support; cultivating future and innovative educational initiatives; committing to responsible stewardship, diversity, and globalization; and implementing a comprehensive capital campaign, Wallace’s vision for the next decade encompasses both the detailed steps and the innovative ideas necessary to continue <a href="../../../a/p/u/APU_de40.html" title="APU">APU</a>’s growth and success.</p>
<p>A published author and sought-after speaker, Wallace attends a local church, where he has served as an elder. He enjoys cooking, outdoor exercise, and family time. His wife is an assistant professor of prior learning assessment in APU’s Human Development Program and has recently completed her studies for a <a href="../../../p/h/2E/Ph.D._5b53.html" title="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> in Higher Education. They have three children.</p>

<p>But before Fans of Fantasy, there was Woods Between Worlds (WBW), and the owner was Kyle. It was closed down, for inactive members. At the time, both Kyle and Tom were making fantasy sites. Though, both agreed to use Tom's site, and combine. Thus bringing Fans of Fantasy.</p>

<p>Humble Beginnings</p>
<p>Global City Innovative College (GCIC) began formal operations in 2002. It was the dream of a young group of professionals and entrepreneurs. With the renewed demand for nurses especially in the industrialized countries, the group decided to try and put up a Nursing school sometime in 2001. Fortunately, they have acquired a large space available at the new Bonifacio Global City area in the former Fort Bonifacio military reservation. The space was then developed to breed quality educated nursing professionals.</p>
<p>Much like the many and varied businesses that surround it, GCIC has typified the incredible growth and even brighter long term potential in the field of education, with enrolment nearly tripling barely into its second full school year of operations.</p>
<p>The school also offers degree programs in BSBA Major in Business Management, BS Accountancy and BS Education (Elementary, Secondary, Special Education and Early Childhood Education). Caregiver and Medical Transcription are also being offered as technical vocational courses.</p>
<p>Truly GCIC is on the rise and the future can only get bigger and brighter, thanks to the pioneering spirit of the young professionals, the dedication of a highly experienced faculty and staff, and the can do attitude of the students that make up the GCIC family.</p>
<p>PRESENT TIMES</p>
<p>GCIC is committed to provide updated, relevant and innovative courses and programs that will equip its students for global excellence. GCIC students are given the tools and facilities necessary to excel in the global field. Creativity and concern to society are given importance to create future leaders in the field of healthcare, IT, business and education. GCIC graduates will distinguish themselves through dedication, hard-work and competence in their respective fields.</p>
<p>Community Service</p>
<p>Global City Innovative College envisions a creative and responsive outreach partnership and people empowerment. Rising to the task, GCIC provides the students opportunities to understand the socio-economic, political and cultural reality as the bases for a relevant and holistic educational system. Students undertake a capability program that is multi-disciplinary and gender-balanced through consultative and participating process.</p>
<p>Thus, GCIC students are exposed to different communities for them to be socially conscious and dynamic individuals, who will provide transparent leadership based on excellence and organize stable communities.</p>
<p>Academic Programs</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing addresses the needs of today’s internationally competent nurses. GCIC plays a leading role in training and health education, providing clinical education in many areas of nursing. Students have the opportunities to work both in rural and metropolitan health care settings, thereby gaining experience and insight into varied areas of nursing. The program curriculum provides students with skills, attitudes and qualifications required for a rewarding career. Various preparations like mentoring, board reviews (GCFNS and NCLEX) and TOEFL licensure exam are incorporated in the nursing program.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration provides instruction in business skills. The program combines a well rounded education with development of managerial and decision-making skills. Its innovative approach includes hands on programs, seminars, case studies, real world situation interaction and guest resource talks from the country’s respected executives and entrepreneurs. The GCIC promise is that each student, upon graduation, will know how to put up and run his own business.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science in Accountancy opens the door to a stimulating accounting career for students. The program curriculum is co-designed by Punongbayan and Araullo, a leading professional business services firm and member of Grant Thornton International, one of the world’s leading organizations of independently owned and managed accounting and consultancy firms. The curriculum guarantees you a comprehensive preparation for the boards and prepares you for today’s much in-demand positions at Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firms even before you take the boards.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science in Education was created in response to the growing local and foreign demand for teachers. The program balances theoretical study, professional study and practical experience. On-site learning sessions at neighboring schools starts early as second year, providing an early exposure to the real world setting of education. Preparations for the Licensure Exam for Teachers (LET) have been incorporated into the curriculum.</p>
<p>GCIC also offers two (2) technical/vocational courses: the Professional Caregiver and Medical Transcription course.</p>
<p>The GCIC Advantage</p>
<p>GCIC’s primary purpose is to provide value education and innovation to students. The school is located at the newly developed Bonifacio Global City where modern facilities and environment friendly community makes it conducive to learning. The school‘s indoor facility enjoys centralized air-conditioning. The classrooms and amphitheater are equipped with state of the art audio-visual devices for lectures and other presentations and provide each student with ample space for learning and comfort.

Modules are designed catering to the needs of the multi-racial, multi-ethnic clients around the world. Cultural competency has become the main focus of the GCIC curriculum. On top of these, GCIC offers affordable tuition fees and provides financial aid and scholarships to eligible students.</p>
<p>Accreditation</p>
<p>In its pursuit to provide quality and innovative education and after four (4) years of hard work, Global City Innovative College finally got its well deserved CHED Government Recognition No. 037 Series of 2006 for its Bachelor of Science in Nursing Academic Program.</p>

<li>GCIC may be a worthwhile entry in the Wikipedia. However, there two problems with this proposal. First, it reads like a promotional entry for the college. An encyclopedic entry must be written in a neutral, objective style, describing the relevant facts about the college. Second, there are no sources provided for the information in this proposal. Wikipedia cannot accept articles lacking reliable, verifiable sources. •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 17:20, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-13_d63c.html" title="Edit section: Entity realism (entry is now online, submitted by registered user...)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Entity realism <i>(entry is now online, submitted by registered user...)</i></span></h2>
<p>Entity realism is a philosophical position within the debate about <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_realism.html" title="Scientific realism">scientific realism</a>. Whereas traditional scientific realism argues that our best scientific theories are true, or approximately true, or closer to the truth than their predecessors, entity realism does not commit itself to judgments concerning the truth of scientific theories. Instead, entity realism claims that the theoretical entities that feature in scientific theories, e.g. 'electrons', should be regarded as real if and only if they refer to phenomena that can be routinely used to create effects in domains that can be investigated independently. 'Manipulative success' thus becomes the criterion by which to judge the reality of (typically unobservable) scientific entities. As <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hacking_3dd0.html" title="Ian Hacking">Ian Hacking</a>, the main proponent of this formulation of entity realism, puts it (referring to an experiment he observed in a Stanford laboratory, where electrons and positrons were sprayed, one after the other, onto a superconducting metal sphere), "if you can spray them, then they are real." Entity realism has been an influential position partly because it coincided with a general trend in philosophy of science , and science studies more generally, to downplay the role of theories and put more emphasis on experimentation and scientific practice. Thus, entity realism sometimes is also called 'instrumental realism' or 'experimental realism'. While many philosophers acknowledge the intuitive pull of entity realism, it has also been strongly (some would say: conclusively) criticised, both as being too restrictive (in that it ignores entities that are observable yet do not lend themselves to manipulation) and as being too permissive (to the extent that seemingly successful instances of manipulation may turn out to be spurious).</p>

Father John Murphy was one of the leaders of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798_64e0.html" title="Irish Rebellion of 1798">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford.html" title="Wexford">wexford</a>. Ironically he was at first against it, and in fact actively encouraged his parishoners to give up their arms and sign an oath of allegiance to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Crown_e446.html" title="British Crown">British Crown</a>. After the defeat at Vinegar Hill he was executed and his body mutilated. He has gone down in the history of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> as a great hero of the rebellion in 1798, for his sincerity and his willingness to die for his people and country.</p>
<p><b>Early Life</b></p>
<p>He was born at Tincurry in the Parish of Ferns, County Wexford in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1753.html" title="1753">1753</a>, the youngest son of Thomas and Johanna Murphy. He sailed for <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> in early <a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a> and studied in <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seville.html" title="Seville">Seville</a>, Spain for the priesthood which is where alot of the clergy in Ireland recieved their education due to the persecution of Catholics and most notably the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_Laws_82c5.html" title="Penal Laws">Penal Laws</a> In the spring of <a href="../../../1/7/7/1779.html" title="1779">1779</a>, Fr. Murphy's hard work and commitment to his faith was rewarded when he was finally ordained as a priest</p>
<p>On his return to Ireland he became the parish priest of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolavogue.html" title="Boolavogue">Boolavogue</a> (5 miles north-east of <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enniscorthy.html" title="Enniscorthy">enniscorthy</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a>. In 1798 he was described as being `"about 45 years old, light complexioned, bald pated and about five feet nine inches high. He was well made, uniting strength and agility".</p>
<p><b>Fr Murphy prior to the rebellion</b></p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a> the English growing fearful of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Irishmen_2902.html" title="United Irishmen">United Irishmen</a> and the influence of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_France_a6ce.html" title="Revolutionary France">revolutionary France</a>, had procurred an oath of allegiance from many of the Catholic clergy. <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Wexford_4848.html" title="County Wexford">County Wexford</a> was besieged by the North Cork Militia who searched the country side for arms and members of the United Irishmen under the Arms proclamation, and used <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a> to the fullest. In this atmosphere Fr. John Murphy encouraged his parishoners to give up their arms. Many of them did, only to be shot at by soldiers after relinquishing their weapons. Soon afterwards, after seeing the continuing atrocities regaurdless of people giving up their arms Fr Murphy became disenchanted because the protection under the terms of the Arms Proclamation seemed to be ignored by crown forces. He is quoted as advising his people "that they had better die courageously in the field, than to be butchered in their houses". There are also accounts of the yeomen in the area burning his church (and others) at Boolavogue.</p>
<p><b>Fr Murphy's involvment in the rebellion</b></p>
<p>It seems that on the night of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">26 May</a> (1798), in Harrow the <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeomen.html" title="Yeomen">yeomen</a> (Camilla Cavalry) clashed with some armed men and Fr Murphy who were protecting their homes. The Cavalry demanded the arms (although some accounts hint at a volley being fired as well) and they were met with open resistance, shots were fired and 2 yeomen were killed including the lietenant in command. Thus "The firstblow of the insurrection in Wexford was now struck”.</p>
<p>There were reprisals on the part of the crown forces and much of the county was scorched, many houses burnt, and a group of people on Kilthomas Hill were killed on suspicion of being rebels. Fr Murphy and his men, now outlaws, numbering upwards of a thousand, camped at Oulart Hill. These were badly armed and had little or no millitary training but it seems that they had an able leader in Fr Murphy and the other local <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Irishmen_2902.html" title="United Irishmen">United Irishmen</a> leaders (<a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Roche_bc7b.html" title="Edward Roche">Edward Roche</a>, Morgan Byrne, Thomas Donovan, George Sparks, Fr Micheal Murphy, Fr Mogue Kearns, Fr Roche and Bagenal Harvey)</p>
<p>They were attacked and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Oulart_Hill_9ec8.html" title="Battle of Oulart Hill">Battle of Oulart Hill</a> followed, Fr Murphy's forces won and again in Enniscorthy and other victories soon followed; (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_Irish_rebellion_1798_0fb5.html" title="Battles of Irish rebellion 1798">Battles of Irish rebellion 1798</a>) swelling the Irish rebel forces and their weapon supply. However defeats at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Ross_f2c4.html" title="New Ross">New Ross</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arklow.html" title="Arklow">Arklow</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtownbarry.html" title="Newtownbarry">Newtownbarry</a>, meant a loss of confidence and discipline. Fr John Murphy had returned to the headquarters of the rebellion at <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinegar_Hill_dc4d.html" title="Vinegar Hill">Vinegar Hill</a> before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arklow_434c.html" title="Battle of Arklow">Battle of Arklow</a> and was attempting to reinforce its defences. 20,000 troops eventually poured into Wexford inflicting defeat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vinegar_Hill_12ae.html" title="Battle of Vinegar Hill">Battle of Vinegar Hill</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_21.html" title="June 21">21 June</a>. However the encirclement of the hill wasnt complete and many rebels escaped.</p>
<p><b>Defeat and Death</b></p>
<p>After this defeat some sued for terms and surrendered (General Fr Philip Roche) however Fr John Murphy it seems had lost all respect for the crown forces and him and the other leaders attempted to spread the rebellion and link up with other rebels headed towards the midlands. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26th.html" title="June 26th">June 26th</a> at the Battle of Kilcumney Hill in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Carlow_04cc.html" title="County Carlow">County Carlow</a>, the Irish forces were again defeated. Following mroe clashes the Irish forces began to retreat again towards <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford.html" title="Wexford">Wexford</a>. They reached Scullogue Gap but Fr Murphy and another leader James Gallgher got sperated in some fog from the main group (who went on to fight for 5 more years from the <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicklow.html" title="Wicklow">Wicklow</a> mountains). Fr Murphy decided to head for the safety of a relatives house in <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tullow.html" title="Tullow">Tullow</a>, County Carlow when the fog cleared. After a few days some yeomen captured him and James Gallagher in a farmyard on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a>. They were brought to Tullow later that day where they were brought before a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tribunal.html" title="Military tribunal">military tribunal</a> and charged with committing <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> against the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_crown.html" title="British crown">British crown</a> and sentenced to death. Both men were torturted in an attempt to extract more information from them, Fr Murphy was stripped, flogged, hanged, decapited, his corpse burnt in a barrel of tar and his head impaled on a spike oppisite the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_church.html" title="Catholic church">Catholic church</a> on the Sessions House. This final gesture was meant to be a warning to all others who would dare to take up arms against the British crown.</p>
<p><b>Legacy</b></p>
<p>So ended the life of Fr John Murphy, as well as that of James Gallagher and the other leaders of the <a href="../../../1/7/9/1798_rebellion.html" title="1798 rebellion">1798 rebellion</a>. They are still a cause for inspiration in the modern <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican.html" title="Republican">republican</a> movement, and shows to what extent certain Priests have gone to protect their flock. He is considered one of the many <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish.html" title="Irish">Irish</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs.html" title="Martyrs">martyrs</a> who died for the cause of Irish freedom and the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> He is remembered in the Irish Ballad of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolavogue.html" title="Boolavogue">Boolavogue</a> which was written in 1898 to commemorate the rebellion.</p>

<p>CJ (Born 27 December 1967) - Guitarist and second vocalist for pop metallers <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wildhearts_f682.html" title="The Wildhearts">The Wildhearts</a>.</p>
<p>CJ started out playing guitar for UK glam rockers the Tattooed Love Boys, before joining the Wildhearts in August 1989. It was reported that Wildhearts mainman Ginger had been watching the Tattooed Love Boys play at a London Hippodrome rock night. Ginger had been at the gig with his friend, and Kerrang! writer/cartoonist, Ray Zell, and confidently told Zell that he would form a band with CJ one day.</p>
<p>CJ stayed with the Wildhearts before leaving the band in 1994. Kerrang! magazine cited the reasong for the depature in its issue on July 20, 1994, that CJ and Ginger had "grown apart".</p>
<p>After leaving the Wildhearts, CJ went on to form <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeycrack.html" title="Honeycrack">Honeycrack</a>, with former Wildhearts live keyboard player Willie Dowling.</p>
<p>The band split around 1997, with CJ forming a new band called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jellys_cb09.html" title="The Jellys">the Jellys</a>, which also featured another Wildheart, Stidi.</p>
<p>Then in 2001, CJ returned to the Wildhearts fold, for their 10th anniversary tour. The band went on to release one studio album, a collection of B-sides and a live album on the Gut Records label before going on another hiatus.</p>
<p>During this time CJ wrote three songs and co-wrote one with Ginger.</p>
<p>The three songs he wrote were Out From The Inside, O.C.D. and Hit It On The Head; with the the co-written song being So Into You, which reached number 26 in the UK singles charts.</p>
<p>As of November 2006, CJ has recorded a solo album entitled Thirteen. On his myspace page CJ said that he would playing some live shows with guitarist Paul Grant (ex <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Colours_Red_30dc.html" title="3 Colours Red">3 Colours Red</a>) Lee Wray (Zen Motel) on bass, and on drums Jon Solomon (Modern English). CJ himself said: "These guys are known as The Satellites. The album should be out early next year and we will be touring. I'm also looking for other projects and bands to work with and I am based in London and Tokyo so not tied down geographically."</p>

<p>Baba Dharam Dass is a holy man whose Tomb is located near the bank of a creek called (Deoka or Deokay or Degh) near the town of Pasrur near SIalkot in Pakistan Punjab.</p>
<p>Baba Dharam Dass is the ancestor of all Jain's who hail from Pasrur. Most Jains rever him and worship him during important birth and other ceremonies in their families.</p>
<p>Descendents of Baba Dharam Dass had to flee Pasrur during the partition of India into India and Pakistan during 1947. Unable to trvale back to Pasrur to perform important rituals on the tomb of Baba Dharam Dass, they have created two replicas of his tomb, one in the town of Meerut near Delhi and other in Ludhiana in Indian Punjab.</p>
<p>Pasrur has a famous tomb of a Jain Baba, Baba Dharam Dass who is the ancestor of most Jains living in Pasrur. His tomb is now in ruins. Last recorded visit to the tomb was made by some Jains from Delhi in 1980's to retrieve a few bricks from it to incorporate in the replica's of the Baba Dharam Dass tomb made one in Meerut and another in Ludhiana in India. It is the author's opinion that this tomb is located in the vicinity of the Gurdwara Manji Sahib in Pasrur in Deoka.</p>
<p>A Jain merchant trader from the town of 'Oshowal' (Oswal in district Marwar in the state of Rajasthan in India) who had financially supported Raja Maan Singh was granted a large part of fertile land which is now Pasrur. The Jain merchant had to move to and live in Pasrur in order to avail of his grant. This was gladly accepted and he became the 'Jaamindaar' of the area of Pasrur.</p>
<p>The new owner of the land brought many farmers from his home town and from neighbouring areas to till the land. Slowly a small town developed in the area. One of the descendents of the original Jaamindaar was 'Baba Dharam Dass' whose tomb is located on the other side of the creek named 'Deoka' (or is it Degh?) just outside Pasrur boundary.</p>

<p>The Alberti Cipher was the first ever polyalphabetic Cipher.</p>
<p>Created in the late 15th century, circa.1470, by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Battista_Alberti_70e1.html" title="Leon Battista Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, it was the peak of cryptographics at that time.</p>

<p>Its creator was <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Battista_Alberti_70e1.html" title="Leon Battista Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, an illegitimate son of an Italian nobleman, was also interested in architecture, painting and writing, though his influence upon Western cryptography was probably his greatest acheivement.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-13_d63c.html" title="Edit section: The Cipher">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Cipher</span></h3>
<p>The Alberti Cipher initially consisted of two <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar_cipher.html" title="Caesar cipher">Caesar Shift</a> cipher performed on the plain text, alternating at random between the two shifts. The change between ciphers was marked by the Capitalisation of the first letter of the section of text to be encrypted with the new shift.</p>
<p>The cipher was later made more complicated by using 3 or 4 different Caesar shifts alternating between them in alphabetical order, again highlighted by a Capital Letter.</p>
<p>Finally, Alberti started using more random substitutions, but the substitution cipher would be shifted about, once again denoted by the presence of a capital.</p>
<p>As holding several Casar Alphabets in one's head at the same time is difficult at the least, Alberti used a Cipher Disc consisting of two metal discs, one mobile, and one fixed, both connected to a central spindle so that the inner disc may be rotated. Around the outside of the outer disc are inscribed the lowercase letters of the alphabet, which you would look at according to which letter came next in the text you were trying to encrypt. Around the inside, mobile, disc the UPPERCASE Letters the of the alphabet were written, so that when the inside disc was rotated to the relevant position, the cipher text chracter could be read off from the inner wheel.</p>
<p>To use this Cipher Disc to encrypt a message one would simply chose a starting letter, rotate the wheel until A was encrypted as that chosen letter, encrypt a set of letters, (normally about two sentences worth), then rotate the wheel to a new position and continue encrypitng, remembering to write the first letter of the new cipher as a capital.</p>

<p>Confessions of St. Patrick.</p>
<p>I am Patrick, a sinner, most unlearned, the least of all the faithful, and utterly despised by many. My father was Calpornius, a deacon, son of Potitus, a priest, of the village Bannavem Taburniæ; he had a country seat nearby, and there I was taken captive.</p>
<p>I was then about sixteen years of age. I did not know the true God. I was taken into captivity to Ireland with many thousands of people and deservedly so, because we turned away from God, and did not keep His commandments, and did not obey our priests, who used to remind us of our salvation. And the Lord brought over us the wrath of his anger and scattered us among many nations, even unto the utmost part of the earth, where now my littleness is placed among strangers.</p>
<p>And there the Lord opened the sense of my unbelief that I might at last remember my sins and be converted with all my heart to the Lord my God, who had regard for my abjection, and mercy on my youth and ignorance, and watched over me before I knew Him, and before I was able to distinguish between good and evil, and guarded me, and comforted me as would a father his son.</p>
<p>Hence I cannot be silent, nor, indeed, is it expedient - about the great benefits and the great grace which the lord has deigned to bestow upon me in the land of my captivity; for this we can give to God in return after having been chastened by Him, to exalt and praise His wonders before every nation that is anywhere under the heaven.</p>
<p>Because there is no other God, nor ever was, nor will be, than God the Father unbegotten, without beginning, from whom is all beginning, the Lord of the universe, as we have been taught; and His son Jesus Christ, whom we declare to have always been with the Father, spiritually and ineffably begotten by the Father before the beginning of the world, before all beginning; and by Him are made all things visible and invisible. He was made man, and, having defeated death, was received into heaven by the Father; and He hath given Him all power over all names in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue shall confess to Him that Jesus Christ is Lord and God, in whom we believe, and whose advent we expect soon to be, judge of the living and of the dead, who will render to every man according to his deeds; and He has poured forth upon us abundantly the Holy Spirit, the gift and pledge of immortality, who makes those who believe and obey sons of God and joint heirs with Christ; and Him do we confess and adore, one God in the Trinity of the Holy Name.</p>
<p>For He Himself has said through the Prophet: Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. And again He says: It is honourable to reveal and confess the works of God.</p>
<p>Although I am imperfect in many things, I nevertheless wish that my brethren and kinsmen should know what sort of person I am, so that they may understand my heart's desire.</p>
<p>I know well the testimony of my Lord, who in the Psalm declares: Thou wilt destroy them that speak a lie. And again He says: The mouth that belieth killeth the soul. And the same Lord says in the Gospel: Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it on the day of judgement.</p>
<p>And so I should dread exceedingly, with fear and trembling, this sentence on that day when no one will be able to escape or hide, but we all, without exception, shall have to give an account even of our smallest sins before the judgement of the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>For this reason I had in mind to write, but hesitated until now; I was afraid of exposing myself to the talk of men, because I have not studied like the others, who thoroughly imbibed law and Sacred Scripture, and never had to change from the language of their childhood days, but were able to make it still more perfect. In our case, what I had to say had to be translated into a tongue foreign to me, as can be easily proved from the savour of my writing, which betrays how little instruction and training I have had in the art of words; for, so says Scripture, by the tongue will be discovered the wise man, and understanding, and knowledge, and the teaching of truth.</p>
<p>But of what help is an excuse, however true, especially if combined with presumption, since now, in my old age, I strive for something that I did not acquire in youth? It was my sins that prevented me from fixing in my mind what before I had barely read through. But who believes me, though I should repeat what I started out with?</p>
<p>As a youth, nay, almost as a boy not able to speak, I was taken captive, before I knew what to pursue and what to avoid. Hence to-day I blush and fear exceedingly to reveal my lack of education; for I am unable to tell my story to those versed in the art of concise writing, in such a way, I mean, as my spirit and mind long to do, and so that the sense of my words expresses what I feel.</p>
<p>But if indeed it had been given to me as it was given to others, then I would not be silent because of my desire of thanksgiving; and if perhaps some people think me arrogant for doing so in spite of my lack of knowledge and my slow tongue, it is, after all, written: The stammering tongues shall quickly learn to speak peace.</p>
<p>How much more should we earnestly strive to do this, we, who are, so Scripture says, a letter of Christ for salvation unto the utmost part of the earth, and, though not an eloquent one, yet...written in your hearts, not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God! And again the Spirit witnesses that even rusticity was created by the Highest.</p>
<p>Whence I, once rustic, exiled, unlearned, who does not know how to provide for the future, this at least I know most certainly that before I was humiliated I was like a stone Lying in the deep mire; and He that is mighty came and in His mercy lifted me up, and raised me aloft, and placed me on the top of the wall. And therefore I ought to cry out aloud and so also render something to the Lord for His great benefits here and in eternity - benefits which the mind of men is unable to appraise.</p>
<p>Wherefore, then, be astonished, ye great and little that fear God, and you men of letters on your estates, listen and pore over this. Who was it that roused up me, the fool that I am, from the midst of those who in the eyes of men are wise, and expert in law, and powerful in word and in everything? And He inspired me - me, the outcast of this world - before others, to be the man (if only I could!) who, with fear and reverence and without blame, should faithfully serve the people to whom the love of Christ conveyed and gave me for the duration of my life, if I should be worthy; yes indeed, to serve them humbly and sincerely.</p>
<p>In the light, therefore, of our faith in the Trinity I must make this choice, regardless of danger I must make known the gift of God and everlasting consolation, without fear and frankly I must spread everywhere the name of God so that after my decease I may leave a bequest to my brethren and sons whom I have baptised in the Lord, so many thousands of people.</p>
<p>And I was not worthy, nor was I such that the Lord should grant this to His servant; that after my misfortunes and so great difficulties, after my captivity, after the lapse of so many years, He should give me so great a grace in behalf of that nation, a thing which once, in my youth, I never expected nor thought of.</p>
<p>But after I came to Ireland, every day I had to tend sheep, and many times a day I prayed, the love of God and His fear came to me more and more, and my faith was strengthened. And my spirit was moved so that in a single day I would say as many as a hundred prayers, and almost as many in the night, and this even when I was staying in the woods and on the mountains; and I used to get up for prayer before daylight, through snow, through frost, through rain, and I felt no harm, and there was no sloth in me, as I now see, because the spirit within me was then fervent.</p>
<p>And there one night I heard in my sleep a voice saying to me: `It is well that you fast, soon you will go to your own country.' And again, after a short while, I heard a voice saying to me: `See, your ship is ready.' And it was not near, but at a distance of perhaps two hundred miles, and I had never been there, nor did I know a living soul there; and then I took to flight, and I left the man with whom I had stayed for six years. And I went in the strength of God who directed my way to my good, and I feared nothing until I came to that ship.</p>
<p>And the day that I arrived the ship was set afloat, and I said that I was able to pay for my passage with them. But the captain was not pleased, and with indignation he answered harshly: `It is of no use for you to ask us to go along with us.' And when I heard this, I left them in order to return to the hut where I was staying. And as I went, I began to pray; and before I had ended my prayer, I heard one of them shouting behind me, `Come, hurry, we shall take you on in good faith; make friends with us in whatever way you like.' And so on that day I refused to suck their breasts for fear of God, but rather hoped they would come to the faith of Jesus Christ, because they were pagans. And thus I had my way with them, and we set sail at once.</p>
<p>And after three days we reached land, and for twenty-eight days we travelled through deserted country. And they lacked food, and hunger overcame them; and the next day the captain said to me: `Tell me, Christian: you say that your God is great and all-powerful; why, then, do you not pray for us? As you can see, we are suffering from hunger; it is unlikely indeed that we shall ever see a human being again.'</p>
<p>I said to them full of confidence: `Be truly converted with all your heart to the Lord my God, because nothing is impossible for Him, that this day He may send you food on your way until you be satisfied; for He has abundance everywhere.' And, with the help of God, so it came to pass: suddenly a herd of pigs appeared on the road before our eyes, and they killed many of them; and there they stopped for two nights and fully recovered their strength, and their hounds received their fill for many of them had grown weak and were half-dead along the way. And from that day they had plenty of food. They also found wild honey, and offered some of it to me, and one of them said: `This we offer in sacrifice.' Thanks be to God, I tasted none of it.</p>
<p>That same night, when I was asleep, Satan assailed me violently, a thing I shall remember as long as I shall be in this body. And he fell upon me like a huge rock, and I could not stir a limb. But whence came it into my mind, ignorant as I am, to call upon Helias? And meanwhile I saw the sun rise in the sky, and while I was shouting `Helias! Helias' with all my might, suddenly the splendour of that sun fell on me and immediately freed me of all misery. And I believe that I was sustained by Christ my Lord, and that His Spirit was even then crying out in my behalf, and I hope it will be so on the day of my tribulation, as is written in the Gospel: On that day, the Lord declares, it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</p>
<p>And once again, after many years, I fell into captivity. On that first night I stayed with them, I heard a divine message saying to me: `Two months will you be with them.' And so it came to pass: on the sixtieth night thereafter the Lord delivered me out of their hands.</p>
<p>Also on our way God gave us food and fire and dry weather every day, until, on the tenth day, we met people. As I said above, we travelled twenty-eight days through deserted country, and the night that we met people we had no food left.</p>
<p>And again after a few years I was in Britain with my people. who received me as their son, and sincerely besought me that now at last, having suffered so many hardships, I should not leave them and go elsewhere.</p>
<p>And there I saw in the night the vision of a man, whose name was Victoricus, coming as it were from Ireland, with countless letters. And he gave me one of them, and I read the opening words of the letter, which were, `The voice of the Irish'; and as I read the beginning of the letter I thought that at the same moment I heard their voice, they were those beside the Wood of Voclut, which is near the Western Sea, and thus did they cry out as with one mouth: `We ask thee, boy, come and walk among us once more.'</p>
<p>And I was quite broken in heart, and could read no further, and so I woke up. Thanks be to God, after many years the Lord gave to them according to their cry.</p>
<p>And another night, whether within me, or beside me, I know not, God knoweth, they called me most unmistakably with words which I heard but could not understand, except that at the end of the prayer He spoke thus: `He that has laid down His life for thee, it is He that speaketh in thee'; and so I awoke full of joy.</p>
<p>And again I saw Him praying in me, and I was as it were within my body, and I heard Him above me, that is, over the inward man, and there He prayed mightily with groanings. And all the time I was astonished, and wondered, and thought with myself who it could be that prayed in me. But at the end of the prayer He spoke, saying that He was the Spirit; and so I woke up, and remembered the Apostle saying: The Spirit helpeth the infirmities of our prayer. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, which cannot be expressed in words; and again: The Lord our advocate asketh for us.</p>
<p>And when I was attacked by a number of my seniors who came forth and brought up my sins against my laborious episcopate, on that day indeed was I struck so that I might have fallen now and for eternity; but the Lord graciously spared the stranger and sojourner for His name and came mightily to my help in this affliction Verily, not slight was the shame and blame that fell upon me! I ask God that it may not be reckoned to them as sin.</p>
<p>As cause for proceeding against me they found, after thirty years!, a confession I had made before I was a deacon. In the anxiety of my troubled mind I confided to my dearest friend what I had done in my boyhood one day, nay, in one hour, because I was not yet strong. I know not, God knoweth, whether I was then fifteen years old: and I did not believe in the living God, nor did I so from my childhood, but lived in death and unbelief until I was severely chastised and really humiliated, by hunger and nakedness, and that daily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did not go to Ireland of my own accord. not until I had nearly perished; but this was rather for my good, for thus was I purged by the Lord; and He made me fit so that I might be now what was once far from me that I should care and labour for the salvation of others, whereas then I did not even care about myself.</p>
<p>On that day, then, when I was rejected by those referred to and mentioned above, in that night I saw a vision of the night. There was a writing without honour against my face, and at the same time I heard God's voice saying to me: `We have seen with displeasure the face of Deisignatus' (thus revealing his name). He did not say, `Thou hast seen.' but `We have seen.' as if He included Himself, as He sayeth: He who toucheth you toucheth as it were the apple of my eye.</p>
<p>Therefore I give Him thanks who hath strengthened me in everything, as He did not frustrate the journey upon which I had decided, and the work which I had learned from Christ my Lord; but I rather felt after this no little strength, and my trust was proved right before God and men.</p>
<p>And so I say boldly, my conscience does not blame me now or in the future: God is my witness that I have not lied in the account which I have given you.</p>
<p>But the more am I sorry for my dearest friend that we had to hear what he said. To him I had confided my very soul! And I was told by some of the brethren before that defence, at which I was not present, nor was I in Britain, nor was it suggested by me, that he would stand up for me in my absence. He had even said to me in person: `Look, you should be raised to the rank of bishop!', of which I was not worthy. But whence did it come to him afterwards that he let me down before all, good and evil, and publicly, in a matter in which he had favoured me before spontaneously and gladly, and not he alone, but the Lord, who is greater than all?</p>
<p>Enough of this. I must not, however, hide God's gift which He bestowed upon me in the land of my captivity; because then I earnestly sought Him, and there I found Him, and He saved me from all evil because, so I believe, of His Spirit that dwelleth in me. Again, boldly said. But God knows it, had this been said to me by a man, I had perhaps remained silent for the love of Christ.</p>
<p>Hence, then, I give unwearied thanks to God, who kept me faithful in the day of my temptation, so that today I can confidently offer Him my soul as a living sacrifice, to Christ my Lord, who saved me out of all my troubles. Thus I can say: `Who am I, 0 Lord, and to what hast Thou called me, Thou who didst assist me with such divine power that to-day I constantly exalt and magnify Thy name among the heathens wherever I may be, and not only in good days but also in tribulations?' So indeed I must accept with equanimity whatever befalls me, be it good or evil, and always give thanks to God, who taught me to trust in Him always without hesitation, and who must have heard my prayer so that I, however ignorant I was, in the last days dared to undertake such a holy and wonderful work, thus imitating somehow those who, as the Lord once foretold, would preach His Gospel for a testimony to all nations before the end of the world. So we have seen it, and so it has been fulfilled: indeed, we are witnesses that the Gospel has been preached unto those parts beyond which there lives nobody.</p>
<p>Now, it would be tedious to give a detailed account of all my labours or even a part of them. Let me tell you briefly how the merciful God often freed me from slavery and from twelve dangers in which my life was at stake, not to mention numerous plots, which I cannot express in words; for I do not want to bore my readers. But God is my witness, who knows all things even before they come to pass, as He used to forewarn even me, poor wretch that I am, of many things by a divine message.</p>
<p>How came I by this wisdom, which was not in me, who neither knew the number of my days nor knew what God was? Whence was given to me afterwards the gift so great, so salutary, to know God and to love Him, although at the price of leaving my country and my parents?</p>
<p>And many gifts were offered to me in sorrow and tears, and I offended the donors, much against the wishes of some of my seniors; but, guided by God, in no way did I agree with them or acquiesce. It was not grace of my own, but God, who is strong in me and resists them all, as He had done when I came to the people of Ireland to preach the Gospel, and to suffer insult from the unbelievers, hearing the reproach of my going abroad, and many persecutions even unto bonds, and to give my free birth for the benefit of others; and, should I be worthy, I am prepared to give even my life without hesitation and most gladly for His name, and it is there that I wish to spend it until I die, if the Lord would grant it to me.</p>
<p>For I am very much God's debtor, who gave me such grace that many people were reborn in God through me and afterwards confirmed, and that clerics were ordained for them everywhere, for a people just coming to the faith, whom the Lord took from the utmost parts of the earth, as He once had promised through His prophets: To Thee the gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth and shall say: `How false are the idols that our fathers got for themselves, and there is no profit in them'; and again: `I have set Thee as a light among the gentiles, that Thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost part of the earth.'</p>
<p>And there I wish to wait for His promise who surely never deceives, as He promises in the Gospel: They shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, as we believe the faithful will come from all the world.</p>
<p>For that reason, therefore, we ought to fish well and diligently, as the Lord exhorts in advance and teaches, saying: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men. And again He says through the prophets: Behold, I send many fishers and hunters, saith God, and so on. Hence it was most necessary to spread our nets so that a great multitude and throng might be caught for God, and that there be clerics everywhere to baptize and exhort a people in need and want, as the Lord in the Gospel states, exhorts and teaches, saying: Going therefore now, teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world. And again He says: Go ye therefore into the whole world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned. And again: This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all nations, and then shall come the end. And so too the Lord announces through the prophet, and says: And it shall come to pass, in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And in Osee, He saith: `I will call that which was not my people, my people; ...and her that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy. And it shall be in the place where it was said: ``You are not my people, <i>there they shall be called the sons of the living God.'</i></p>
<p>Hence, how did it come to pass in Ireland that those who never had a knowledge of God, but until now always worshipped idols and things impure, have now been made a people of the Lord, and are called sons of God, that the sons and daughters of the kings of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ?</p>
<p>Among others, a blessed Irishwoman of noble birth, beautiful, full-grown, whom I had baptized, came to us after some days for a particular reason: she told us that she had received a message from a messenger of God, and he admonished her to be a virgin of Christ and draw near to God. Thanks be to God, on the sixth day after this she most laudably and eagerly chose what all virgins of Christ do. Not that their fathers agree with them: no, they often ever suffer persecution and undeserved reproaches from their parents; and yet their number is ever increasing. How many have been reborn there so as to be of our kind, I do not know, not to mention widows and those who practice continence.</p>
<p>But greatest is the suffering of those women who live in slavery. All the time they have to endure terror and threats. But the Lord gave His grace to many of His maidens; for, though they are forbidden to do so, they follow Him bravely.</p>
<p>Wherefore, then, even if I wished to leave them and go to Britain, and how I would have loved to go to my country and my parents, and also to Gaul in order to visit the brethren and to see the face of the saints of my Lord! God knows it! that I much desired it; but I am bound by the Spirit, who gives evidence against me if I do this, telling me that I shall be guilty; and I am afraid of losing the labour which I have begun, nay, not I, but Christ the Lord who bade me come here and stay with them for the rest of my life, if the Lord will, and will guard me from every evil way that I may not sin before Him.</p>
<p>This, I presume, I ought to do, but I do not trust myself as long as I am in this body of death, for strong is he who daily strives to turn me away from the faith and the purity of true religion to which I have devoted myself to the end of my I life to Christ my Lord. But the hostile flesh is ever dragging us unto death, that I is, towards the forbidden satisfaction of one's desires; and I know that in part I did not lead a perfect life as did the other faithful; but I acknowledge it to my! Lord, and do not blush before Him, because I lie not: from the time I came to know Him in my youth, the love of God and the fear of Him have grown in me, and up to now, thanks to the grace of God, I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>And let those who will, laugh and scorn, I shall not be silent; nor shall I hide the signs and wonders which the Lord has shown me many years before they came to pass, as He knows everything even before the times of the world.</p>
<p>Hence I ought unceasingly to give thanks to God who often pardoned my folly and my carelessness, and on more than one occasion spared His great wrath on me, who was chosen to be His helper and who was slow to do as was shown me and as the Spirit suggested. And the Lord had mercy on me thousands and thousands of times because He saw that I was ready, but that I did not know what to do in the circumstances. For many tried to prevent this my mission; they would even talk to each other behind my back and say: `Why does this fellow throw himself into danger among enemies who have no knowledge of God?' It was not malice, but it did not appeal to them because, and to this I own myself, of my rusticity. And I did not realize at once the grace that was then in me; now I understand that I should have done so before.</p>
<p>Now I have given a simple account to my brethren and fellow servants who have believed me because of what I said and still say in order to strengthen and confirm your faith. Would that you, too, would strive for greater things and do better! This will be my glory, for a wise son is the glory of his father.</p>
<p>You know, and so does God, how I have lived among you from my youth in the true faith and in sincerity of heart. Likewise, as regards the heathen among whom I live, I have been faithful to them, and so I shall be. God knows it, I have overreached none of them, nor would I think of doing so, for the sake of God and His Church, for fear of raising persecution against them and all of us, and for fear that through me the name of the Lord be blasphemed; for it is written: Woe to the man through whom the name of the Lord is blasphemed.</p>
<p>For although I be rude in all things, nevertheless I have tried somehow to keep myself safe, and that, too, for my Christian brethren, and the virgins of Christ, and the pious women who of their own accord made me gifts and laid on the altar some of their ornaments and I gave them back to them, and they were offended that I did so. But I did it for the hope of lasting success, in order to preserve myself cautiously in everything so that they might not seize upon me or the ministry of my service, under the pretext of dishonesty, and that I would not even in the smallest matter give the infidels an opportunity to defame or defile.</p>
<p>When I baptized so many thousands of people, did I perhaps expect from any of them as much as half a scruple? Tell me, and I will restore it to you. Or when the Lord ordained clerics everywhere through my unworthy person and I conferred the ministry upon them free, if I asked any of them as much as the price of my shoes, speak against me and I will return it to you.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I spent money for you that they might receive me; and I went to you and everywhere for your sake in many dangers, even to the farthest districts, beyond which there lived nobody and where nobody had ever come to baptize, or to ordain clergy, or to confirm the people. With the grace of the Lord, I did everything lovingly and gladly for your salvation.</p>
<p>All the while I used to give presents to the kings, besides the fees I paid to their sons who travel with me. Even so they laid hands on me and my companions, and on that day they eagerly wished to kill me; but my time had not yet come. And everything they found with us they took away, and me they put in irons; and on the fourteenth day the Lord delivered me from their power, and our belongings were returned to us because of God and our dear friends whom we had seen before.</p>
<p>You know how much I paid to those who administered justice in all those districts to which I came frequently. I think I distributed among them not less than the price of fifteen men, so that you might enjoy me, and I might always enjoy you in God. I am not sorry for it, indeed it is not enough for me; I still spend and shall spend more. God has power to grant me afterwards that I myself may be spent for your souls.</p>
<p>Indeed, I call God to witness upon my soul that I lie not; neither, I hope, am I writing to you in order to make this an occasion of flattery or covetousness, nor because I look for honour from any of you. Sufficient is the honour that is not yet seen but is anticipated in the heart. Faithful is He that promised; He never lieth.</p>
<p>But I see myself exalted even in the present world beyond measure by the Lord, and I was not worthy nor such that He should grant me this. I know perfectly well, though not by my own judgement, that poverty and misfortune becomes me better than riches and pleasures. For Christ the Lord, too, was poor for our sakes; and I, unhappy wretch that I am, have no wealth even if I wished for it. Daily I expect murder, fraud, or captivity, or whatever it may be; but I fear none of these things because of the promises of heaven. I have cast myself into the hands of God Almighty, who rules everywhere, as the prophet says: Cast thy thought upon God, and He shall sustain thee.</p>
<p>So, now I commend my soul to my faithful God, for whom I am an ambassador in all my wretchedness; but God accepteth no person, and chose me for this office, to be, although among His least, one of His ministers.</p>
<p>Hence let me render unto Him for all He has done to me. But what can I say or what can I promise to my Lord, as I can do nothing that He has not given me? May He search the hearts and deepest feelings; for greatly and exceedingly do I wish, and ready I was, that He should give me His chalice to drink, as He gave it also to the others who loved Him.</p>
<p>Wherefore may God never permit it to happen to me that I should lose His people which He purchased in the utmost parts of the world. I pray to God to give me perseverance and to deign that I be a faithful witness to Him to the end of my life for my God.</p>
<p>And if ever I have done any good for my God whom I love, I beg Him to grant me that I may shed my blood with those exiles and captives for His name, even though I should be denied a grave, or my body be woefully torn to pieces limb by limb by hounds or wild beasts, or the fowls of the air devour it. I am firmly convinced that if this should happen to me, I would have gained my soul together with my body, because on that day without doubt we shall rise in the brightness of the sun, that is, in the glory of Christ Jesus our Redeemer, as sons of the living God and joint heirs with Christ, to be made conformable to His image; for of Him, and by Him, and in Him we shall reign.</p>
<p>For this sun which we see rises daily for us because He commands so, but it will never reign, nor will its splendour last; what is more, those wretches who adore it will be miserably punished. Not so we, who believe in, and worship, the true sun, Christ, who will never perish, nor will he who doeth His will; but he will abide for ever as Christ abideth for ever, who reigns with God the Father Almighty and the Holy Spirit before time, and now, and in all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>Behold, again and again would I set forth the words of my confession. I testify in truth and in joy of heart before God and His holy angels that I never had any reason except the Gospel and its promises why I should ever return to the people from whom once before I barely escaped.</p>
<p>I pray those who believe and fear God, whosoever deigns to look at or receive this writing which Patrick, a sinner, unlearned, has composed in Ireland, that no one should ever say that it was my ignorance if I did or showed forth anything however small according to God's good pleasure; but let this be your conclusion and let it so be thought, that, as is the perfect truth, it was the gift of God. This is my confession before I die.</p>

<p>Bogatu is a term generated from the latin word bogarentus and a new demensional pro-creation theory concerning micro-platicisms. In context, this word has come to mean outrageous or outlandish. E.g. A young chimp is bogatu if a frog is appealing to him. There are other textual bases for the term "bogatu" including the old Romanov, Victor Bogatu and his wife Silvia.</p>

<p>At Jefferson, there are five academic teams a student can be put into; PRIDE, STAR, JET, SWAT, and BEAR. PRIDE and STAR are 7th grade teams, JET and SWAT are eigth drage teams, and BEAR is both 7th and 8th. A student cannot chose what team they are on, they are assigned one at the registration into Jefferson. A team decides what hallway the student's locker is located in, what teachers and classes they will have for core subjects, and what homeroom they will be in. However, teams do <b>not</b> affect electives or gym class, although all BEAR students will have 5th period lunch while for the other teams it is random whether they have 4th period lunch (8th graders), 5th period lunch (both grades), or 6th period lunch (7th grade).</p>

<p>In classrooms where <b>assessment for learning</b> is practiced, students know at the outset of a unit of study what they are expected to learn. At the beginning of the unit, the teacher will work with the student to understand what she or he already knows about the topic as well as to identify any gaps or misconceptions (initial/diagnostic <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assessment.html" title="Assessment">assessment</a>). As the unit progresses, the teacher and student work together to assess the student’s knowledge, what she or he needs to learn to improve and extend this knowledge, and how the student can best get to that point (formative assessment). Assessment for learning occurs at all stages of the learning process.</p>
<p>Researchers whose work has informed much of this assessment reform include Ken O’Connor, Grant Wiggins<a href="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, Jay McTighe<a href="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, Richard Stiggins<a href="http://www.assessmentinst.com/staff_rick" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.assessmentinst.com/staff_rick" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam, Thomas Guskey, and Damian Cooper<a href="http://www.damiancooperassessment.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.damiancooperassessment.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>The notion of assessment informing instruction is relatively recent in education. In past decades, teachers would design a unit of study that would typically include objectives, teaching strategies, and resources. An evaluation component—the test or examination—may or may not have been included as part of this design (Cooper, 2006). The student’s mark on this test or exam was taken as the indicator of his or her understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Among the most comprehensive listing of principles of assessment for learning are those written by the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority)<a href="http://www.qca.org.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.qca.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The authority, which is sponsored by England’s Department of Education and Skills, is responsible for national curriculum, assessment, and examinations. Their principles focus on crucial aspects of assessment for learning, including how such assessment much be seen as central to classroom practice and that all teachers should regard assessment for learning as a key professional skill.</p>

<p>On October 11, 2006, the students and staff at <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scranton_High_School_%28Pennsylvania%29_f8de.html" title="Scranton High School (Pennsylvania)">Scranton High School</a> found out a shocking truth. McTiernan had been having an affair with of the vice principals, Melissa Rose[1]. His wife had found out and told the School Board. On October 13, 2006, McTiernan took a leave of absence from his job as principal. On October 19, 2006, McTiernan resigned from City Council, suprising both council members and citizens[1].</p>
<p>Currently, McTiernan's situation is unknown. His seat has already been filled on City Council, and he has not returned to his post as principal of Scranton High. There is a strong rumor that the School Board has placed him over at the Administration Building until furthur notice. Melissa Rose has also been transferred to Northeast Intermediate School. On November 9, 2006, it was announced that the School Board had appointed vice principal Brain McGraw principal. With this information, it is highly certain that McTiernan won't be returning for a while, if at all. On a happier note, McTiernan has sorted things out with his wife and has stopped the affair.</p>

<b>From Mother Jones Radio (<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/radio/2006/02/borene_bio.html" class="external free" title="http://www.motherjones.com/radio/2006/02/borene_bio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherjones.com/radio/2006/02/borene_bio.html</a>):</b> ANDREW BORENE</p>
<p>Raised in an Edina, Minnesota household that included three generations of Borenes, Andrew Borene learned important life lessons about perseverance and patriotism early from his grandfather who was a survivor of the great depression and a World War II veteran.</p>
<p>In 1998, Andrew earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Macalester College, where he was a varsity football captain. After graduation, he helped local governments as a public finance investment banker with Wells Fargo in Minneapolis and San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 2000, Borene earned a commission as a U.S. Marine officer. Borene graduated with honors from his basic officer training courses, ultimately becoming a military intelligence officer. Borene crossed into Iraq with the 1st Marine Division in 2003 as the coalition invasion began, participating in the major combat operations that resulted in the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>After an honorable discharge, Borene returned home to Minnesota to raise a family and pursue a law degree at the University of Minnesota Law School, where he is president of the National Security and Law Society.</p>
<p>Borene says his political activism is a continuation of his commitment to serve his country. At the 2004 presidential and vice presidential debates, Borene brought a pragmatic perspective to the issues of national security, terrorism, and the Iraq War during the election season. Borene has since worked extensively with the media on these important issues by providing guidance and commentary. Additionally, he has written syndicated op-ed pieces for the New York Times, the Baltimore Sun, and other publications as an advisor to Operation Truth, a non-partisan advocacy organization for America’s troops and newest veterans.</p>

<p>70.21.143.10 22:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC) Laurie Hood (vocals) Peter Mann (piano) Victor Garber Lee Harris</p>
<p>The Sugar Shoppe came together in Toronto as a studio project in 1967. Peter Mann had relocated from New York and met up with Laurie Hood, who was in her last year of a scholarship at the University Of Toronto's Faculty of Music.</p>
<p>They also teamed up with Lee Harris (who had three years of vocal training), and London, Ontario native Victor Garber who was acting in the University Of Toronto's Hart House and moonlighting in coffeehouses around Toronto.</p>
<p>At the time of the band's inception Mann had re-arranged Bobby Gimby's anthemic song "Canada" which the band released as its first single in 1967 on Yorkville Records. They had one more single in 1967, "The Attitude", before being signed to Capitol Records for a full-length self-titled album in 1968.</p>
<p>Sugar Shoppe would finally move to Epic Records briefly before folding.</p>
<p>Laurie Hood would go on to take an office job with Toronto Sound Studio working for Terry Brown and Doug Riley. She eventually became a well-respected session singer for the likes of Klaatu (1974's 'California Jam'), Shooter, Myles And Lenny (along with Sugar Shoppe bandmate Lee Harris), and eventually for such luminaries as Anne Murray in the '80's; Victor Garber would find fame as a stage and screen actor starring in the hugely successful Hollywood blockbuster 'Titanic' and in the television series 'Alias'.</p>

<p>Color InfraRed photography is a type of color photography (digital or chemical) where the visible blue wavelengths are omitted to allow near-infrared wavelengths to be captured instead. This modified colorspace offers many practical applications for detecting conditions not normally visible in natural color (RGB) imaging. Agricultural applications use CIR imaging to detect presence, species or health/condition of vegetation, since chlorophyll reflects well in the infrared wavelength. In Military usage, camouflaged inorganic items can be discerned from similar-colored organic cover due to the difference in their infrared response.</p>
