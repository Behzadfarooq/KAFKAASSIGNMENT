<li><b>Comment Response</b> The lack of citation is certainly disturbing, especially when the article seems to miss Chiyome Mochizuki entirely, who appears to be the basis of the Kunoichi mythology. In any case, the mythology is firmly entrenched now. I see that <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">Ninja</a> is having the same credibility issues. I honestly can't see a solution to this credibility gap, but I really don't feel that deletion is warranted.

<li>I do have to agree with Usasatsui that this argument seems to be a bit confusing.

<dd>I don't know all the past precidents, and I'm not trying to be dense... I think that my main point is that we're talking about something that, in essence, does not exist -- who gets to decide what Kunoichi is? How can we write a verifiable article on a concept that can't be measured, can't be tested, can't be verified? Some may say <i>by incorporating only third party sources</i> -- in essence, incorporating what others say about Kunoichi. I just think that this is an unverifiable article about a ficticious idea of questionable notability. Your point regarding other fiction that obviously warrants an encyclopaedic entry (such as <i>vampires</i>) is taken, but in this instance I don't believe that is the case. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 01:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. There is a common theme to how Konoichi are portrayed, just as there are common themes to portrayals of Santa or vampires. As has been said, there is a lot missing and a bit of cruftiness, but those things can be worked out. The article as it stands sucks, but I believe the topic deserves an article. Worst case scenario, if when all is said and done there's not much left , it can be merged into "<a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">ninja</a>". --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 05:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question</b>, how do you say the naming for <b>female ninja</b> cannot be measured, tested, nor verified? There are people using it, at the very least it is a popular culture issue in Japan. I don't care if the article was kept or not (of course I am going to vote for a <b>keep</b>), but I do not want to see somebody's thinks that the term is not verifiable just because they have not heard it before. BTW, this word is found in two Japanese to Chinese <b>dictionary</b> and at least two Japanese dictionary where the meaning is literally <b>Female Ninja</b>. People have written in books saying why it is called that way, there are no exact final answer, but so do many science topics. The conclusion of actual reason for having this term is unknown, and thus the article should say that exactly, which does not mean it is not verifiable, but <i>verified to be unknown</i> by secondary sources. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 03:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The No OR argument would work only if the individual who created this article coined or developed the meaning of the term beyond verifiable sources. In other words, the purpose of the OR policy is primarily for sources and arguments, not topics (e.g., Kunoichi as a factual occupation might be OR, and a poll taken by the editor indicating what percentage of individuals believe they are real would definitely be OR). I certainly agree that better verification is necessary here, but the <i>topic</i> in this case is not OR, and should be kept. By the way, there are lots of entries in wikipedia involving "a collection of role-playing fantasies with no basis in fact," so if you think the article needs to be <i>rewritten</i> to reflect that this is the primary focus, fine. Otherwise, I really don't see how your point stands up. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 17:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Firm Keep</b> After reading the article, I'm seeing a lot of statements which could be sourced. The lack of inclusion regarding the origins of the term is a little strange, but that's a job for cleanup. While the <i>"Derivation of the word Kunoichi"</i> section looks to be OR, the <i>"History"</i> section is quite well written. I can see the article is being cleaned up even as this AfD takes place and see no reason for deletion at this time. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 16:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The amount of usage in blogs and forums is actually pretty surprsing, and includes a lot of the big sites: Slashdot, Daily Kos, Free Republic, etc. But, of course, we need more than blog posts. <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-5096128.html" class="external text" title="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-5096128.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a <a href="../../../z/d/n/ZDNet_977e.html" title="ZDNet">ZDNet</a> article that details the term, employing it in an extended metaphor to Microsoft. It was also the topic of a <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/news/view/141" class="external text" title="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/news/view/141" rel="nofollow">discussion workshop</a> at the 2005 <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Academy_of_Forensic_Sciences_f7df.html" title="American Academy of Forensic Sciences">American Academy of Forensic Sciences</a> annual meeting, entitled "Poking the Wookie: The Chewbacca Defense in Digital Evidence Cases".

<li>Then why didn't you actually use that source? Finding a reliable source is one thing, using it in the article is completely different. The whole point of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is that anyone who read the same research you did (in other words, the credible sources you cite) would obtain the same information that the article presented. Citing a source without using it in writing the article is worse than leaving the source out altogether - it sends researchers looking in the wrong places to verify the information you presented in the article. As such, I removed your reference. If you want to use this book as a source: 1) Acquire a copy of the book. 2) Read the chapter in question, and make sure it's pertinent to the article. 3) Using the book as a source, rewrite the article using only credible information. Until you do that (and maybe even after you do), the article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is non-negotiable. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 18:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Point partly taken, maybe I will move it to "Further reading" until it can be properly used and cited. The reason I did not rewrite anything is because the article makes no "claims" that require sourcing from it. One might ask exactly what in the article you would consider to be "unverifiable". A fictional legal strategy used in an episode of <i>South Park</i> and what is essentially a transcript of the scene in question? Surely that is beyond doubt, and verifiable from the episode as a primary source. Then a small section on external usage which cites only those cases (OK, mostly blogs) where other editors have found sources. I will, by all means, get the book and add anything interesting I find. I might also point out that the nomination represents that the subject is "not the subject of third party sources", I was merely pointing out that it is. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 21:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let me see if I've got this straight. A "Chewbacca defense" is one where the prosecution's side is presented as too complicated to be convincing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...or use a "Chewbacca defense" (thanks to the South Park TV show for this phrase) and try to razzle-dazzle the jury about how complex and complicated the other side's evidence or probability estimates are. <a href="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/425/425lect15.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/425/425lect15.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, wait. It's a defense that's "based on physical possibility that someone else committed bad act" <a href="http://www.scilawforensics.com/presentations/wookie.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scilawforensics.com/presentations/wookie.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>But no, wait. The "Chewbacca defense" is <i>actually</i> a postmodernist's dream, "in which someone asserts his claim by saying something so patently nonsensical that the listener's brain shuts down completely."<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellis-weiner/d-is-for-diabolical_b_39491.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellis-weiner/d-is-for-diabolical_b_39491.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Ah, <i>now</i> I understand! What we've got here is a classic <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> that's not even fit for Wiktionary.</p>

<li>(reply to Geuiwogbil) The "commentators" cited don't discuss the term or whatever the term is supposed to denote. The citations are merely references to the term.

<li><b>Keep</b>, do not merge - notable subject (though bizarre, but with breadth our biggest advantage that's all the more reason to cover it) with independent reliable sources, deserves its own article.

<p>This a series of names taken from the Indian given names category. Some in that category were valid disambig pages, or articles, but the following should be deleted, as Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and all they do is define the name.

<dd>Hmm, these are actually first names/given names, and NOT surnames. As for ghits, you'd definitely get ghits when those are part of many persons name.

<li><b>Relist</b> individually. For each of these names, a determination about deletion will need to depend on what verifiable sourcing is available. Some of these names have mythological applications, some do not. Some have been used in Indian business, some have not. Especially because there will be large numbers of false positives on Google, and because searching for non-English top, these articles should be given separate treatment to ensure that worthwhile content is not accidently removed. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I personally do not want to relist these individually. It took me long enough as it was, and relisting all of these will clog the deletion debate. If you tell me the specific articles that could be kept, the reason they should be kept, and I agree, then I will strike them out on my list and withdraw my nomination for that individual article. I don't know whether that is allowed, but I think that would be the best way of dealing with this situation.

<li><b>Delete</b> all, on the basis that Wikipedia is not a Dictionary of Names. (I have one, very interesting it is too, but it's just what it says - a dictionary.) The fact that some of these are also names of Hindu mythological characters is irrelevant: these articles are about the names, not the characters.

<p>As far as I can understand, this list is supposed to contain either (1) instances of confusion over history topics, or (2) instances of confusion over placenames/peoples throughout history. I don't think that either criterion is, of itself, particularly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>. In the first case, the list would essentially be a result of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">something that happened in school one day</a>. In the second case, the list would seem to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, be potentially unmaintainable, and be (again) unnotable unless the importance of these confusions was specified. My second (or fourth, depending on how you count it) reason for nominating it for deletion is that it adds little or nothing of encyclopedic value (after all, <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">Wikipeida is an encyclopedia</a>) as evidenced by the facts that:</p>

<li>it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced</a>; and</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: If this is a list for historical confusions, then that article should be much longer than its current state. Also, what is the confusion about? I see no confusion!

<p>Listed for Speedy deletion as a CSD:A7. There is a claim of notability on the talk page and in the article that one member was in another notable band (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Republic_%28band%29_8a60.html" title="The Golden Republic (band)">The Golden Republic (band)</a>). I'm not sure they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> but I don't think A7 applies here and the Speedy was contested so I'm listing it here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Assuming that The Golden Republic is notable itself (a cursory search suggests it is), then the relevant point of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> is "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable" (it is probably not appropriate to use redirects, as this is a band with members who weren't in the other band - and the guy who was joined this band after leaving the old one). I'm trusting that consensus has decided this is a good reason to call a band notable, because without it this would be a definite delete . <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm not an expert on the music world, so I cannot evaluate whether a notable person in an old band starting a new band makes the new band notable. (In this case, I don't think so.) Sources on Google confirm that this band exists and has performed, but that's it. I see no significant press coverage. If the best links you can show me are a myspace profile and a blog post, you haven't made your case for notability successfully. Note also that the "history" section is unsourced. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 20:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>By not specifying the notability of these companies, the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_b313.html" title="WP:Notability (companies and corporations)">WP:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>. Of the six toolmakers listed, the first four lack WP articles (two are redirects to other pages). Moreover, even if all of these pages were created (presupposing that they are all notable), then they should probably be listed in a category (e.g., Category:Toolmakers in the United States) rather than on a list. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:34, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not sure why that would be considered bad faith considering it's a logical path of reasoning. We became aware that the article itself should be deleted using the same rational as why it shouldn't be in the list article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm ambivalent in general about individual articles for individual conventions and issues surrounding the RfC that led to this. However, looking at a few articles on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anime_conventions.html" title="List of anime conventions">List of anime conventions</a>, this particular article has citations that are about average for its type. It cites AnimeCons.com and, yes, the convention's own webpage. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Weekend_Atlanta_0a33.html" title="Anime Weekend Atlanta">Anime Weekend Atlanta</a>, a far more notable convention in my estimation, doesn't even go that far. As for notability... AnimeSouth probably fails the test. But I think a lot of other convention articles would also fall under the axe.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonocrat_e146.html" title="User:Monocrat">Monocrat</a> 02:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> After repeated requests to add some actual content (with references) to the page before removing the "stub" tag, neither User:Animesouth (nor anyone else) has done so. Therefore one must assume that there is nothing else that can be said about this convention. Surely <i>someone</i> must have posted an independent third-party con report that could be cited as reference. If there were detailed information on it, I might be able to support keeping it...but seeing as how nobody has anything to add -- no history, no details on past events, etc. -- I don't see anything in the article that makes this any more notable than the next convention. (If there <i>IS</i> a reason this convention is notable, <i>why isn't it here?!</i>) Additionally and unfortunately, the repeated vandalism by User:Animesouth has made maintenance on this article far more troublesome than it should be. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 22:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, when another editor added this basic info to the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article two other editors said they thought this didn't belong because three sources didn't meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline of multiple non-trivial sources, so I added more sources independent of each other, and now having seven sources is supposedly a problem. After I added more sources the two editors said it met the notability guideline for its own article but not to be in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article, so I moved it to its own article. Now those editors think that the article ought to be deleted. Or maybe it should move to Wikinews. Or I need to find more recent sources showing that the story didn't just die after the incident.

<li>This article is in the canonical form for a news article. It has a news article style title, covers the story as a news article would, and cites more than enough sources to qualify for publication as a news summary piece. It thus does not belong in Wikipedia, whose articles are encyclopaedia articles, not news articles. An encyclopaedia article would have a different title, per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28verbs%29_00a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (verbs)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (verbs)</a>, for starters, and a far broader scope. The proper place to write news articles is Wikinews. However, Wikinews won't cover this story because it is more than 6 months old at this point. Forking out a news article that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">does not belong in the encyclopaedia</a> is not the way to solve a content dispute over a biographical article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So there's still a bunch of humor pieces. Big whoop. Those aren't news. Face it, the only reason this is an issue is because a lot of people vehemently disagree with Limbaugh, so they make it their mission to disparage him in any and all possible ways. Give it up. The political shit ain't worth it.</li>

<p>Largely reposted content previously deleted A7, but it does make a stab at asserting notability. However, '6th out of 100 webcomics listed at topwebcomics.com' may not be the most solid claim to notability.

<li>'For the person, I don't see why we need an article. This should probably be merged to the article on the webcomic <a href="../../../t/w/o/Twokinds.html" title="Twokinds">Twokinds</a>, but that was speedy deleted back in November, because it didn't claim the business about "6th out of 100" or the 2 million hits per day.

<li>The "6th slot in the top 100 webcomics of all time" claim is at best highly misleading. That's a list that resets every month if I understand correctly, the list includes only a small fraction of the comics on the web, the list is open to manipulation, and it does not include many of the most read comics on the web. The idea that "If you don't count <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29_7eef.html" title="Penny Arcade (comic)">Penny Arcade (comic)</a>, <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_Friendly_bca9.html" title="User Friendly">User Friendly</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_Sweeties_9b01.html" title="Diesel Sweeties">Diesel Sweeties</a>, and on and on, well, then "this comic is #6" does not seem like much of a claim of notability. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 21:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per Mangojuice, but do I have to take issue with the nom's suggestion that having one's wikipedia bio turn up first in a google search is a bad sign notability-wise. I've heard that brought up in AFD before, and it seems to be a misconception. We're the top result for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bill+clinton&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bill+clinton&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=george+bush&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=george+bush&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">George Bush</a>, too (although the web site for <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> is the top result for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=al+gore&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=al+gore&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Al Gore</a>; must have something to do with him inventing the internet.) I've searched a few less-notable names (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Christopher+Fry" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Christopher+Fry" rel="nofollow">Christopher Fry</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Chris+Regina" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Chris+Regina" rel="nofollow">Chris Regina</a>, for example), and the same seems to hold true. It looks like you need to have a web presence that is not just notable but really, <i>really</i> notable in order to beat Wikipedia's Google clout. The number of google hits may be a factor in determining notability, but the position of the Wikipedia article in question in the results probably shouldn't be. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 16:11, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The touring schedule is listed on their myspace website (link fixed), it just needs to be correctly sourced on the page. I'll try to do some research to find when they were established, but they are definetely currently touring. Also several things have been nicknamed Fab 5 as a play on The Beatles nickname Fab 4 (spice girls among them), this is not an impersonation it is the actual name (not a nickname) of the band. I believe TommyOliver's reasons for deletion are completely void. On another note it seems this artice was originally nominated for deletion because it was only made to promote the band. This is untrue, I started this article because I was doing research about them (having heard how great they were), and was suprised to see I couldn't find any information on wikipedia. After finding information elsewhere, I decided to start this page to help users in the future looking for this cover band. I have no connection to the band and have never even seen them play, so I would have no motive to promote them. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWar_wizard90_af34.html" title="User:War wizard90">War wizard90</a> 06:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Does not seem to meet WP:BIO standards of notability. Blogger and author of a few non-notable books, none of which are within the top 1,000,000 books on amazon, with no evidence of reviews or articles independent of author. First link seems to point to advertisement for erotica writing service.

<li><b>A Counterpoint</b> was presented on the article's <a href="../../../s/a/g/Talk%7ESage_Vivant_d6db.html" title="Talk:Sage Vivant">the article's talk page</a>. It appears that some of the story anthologies edited by Sage Vivant are within the top 1,000,000 Amazon sales (though not very high), and some web reviews of these anthologies exist on a site dedicated to erotic fiction. So, the reliability and independence of these citations should be considered. Reference to other media mentions was made, though it is not clear that Sage herself has ever been the subject of an independent review or article, and the majority of citations listed do appear to be mere "mentions," possibly trivial in nature.) In any event, I guess some of her editing projects have gotten more mention that I at first supposed, so this could be a borderline case.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 05:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It seems as if a Nicholas Strunk does exist and that he has released at least one single, but these articles have little to nothing else to do with the reality. Sources are very difficult to come by. The author of both articles has repeatedly removed the "hoax" tag I placed on this article without adding sources. Statements in the article to the contrary, billboard.com shows no entries for this artist.

There were also scattered and not very reliable references to him getting ready to work with Timbaland at some vague point in the future, but those references also refer to him as a UK artist, not some teenager from Holland, MI.

<li><b>REMAIN</b> there is definite notability. This is the only American watch company who manufactures anything. Every other American watch company purchases their components from foreign countries for assembly in the US. In addition, Newt43 has continuously posted links to bulletin board websites and a customer complaint website that doesn't verify anything. The site is well known for allowing defamatory information to be posted and the owner of the website has been sued many times and thumbs his nose at the courts. Newt43 displayed that he could not write anything with a NPOV. He continuosly erased the non-biased information that was previously posted to post his inaccurate information obtained from others with an axe to grind. In fact, Newt43 may be the person who wrote those articles to which he made reference.

<p>Thank you. The person about whom you referred, posted libelous information about Montres Allison and Terry Allison. If my tone seemed hostile to you, please understand that Newt43 caused any hostility that you are perceiving in my tone and comments. Repeating defamatory statements is not a defense against charges of civil nor criminal libel. He should not have continuously posted information about which he had no first hand knowledge and that he knew came from sources that were not accredited members of the press nor organizations well-repsected in the community for consumer complaints. He took disparaging information posted by practically anonymous authors and replaced earlier, accurate information with the disparaging information. He should be ashamed and should be punished for acting in such a manner. Thank you.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the article is about a cinema in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The article is very poorly written and could almost be speedied as spam as it includes details on the discount prices on nachos. I suppose I could simply clean that bit up.

<li>On the contrary: It is. Wiktionary takes proper nouns as well as common nouns. Proper nouns are, after all, words (as long as they are properly attested).

<li>I was referring to an actual dictionary in the commonly used sense of the word, rather than Wiktionary. None of my dictionaries include people's names, except for the two specifically labelled as dictionaries of people's names. I didn't know that about Wiktionary though - perhaps I should pay more attention to it.

<li>Wiktionary is an "actual dictionary in the commonly used sense of the word". That you have some dictionaries that do not include these words does not affect that — it merely means that some dictionaries with limited vocabularies exist. But that shouldn't be news to anyone. And that you have some dictionaries that include proper nouns indeed reinforces the point. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Long established club admittedly but no statement that it has done anything notable and no multiple non-trivial sources.

<li>That's way out of line for you to be nominating an article for deletion and then deleting references and text based on your subjective interpretations of the WP Guidelines.

<dd>(1) "SHOOTING THE BREEZE" with Tim Stirk says: <i>"THERE WILL be no organised sailing this week on the Border, as all attention will be focused on the 23rd Coca-Cola Eastern Cape inter-schools sailing championship in Port Elizabeth, hosted by Redhouse Yacht Club."</i> I included this because the mention in this manner demsonstrates that (a) the Redhouse Club is hosting an event which is prestigious enough to receive all the attention in the area, and (b) the Club is "noticed" by independent journals which is among the criteria which WP standards define as Notability. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:59, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(2) "Redhouse River Mile set for mid-February" says: <i>" This historic annual event, first staged in 1924, will again be held from the Redhouse Yacht Club ... While the first Redhouse Mile attracted 48 participants, the 2003 event is expected to attract nearly 1 000 entrants."</i> This definitely speaks to notability by demonstrating that the Redhouse Club hosts what is considered to be a historic event. Moreover, a 1000 participant swim-meet is a huge event which in and of itself may be notable for an article at WP.</dd>
<dd>(3) Both of the articles mentioned above are from online reprints of articles from recognized South African newspapers, at the official sites for the newspapers. How much more independent and non-trivial could the sources be?</dd>
<dd>(4) In and of themselves neither reference above is sufficient to demonstrate notability, but in concert, three sources certainly make an arguable if not compelling case for inclusion.

<p>Creating deletion discussion for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kansas_State_University_Distinguished_Alumni_c5dd.html" title="List of Kansas State University Distinguished Alumni">List of Kansas State University Distinguished Alumni</a> because this article was a simple cut-and-paste from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kansas_State_University_people_af54.html" title="List of Kansas State University people">List of Kansas State University people</a>, and the latter is the accepted naming format for lists of people related to universities. (To call it a list of alumni it is inaccurate inasmuch as it also lists faculty, etc.) Further, there is a high potential for confusion having two nearly-identical pages, so this one should be deleted. Finally, the original List of People has been updated while the article proposed for deletion has not. <a href="../../../k/g/w/User%7EKgwo1972_3caf.html" title="User:Kgwo1972">Kgwo1972</a> 04:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC) On second thought, should I just make this a redirect? <a href="../../../k/g/w/User%7EKgwo1972_3caf.html" title="User:Kgwo1972">Kgwo1972</a> 04:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A tough call as an editor of this page: External links exist elsewhere, but few show all the cars. Many Gran Turismo 2 "car lists" are pre-release "tease" lists that are quite inaccurate; having missing cars, non-existent cars and vague descriptions based on game region. On the other hand, it's tough to have every car <i>because</i> there's three game versions sold worldwide, all with differing levels of availability (missing, hidden, renamed). We'd have to have a separate list for the Japanese, NTSC, and PAL versions, and maintaining several lists from vandalism is too much work for very little gain. Internal links from the individual "real" cars could make mention of it's availability in GT2, and external links should do the job on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gran_Turismo_2_a3f4.html" title="Gran Turismo 2">Gran Turismo 2</a> page, since a <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/guides/index.php/Game_Guides" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/guides/index.php/Game_Guides" rel="nofollow">GT-related-Wiki</a> already exists for this purpose. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFormulanone_5859.html" title="User:Formulanone">Formulanone</a> 06:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Original research and wishful thinking. As well as being unsourced and a neologism. While there are efforts to make lobbying more transparent to the public, there isn't a generally accepted "open lobbying" methodology. And the article's premise that open lobbying is something that NGOs participate in contrast to corporations engaging in non-open lobbying seems to be entirely without evidence. The article is POV and un-savable in its current form. In case it's unclear, I'm in favor of deletion. <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 04:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> In a nutshell: talks in-universe and addresses <i>extremely</i> minor and unimportant character.

But am I going to be defending this article, which looks so bad? There's no evidence that they have charted, and the clincher for me is the lack of an article on the JA Wiki.

<li>Delete without prejudice to recreation. They're apparenly one of very few all-female visual kei bands out there. They ARE going on a national tour of Japan, but I have no way of evaluating the venues listed on the website. They released an album just recently.

<li><b>Very Weak Delete</b> They've released two mini-albums and a couple of singles. They're with what appears to be a fairly major label, and touring in some reasonably sized venues nationally. They've had at least one major article, in <i>Cure</i> (a Japanese music/culture magazine -- unfortunately I haven't got a copy to use as a source). I think they're at least borderline with <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and arguably pass. But lack of sources tips it for me.

<li>Very sorry for the trouble, but I was requested to do this by the person behind the creation of <a href="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" class="external text" title="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" rel="nofollow">The Gates of Hell</a>. I'm not exactly certain if it fits the criteria of being published, as it's only available online. This is really the first thing I've posted, so hopefully someone else from <a href="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/index.php" class="external text" title="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/index.php" rel="nofollow">Dicefreaks.com</a>will be here shortly to edit the articles to fix the problems. Please hold off deleting the articles until someone more experienced can come along and remedy this problem. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacMonster_7157.html" title="User:MacMonster">MacMonster</a> 08:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hold off indeed! <b>Speedy delete</b> more like. Notability not established. Also the monster above essentially admits that it it spam. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> - the only way to remedy this <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">this problem</a> is with the delete button. So tagged. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 08:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete the articles then, hopefully someone who actually know what they're doing will be able to do it within the next few days. Sorry for the trouble. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacMonster_7157.html" title="User:MacMonster">MacMonster</a> 08:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let's not <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite</a> here guys. Play nice. Agreed that it's crufty, though, and probably not worth its own article unless you can provide some sources for notability - see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 09:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>My intent was to first set up the articles for each of the pages to be linked to, then create a page for <a href="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" class="external text" title="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" rel="nofollow">The Gates of Hell</a>, but it seems apparent that such things are best left to others. In retrospect it would seem best to do it all on one page, however I wanted to avoid a post that neared five feet long. Delete it, someone else will do a better job of it, or merge the articles together, whichever is best. However, please note that I in no way had a hand in the creation process of <a href="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" class="external text" title="http://dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=88" rel="nofollow">The Gates of Hell</a> or it's contents.

<li>It's fine. No one's perfect at this at first. Stay around for a few days and everythign will become clearer. Anyway, you can tag the article with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}}, and it will be speedy deleted for you. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 10:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You didn't do anything "wrong" by creating these articles, and there was nothing inappropriate about their content. It's just that the topics themselves are not notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. However, they might be perfect for the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Wiki</a> website. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaimeLesMaths_f7a6.html" title="User:JaimeLesMaths">JaimeLesMaths</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/a/i/User_talk%7EJaimeLesMaths_235e.html" title="User talk:JaimeLesMaths">talk</a>!<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JaimeLesMaths_544b.html" title="Special:Contributions/JaimeLesMaths">edits</a>)</sup> 10:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Get out of the old state of mind, people. These articles suck ass, no one will ever fix them, and they only encourage people to use Wikipedia as their "OMG" fansite of useless trivia. There never was a consensus to make articles for every episode because a minority can so easily make episode articles. Then people come on to Wikipedia, see that, and assume it was a thought out decision. It's not, it's just a big mess of "OMG, others have episode articles, we should have episode articles" misconception. Why can't we end this insanity?

<li>This is an excellent case of where counting Google hits is not research. Research turns up the Swiss Cheese model of accidents, and the concomitant notion of having multiple defences against error, where errors occur when all of the holes in the various slices of cheese align, being discussed on pages 16 and 17 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0826133460</a>. (There's a diagram on page 17.) This in turn cites a paper by James T. Reason entitled <i>Human Error</i> published in 1990 by Cambridge University Press. Reason's "Swiss Cheese" model is also discussed on page 1065 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9058095517</a>, where it is described as "widely accepted in the health sector[s]" of the U.K., the U.S., and Australia. Page 16 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 075461591X</a> also points to another paper by Reason discussing this Swiss Cheese model: <i>Managing the risks of organizational accidents</i> (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997). You can read about one <i>application of</i> Reason's Swiss Cheese model (in the aviation industry) on pages xv to xvii of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0071373624</a>. (There's another diagram on page xvii.) You can read about its application to the firefighting emergency services (which discusses preventing firefighting errors by "inserting additional layers of cheese into the system") on page 20 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1593700067</a>. (This has yet another diagram.) You can also read about it on pages 11, 12, 353, and 354 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0754646416</a>. (The diagram is on page 12 in this book.)
<p>This idea is <i>not</i> original research. It is simply the case that this article is unreferenced, badly written, and incorrectly titled.

<li>Quintus, I try to understand the effort you put in FTE Day and the significance it may have for you, but have you ever read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">the policy about notability</a> in Wikipedia? For instance the fact that a topic is considered notable, and so suitable to be included, "if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other"? We are not questioning FTE Day in itself (or perhaps someone has, but this is not the point). The fact is, something is notable (be it a song, a crime or an event) if it is widely known, referenced and studied. Give yourself and FTE Day time to grow and become renowned. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 12:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I completely understand where you are comming from, but i doubt that it is going to get more renound then it already is. To me, it seems like being mentioned on national television seems to qualify it as notable. I agree it is still a bit obscure, but there are many other more obscure articles on wikipedia. Why argue over this one when it HAS been mentioned on national television. Probably a few hundred thousand people heard it announced on the TV. It is true that probably reletivly few have taken it to heart, but there is a group. And since it was mentioned on comedy central, I think it is notable enough for wikipedia.

<li>Well, we're getting somewhere here: at least we know where this came from: it is indeed from the Daily Show: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22daily+show%22+%22%27Fuck+The+Earth+Day" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22daily+show%22+%22%27Fuck+The+Earth+Day" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. That being said, too bad. It's not notable yet.

<li>It is <b>NOT</b> a real holiday. It was a one-off joke/comment on the Daily Show. Should we make Wikipedia articles for every sentence that comes out of Jon Stewart's mouth? That would be patently absurd. Go ahead, you and your friend celebrate the so-called "holiday." If you can manage to get some press, or even start a sizable meme in the blogosphere, then it might be considered for an article after the fact.

<p>This one is pretty good. I was suspicious because he's just 15 or so, but I realized that some rappers are young. Then, while researching I happened to find the <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lil_Wayne_3e09.html" title="Lil Wayne">Lil Wayne</a> article. Most of "The Ridder's" biography is actually Lil Wayne's. Google turns up a few references to a rapper called "The Riddler," but he'd be older than this guy.

<dd>He is fifteen years old and the lead claims that he is the president or CEO of two different record companies. Yet later, the article states "The two (the subject and a friend) later on went to make plans for a future record label while beefin with rival rapper Royal T." A third record company?

I realize that the article's creator had removed the tag from the article itself and I did remind them on their talk page that it was inappropriate to do that. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 20:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Note</b> Please do not delete this article. I spent a lot of time on researching and gathering very rare info on the character. Many people find this article interesting and helped me troughout putting up a lot more information.--Jack Mercer 23:12, 28 January 2007

<li><b>Note</b> The movie contains footage of birth certificates, tomb stones, etc, that are easily missed on first viewing of the film. Also between production and DVD sale of this movie a commentary, by the producer, has been recorded, this divulges more off screen/alluded to information. Adding to this, the actors, predominantly Garrett, have been increasingly interviewed and asked about their previous characters, whereby they have divulged previously un-marketed information. Lyeac 08:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note?</b> Heres the info that was lost due to User:Jack Mercer's blanking of the page. It's the reason for the AFD.
<ul>
<li>None notable character from a movie. More important characters in the movie don't have a article. All relevant info is found in the main movie article. Full of speculation over sexuality.--<a href="../../../m/8/v/User%7EM8v2_b3d5.html" title="User:M8v2">M8v2</a> 22:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Jack Mercer is one of the four main characters in this film. The actor, Garrett Hedlund - relatively unknown, who portrays Jack is credited aside the well known names of Andre "3000" Benjamin and Mark Wahlberg on the movies jacket and opening credits, and the character of Jack himself appears multiple times in all manner of movie jacket, advertising and trailer... Jack is a main character. Secondly to say that more important characters in the movie don't have an article is false, Bobby Mercer (Jack's oldest brother ~ Mark Wahlberg)has an article, and I've read several sites attempts at compiling information about Angel and Jerry for publish in this forum. Thirdly, all relevant info is not found in the main article; indeed being new to and inspired by this fandom, I found out about Jack's birthdate, the plans for the roof scene and that Jack was originally supposed to survive the shoot out, all from this article. Finally it is correct to state that Jacks sexuality is speculative at best, Bobby converses with Jack; "How have you been, still sucking a little cock left and right?", and latter in the bathroom scene Angel askes a question about a rash, concerned that he has contracted an STD, and Bobby states; "Ask the cockologist here" referring to Jack in the shower. Jack's sexuality was discussed un-biasedly here, in indeed, a more correct forum than the "Four Brothers" main page ~ that doesn't even report the movie divulged history of each character.Lyeac 08:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tamaskan_Dog_7b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tamaskan Dog">before</a>, there does not appear to be any documentation of this "breed" in reliable sources.

<ul>
<li>Recognition by a major kennel club or breed registry</li>
<li>News coverage</li>
<li>Historical importance</li>
</ul>
<p>Little appears to have changed from the first nomination, except that some of the claims which were proved false have been removed.

<p><b>Comment</b> -- Please be sure you are excluding wikipedia, its mirrors, blogs, advertising sites, discussion forums, etc. when you check for Ghits. I have seen a copy of the article printed in the small Finnish paper that is cited in the article. There may also have been an article published in the journal <i>Our Dogs</i> that the article's proponent removed for unknown as of yet reasons. Please read the article's talk page where I and some others have asked several questions. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 15:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>In light to the comment below I am re evaluating my position.

<li>Re evaluation complete, My first impression was incorrect (badly). I attempted to validate the references and was not able to, with one small exception the references had to removed from the article see Talk:Tamaskan_Dog#Section_Removed.

<p><b>Comment</b> -- There is a link to the first attempt, up in the nomination, under the hyperlinked word "before." Ghits, in my opinion, are usually useless. Unfortunately, just like anyone can edit Wikipedia, even more anyones can put up a web site. That is all Google is categorizing. <i>Also, please list either here, on the article's talk page, or in the body of the article itself the "multiple hits that would support <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>"". I have literally searched for hours and found nearly nothing that I consider useful, except possibly a local interest article written only in Finnish and one other article that I will probably have to pay money for in order to see since no one who wants to keep the article has been able to provide me with a copy.</i> Hmmmmmm. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 16:14, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

For my own curiosity, I will work with these two publishers to see if I can obtain any materials. Regardless, the current article should be deleted. I have to say, per the article's talk page, I'm glad this is something we take way too seriously! <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 11:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If one types "reading lists" into Google, over one million results are indicated (and 3.5 million for "reading list"). If one types "reading lists" into Wikipedia, the results show one page on speed reading and another on reading disabilities. This would thus seem to be an area of immense oversight on Wikipedia in comparison with global interest in the subject. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepso_53bb.html" title="User:Pepso">Pepso</a> 14:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The high number of results just proves my point: they are not notable merely for existing. Yes, I'm reasonbly confident there are some notable ones out there - in fact I'm sure of it - but so far as I can see this is not one of them. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 15:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Surely the question is whether the subject of the article is notable. The article is about a list created on usenet. I'm not normally a fan of Google tests, but in this case it should be fairly revealing. "Greatest Books of All Time" + usenet reveals <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Greatest+Books+of+All+Time%22+usenet&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Greatest+Books+of+All+Time%22+usenet&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">" 11 hits</a> while "425 Greatest Books of All Time" weighs in at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22425+Greatest+Books+of+All+Time%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22425+Greatest+Books+of+All+Time%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">5</a>. I fully agree with the nominator in the above discussions. <i>This</i> list is not notable - in fact, the article as much as says so. Talk of the validity of reading lists in general is just a red herring. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 20:08, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On Usenet, this <i>was</i> notable. In fact, I recall running across it often ten years ago. Yet as years passed, it vanished, except for a citation on IMDb and a website where someone kept it with other book lists. My motive in importing it to Wikipedia was to salvage and resurrect something that was a valuable Usenet document and keep it from being lost to history. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepso_53bb.html" title="User:Pepso">Pepso</a> 20:14, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

That the newsgroup participants who organized the project didn't ensure that it was properly recorded should be taken as a lesson for the future: <i>Publish your work properly.</i> Usenet samizdat is not enough. Wikipedia only takes subjects that have been properly documented and published, and even then its purpose is to contain encyclopaedia articles. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a repository of source material</a>.

<dd>While Walter Tevis was teaching English literature at Ohio University, he became aware that the level of literacy among students was dropping at an alarming rate. This observation gave him the idea for his science fiction novel <i>Mockingbird</i>. It's the story of a far future when mankind is dying and everyone is illiterate. The central figure of the novel is a man who has taught himself how to read. He contacts the dean of NYU and tells him that he has figured out what "reading" is and can teach others. They're not interested in hiring him. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepso_53bb.html" title="User:Pepso">Pepso</a> 13:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>From the article:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Some of the terms commonly used to describe the condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc, and the misleading expression "slipped disc." Other terms that are closely related include disc protrusion, bulging disc, pinched nerve, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sciatica.html" title="Sciatica">sciatica</a>, disc disease, disc degeneration, <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degenerative_disc_disease.html" title="Degenerative disc disease">degenerative disc disease</a>, and black disc.</b></li>
<li><b>The popular term <i>"<a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">slipped disc</a>"</i> is quite misleading, as an intervertebral disc, being tightly sandwiched between two <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebrae.html" title="Vertebrae">vertebrae</a>, cannot actually "slip," "slide," or even get "out of place." The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched, and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot "slip."</b></li>

<ul>
<li>I would only agree that a re-direct is appropriate if you can demonstrate that "slipped disc" is used to refer to only a herniated disc, and never some other sort of spinal problem. Based on the opening sentence of the slipped disc article, this does not appear to be the case. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 12:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

If there are other uses of the term, then they can either be discussed in the new article -- <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a> -- or a real disambiguation page can be used to replace this one. Whatever happens, the contents of this one have already been merged, and the problematic nature of the term "slipped disc" explained there.

<dd>Fyslee, I think from past experience, that people tend to vote <b>Keep</b>, <b>Delete</b>, or <b>re-direct</b> based on which solution they think most appropriate. The fact that people are voting <b>keep</b> indicates to me that the article should remain as an article, rather than as a re-direct to a different article, which addresses a different subject. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 12:41, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The new article was created by including all the content from this one, and adding much more new content. I (a Physical Therapist) and Dematt (a chiropractor) did most of the work, and other medical personnel, including MDs, helped. It has been well-accepted. The term slipped disc is a misleading expression for the subject of the new article. It does not describe a "different subject." -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 12:46, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fyslee, can you please explain why the article needs to be deleted and redirected rather than simply redirecting it? Also, you keep saying it "should have been deleted". Should have been according to who? Was there a previous AfD? I don't understand why the article can't be kept under a redirect, particularly if, as others above say, it includes additional information that might be useful in the future.

<dd>Fine with me. Just as long as the redirect is left in place, and the article isn't edited. This article hadn't been edited since August 30, 2006, since all the editors back then -- PT, DC, MD -- all agreed a new one would be better. The new article is much better, and a well-accepted improvement here. Articles that are turned into redirects should not be edited or revived, or even linked to directly. A way to use the term, if one has no qualms about perpetuating the use of a misleading term, is to do this:</dd>

<dd>In that case, Fyslee, I suggest we simply redirect the page and keep the old article in the history. If Rebroad feels there is material in the old article that needs to be merged into the new one, he is welcome to do so. I think everyone but Rebroad has qualified their "keeps" as redirects so there seem to be consensus here to redirect. If the other party refuses to accept that, we can look at protecting the redirect. But unless there's a particular reason to delete, I think redirecting should be sufficient. <b>Sarah</b> 14:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> that is not the best example as in that case I'd say the redirect from Upset stomach to Indigestion is wrong and very unhelpful.

<dl>
<dd>I'm happy with that as long as someone answers the question that seems to be at the heart of this. Can you confirm that the term slipped disc is used only to mean Disc herniation? If it is then the redirect is fine However, if slipped disc can refer to more than one condition a simple redirect will be no more helpful than the current upset stomach article. In this case we need an article at slipped disc explaining how it can refer to more than one condition and linking to the appropriate articles. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is a very good point and deserves consideration.

<dd>The problem at the moment is that not many people will have heard of terms other than "slipped disk", and therefore a) won't search for the other terms, and b) won't understand what other articles mean unless they use this term. I think it was going OTT to change all articles referring to slipped disk to a term that no one would be familiar with. The best way to educate people as to what a slipped disk is is to continue using this terminology but to explain what it means and also what it doesn't mean. Uses of words change over time. For example, "gay" no longer means what it used to. It should not be up to the medical profession alone to decide the future of the meaning of "slipped disk" especially if it is a term the medical profession themselves chose NOT to use. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 15:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rebroad, maybe you misunderstand. That is the reason for a re-direct; so that if someone searches for <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipped_disc.html" title="Slipped disc">Slipped disc</a> it will go to the article that covers what they are really looking for. The medical profession stopped using the term because it misled people and anything that would be in an article with that name would be lay language and unhelpful - all they would be doing is repeating that it is misleading and link them to <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_disc_herniation.html" title="Spinal disc herniation">Spinal disc herniation</a>. They don't need to know what the other words mean. The article that they are re-directed to explains that well, I think. But you are welcome to improve it if you think it needs it. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 16:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect and protect</b> per Arthur Rubin, with note on talk page as to why redirect is proteced. The merge already ocurred; links pointed to the new, accurate article. There was no reason to return the old "Slipped disc" article and change the redirects, as that article has been superceded with one under the accurate term. As far as "other meanings" given in the intro to "Slipped disc", the only ones I see which do not mean Herniated disc are <i>pinched nerve, sciatica and degenerative disc disease</i> - which are not cited, and not even in the See also of the article, so that seems to be very bad editing rather than a valid concern. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 17:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> then all searchers for "slipped disc" will get to the right place, and that article can be made excellent.

<li><b>Redirect and protect</b> reading Arthur and KillerChihuahua's explanation makes this sound a no brainer. I think a delete is to be avoided since slipped disc is common terminology.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't think keeping this page will somehow require that we "have an article for every song in existance" (sic). Slipknot is a very popular band and this track opened an album that was a huge seller. As the article itself states, "The song was, to most, the introduction to Slipknot when they first bought or listened to the self titled album." It should also be noted that most bands are careful to put a strong track to open an album. So the album's popularity establishes the notability of the song. And I would just note that no one in this AFD has made a case for the non-notability of the song, preferring to rely on assertions. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 23:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li>I allowed for aprox %50 not being important enough. If an album is important enought to have an article then so should the lead song be, says you're argument. Trimming it down by %50 or thereabouts is a move that would likly be opposed/ignored/argued over by some, but assuming it was practicle, then it would still leave far too many. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 17:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non notable IRA terrorist. Seems to be written to make a POV attack on the British Police <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. O'Neill became notable only in death, because of the dispute over whether the police acted correctly in firing at him; a major campaign was organised by his friends to try to get official acknowledgment that the police acted wrongly. The case has been <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450142000?open&amp;of=ENG-384" class="external text" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450142000?open&amp;of=ENG-384" rel="nofollow">taken up</a> by Amnesty International. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 13:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- the way things are going, Wikipeida is turning into some sort of IRA memorial site. Although some terrorists are notable, most of them are not- this man didn't even seem to have committed an attrocity that would have made him notable. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>That comment actually disgusted me and really give me an incite into your vantage point with regards this type of topic. Do you think the only way a republicans can attain notability is by committing an "atrocity"?? This guy was pulled out of his bed and killed, so who is it that commits the atrocities. My advice would be to try and avoid POV and stick to fact in these types of issue. I have had to learn that lesson the hard way. regards--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 21:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have sympathy for Astrotrain's position here and I can see the logic in that Astrotrain does not feel that this person was notable as a terrorist and as wikipedia is not a memorial, merely dying does not constitute notability. My position is that the death itself is notable, and I have a low threshold for the notability of terrorists. Though the language might not be sufficiently neutral, I don't think it is right to assume other than good faith. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 11:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> sorta maybe leaning towards keep, but really, it needs to say something more than x was an IRA volunteer killed by the British Police. I would also STRONGLY suggest we use the term "IRA member" rather than either of the terms terrorist or volunteer as both of them seem to be POV to me. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please vote only on the article in question- not the nominator. There is no bad faith on my part- I agree for articles to be included for notable terrorists - and have only nominated articles that clearly cannot go anywhere.

<ul>
<li>When the nominator has a pattern of making nominations justified by his political feelings in the case, it is appropriate to regard further nominations as being against Wikipedia's NPOV policy, and thus, being in bad faith. If you'd show some selectivity about the articles you nominated, or hadn't expressed your opinions in the ways you have, I'd think that your blanket nominations of articles on IRA members was just an excess of deletionist zeal, especially since at least some of your nominations appear to be reasonable. But it's pretty clear that your nominations are based on anti-IRA animus, not on the merits of the case.

<dd>When they say delete per nom they are saying that it should be deleted per the nomination that this article seems to be written as a PoV attack on the British police. I agree to a certain extent but think it more important to realise he didn't accomplish anything of note.

<dd>Okay, the points you raised. Point 1 is a non-issue; nobody really thinks Wikipedia is in danger of becoming an IRA memorial site. It's not even close to being a reason for deletion. Point 2 is also not a reason. It says "delete" because "the article doesn't merit a dedicated page". That basically says "delete" because "it should be deleted". We have policies and guidelines to help, so try arguing from them. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 15:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Point 1: There seem to be a large number of articles, of doubtful worth, about IRA militants on Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> has made a start by nominating some of the more worthless ones for deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> and I previously cleaned up the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Sands_2dc2.html" title="Bobby Sands">Bobby Sands</a> article, which was so POV at that time as to be simply propaganda. As I say above, I have no problem with a general article about minor IRA personalities but I find it suspicious and disturbing to have a series of individual articles, padded as they are with references to POV sources and a strong bias of republicanism and/ or anglophobia. It seems to me that certain contributors are making it their job to list every IRA personality that they can. Point 2: As <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Bader_58c0.html" title="Douglas Bader">Douglas Bader</a> had it, 'Rules are for the guidance of wise men and the obedience of fools'. The Wikipedia policies and guidelines are sufficiently broad so as not to compromise users' common sense and do not, in any case, help either side in this debate. You also misrepresent my argument: I do not say, '"delete" because "it should be deleted" ', I say delete because the subject is comparatively trivial and being used to advance agendas, not knowledge.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 16:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(reset indent) How is it suspicious and disturbing? And what relevance does certain contributors' actions have to <i>this</i> debate? The policies and guidelines are not completely binding, granted, but they are established through general consensus and can't be ignored on a whim. This decision is clearly not "common sense" as there is plenty of disagreement.</dd>
<dd>Added to that, you still haven't constructed an argument. "Being used to advance agendas, not knowledge" is not a reason for deletion as far as I can see. I'm not even sure what's meant by it. Saying it's "comparatively trivial" is also meaningless as you're not comparing it to anything; it's like saying it's "too trivial for an article", which is again essentially saying "delete because it should be delete". When I analyse your argument, I'm still not finding anything that holds up. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:20, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have the feeling, <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a>, that we are simply not going to agree on this issue and that further discourse on the subject is pointless. However, to answer your questions: (1) I find it 'suspicious and disturbing' that what is being promoted as an objective source of information is actually tendentious; (2) particularly so because this article is one of a series; (3) that if someone wishes to construct an online shrine to IRA militants, that is their perogative, but it is not something for Wikipedia, no matter how artfully disguised. (4) I used the phrase 'comparatively trivial' carefully, because life is sacred and obviously his death caused pain to those who loved him. However, frankly and from an historical perspective, the sole interesting feature of this individual is his accidental shooting by the Police and that could be dealt with on a page dealing with that subject rather than giving this individual a page of his own.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 22:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You may well be correct, but it doesn't matter if you are or not. Just as we write from sources, not our own personal knowledge, so we choose our subjects based on what there is enough source material to create a decent article on, not whether we personally think the person <i>deserves</i> to be written about. Sometimes, the media does have a bias toward writing about the sensational and bad. If you wish to try and correct that, you can certainly write letters to editors, start a citizen's group, or use any number of other means. But this is not the place to correct anything-either the sources exist, or they don't. In this case, they do. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here are some more references listed by Amnesty International regarding the shooting of Diarmuid O'Neill that you might be interested in if you want ot know more.</dd>

<ul>
<li>(1) This refers to the Canary Wharf bombing of 9 February 1996. The bombing resulted in a number of casualties and two deaths at the scene.</li>
<li>(2) Tracey Davanna: “Why Was Diarmuid O’Neill Killed&#160;?” in Fortnight, November 1999, p. 12</li>
<li>(3) Patrick Kelly, Brian McHugh and two others were charged with and tried for conspiring to cause explosions and with possessing explosives. It was during this trial that the officers involved in the raid were questioned about the incident in the hotel.</li>
<li>(5) The post-mortem examination was conducted by Dr Iain Eric West at Guy’s Hospital, London. The quotes are taken from his report which was written on 25 September 1996.</li>
<li>(6) Although the latter of these quotations appears in the police`s official transcript of the recording of the incident, the first one caused some controversy during the trial mentioned in footnote 3. According to the police transcript the words said are an order to shut up (“Shut the fuck up!”). Brian McHugh, however, claimed that the words in question were a command to kill (“Shoot the fucker!”).</li>
<li>(7) This quote is taken from the report of the PCA, handed over to the CPS on 11 April 1999.</li>
<li>(9) After Paul Philippou of the Justice for Diarmuid O’Neill Campaign had met the PCA to discuss the report, he summarized their argument to delay the interview with ‘Kilo’ as follows: ”They [the PCA] said it was standard procedure to talk to all the other officers first and then to question him [Officer ‘Kilo’]. That sounds very reasonable but only if the time period is quite short—not if it is two years.” [Tracey Davanna: “Why Was Diarmuid O’Neill Killed&#160;?” in Fortnight, November 1999, p. 13]</li>

By using the arguments put forward her this terrorist gets his page on Wikipedia not because he was notable - he was not - but because he appeared in the newspaper. Its quite pathetic. It is not a question of censorship, just whether or not this complete nobody, who never did anything in life other than join an organisation dedicated to furthing its aims by murdering innocent people and violence, should have an entry in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I read the following on the internet just now:</li>
<li>"Hardworking people have become alienated with politics because they don't have the time or inclination to struggle with its complexities. When they do try to put their view across, rational, well argued points are fobbed off with nonsense - spin, platitudes and stonewalling. So they give up, believing the world to have gone mad. Their silence clears the way for a small number of extremists to dominate policy making with their own agendas."</li>
<li>Does this sound familiar?! It sure does to me.</li>
<li>This comes from a guy who is speaking against the proposed new system of road-pricing in the UK, Nigel Humphries of the Association of British Drivers (ABD). This is NOT an endorsement of his views!!! (although...)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First off, lay off the personal attacks - clearly two people were curious why an "Article for Deletion" started out with "Keep and Expand"! Normally the nominator is giving reasons for "Deleting" here, not keeping. Second, I agree wholeheartedly with your comments that the change to a redirect was inappropriate, ill timed, and biased. Third, this appears to be more of the beginning of a content/merge dispute, which I agree should be nipped in the bud (as per walton monarchist89). <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 20:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>When discussing redirects, it's traditional to use the talk-page rather than using an AFD. In any case, the redirect request isn't related to a POV, since an unbiased user would see that the Trophy Hunting section on the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">Hunting</a> page is much more developed (and has been that way for at least a year when compared to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy_hunting.html" title="Trophy hunting">Trophy hunting</a>.) While the trophy hunting page was created first, it seems as the associated contributor to the hunting article was unaware of the subarticle in question and developed the content in the main page instead.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Calling people animal rights activists also undermines claims of POV, especially when they write what appears to be reasonable explainations to their claims or edits. Even though the discussion window was shorter than normal (since Trophy hunting wasn't edited that much), redirects will take place if there's no reasonable expectation of opposition. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigma_7_b43b.html" title="User:Sigma 7">Sigma 7</a> 20:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, don't redirect</b> - should not be merged with <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">Hunting</a>, as there's enough info already to make this an independent article.

<li><b>Redirect</b> - based on edit histories, the section in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">Hunting</a> was much more advanced and developed independantly. If the section becomes too large or unwieldly, it will then become suitable for a seperate article. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigma_7_b43b.html" title="User:Sigma 7">Sigma 7</a> 20:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't feel strongly either way. However, if the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy_hunting.html" title="Trophy hunting">trophy hunting</a> article is kept, the text should be deleted and replaced with the text at <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html#trophy_hunting" title="Hunting">hunting#trophy hunting</a> which is fuller and more neutrally worded. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeHobday_b9ab.html" title="User:MikeHobday">MikeHobday</a> 22:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, sorry, you're right - on closer inspection it's not primarily about a website. Nonetheless the important factor is the lack of independent online coverage - the links are to a freewebs site and a Myspace, which do not constitute evidence of notability. So my Delete vote stands. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 18:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>An open letter from The T Team to whom it may concern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hello all, The T Team here to shed some light on this little discussion. Several days ago, a young man named Elijah (see earlier comment) told us about how he had set up this little page for us on wikipedia. We had no desire to join good ol' wiki, but this young chap seemed to think we were important enough. We thanked him. Unsurprisingly enough, the article immediately came under scrutiny, mainly due to our unfortunate.....lack of funds, as it were, to get an actual domain name.</p>
<p>Side note for a minute, a quick message to J Milburn, your comment about free domains being non-notable....stupid. I'll have you know that professional wrestler Rick Steiner (one half of the tag team voted the second greatest of all time in North America by Pro-wrestling Illustrated) uses freewebs, and I'd call him pretty goddamn notable. Stupid comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's pretty clear to us that the article is hated, so we're more than happy for you to take it down. We don't need a wikipedia article. It was just something a young man decided to do to give back to the group he so loved, thinking others too would enjoy learning about this team. After all, in an encyclopedia that dedicates an entire article to "Allip" (yes J Milburn, that's a note to you), surely they encourage everyone to contribute whatever they can. Surely a great encyclopedia would cover as many topics as it possibly could? There are some articles with no external links or websites referenced at all, yet this seems fine as long as no freewebs sites are mentioned. We'll pass on the message to Elijah that for all future articles he hopes to set up, to put no websites at all to stand a better chance at not being deleted.</p>
<p>Well, that's all from us. We appreciate you taking an interest in our group, and hope you get a laugh from it here or there. This whole discussion has sort of made us wonder what you guys could possibly get out of scrutinising others peoples works. It makes no difference to you if these articles stay up. You put a lot of time into your articles and they put a lot of time into theirs, yet you say theirs aren't important enough for a website that you dont even own. You're just another brick in the wall. I wonder how many people have left this site in anger after they put a lot of time and effort into their own articles, only to have a Dungeons and Dragons nerd delete it. Sad, in a way. Anyway, that's by-the-by. Take it easy, guys</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have recieved so much abuse on AfD of late. First of all, the IP from which the long message was posted was the same IP that recently vandalised my userpage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJ_Milburn&amp;diff=103980502&amp;oldid=103690140" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AJ_Milburn&amp;diff=103980502&amp;oldid=103690140" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_Milburn&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103980723" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_Milburn&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=103980723" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I guess this person has some agenda against me. As for the matter of me commenting on the <i>official site</i> being on freewebs- it was just that, a comment that, as far as I could see, summed up the article. The actual reason for deletion, as I stated in my initial comment, was the fact that no notability was asserted. The official site, according to the article, IS on freewebs, and so if it is a stupid comment, it was your friend Elijah who made it. Bringing up <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allip.html" title="Allip">Allip</a> is just a classic case of the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_test_7449.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon test">Pokémon test</a>, and is irrelevent. Also, guess what? <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#It_should_be_about_everything" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia isn't about everything</a>. Why is there no article on me? Why is there no article on any of my friends? Because, much like (as far as I can see) this comedy troupe, we are not notable. The fact that so many articles on Wikipedia suck- If I come across one that does suck, I will do something about it. If there is no question that it is non-notable, I will speedy delete it. If there is question, I will bring it here. Sometimes I will <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">'prod'</a> it. Other times I will help rewrite it, or at least leave a message on the talk page, contact other editors, or tag it as needing attention in some field. The fact that I choose to edit Wikipedia as a hobby is irrelevent, and yes, I am just another brick in the wall. In nominating articles that should not be here for deletion, I am helping the encyclopedia in many ways. I don't own the website, but the whole point is that almost all of the work is done by volunteers. That doesn't mean that it is free web space, or that anything that is written should stay. Also, I haven't deleted it. I have nominated it for deletion, so that there can be a community consensus on the matter. It is not me who has chosen to delete the article, if it is deleted, but the community. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 16:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it me or are you the most boring people that ever lived!? There are many entries that read like a biog, that's part of what makes an encyclopedia an encyclopedia. Also if Wikipedia allows its pages to be moderated by a 16 year old tit that knows nothing about nothing and clearly has nothing better to do with his dull existence, then I would be delighted to remove the offending article myself. Evidence of my books being published are on the Welsh Books Council site if you would care to check. Oh, and my Voyage of Nomad book was reviewed in Buzz magazine, that's a South Wales arts and entertainment guide if you know as much about that as you do Welsh poetry. Who is notable? Certainly none of you pathetic individuals. That probably doesn't meet God knows how many of Wikipedia's idiotic pointless directives which are a complete contradiction on what is a free encyclopedia, but who cares. KH</p>

<ul>
<li>With TV episodes, from what I've seen both policy and precedent don't make a blanket judgement either way on TV episodes. Individual articles are OK, but only if the episodes are notable and the articles have sufficient content to justify their existence (or at least show the potential to get there with some editor effort). Really, TV episode articles should be judged on a case by case basis, not a notion that all should be kept or all deleted. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh come on, if you want me to bullshit you and retype my message all <i>Wikipedia-PC</i> with neutral sounding words, ok, but don't tell me people don't think that. Certainly, that should never be the criteria alone, as Wikipedia is a work in progress and we are here to improve rather than delete. BUT, it's not likely that such articles even can improve. Yes, some minor improvements have been made, such as an infobox and the slight rewording of the painfully small content, but it's still nothing more than an episode that is not independently notable, nor information that needs to be split due to size. It's just mindless plot summary for the sake of plot summary (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7). You seem to be missing the point of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> and other similar pages. I don't like it <b>because</b> it's not a good article nor does it have the potential to be one and because it is needless plot summary, which our policies and guidelines strongly discourage.

<dd>I'd like you to humour me and construct proper arguments, yes.

<dd>Maybe for the same reason I haven't corrected every typo on Wikipedia, time. The idea that this is a general censuses is what gets under my skin. It's not a consensus. I'm not saying there's consensus <i>against</i> episode articles, but there never was a real consensus for them. It's so painfully easy to make articles that it makes it appear there is wide support for this. New users come on (and even old ones), see the articles and do the same for other shows. It's not a horrible thing, and everyone was acting in good faith, but for the vast majority no thought was really given to the creation. It was not the result of a discussion, rather it's the result of a misconception on a major scale. Precedent does not help us in this situation. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 00:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And nice double standard you have there, considering the "reasons" some of the keeps have made. That being said, I have no problem with further explaining myself.

<dd>I would like to note that, in contrast to what Ned said above about consensus, a consensus to include articles on episodes of notable TV shows was reached at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a>. It's also worth noting, given his objections to plot summaries, that the very first thing included in a list of items "to include about a television episode, where possible" is a "plot summary of the episode". Furthermore, he should know both of these things, since he's edited both the page in queastion and its talk page. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 14:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it should also be noted that that page also says to create individual episode articles "Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes". It certainly doesn't say that every notable show should have an individual article for each episode, in fact it recommends starting with series and season articles first and only splitting individual articles as necessary. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is true, and ordinarily I would've suggested that this be merged back into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dilbert_animated_series_episodes_bb7f.html" title="List of Dilbert animated series episodes">List of Dilbert animated series episodes</a>, except that in this case doing so would break that page's table format. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:59, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a big supporter of <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a>, so yes, I know all about it. As Milo's note says, the topic of an episode is ok, but not necessarily an article dedicated to an episode. The episodes do not need individual articles, and only make themselves a target for cruft, trivia, and OR. Even forgetting anything about notability or any of those shades of gray, we still don't actually have anything more than a plot summary to write about that is unique to a specific episode. As for the table formatting, the solution to that is easy, just use the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Template%7EEpisode_list_d7db.html" title="Template:Episode list">Template:episode list</a> system. I would have no problems with a merge. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 19:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will 2nd Milo's and Ned's comments here. And I would like to introduce a term for this problem "Episode creep"&#160;:D. Yes the discussion says that. HOWEVER. It also says that you should not default to such behaviour, but where possible start with Shows -&gt; List of episodes. Then once you establish notability for a seperate article (translated: more then a plot summary and the stuff which is usually tracked in imdb) you can create seperate articles for episodes. This does not say you have to create articles for ALL episodes of a show. The idea here is to improve before you create instead of simply duplicating effort by creating a ton of episode articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 19:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Notability is questionable, and this article has been in essentially the same useless state for more than a year. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:36, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - lots of major shopping streets have their own articles at present, and as far as I know there's no specific policy on this issue. As to the article being in a "useless state", that can easily be fixed, and isn't necessarily a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to the article on the town. There is no reason to have it as a seperate article. As for their being plenty of articles on shopping streets, that is in no way a criteria for inclusion. The same logic can be used in reverse- there is no article on my local shopping street, so why should there be here? Well, actually, it was decided [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dalton_Road|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dalton_Road|here" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>] that it should be merged with the article on my local major town.

<li>Do we have hard evidence that he was an official member of this band?

<p>This league is strictly a reserve league. We have articles for the reserve leagues of the Premier League and the Football League, which are reasonable I think, but the reserve league of the Leicestershire Senior League is not notable.

<li>Saying that it has notability because a team won it last year is an odd comment. Every league that's existed for more than one year has a team that won it last year, they aren't all notable.

Lots of other small leagues have reserve divisions which are not notable enough for their own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although this reads in part like advertising, I think wiht some improvement it can be made into an article. I for one was researching Marlboro brands and this article was a useful source of info that they are a type of marlboro cigs - we dont have these in UK - only Blend 28.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think this article will be deleted as I did create an article on Cafe Creme cigarillos - it was wiped after a week with no discussion which I personally thought was wrong and the Wikipedian who did it should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Aside from that - people have made an effort with this article, and have put a picture of the brand too. It deserves to have work on it before deletion.</p>
<p>Many articles on this site would not appear in a normal encyclopedia. But this is no ordinary encyclopedia. I think if you delete this sort of article (aside from the arguements on health of this product - lets not forget artciles on BUrger King are bad for your health too) then other articles such as companies, majority of celebrities should be deleted too <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 20:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please refer to <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> insofar as your argument that others should be deleted if this one goes. With all due respect, your suggestion at deleting celebrities because we're debating deletion of a brand of cigarettes is a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-sequitur.html" title="Non-sequitur">non-sequitur</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The comparison was made simply because there are a lot of 'celebrities/sportspeople' on this encyclopedia who are not that famous outside their profession - by all means have an article on someone like Charlie Chaplin they are very well known but other celebrities who are still alive and not that famous, such as some soccer players who are on here is pointless - so on that basis if your going to keep the non celebrities/sportspeople why not keep other brands of cigarettes which are not that popular. Let us not beat about the bush, you wouldnt see this or some soccer player article in Encyclopedia Britannica would you?</p>
<p>I hope that this article is not being considered for deletion due to its content matter -i.e tobacco and someone who hates smokers is proposing its deletion. If it is, can I say that it is unlikely a non smoker would find this article and start smoking based on the content. I for one wouldnt! --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 21:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take note of the deletion logs. I am pretty sure there are others, I'll add them if I find them, most have been deleted more than once.

Besides that, the film is notable for being affiliated with <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> (being the first feature to have the Newgrounds logo on it). I contest your hypothesis that Benfer's popularity is limited to Wikipedia users or is stronger on Wikipedia than elsewhere on the internet. <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> says this: "Repeated re-creation of an article by previously unassociated editors may be evidence of a need for an article" The admin who deleted his entry and prevented its recreation last October (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Robert_Benfer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Robert_Benfer" rel="nofollow">page logs</a>) based his judgement on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Benfer_d693.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Benfer">this deletion vote</a> in February 2005. A review of his notability since that time has not been undertaken. According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" and "Name recognition" may be signs of notability. It would seem to me that he satisfies those criteria: his website is the #1 result when you <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;channel=s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=knox&amp;meta=&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;channel=s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=knox&amp;meta=&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">search for "knox"</a> on Google ("<a href="../../../k/n/o/Knox.html" title="Knox">knox</a>" is a common word which is used in many other contexts), he's the <a href="http://newgrounds.com/users_most_bookmarked.html" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/users_most_bookmarked.html" rel="nofollow">6th-most bookmarked</a> artist on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> (a website with over 1 million members), his <a href="http://www.knoxskorner.com/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.knoxskorner.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">website</a> has been visited over 14 million times and his films on Newgrounds <a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/search.php?terms=Knox&amp;kind=a&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/search.php?terms=Knox&amp;kind=a&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">had been viewed</a> 10,959,036 times as of Oct. 12, 2006. Also, this very film that we're discussing now sold 2000 copies in its first month despite being sold only online through his website (according to the Film Threat article). Since the film is a continuation of the "Klay World" series that have been so popular on Newgrounds, I would argue that it is notable. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 21:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The Filmthreat article is alright actually, I didn't spot it before. I did a google before nominating and saw the ArticlesBase one too. But the ArticlesBase article isn't a reliable source, anyone can submit articles there. It's pretty much an SEO magnet for backlinks. Newgrounds rankings are useless, you'll see that Legendary Frog has been deleted multiple times. Whereas <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xiao_21c5.html" title="Xiao Xiao">Xiao Xiao</a> has had a court case victory against Nike, and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Hominid_5d5a.html" title="Alien Hominid">Alien Hominid</a> has had various professional reviews and published by a third party, Knox, hasn't. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 21:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'd say that generally Film Threat shouldn't be considered a reliable source. It's basically a fanzine, with articles and content from unpaid volunteer writers. They're not at all discriminant as far as what they cover: to directly quote <a href="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=about" class="external text" title="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=about" rel="nofollow">their site</a>: "<i>Send your film to us, and we'll review it. That simple.</i>" I used to love their print version when it existed and I admire their anything-goes attitude, but they're far away from being a reliable source for our purposes. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as usual.

<li>Just a small note - some of the points I made above seem to suggest that his fanbase isn't exactly small. But anyway, I'm not really willing to fight this one - let it be as editors decide. There's a high likelyhood that the Benfer article will have to be unprotected eventually, anyway, so there's no rush. I'm not actually a fan of his (I realize this may be difficult to believe) - but I think that judging by his popularity, there is enough demand among readers to warrant a few wikipedia articles about him or his films. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 03:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is not true. I just started the article and it is in progress. Muslim society is not equivalent to Arab world. Muslims in india and Afghanistan etc have different cultures and traditions. Many restrictions are not due to religion. Instead it originates from traditions and cultures. This article is going to discuss the issue in the context of Arab culture and Arab social norms.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now per Ioukawa. "Muslim world" and "Arab world" are not the same (one is a religious category, the other ethnic). There is the danger of this becoming a POV-fork, and there will surely be some overlap between the two articles, but I think the topic is a defensible one. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg"><font color="#DF0001"><b>Buck</b></font><b><font color="green">ets</font></b><font color="grey"><b>ofg</b></font></a> 19:09, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The sister of an important religious figure, but it's unclear how she's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> by herself. Her name, in some obvious spellings, gets low-3-figure Google hits.

<p><b>Keep and rewirte:</b> I agree maybe the article does need re-wording in some places, however Bebe Nanaki Ji, is of great historical importance in the Sikh Faith. The reason for my humble contribution to Wikipedia was to add valuable insight into the life of the first Sikh of the Sikh faith. As well as being the first sikh, she was also a woman, which has far reaching conoltations in regards to one of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's core messages of equality between men and women.</p>
<p>She also played the pivotable part in the recognition of Guru Nanak Dev Ji as an enlightened spiritual leader. There was a unique relationship not just as the first sikh but also as a Sister.</p>
<p>Admittedly there is not nearly enough reference material regarding her life, which is also another reason for posting the article.</p>
<p>If you could all make suggestions in the areas you think that need work, i am sure that the work could be accomodated rather than deleting the article as a whole. I think this would be an injustice to the readers of wikipedia. The fact is people come to wikipedia to learn about something that they did not know before they came to read its pages. I am sure a fair number of people read the articles around Sikhism and Guru Nanak Dev Ji and as such it is a shame that such a prominent Sikh Figure as Bebe Nanaki goes without a mention on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Forgive me for i am a literary novice with the best of wishes.</p>

<dd>No I meant that I was incorrect in noting the person was male. The spelling of Bebe is confusing as Sikhs would use "Bibi" instead. That still hardly matters as "Bibi NAnaki" (as she is more commonly known) is notable.

<p>Editor of the house paper of the Seventh Day Adventists.

<li>I think Francis M. Wilcox is a very significant Seventh-day Adventist individual. His name appears in the <i>Historical Dictionary of the Seventh-day Adventists</i> edited by Gary Land ([Scarecrow Press, 2006], pp. 328) and the Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia ([Review and Herald, 1996], vol. 11, p. 900). Both have sizable articles on him. The article is a stub so it is a start and I (and I see at least one other person) have begun to work on it. His most significant contribution is editor of the Seventh-day Adventist church paper, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Review_and_Herald_be6b.html" title="Review and Herald">Review and Herald</a> for which we have articles for the other editors. The editor of this publication is usually a "heavyweight" when it comes to dealing with denominational issues and he is therefore a key person to helping understand the milieu of Adventism.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no significant hits from Google News Archive (he does show up in apparent trivial mentions in ancient WaPo stories behind a paywall), Google Scholar, or Google Books.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This individual is significant and I've already expanded it from a few lines. Yes, it does need more sources, but as a Ph.D. student in history I also know that Google scholar is not a very good test for reliability. There are several academic treatments of Adventism from reputable, scholarly sources that need to be cited (and will be). I would urge for this article to be kept so that these sources can be added and the article expanded. The area of my doctoral research is on the 1920s and F. M. Wilcox was a significant figure in the interactions between Adventists and Fundamentalists, was a cutting edge leader in espousing Adventist doctrines, and played a very significant role in developing views of Pacifism by World War II. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewalkingstick_cb57.html" title="User:Thewalkingstick">Thewalkingstick</a> 31 Jan 2007</li>

<p>Non-notable indy wrestler. A google search turned up a Fred Sampson (that isn't a wrestler), fan sites such as OWW with Fred Sampson on it, and so on. The TV.com link just lists his WWE appearances: which isn't that notable either. WWE is known to hire indy wrestlers for matches and segments. Because Fred has done a bunch, he is notable for Wikipedia? I don't think so. If we had wrestling bio articles for everyone WWE has used for matches and segments: Wikipedia would be flooded with tons of cruft. This article is better suited for a wrestling wiki. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 20:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article because there are links for this wrestler on other articles on wiki. I know he isn't majorly noticeable but I don't like seeing links that have nothing on them. I did do some checking and a google search brings back this many results "1,300 articles for "Fred Sampson" #wrestler". There is some interesting facts for him, I included references and source martial with him. He is on the WWE scout list, hasn't had a full contract. But has had Heat and Velocity jobs.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Your not entering it right, The search you are performing is looking for two separate terms. You want to do "Fred Simpson" #wrestler because using the # sign looks at the articles for where exactly Fred Simpson is located and finds if it has the wrestler word attached in that same area. This is the better way to search using relative terms. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 09:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, I know exactly how you got that result. You typed in your search string, looked at the first page, then claimed 1200+ hits. However if you keep looking through the pages of results (no need to do it one at a time) you eventually get to the last page which gives you the number of unique hits. <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html#On_.22unique.22_results" title="WP:GOOGLE">See here</a> for more information, it only returns one hit per domain and disregards substantially similar pages. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 19:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tagged as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> and deleted, but restoration requested so I'm bringing it here. No evidence of non-trivial coverage in independent reliable sources, sole claim to notability appears to be one member who was briefly part of a barely-notable band before they were barely-famous. There are only 49 Google hits <i>in total</i>, 35 of which are unique, none of which appears to be a reliable source. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If non-trivial coverage is an overriding criterion, then I agree, as I cannot locate any press about Dupobs, and indeed the google hits are as you describe, for what that's worth.</p>
<p>But since this is a guideline open to interpretation and flexibility, we should consider the case on its merits, and according to criteria relevant in the world of music. The criteria for Notability:Music apply here, don't they? Reading the article would indicate that the crossover in band membership is current (a simple perusal of the relevant band URLs confirms this) - even though that shouldn't matter -, so the charge that the 'sole claim to notability appears to be one member <i>who was briefly part</i> of a barely notable (sic) band' is incorrect (emphasis added).</p>
<p>As regards the band upon which Dupobs relies for its claim to Notability, I don't know what you mean by 'barely-famous', but I had thought fame was not a criterion for Notability. And if said band satisfies Notability (by association with other undisputed notables, and by multiple, nontrivial coverage in independent, reliable sources), I fail to see how you can make the claim that this constitutes "barely-notable". I don't know what that concept means; I cannot find a definition for it in Wikipedia's guidelines. Do we really need to create such categories? --<a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeandjinni_32e6.html" title="User:Jeandjinni">Jeandjinni</a> 22:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed: notability and fame are exclusive. And seeing as fame is not a criterion for notability, the article should not be deleted. I doubt a deletion would be considered were dupobs to comprise a member from a famous (not just notable) musical group. Also keep in mind that searching the internet is not necessarily an effective means to determine notability for musical groups that were in existence, and ceased to be active, before the proliferation of the internet, as was the case for another music group (not the one meeting notability criteria) comprising one of dupobs' members (see article). Consider also the cross-reference to PRISM international, which, according to its website, has published works by highly notable authors such as Jorge Luis Borges and Margaret Atwood. Interestingly, there's no article for PRISM international on Wikipedia. So who's to determine what's notable or not? The article should stay.</p>

<dd>Per <i>policy</i>, we can't have an article without sources. Per <i>policy</i> we are not a directory. So per <i>policy</i> we ask for multiple non-trivial sources. We clarify that in the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>, which explains it all in some detail and represents a distillation of many thousands of deletion debates.

<dd>Guy, as has been argued before elsewhere - doesn't the lack of any sources make this a case of verifiability (not notability)? Anyway, if this rule were applied to a jazz ensemble of fifty years ago, would the case be viewed differently? I know what an encyclopedia is; I just want to help make a better one. To me that encyclopedia would include marginal, specialized music that is "notable" in circles where specialized cultural or aesthetic knowledge (like specialized scientific knowledge, which is protected on similar grounds) is required to assess the music's notability. There's plenty of outside music that could be considered "notable" on artistic criteria alone, and which is the result of twice-or-thrice removed collaborations between musicians who work in other projects, written about in respected publications long out of print and never digitized. This music surely did not not exist! I also understand the need to keep out the garage bands, the false starts, and the fictions and I forcefully agree with that reasoning. But surely the Music Notability guidelines (and we can debate how these could be refined on that page to account for this) should reflect and respect the logics of particular music scenes and traditions, rather than rest on a simple reiteration of the "verifiability" criterion, which could throw out a huge chunk of important music.--<a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeandjinni_32e6.html" title="User:Jeandjinni">Jeandjinni</a> 15:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I am concerned, the two are inextricably linked. A notable subject will have sufficient sources to be verifiable, a subject verifiable form multiple non-trivial sources is likely to be notable. I have yet to see an example of a subject which has multiple independent non-trivial sources but which is not notable. This is not an article about a jazz band from fity years ago, it's about a band from right now which has no independent sources. There are folk muscians now with negligible Google presence, but these are not folk musicians, theya re argued to be a significant rock band. No evidence of significance is presented. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, plenty of corporate-funded musical entities build whole careers on multiple purportedly 'independent non-trivial sources' without otherwise establishing Notability by any aesthetic criteria. I know that relying on sources is convenient (esp. considering the number of nn band articles that should be deleted), but the problem with using sources as a basis of distinction is that the independence and non-triviality of many sources can be in question. Are we to accept that a magazine such as <i>Rolling Stone</i> deserves its italics when it is arguably not much more than an advertiser-supported PR gallery for large record companies, essentially a "Billboard" with a bit of critical artifice? Secondly, that it's not a jazz or folk ensemble is <i>precisely</i> the point. There are different standards of Notability in different genres, which is (or ought to be) the rationale for the more open guidelines specific to music articles. 'Avant garde rock' is the genre in question, not 'rock'. No one's arguing that the Dupobs are Notable in the same way that Led Zeppelin is. The yardstick used should be different. --<a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeandjinni_32e6.html" title="User:Jeandjinni">Jeandjinni</a> 16:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You appear to be arguing for us to have articles on bands because you think they are good, not because there are independent sources on which an article can be based. It doesn't work that way. A young performer I heard recently, Etienne Cutajar, has more talent in his little finger than the average boy band has in its entire collective body, but there are no sources (well, one, but it's in the journal of the British Horn Society so not widely circulated), so no article. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 00:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Guy, where did I ever say I thought Dupobs was good? I <i>agree</i> that Dupobs doesn't satisfy <i>verifiability</i> - that's an objective test. However, I disagree that <i>Notability</i> is the same thing for all musical genres or subcultures. There are other criteria I've suggested (aesthetics, relation to various traditions, coverage in dead press), but no one seems interested in talking about that. I agree with the proposed deletion on the grounds of <i>verifiability</i>, not on the grounds of <i>notability</i>. Further, in the hypothetical example you've cited, why would you think wide circulation mattered? As I've suggested in a more general sense previously, wouldn't the deletion of the Etienne Cutajar article constitute bias of Wikipedia in favour of coverage by commercial publications? Surely you wouldn't go that far?--<a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeandjinni_32e6.html" title="User:Jeandjinni">Jeandjinni</a> 01:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "visible notability" material has been in the article since I originally posted it back when Wikipedia was young. I don't want to sound testy, but has anyone read it? As far as editing my own article, doing so is entirely consistent with my life and work. As you can see, I haven't glorified myself. I've simply listed a few of my accomplishments with pointers to others. I was unaware of the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> guideline (which I note are guidelines, not rules) when I added a few more items. I really don't get any of this. You've instituted a set of rather obscure "guidelines" and you are now zealously enforcing them retroactively as if they were rules in the most heavy-handed way possible. Does it occur to you that perhaps you should have read the article and looked at the external links first?

<dd>If you read the discussion, you'll see that I supplied the links to the reviews. Since you've discouraged me from editing my own page, I now have to wait for someone to spontaneously post them, I presume. Oh well, I'll just go ahead and post them myself and you can use that against me, too.</dd>

<dd>I also want to take exception to your comment about "blogs." You are setting criteria that you have absolutely no competence to judge. A review is a review. Who are you to determine the credibility of the source? You admit that you don't have deep knowledge of "the nature of US publications." In my case, the nature of the publications in which my work has <i>appeared</i> -- not reviewed -- is what actually counts the most and what makes me "notable." So if you aren't aware of the significance of New American Review, Saturday Evening Post, Playboy, Village Voice, Library of America, Rolling Stone, The Rock History Reader, you should perhaps do some research. All of these publications are listed in my cv.</dd>

<dd>People who come looking for me do so because of the quality of my work, often because they've seen my name mentioned in an online discussion, or because they are historians and scholars who are researching Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, Thomas Pynchon and other celebrated people about whom I wrote articles that are unique original sources of information. The Brian Wilson story has been anthologized several times and is used as a primary source in every book about him. It's usually referred to as a "classic."</dd>

<dd>Now I can get one of my admirers to write that up and put it on the page, but I don't really feel that would be much different from doing it myself. The basic issue here is honesty. That's what my work is all about. If you can't perceive that from what I've written in this discussion and you can't get the points raised by the people who have written in my behalf, I think that I have to challenge you to defend your credibility and your judgment. Who are you exactly? Why are you tearing around Wikipedia imposing your rather legalistic edicts in areas where you admit you have little or no expertise?</dd>

<dd>Let's get something straight. I don't need Wikipedia. I posted some corrections in the story on Cancun quite a while ago. I don't recall when I decided to put up a brief item about myself. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I did not realize that I would later be subjected to a "procedure" about it by an over-zealous administrator intent on maintaining the purity of Wikipedia from the un-notable. I was later invited to contribute by Jimmy Wales after I wrote to him to complain about offensive remarks about me that appeared in the Thomas Pynchon article that I could not edit because my IP address had been banned for unknown reasons. The remarks were immediately corrected by one of the administrators who was responsible for the page and my IP was fixed. So it's really more of a case of Wikipedia needing me, specifically because of my "notability."</dd>

<p>A friend has pointed out to me that the vanity remark refers to the fact that I wrote my own entry. That's right. I am a <a href="http://www.google.com.mx/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=T6Z&amp;q=%22self+referential+art%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.mx/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=T6Z&amp;q=%22self+referential+art%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">self-referential</a> artist. My work is about me and what I see. That's the only truth I know. It's the only truth I believe. Anything else is hearsay. I used to write about Very Important People -- Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, Thomas Pynchon -- for very large publications. A time came when I realized that my own life was what I knew best and that was what I should record.</p>
<p>Go ahead and delete it. If someone else chooses to restore it, that's fine with me. Dumped from Wikipedia for writing my own brief bio. From <i>Wikipedia</i>?. It's just the greatest! I love it. --Jules Siegel</p>
<p>I don't profess to be a Wikipedia expert, but Mr. Siegel appears to meet the "notability" test for authors set forth on the Wiki help pages that "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". Perhaps he can elaborate, particularly with respect to the "art" and travel books. -- Jack Lebowitz Jackl2400 17:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

But let's not get that heavy. Go ahead and delete me. I give up. Wikpedia has <i>rules</i>. You've got to know those rules. <i>Other</i> people have to point out that I am notable. <i>Other</i> people have to delete the delete Jules Siegel notice. [Slaps head.] How could I have been so <b>stupid</b>! Now I'm not going to be in Wikipedia and I am banished to the <a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/you_are_pitiful_isolated_individuals-you_are/294968.html" class="external text" title="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/you_are_pitiful_isolated_individuals-you_are/294968.html" rel="nofollow">dustbin of history</a>. That's what I get for talking back. Will I <i>never</i> learn?</p>
<p><b>Keep it</b>. Siegel is a noted author with an compelling life story and an established body of work, who has been widely recognized by his peers. It seems to me the wikipedians are getting a little heavy-handed with their wanton purges based on an overencompassing vanity criteria. Self-submitted entries should be scrutinized certainly, but this should not be solely used as a convenient and to my mind, somewhat lazy excuse, to delete. Surely if his work is considered important enough for MOMA, that alone should render the request to delete moot. -- Libby Spencer <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.57.79.132_22d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.57.79.132">66.57.79.132</a> (talk)</small></p>

<p>This article about a place in India was clearly written by a few users who are unfamiliar with how to write a good article on Wikipedia. I am not making a statement about the notability of the place. However, as it stands, the article needs a complete overhaul at the very least.

<p>Low number of Google hits suggest that 'mall emo' is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">non-notable neologism</a>. The article seems to contain mostly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, as none of the sources/references listed contain the term "mall emo".

<p>"If this makes it into major media like the NYT, then it will be a notable hoax." Why should an electronic public encyclopedia use foolish standards of inclusion, when there's no limitation of print, pages, or storage? The notion of a useful standard of "notability" is an idiotic enterprise, on the part of wiki policy. ALL MANNERS OF MINUTIAE are "notable" for somebody somewhere who has cause to find information that particular thing, at some point in time. The Infinite Solutions video exists in the world. Secondly, people have already taken the cell-phone/network video seriously. If anybody wanted to understand whether the videos were "real" or "fake" a wiki would obviously help. To assert that the hoax isn't "notable" because there's no big-media mention, and therefore that it shouldn't be included in wikipedia, is nothing more than snobbish ignorance. (By the way, the suggestion that NY Times coverage somehow inherently lends "authoritative"ness to any issue or topic, or set of facts, is extremely naive.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.119.132.160 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.119.132.160_0ba7.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.119.132.160">contribs</a>).</small></p>
