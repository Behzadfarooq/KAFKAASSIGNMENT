<dd><b>Comment</b>. As I was the one who originally off-loaded the Pro Tour part of the list into this article from the main Magic: The Gathering article, they are nowhere near interesting and important enough to go in the main article, which is already a bit over-long.

<dd>I disagree, as clearly there are tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people playing in sanctioned tournaments, which is only a small percentage of the Magic-playing population, of which it is a given there are people who are important enough to be notable and therefore need articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> this is a bit of a catch-all isnt' it? I don't see the purpose of this article. Creators and Support Staff should be listed in the main MtG article. NetReps don't need to be mentioned (none of them meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> anyway)... same with the Fans.

<dd>I agree, the Netreps section can probably be deleted, but if you agree about the rest of the content being keepable, then I ask you consider whether enlarging that article any further is desirable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:50, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I didn't say the rest was necessarily Keepable, though I think a list of Tournament Players could be kept, but that should be a category or List of Magic: The Gathering Tournament Players with the caveat that they must all meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to be listed there. The rest of the people in the current article don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as far as I can tell, so I don't see the purpose of a catch-all article with various lists of people with differing connections to M:TG, any of whom don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:11, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, the biggest problem though is that this is a muddled amalgam of people with varying relations to the game. The criteria for inclusion is vague or non-existant.

<li><b>Delete</b> As one of the NetReps, I find it mildly amusing that some Wiki guardians - who have no concept of who I may be, nor what contributions I might make - find those things to be trivial.

<li><b>Comment</b>. We seem to have gone to a standard where any olympic athlete is considered notable for purposes of inclusion. I'm not saying there is a problem with this; but particularly with the minor athletes who don't place in the olympics--but do participate--I bet you would be hard pressed to find "<i>numerous</i> verifiable sources" (at least those which are easy to find).

<li><b>Comment</b> Not just <i>any</i> olympic athlete rates for inclusion. The subject has to perform at the "highest level."
