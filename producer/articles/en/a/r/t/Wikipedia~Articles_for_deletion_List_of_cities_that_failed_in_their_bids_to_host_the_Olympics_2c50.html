<li><b>Comment</b> - They're definitely redundant; not sure I particularly like the naming on either.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not a fan of lists, but this list contains encyclopedic information that isn't easily or quickly derivable from the <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a> article. Moreover, a category would only serve to note that the city had failed at least once for a bid; it wouldn't show how many times they had failed and in which years. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 21:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree that this is redundant because it organizes the information in a different way. These lists are complementary. I suppose, however, that you could merge the two lists -- basically making this a second section on <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a>. Either way, not a discussion for AfD. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 02:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to a new section in <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The list contains information not found in the two cited articles (for older years) and also presents the information in an alternate format. I will try for a cleanup of the list's appearance. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:39, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have converted part of the list into table format that lists entries by: Country, City, Failed Bids. I would appreciate any comments (either here, the article's talk page, or my talk page) as to whether I should proceed with this format or suggestions for an alternate format. Thanks, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I like the format, but more than ever this now appears suitable as a section in <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a>. Is there some reason not to put it there? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 23:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, two reasons. Firstly, I generally prefer merges to be conducted outside of AFD. I know this is just a personal preference, but I think it allows for a merge to be performed with more deliberation and more participation from other editors. Secondly, <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a> sorts by year, whereas this article (which <i>really</i> needs to be renamed) sorts by country and city (formerly just city). The two are currently not redundant, as <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a> does not include information on failed bids prior to the 2000s. Ideally, all of this information should be in one article, but the problem as I see it is this: how can we merge all of the information into one place without reducing readability and usability? All of the information in this article <i>can</i> be merged into <a href="../../../b/i/d/Bids_for_Olympic_Games_7aeb.html" title="Bids for Olympic Games">Bids for Olympic Games</a>, but I don't see how the alternate presentation format can be preserved (simply converting to a sortable table won't suffice). Perhaps you can offer suggestions? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your points. How about adding another column for successful bids, and then simply adding the resulting table as a section in the Bids article? And regardless, as you say, this discussion doesn't really belong here. Shall we move it to the talk page of the article? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 13:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as Olympic bids are major city events it is notable to list how many times each has failed. Merge is unnecessary and would complicate the other list(s). â€“<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 09:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
