And her page survived that. Since then, Boyd appeared on the O'Reilly factor, on Fox News, to talk about the internet. So she's increasingly visible!

<dd>Justin, there wasn't so much a "convened panel of Wikipedians", as just two or three people talking about the article since March 22 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danah_boyd&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danah_boyd&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which is a very different thing than the formal (and much more serious) Deletion Review process that's going on right now. Please, can you provide any proof about the Fox News appearance, like a link to her name on the Fox News site, or any other major press (CNN, MSNBC, BBC)? At the moment, I'm on the fence about her bio, but leaning towards "Delete", since the way that the bio is currently written, it reeks of a vanity article (please read the policies at <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>). The article has been trying to claim that Danah is amazingly famous, but if she's so famous, how come there's nothing in the article about her being mentioned in major news sites? So far, the way things look, is that this article is just by a bunch of her friends trying to claim that she's well-known, but trust me, that does <i>not</i> go over well among seasoned Wikipedia editors. Also, the obvious sockpuppet/meatpuppet votes (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>) that are piling up below are not helping matters, since it's obvious to anyone who understands Wikipedia, that the votes are by newbie users, and as such are near meaningless. Unless some serious credible evidence can be provided that Danah is genuinely well-known, I am probably going to vote "delete", myself. Please please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and provide some solid credible proof about danah's fame. Otherwise the article should probably go away until there is enough credible media attention to make it stick. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:14, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> danah is all over, so this seems silly to delete here at wikipedia. She is a leading authority about all sorts of social and internet topics, and there are people who want to look up here accomplishments and information about her. -- Mary Hodder 14:39, 11 April 2006 (<small>(First and only comment ever posted by User:128.111.166.190, 15:40, April 10, 2006</small>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This can hardly count as a vanity page. boyd is a committed, articulate, insightful and prolific scholar and public intellectual on the topic of networked social communities. It's hardly relevant whether a friend created a page or not. --Julian Bleecker 14:47, 10 April 2006 <small>(Posted by User:Jbleecker, 15:48, 10 April 2006)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the talk page shows, we went some rounds on this and figured that this is an interesting border case in terms of notability. I did some addition of relevant cites that I believe makes the case for her being notable and she definitely passes <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> (which is a <i>proposed</i> policy). Of course, I think even danah would agree when I say Wikipedia would not be much of a different place without this article... but I could have sworn that the standard was to err on the side of inclusion for borderline notable cases. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebeone_7919.html" title="User:Joebeone">Joebeone</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoebeone_73bb.html" title="User talk:Joebeone">Talk</a>) 22:16, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i><b>Later:</b></i> I should be clear: I would hate to see that the fact that someone like myself, a friend and colleague, edited her article would lead to it being deleted. I can commit to not editing it, if that would help. I did some more poking around on Lexis and found at least one other news article from a major paper that is a profile of danah<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Also, it might be the case that the article appears to be a vanity peace because of my recent edits where I tried to track down cites to investigate notability. As to some of Elonka's specific criticisms: The NYT profile isn't enough? What about the SF Chron profile I've linked to here (that I would add to her piece but it might increase the vanityness)? Also, it seems premature to claim sockpuppetry as no one has been accused of using alternative logins to edit this or other articles related to this issue, no? Granted, the fact that they are new to Wikipedia will affect the weight of their votes, as it usually does. I should also finally note that danah is friends with Jimmy Wales and even got him to speak here at our school (which I was fortunate enough to record) <a href="http://josephhall.org/nqb2/index.php/2005/11/03/jimbo" class="external autonumber" title="http://josephhall.org/nqb2/index.php/2005/11/03/jimbo" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>; if you download that mp3, the woman you hear introducing Jimbo before his talk is danah. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebeone_7919.html" title="User:Joebeone">Joebeone</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoebeone_73bb.html" title="User talk:Joebeone">Talk</a>) 22:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that this page should be kept. I feel like I run into Danah Boyd time and time again on the internet.

I've extensively rewritten the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danah_boyd.html" title="Danah boyd">danah boyd</a> page to bring it into line with Wikipedia format -- in my opinion, the notability requirements are definitely met. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 17:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A handful of paper and citations but not enough for me to think she qualifies under the professor test. Might qualify as a notable blogger. Passing mentions in newspapers and 5 minutes of fame on a popular TV show does not amount to squat. Being a friend of Jimbo does not qualify as notable. Lots of google hits. But when your first google hit begins "hi, this is me", you have to wonder about the quality of them. I'm not convinced she's not notable, but I am convinced the page does not establish notability. <b>Delete without prejudice</b> unless the article is trimmed to focus only on what is notable about her, and expanded to show what is notable about her - not just claim that she is. It should be obvious to the reader that she is notable, and why. What is her great contribution to the universe?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks like a preponderance of the evidence to me. Not <i>very</i> notable, but notable enough. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:50, 12 April 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Danah's work is important and she is important in bringing systematic evidence to bear about MySpace. She is a featured speaker at conferences and the media. Indeed, I direct all media inquiries about MySpace to her. Given that she has good evidence, whereas others just talk, her work is both notable and important, and Wikipedia folks interested in MySpace would be well directed to her/it. Who cares if she is a PhD student or a 63-year p;d Harvard PhD (like me). Credentialism is a poor criterion. Danah IS important.
