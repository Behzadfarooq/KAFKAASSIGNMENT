<li><b>Delete</b>. Local neologism that doesn't even clearly explain how it's different than "got 'em", if there's anything other than the spelling--removing punctuation from an expression doesn't seem very notable. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:49, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> not notable. The expression "Got 'em" (never spelled "Gotem") as an abbreviation for "Got them" is very old and long predates usage by Florida high school students. The new usage described for a single local high school in Florida is not notable, probably a fad that will end when they graduate or get bored and move on to the next fad. If an article about the very common English expression "Got 'em" is needed, then write it from scratch... there's nothing here that could be used. By the way, some of the "keep" votes above are suspicious and sound like an informally organized campaign to stuff the ballot box. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:39, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Neologism. No evidence presented of real use outside a very narrow circle.

"everythign starts small, let this grow. itll stop growing on its own if its not meant to be" is really the key: Wikipedia is not for the promotion of new trends, however, worthy. It is an encyclopedia that presents already-well-established existing facts that are already of some degree of importance. I am not convinced that the supporters are sockpuppets, and I'm sorry they are having a rough introduction to Wikipedia.. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:28, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, I'm probably doing something controversial here, but I'm making a point about the unprofessional and harmful comments that have been left along with votes, by setting apart these votes like the "suspect votes" were set apart.

<dd>Comment: What's done is done, but in the future please <b>do not</b> try to sort out the suspect or controversial votes. It makes it almost impossible to sort these discussions out at the end of the discussion period. Too much context is lost when the comments and/or replies are moved.

<li><b>Comment</b> If I were the acting sysop on this page, I would probably count these as about three "keep" votes. Admittedly there's no way to be sure and a clever person could simulate different personalities and writing styles. I see enough differences in style between different voters to there's more than one voter. I see enough similarities in style to think there are fewer than nine. taking the geometrical mean of one and nine, I get three... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Only sockpuppets take geometric means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> checking this page i can see that some people suspect that "sock puppets" have been used. I give you my word, that to my knowledge, no sock puppets have been used. Now granted some of the "keep" votes are by new users, which apparently aren’t going to count (however i think they should). So a question for an admin, how is it determined what votes are used and what votes are thrown out. Does a person need to have a certain number of edits, be a member for a certain amount of time, ect.. I am in no way trying to cause trouble, I am just curios as to what the protocol is. (And besides even if the votes that have been thrown out were counted the article would still be deleted, sadly I might add). One last thing would it be a problem for me to have the gotem article on my homepage? bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:31, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not suggesting that you yourself are a sockpuppet but nearly all of the those anonymous keeps came in within a few minutes of the page being VFD'd which is a strong indication that a little clique had been 'instant messaged' to fluff up the vote. Why else did a bunch of anonymous voters show up so quickly? It never happens unless some form of sockpuppetry is involved. I don't think they were sockpuppets in the strict sense of the word, but there was obviously a group of people trying to make their little catch-phrase into something it isn't. The delete votes, most of which came from regular contributors, straggled in as they normally do over the next hours and days. --207.253.111.119 15:18, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(This comment isn't just directed at 207.253.111.119 -- though it's fascinating that the strongest elitism is coming from an anonymous IP -- but at everyone in this discussion who is attacking the new users who tried to contribute to Wikipedia.)</dd>
<dd>They aren't sockpuppets in any sense of the word. It may be annoying when a new user recruits other new users to back them up on VfD, but there's no rule against it, and there shouldn't be, because all users are equal.</dd>
<dd>Editors who have made hundreds of edits are usually dismayed to find that some high school student recruited over IM can cast a vote that counts as much as theirs. They tend to react by intimidating the users, either calling them names or telling them that their votes don't count (which is untrue). You've done this too, now.</dd>
<dd>So is it that upsetting that someone might vote against you? Someone who (gasp) isn't familiar with how Wikipedia works? You should sit back and relax, knowing that other experienced editors will come along and cast their own votes, and the right thing will happen to the article.</dd>
<dd>Sure, this article doesn't have much worth, but the users supporting it might once they get more Wikipedia experience. Wouldn't it be great if more high schoolers discovered Wikipedia and found out what a wonderful thing it is? Instead, though, they tend to discover Wikipedia and immediately have to withstand a barrage of personal attacks on VfD. Get off your high horse and go edit some articles.</dd>

<dd>Actually, that "anonymous" comment was mine -- I didn't realize I wasn't logged in when I made it. I must admit I am baffled by the suggestion of 'elitism'.

<dd>I could not agree more with Rspeer, the whole point of wikipedia is to make loads of knowledge available to the masses for free. And the only way that a lot of knowledge can be compiled is if a lot of people compile it. When veteran users come out and attack an article so furiously is not saying much about the wikipedia community. I enjoy Wikipedia, I like creating new articles and editing old ones, and I like to just sit and read wikipedia. But the problem is wikipedia will die out if veteran users attack new users in the way that happened many times on this vfd page (lets face it veteran users, which i am not one of, as you age, get married, get a job, have kids, wikipedia will fall to the bottom of your todo list). I guess what I am trying to say is that just be friendly to the new users, help them with various wikipedia protocol (which i am still learning and i have been part of wikipedia for a good 2-3 months now). And instead of declaring their vote invalid (because they only have one edit, or are new to wikipedia) and mocking their attempt at trying to save a wikipedia article they like, tell them why it isn’t a valid wikipedia article (which wasn’t done until days after the initial votes were posted), and i would think that the process would go smother. I know this wikipedia article will be taken down, but that is no longer the point, the point is (and some users ego's still wont let them see this) that I think wikipedia needs to take a look at who they treat new users, becuase remember in the future it will be us (i am only 17, and most of my friends-which made up a large majority of the keep votes- are the same age)who will be keeping wikipedia alive, so come on treat as with a little respect.bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:42, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Read the comments again! There are comments on the article itself - most of which are utterly bland and neutral, saying that it doesn't belong. And then there are comments about the voting, some of which merely express irritation that a bunch of people came out of nowhere for the sole purpose of saving this one little catch phrase which wouldn't belong in WP anyway. That's not elitism. It's not a ferocious attack. Anyone is welcome as a contributor but if a contributor doesn't understand what WP is all about, someone else will point that out to them. Hopefully this will be done diplomatically, but sometimes not. I actually think people have been remarkably restrained and good-humored about this and a number of people have taken pains to explain how things work. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 02:42, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Reading through some of the delete votes i was amazed at the amount of elitism that was contained in there reasons for deletion. While maybe I am just reading the votes wrong, I still find it somewhat shocking that this is how some of the veteran users treat new users. It seems to me that there is a wikiclick and if you are not part of the "click" then your going to be in trouble. I just think that people should maybe tone down their responses and try and welcome new members instead of scaring them off by bashing them. bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:44, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Lots of votes here are misunderstood. Veteran users aren't all a bunch of elitists. Most of them are just trying to be effective and quick about the deletion process. People who feel strongly about the subject may feel hurt about its deletion, but it's not a personal attack. They're trying to keep the wiki clean and it can be really frustrating to see such stuff coming by. I recommend all new users to read the policy on what <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">wikipedia isn't</a>.

<li>Yeah.

I posted the notes about number of user edits because it's common practice on VfD votes to do so. However, I think we (including myself) often forget to take into account that new users are often unfamiliar with Wikipedia policies. I'll note to be a bit less brusque in the future. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoobergunch_e9e1.html" title="User:Goobergunch">Goobergunch</a>|<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoobergunch_93e1.html" title="User talk:Goobergunch">?</a> 20:23, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don’t think it matters fvw, if that is the users first post or 1000 post. What matters is the point that he made, which I think is rather valid. So I think that this vote should in fact be counted because the point is valid and one that should be taken into consideration.bakuzjw (aka 578) 03:08, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>I don’t think it matters</i> — You should, because it does. Please famliarize yourself with what is written at the top of <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. <i>the point is valid</i> — No, it isn't. If "knowledge" is "lost" by an article being deleted from Wikipedia, then said knowledge was, by definition, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is not permitted in the first place. Moreover, it's pretty damning evidence of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">non-notability</a> of the word if the only place that it is known about is a Wikipedia article submitted by a handful of schoolchildren. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:36, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)

<li>I guess we are just going to disagree on this issue then Uncle G, I can't help it if you have a closed mind and don’t like it when "a handful of schoolchildren" stand up for something they like. If you delete this page or not really makes no difference to me because it will live on forever on my user homepage, and perhaps in a couple of months i will repost it and see how the votes fall that time. bakuzjw (aka 578) 00:50, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you'd better make sure you have a lot more evidence to present of it being notable at that time, because if you recreate an article that was deleted by a VfD consensus, it qualifies for a speedy delete. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:52, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes that is what i meant, i wouldn’t just repost an article for kicks, and besides, right now i am very well versed in all of the rules regarding wikipeida VfD because i have read over them at least twice (because various people have referred to them in there comments). bakuzjw (aka 578) 21:15, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What users such as CharlieO do not seem to realize is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and as such has no interest in "capturing the birth" of <b>anything.</b> At least not in form of an encyclopedia article in the main namespace. That is simply not what Wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_general_knowledge_base" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base</a>.

<li>Put it on a web page in any reasonable location and let archive.org capture it. Many ISPs give you a personal web page. Use it. Unless you deliberately exclude it from indexing, archive.org will probably pick it up within about a year. They've picked up my utterly non-notable personal web page twenty times since 1999.</li>
<li>Or post something about it any Usenet newsgroup, via Google Groups--I suggest alt.usage.english--and let Google archive your post.</li>
<li>Submit it to jnanabase, which <b>is</b> a general knowledge base</li>
<li>Or, for that matter, CharlieO, you can put it on your Wikipedia user page, which you have not yet created. Wikipedia user pages are indexed by Google, by the way.</li>

<dd>Everybody and their brother wants to submit Wikipedia articles about their band, perpetual motion machine, neologism, or philosophical theory, and the argument is always "This may not be notable now, but it will be real soon." Fine. Then we don't <b>need</b> an article about it <b>now.</b> <b>When it becomes notable,</b> submit the article, together with verifiable references to the slang directionary that includes it or the New York Times article that mentions it and we'll be pleased to accept it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:15, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would like to make a factual dispute in the claims by CharlieO.
