<li><b>Delete</b> I have to say that I am very confused about the show. A Google search for the title reveals some vague references to a show on Fox that premiered in October or November, but no concrete information exists. I really don't know what to make of it, however as no reputable source can even support the existence of the show I have to vote for deletion. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 00:32, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a syndicated show that appears to air on weekend late nights, not strictly a Fox-affiliated show. According to <a href="http://www.vippassport.tv/HOME/flashlisting.php" class="external text" title="http://www.vippassport.tv/HOME/flashlisting.php" rel="nofollow">the show's local listings</a>, it doesn't air in New York City, so I would never have had the chance to see the show. But I picked an affiliate at random: <a href="../../../w/j/b/WJBK_7df7.html" title="WJBK">WJBK</a> in Detroit, and <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/myfox/pages/InsideFox/TVSchedule?pageId=5.9" class="external text" title="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/myfox/pages/InsideFox/TVSchedule?pageId=5.9" rel="nofollow">it is listed in their local listings</a> for Monday (or Sunday broadcast day) at 2:00 AM, as the VIP show says. Nevertheless, the show is not notable per TruthGal and Nate. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 01:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles.
<dl>
<dd><small>The difference between 'major' and 'minor' characters is intentionally vague; the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character. Some books could plausibly have several dozen major characters.</small></dd>

<dd>This article clearly states that "<b>Slevin Kelevra</b> is the <b>main protagonist</b> in the movie, Lucky Number <b>Slevin</b>. How could the protagonist be a minor role? The nominator has missed the fact that this is the main character, who is not only mentioned specifically at the <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Number_Slevin_b759.html" title="Lucky Number Slevin">Lucky Number Slevin</a> page, but his name is also in the title. Perhaps the author of the article is being unclear; however, poor writing style is not grounds for deletion.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There is no discussion as to how many films in which a character should appear inorder to be notable. The question is whether the character is Major or Minor, and in either case deletion is not an option. At least the subject should receive a merge and redirect.</dd>

<dd>The point of saying "delete" is that the <a href="../../../s/l/e/Slevin_Kelevra_5945.html" title="Slevin Kelevra">Slevin Kelevra</a> article provides no additional insight or information not provided in the <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Number_Slevin_b759.html" title="Lucky Number Slevin">Lucky Number Slevin</a> article. In fact, the article in question here does nothing more than name the character and then go on to provide a plot synopsis of <i>the movie</i>, rather than providing information that extends beyond the scope of the movie. Since the movie's article provides a much more detailed plot synopsis, this article can safely be deleted, perhaps with a redirect, as the original AfD nomination states. I stand by my earlier vote of <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 16:12, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - <s>After rereading both articles, <b>I refute Dachannien's comment</b> about the redundancy of the two articles. However, in both cases the articles break the guidelines regarding articles containing extensive restatements of the plots. I think that a well thoughtout merge is in order. As my suggestion was to keep or merge, I would more strongly advocate a <b>merge</b> predicated on a complete rewrite of the Lucky Number <b>Slevin</b> article. Short of someone taking on that task, I would advocate a <b>keep</b> in the mean time.</s> --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 16:24, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Update</b> I have merged the valuable aspects of this article describing the protagonist into the article <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Number_Slevin_b759.html" title="Lucky Number Slevin">Lucky Number Slevin</a>, so that Dachannien's assertion of redundancy is now valid, and suggest that someone make sure that any valuable plot information be transferred as well.

<li>I would call this an artist's manifesto. It is interesting. In fact, it is very interesting. But I don't think it deserves a page of it's own. I think it should either be moved to the artist's page, or, if it is available somewhere else on the Internet, it should be clearly linked to from the artist's page. Ideally, an editor would boil down the ideas and present them to a reader in the article about the artist, on the artist's page. But I am not up to that task. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 22:21, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not artist's manifesto. This is an article about Transpressionism. Given that Stuckism (that was established in 1999, i.e. five years after the introduction of Transpressionism)has an entry ofit's own Idon't see the reason for hostility towards Transpressionism. Incidently, beside <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuckism.html" title="Stuckism">Stuckism</a> there are other more recent movements like Transavantguardia, Neue Wilde and the School of London that have been obviously influenced by Transpressionism.<a href="../../../1/4/0/User%7E140.80.199.91.html" title="User:140.80.199.91">140.80.199.91</a> 18:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no hostility towards Transpressionism (if anything, this page shows interest in it), simply an observation that so far it has not been shown to meet Wikipedia's requirements for inclusion. It does not appear to have any widespread notability, as evidenced by mentions in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">acceptable sources</a>. Movements with articles such as Stuckism can be verified through <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Stuckism&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Stuckism&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">40,000 google hits</a> and mainstream media mentions.

<li>OK. It is not an artist's manifesto. I know I read some interesting things in it that seemed more than slightly relevant to what I see as relevant concerns in the visual arts. I saw value in it. I didn't thoroughly study it. I would probably not agree with all of it, if I read and studied it in it's entirety. I just wanted to say it addressed concerns in visual art in the times in which we live. I don't know what an artist's manifesto is. It just seemed like it might be one to me. I like it. I think it should be linked to, from the artist's page, if it is not notable enough to warrant it's own page. And it certainly deserves restating in layman's terms. That is one of the tasks of an editor. An editor serves as a bridge between a likely reader and a piece of source material that may not be readily comprehensible to a likely reader. I don't think the primary issue is whether or not it deserves inclusion on this page or on the artist's page. The most useful thing would be a digesting and restating of the article about Transpressionism. I know that I would be interested in reading such an article. This is problem that doesn't only afflict this article. Most visual art movements and styles are afflicted by unclarity. That should be addressed by an editor. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 19:59, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My particular interest is contemporary UK art. You don't need to search out the articles I've started (mainly on Stuckism, Turner Prize nominees, YBAs and FBA artists).

<p>A bridge of no notability. Created by a single-purpose account, given the way it reads likely an associate of Mr Gelegotis. Almost no ghits for Mr Gelegotis <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Paul+J.+Gelegotis%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Paul+J.+Gelegotis%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and even fewer for "his" bridge. The google links indicate this was a suggested name for the bridge but not that the name was finally chosen. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 03:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Being the site of a Civil War battle and a slave revolt makes the bridge notable, and even though this is not the same physical structure, a mention of the new bridge should be included in that article. Since the article states "Stono Bridge" is still the more common name, and that was apparently the name in use during those historical events, it should probably be at that name anyway. The official name of the new structure makes a good redirect. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 02:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Changed my vote to <b>Neutral/Move</b> The new historical context is interesting, and if the article is kept, I would strongly support a move to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stono_Bridge_9ffb.html" title="Stono Bridge">Stono Bridge</a>. Not enough historical information yet and too many unanswered questions for a full keep&#160;!vote from me though. (was the rebellion in the general Stono area, or really centred on Stono Bridge? Was the Civil war clash more than a skirmish/small part of a wider battle?). The article also needs to refocus on the history, not the traffic details. Incidentally, this book should be helpful to the article:<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1570036055&amp;id=nl3Ec6zIfF8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA63&amp;lpg=RA1-PA63&amp;ots=Xo_Vjwcby_&amp;dq=stono+bridge&amp;sig=yzQEj7BxyIHzqtr0rEuQlrhnIVk" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1570036055&amp;id=nl3Ec6zIfF8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA63&amp;lpg=RA1-PA63&amp;ots=Xo_Vjwcby_&amp;dq=stono+bridge&amp;sig=yzQEj7BxyIHzqtr0rEuQlrhnIVk" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:34, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are right, so far there has not been 1 valid reason to keep the article. Nothing has been provided to show why this school is notable, and unless something is provided before this vote is closes then this article should be deleted (or merged like Sjakkalle suggested). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 18:50, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Umm. No. <b>Every</b> keep vote hasn't been for the reasons that you've listed. I stated that because it isn't notable to <i>me</i> doesn't mean that it's not notable. <b>And</b> I questioned if we're running out of electrons. Why the rush to remove information that is undoubtedly notable to some? The article isn't harming anybody or anything so let it be. Rather than looking for articles to delete spend ten minutes and add more information to it (as I did). And then take a deep breath and feel good about the value you've added to Wiki.

<li><b>Note</b> According to a quick lexis search and his bio website he's been syndicated by U-Wire, Nextex (I'm not sure what that is) and Advance Publications.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> as he seems almost notable, but in DRV it was noted that his column is "self-syndicated, meaning he posts it many place" -- this is not notability.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Artcle says his columns have appeared in the LA Times and Washington Post. I just did a search of John C. A. Bambenek at both sites. Nothing current written by John C. A. Bambenek at the LA Times, and nothing in their archives written by him. Nothing current written by ohn C. A. Bambenek at the Washington Post, and nothing in their archives written by him. He's a college newspaper columnist which is not notable enough for a Wiki entry.TruthGal 15:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Confirmed</b>. The sentence "His commentary has appeared in the Washington Post and the L.A. Times." is resume puffery -- he has been quoted, as a "SANS researcher", in both publications.

<li><b>Comment</b> Searching the SANS site, I was unable to find any of these publications for sale, except for the ones he is listed (in this article) as only a contributor to. I suspect the others are at best "white papers". If you do a <a href="http://search.sans.org/search?portal=f4c63c2716406a330b74d15b0ac9e540&amp;ie=&amp;site=SANS&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;restrict=SANS&amp;client=SANS&amp;lr=&amp;proxystylesheet=SANS&amp;oe=&amp;q=bambenek&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=search" class="external text" title="http://search.sans.org/search?portal=f4c63c2716406a330b74d15b0ac9e540&amp;ie=&amp;site=SANS&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;restrict=SANS&amp;client=SANS&amp;lr=&amp;proxystylesheet=SANS&amp;oe=&amp;q=bambenek&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=search" rel="nofollow">search on "Bambenek" on the SANS site</a>, you get one hit, where he is thanked for helping to prepare a tutorial.

<li><b>Further Comment</b> - Of the long list of references above, a number of them no longer work, and the rest consist mostly of him being quoted as a representative of SANS. He does seem to have some very minor notability for discovering a minor security flaw in Mozilla in December 2005. But as far as I can tell, none of the articles is actually about Bambenek or centers on his work. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:25, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nobody's saying the books aren't real (although some of them appear to be more white papers than books), but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has a slightly higher standard. Most of those books are published by SANS, his employer. Several of the quotes have him acting as a spokesman for SANS, or his blog posts are quoted on various bugs.

<li>Okay, I <b>am</b> saying that those publications are <b>not books</b>. Two of them are brief white papers, one is self-published (his website), and the ones with the SANS name match the name of SANS-sponsored classes given at conferences, so it's possible he is the "author" of the courseware, but he isn't credited anywhere that passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so I have commented them out. I'm not going to check all the "contributor" claims, but he is not a published book author as the article was clearly written to suggest. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:29, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete:</b> Seems like a hoax to me. The G4 article doesn't mention it. The Entertainment company site has an empty framework. The show site loads for a long time and then just displays a logo. The kid's blog is juvenile. In any case, not notable, since "apauled g4" gets only 64 Google hits, many referring to the G4 computer.

<p>Message for Hu &amp; others: Apauled is not a hoax; although it a hoax show airing on G4. To respond to Hu’s comments, the G4 article doesn't mention Apauled because the G4 article doesn’t list shows that are airing as interstitials throughout the schedule. The Entertainment company site does not have an empty framework, please see for yourself. The show site doesn’t load for a long time and then just displays a logo; please see for yourself.

<dd>Of course this needs to be kept, and expanded upon, according to the spirit of Wikipedia's open source method.

<dd>As you are the the author, I would suggest you <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">wikify</a></i> this article, <i><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">add references</a></i> and <i>link</i> it to articles where the subject is pertinent, such as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Anglo-Saxon_England_6756.html" title="History of Anglo-Saxon England">History of Anglo-Saxon England</a>. If it fits in to the overall scheme and is useful, then I could change my position, and others might too. As it stands it's just an orphan essay. England has lots and lots of articles, I'm probably more aggrieved about various English hoax (my, English schoolkids just <i>love</i> a good practical joke), nn football club and petrol station articles that have to be constantly deleted than this one, which on a second glance at least could serve a useful purpose rather than being yet more Anglocruft. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 11:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although this period of warfare probably merits a military history article, there wasn't much that was unique to the Anglo-Saxons. It's essayish, and the bits derived from contemporary poetry/historical epics are original research. Some of the rest could be properly sourced, but again, the scope is probably wrong. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:19, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> given that anglo-saxon... is a historical contrivance to describe a somewhat diverse group of people with different habits and practices... this article is either OR or non-encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> noting that some of the above appear to be statements of odd POV. This topic is particularly important for the period up to and including Hastings, and the difference in approaches at that crucial battle was very important. England is hardly the front-runner in terms of irrelevant cruft, and this topic is far from irrelevant. A primary source is not original research, there probably should be more requirement for them.<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFasterPussycatWooHoo_b42d.html" title="User:FasterPussycatWooHoo">FasterPussycatWooHoo</a> 14:26, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but expand, and add some citations and references. This is a rather relevant important topic in English military history. I would suggest AFDing articles such as non notable English diners, pubs, and amateur football clubs too, if there's a constant complaint abt too much England related articles. =) -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdvanced_440b.html" title="User:Advanced">Advanced</a> 18:01, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is unsourced. It could well deserve an article, when that section elsewhere becomes too large. However, on the other hand, I can find no information on the matter elsewhere in Wikipedia.

<dd>Well, the one problem with that is that the pov fork was created to promulgate the view that Mitanni was Armenia; a claim that the editors responsible have been incapable of substantiating with even one reliable source for citation.

<dd>Which would be fine and good except the details are patently false. The editors who created this page tried to insert these details into a number of established articles and had their changes removed by editors who demanded citations by reliable sources. A month or so later, they have yet to produce one reliable source. Because they couldn't insert their stuff in the real pages because they can't cite it with reliable sources, they make up pov-forks among other things. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 16:21, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your point? These historians are real and they have fascinating books if you reject this theory thats your opinion but basing on facts and evidence they recovered alot of this is true. You can go buy the book and read it. Your edits and Dacy's are similar also, and Ararat and me are not the only people in the world who see this as history the mitanni kingdom of armenia these are all evidence and documents recovered in the Armenian highland. You obviously reject this for some reason and mentioning these are important its part of mitanni history i assume these historians just made it up. They even gave lectures in Boston a while ago. Historians, Scholars, Books those are all reliable and i never knew giving reliable sources has a deadline.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't feel strongly about this entry either way, but I just wanted to point out that the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences gives out about 80 Oscars every year (and this year will be the 79th Academy Awards ceremony). The Oscar-winners club is fairly exclusive, but I can conceive of Oscar-winners who would not be considered notable per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> For the above cited reasons. And I have to disagree with TruthGal, even if a lot of Oscars get handed out each year, winning one of them indicates that the winner is very important in their field and are notable enough for an article. I, personally, feel that winning an academy award is enough to meet notability requirements. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:43, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The nominator isn't exactly known for his civil behaviour and is a known supporter of neo-nazi ideology. He has been pushing these thoughts on several articles so I don't think he is to be considered objective. That said, the article he is nominating is not of very high quality. However, <s>he was instrumental in these strikes and</s> given the history of his country I cannot entirely deny that he may meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I corrected myself above. I am unable to find a source for that statement or in what way he was a student leader. This requires further research to establish if he is notable or not. Also it needs to be established if the students were instrumental in the strike and what part he might have played. It seems to have generated quite an amount of local press. However, the criteria is verifiability so unless we van verify his notability I say we delete the article. If there aren't better sources anyway the article is unlikely to ever grow beyond stub status. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 20:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This isn't about me. It's about the deletion of an unecessary article. Kousouris wasn't "instrumental in strikes" he is known only because he was attacked. He doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. About you who say that I 'm "not to be considered objective" because I 'm a "neo-Nazi", what can I say...

<li><b>Comment</b>: I lean towards <i>week keep</i>, but I want to inform the reviewers about the essence of the event. Kousouris was brutally beaten by a group of extreme right-wing members of Hrisi Avgi. One of them was <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonios_Androutsopoulos_90e8.html" title="Antonios Androutsopoulos">Antonios Androutsopoulos</a> who was sentenced in 21 years in prison, and who has an article in Wikipedia (article created by Damac and edited by Mitsos). This event took significant publicity in Greece and was notable. Now, my opinion is that if Kousouris does not deserve an article of himself, Androutsopoulos deserves neither! Either we will delete both articles and create a single article concentrated on the events and not the person (e.g. Kousouris' beating); either we'll keep both articles.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yannismarou is right.

<dd>As I stated in the talk page: a google search for "body mint" brings up 30K hits.

<dd>Google hits do NOT equal notability - from what I understand from the specific guidelines <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html#Criteria_for_products_and_services" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">here</a>, the number of mere mentions or trivial references do not count, which is all counting the number of Google hits will tell you. A source also needs to be unbiased - anything from the company or another source trying to sell the product directly or indirectly does not count either. There's also another matter, even more important to consider I think: what makes 'Body mint' notable enough <i>from <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorophyllin.html" title="Chlorophyllin">chlorophyllin</a></i> to warrant a <i>separate</i> article of its own? As far as I can tell, there isn't anything other than the trademark to distinguish 'body mint' from other commerical chlorophyllin preparations or chlorophyllin itself. In cases like these, wikipedia policy seems to be to redirect brand names to the article on the generic parent compound. The only exception seems to be in the case of a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genericized_trademark.html" title="Genericized trademark">genericized_trademark</a>, and that doesn't apply here - and if anything, it would apply more to <a href="http://nullo.com" class="external text" title="http://nullo.com" rel="nofollow">Nullo</a>, with a whopping 1.8 -million- hits on Google. And yes, I realize that not all of those hits are about the product - but a fairer search adding 'odor' to both brand names still results in 31K hits for Nullo vs 1.4K for Body mint. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacula_c10e.html" title="User:Pacula">Pacula</a> 22:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I discussed on the talk page, the chlorophyllin article is about an organic chemical. The "Body Mint" article is more about body health. The body mint article gives natural alternatives to "body mint". &#160; You are setting a higher standard than policy. The policy pages does not say unbiased and does not say anything about indirectly trying to sell the product.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Easily passes WP:BIO. The Indianapolis 500 was definitely the paramount event in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Automobile_Association_4c7a.html" title="American Automobile Association">American Automobile Association</a> (AAA), the highest level fully professional racing league in 1933. What racing event could possible be considered more professional than the Indy 500 in 1933? The best drivers and barnstormers from around the country came to Indy for the event. All the contributing that I've done with old drivers make that point obvious. The article is well sourced and notability is asserted by multiple non-trivial sources. The AAA hasn't promoted the event for many decades, and the IRL/ChampCar series should not be considered first party sources IMO. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 22:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not believe an individuals level of success or failure does not in itself make them notable (or not). I feel that the obscure may still relevant because of its context. Do you discount the worst selling singles of otherwise significant recording artists simply because they did not fare so well. Certainly not because they would be expected to be there in an encyclopedia. The article in this case should be a small one certainly but it should be there.<a href="../../../j/s/y/User%7EJsydave_0f0d.html" title="User:Jsydave">Jsydave</a> 23:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the single might be notable because, for example, it represented a development in the artist's performance, but if it was virtually unknown and insignificant, then no, it would not in principle merit an article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David Mestel</a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid.Mestel_63c9.html" title="User talk:David.Mestel">Talk</a>)</sup> 12:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The whole point of notability is a guide that the subject can be written about from a NPOV from verifiable sources - that is clearly the case with this article. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexj2002_245b.html" title="User:Alexj2002">Alexj2002</a> 14:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not really relevant here: I don't think anyone has a personal bias about this article. We are simply arguing for its inclusion based partly on our interpretation of the criteria and – certainly from my point of view – partly on a consideration for a "completist" approach to content. Yes, the article (and many others like it) could be improved further – take note of Readro's initial efforts – but why on earth should a minor article be deleted?

<li><b>Delete</b>. The term itself is common enough in standard English, and is applied to everything from paperwork to food to American Football players, so ordinarily, I would say transwiki, but the current article is about an unbelievably trivial and non-notable use of the term and is completely unsalvageable IMO. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 00:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Erm</b> I guess conditional keep per Arnzy, and possibly move to some other term like "dogpile". This article is not a dicdef, but is weak in terms of verifiability. I think this afd is a bit premature, as there is some hope of turning it into a reasonably sourced article, and there aren't substantial promotional elements calling for an immediate smackdown, so its problems should have been discussed on its talk page before AfD.

<li>Oh, I'm not questioning whether the magazines are legit - I'm just saying that 4 out of 5 of them aren't noatble enough to have Wikipedia pages. And therefore, if a publication that's not notable does an article about a person, one can't then use the article in the non-notable publication to make the case for the person's notability. Or if you prefer - If someone writes about a tree falling in Calabasas Magazine...&#160;;) TruthGal 23:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The mention of the Sugar Blush Beauties in Playboy consisted of less than two sentences in the text accompanying a six-page pictorial of Rachel Sterling. That pictorial could help make a case toward Sterling's own notability but the discussion is so short it doesn't do much to assert notabiility for the group. For the record, the following is the entire text of the Playboy reference to the Sugar Blush Beauties:</li>

What was there before made no claim to special notability, but in fact the program would be regarded by some as being not only the most natable program out there (in the field of psychology), but a sign of a revolution in psychology itself, of a new emphasis.

<dd>"Positive psychology", the study of optimal human functioning, is an attempt to respond to the systematic bias inherent in psychology's historical emphasis on mental illness rather than on mental wellness. Some humanistic psychologists developed theories along these lines, but without solid empirical support. The pioneering research of a new generation of psychologists has led to a renewed interest in this approach, providing a firm scientific foundation for the study of human happiness and optimal function, thus adding a positive side to the predominantly negative discipline of psychology. In this sense the program is unique, representing a very important milestone in opening this important area.</dd>

<p>The user who created this page decided that another page, already a featured list, was too long. They then cut down the articles greatly, and put them in three seperate articles. He also decided that they should be featured, as the original one was. Couldn't think of any speedy deletion criteria that fit, but I think that it should be speedied anyway. This is the first of them, I am also nominating-</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I hope the three proposed articles can be deleted with as much speed and efficiency as possible. None of the three articles contribute anything to Wikipedia- they were blatantly ripped from the original page, which had no length issues whatsoever and was one of the premiere articles associated with the Avatar Wikiproject. There's no reason for them to remain active. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 16:29, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that the intent is to basically split the single list of Avatar episodes into one per season, because it does seem rather long already, and is likely to double in size again. I don't know that just creating the articles is a good idea, but it is something worthy of discussion and consideration. So I can't recommend speedy deletion or any hasty action. I'd like to hear from some more people actually. I actually find the objections here to be a bit troubling. I do think asking for opinions first would have been the way to go, but I don't see any gross wrong-doing in the actions taken. It is not an insult for content to be split from one page, but rather the point of the GFDL. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The problem I have with this action is that it was undertaken by a single user (one who does not possess an account, to make matters worse). This comes after a number of users including myself collaborated and put hours of work into getting the original list to reach Featured status. The user who created these three lists did so on a day where many users are not likely to leave comments immediately (due to rather obvious circumstances regarding the date), thus those users who I am certain would support my reasoning will not likely voice themselves for some time. I myself will be leaving shortly after posting this comment. The user who created the articles has not taken any action to improve the articles after their creation- thus, they contain no information that could not be found on the original article, thus they contribute nothing whatsoever. The alternative to deleting the three articles is to revert the original page to the status the user set it to after creating the newer trio: as a method of navigating the new pages. This is hardly a status befitting a Featured List, and I am certain a number of users would not allow this to come about (including myself). This is the reason I initially called for the deletion of all three articles, and the reason I continue to support this action. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 17:52, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your first objection is untrue, the person does have an account. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZach111493_1106.html" title="User:Zach111493">User:Zach111493</a> is a user, with an account, even if a recently established one. This may mean many things, but I remind you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a>, and that you recognize that as a new user, they may not know the best protocols to follow. That you and other users have worked hard on these pages is also not a good objection, since none of your content has been removed or deleted. That this was done on a holiday doesn't matter much, is there any hurry to act on this decision? Nope, taking a few days, weeks, even months on this wouldn't hurt. There's no false information on the pages that I could see, or anything remotely libelous. It's not a problem in need of hasty action. Now as to the question of whether or not lists like the original episode guide should be split, I don't know, but I can imagine many series where it might well be helpful to break things into articles for each of the seasons. OTOH, I can understand the desire to have it in one comprehensive page. However, there is no need to be possessive about this page. That it is a featured list doesn't mean we can't decide that it might well be improved by splitting it. It does mean that anyone who wished to do so would be well-advised to seek consensus before doing so, but that they didn't so no reason to get upset. A little patience on your part, and following <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">"Don't bite the Newbies"</a> might help a good bit. As it stands, you should avoid calling things BS and saying they contribute nothing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:58, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are actually wrong in saying that no content was moved. Content <i>was</i> moved, and a lot of it- almost all of the information on the original list was cut out and used as content for the three new pages, I simply reverted it all back. That's virtually vandalism. My reverting the information back does thus make the three new pages obsolete- they are not valuable to Wikipedia because they contribute no new information.</dd>
<dd>The fact that he <i>didn't</i> have an account really doesn't matter- he edited a very large portion of the original article without consensus from other users, which was met with disapproval. Thus, I called for a consensus to revert this change. I have thus far not attacked the user- I have said nothing directly to him at all, and only passively addressed him as "some user with no account." I am instead attacking his actions, and I feel there is a great difference between taking action against the two targets. Finally, the fact that it is a major holiday does matter, because the change was enacted upon this date when very few users were online to speak against the action- I believe I was the only online member of the Wikiproject when it transpired. Obviously, these things do not matter at the present moment, but I believe you should hold my rather aggressive approach to resolving this incident against me. I understand that Zach made the edit with good intentions, however we all know what the path of good intentions may lead to. I am willing with all my heart to forgive him- so long as he learns his lesson. Now, Manticore, please stop arguing for the page's survival using an ad hominum argument- it should not matter at all how I act in arguing so long as my points are valid. I view this action as a mistake that should be corrected quickly and efficiently, so that we can all move on. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 03:28, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't seen any removed content. Moved? Sure, but that's the closest you'll get to removed, and that's not a real problem. It's still there in the history. More importantly, it's not vandalism, virtual or otherwise. If you want vandalism, wait till you see somebody replace an article with some random pejoratives. That's vandalism. This isn't even close, and you shouldn't act like it was. At most, it's a mistake, and to be honest, you could have dealt with it much more effectively than you did. A kind, considerate word would probably have worked just as well, and you could have made the pages into redirects without even bothering with a call for deletion. There is no hurry here, so what if it's a holiday. It's a television show, I like it myself, but I'm not going to claim there's any pressing hurry. I think you need to take a step back and realize that there was no harm done. The page you have contributed to is still there, it was easily fixed, and at most Wikipedia's servers are using up a few more kilobytes of space than they would. That's not a big deal. Yet to me, you've gotten all riled up, as if this was something that needed to be taken care of now. It's not. The fact is, there is no need for an aggressive approach. No major revert wars occurred, no trolling, no vandalism, in other words, no big deal. And yes, how you act is very important.

<dd>Actually, it's you that got riled up, Y was simply doing the same job we all do DAILY. DAILY we get large amounts of things done to pages without concensus. DAILY we revert repeated vandalism. DAILY we explain to users why their edits were changed and have to hear the shouting from them. But today, when Y was simply doing the same job he's done day in and day out (normally those deletions happen right away as with the recent page created for Avatar Characters), you decided to step in and start dismissing our actions, the very same actions that got this article into FA status to begin with. It's true that redirection could have worked, but redirection does not always get the editor to stop (and if you don't believe that, i've got a few history pages to show you, (how many times have we deleted <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kataang.html" title="Kataang">Kataang</a> or Zutara?)). 06:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't feel I'm riled up, nor do I feel that would even appear to be so from my words. If I have given that appearance, let me assure you that is not the case. I'm troubled, sure, but not upset. Your concerns about vandalism are certainly valid, but you needn't worry about expressing them, I've dealt with my share of it too, so I'm quite aware of it. It's not a problem limited to the Avatar pages, but one unfortunately endemic to Wikipedia. There are many reasons why it happens, but that it does happen so pervasively is a reason to keep a cool head. However, unlike actual vandalism, or articles like Kataang or Zutara, this was a potentially reasonable decision. At the least, it didn't violate any explicit principles of Wikipedia, aside from seeking Consensus first. But since <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldness</a> is encouraged, it's not a great problem. Nothing was vandalized, no bad content was introduced. Since it was objected to, it would have been better to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, inform the editor of the objections to that bold action(which was not done until after this began, aside from some inappropriate talk page comments), revert the moved content(which was done anyway, so not a problem), and so the only problem would be the existence of these pages. Which is not actually a great problem. It's a few extra kilobytes of disk space, and if quick action was really wanted, a couple of redirects would have put the pages out of action immediately. Or you could have spoken to the creating editor, and asked them to request the pages be deleted. A gently worded request might have accomplished that very easily. Instead, we get a person calling the action BS on the talk pages and this nomination which has problems with folks being a bit overzealous. I'm sorry if I am saying it in a way that offends you, but I do find that to be a matter of concern, and so I have politely tried to express it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:54, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, in this case I'd say it was a result of a new user copying and pasting the information without realizing that certain parts weren't appropriate for a split.

<li><b>Delete and/or redirect</b>-Entirely unnecessary. Not to mention, the episode list has a currently hidden section designed for when new episodes are announced but yet to air. This also leaves broken links galore all around, for no significant gain. Furthermore, this was a featured list before, so any arguments that it wasn't functional seem rather groundless. What's more, there are featured episode lists far, far longer than this one. Its pointless, done with no consensus, and the articles should either be deleted or redirected to the existing article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> (<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>) 18:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>This is more fancruft similar to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_pre-made_characters_in_The_Sims_47f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of pre-made characters in The Sims">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_pre-made_characters_in_The_Sims</a>. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate list of information, Wikipedia is not a game walkthrough guide. Nothing in the article asserts the notability of the characters listed (note generic "characters" such as "Babies" and "Butler" in the list). This information is probably suitable for a gaming wiki.</p>
<p>Additional comments: 1) This has nothing to do with the notability of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sims_0cf9.html" title="The Sims">The Sims</a>, only the notability of this page. 2) I am not arguing against the idea of creating lists of <b>notable</b> characters in a game (there are plenty of examples of that), but there's no reason to have an infodump of non-notable characters like this. When games, TV shows, films and books have lists or pages made for specific characters, there is a good reason for it (such as the character becoming important elsewhere, influential, or a cultural icon) and there's no reason to believe that's the case here. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:47, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>But according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, attention in the WRT54G community <b>does</b> correspond to notability, unless I'm misunderstanding this sentence: "The number of users has been considered for some time a criterion for notability".

<li><b>Delete</b>, or, possibly, <b>redirect</b>. I was the original CSD nominator, and I still stand by that decision. The fact that this is is an open-source project and not a conventional company does not in any way mitigate the need for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">independant verification</a>, none of which this article has ever demonstrated.

<li>I agree that whatever happens to this article should also happen to all the other WRT54G firmware articles - if one such article is not suited to Wikipedia, then none of the others are either.

<p>Notability <b>(Note: this post is copied to this forum due to relevence)</b> Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy.</p>
<p>January 19, 2003 Courier-Journal Article ID: lou2003012007205388: Director hopes film lures bit of Hollywood to Louisville</p>
<p>Included in that article are references to my work on several major films, and supports my status as a professional and NOTABLE filmmaker. The article written by Nancy Rodriguez was supported by interviews and research by the journalist.</p>
<p>Contrary to stevietheman and Dhartung's claims, I have read the article and the definition of "Notability" as provided by Wikipedia. The inclusion of this article is supported the article mentioned above as my reputation as a filmmaker within the Louisville businss community was sufficient to provide me support during my productions, including from major business leaders based entirely on my name recognition. By the very definition of "Notability" whether on a local, national or international level, my contributions to the film communities in Louisville, Florida, London, Los Angeles, NYC have provided me respect based on name recognition within the communities. International recognition will come as a result of the upcoming release of Midnight Snow. However, I have become aware that there is an effort to promote regional and locally related articles. If nothing else, the article would qualify for a Louisville based circulation based on local notability resulting from the article in the Louisville Courier-Journal (which is an internationally recognized publication).</p>
<p>Regarding Symbiosis System of Acting, this is an "Acting Method" no different than any method taught to actors, such as the Meisner Method. Since I have already qualified by argument for inclusion of this article, Symbiosis System of Acting would qualify by default, just as the articles relatd to Meisner's techniques. However, the category is called "Acting Methods". An acting method by itself doesn't become notable. It is notable through a grassroots effort through teaching. 183 students of acting have been taught this method since 2004. That isn't necessarily a small number considering that it was only developed into a formatted program during the past decade. That doesn't make it any less important than Meisner or Strausberg which has been taught for several decades with an established following. But the definition of Acting Method would qualify Sysbiosis System's inclusion as an article about Acting Methods because it is exactly that... an Acting Method. Exclusion of more contemporary techniques such as Symbiosis System, Dawn Wells Film Acting Boot Camp or Bob Fraser's "You Must Act" programs would make the category on Wikipedia's Acting Methods incomplete since most of the Meisner, Stanislavsky and Strausberg techniques are relevent to stage acting only and are mostly outdated. There are too many qualifying techniques being used today in film acting that under the guidelines you are addressing would be disqualified and would thereby render Wikipedia as an out-dated resource.</p>
<p>Qualification of an article is not left for interpretation by Editors. However, I do feel that the Editors, who are not attorneys, should consider that by interpreting written policy, they are setting a precedence that would have to be followed very carefully on all future articles. As courts are careful about "interpretating" law, Editors and Administrators need to be careful about interpreting policy, otherwise Wikipedia could quickly become an outdated and unreliable source of information based on unnecessary exclusion of so many relevent articles.</p>
<p><b>Vanispamcruftisement</b></p>
<p>Vanispamcruftisement (IPA: /væ.nə.spæm.kɹəf.ʼtaɪz.mənt/; sometimes abbreviated as vanispamcruft or VSCA) is a portmanteau term comprising several editorial faults which some Wikipedians see as cardinal sins: conflict of interest, spam, cruft, and advertisement. The term was coined by Freakofnurture to describe an article nominated for deletion which exhibited all the above properties, being an article apparently created by the owner of a small company, about that company, name-checking the owner of the firm with a brief resume of his skills, and in respect of a company whose products appeared on the face of it to be of strictly limited appeal outside the world of geekdom.</p>
<p>Contrary to steveietheman or Dhartung's claims, neither article qualifies under the above definition. The J. Kristian O'Daugherty article was written by Ilson Lakosky about a film director. There are no services... no company... no advrtisements anywhere, including on my website at www.jaykofilms.com. What any reader is directed to through external links, are pages discussing the film industry, still photography, an extensive resource on acting under the Symbiosis System of Acting, and ten galleries of original, and obviously professional quality photographic work. Everything that any serious artist's website might contain. The reference to JayKO would be no different than referencing Askew in an article about Kevin Smith. They go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The Symbiosis System article doesn't promote any service which payment is expected. In fact, I've noticed that Ilson provided most of the structure of the system in the article, although somewhat incomplete. All information provided to the public about Symbiosis System of Acting allows the reader to apply the system without having to attend classes or purchase any services, books or materials. In otherwords... Free Use of the acting system by the reader without obligation.</p>
<p>As to my position on the threats of Legal Action, I do find Ilson's remarks somewhat inappropriate. Any legal action would have to be made by me alone and that is not my objective. I'd prefer this matter be resolved without further disruption and in a professional and respectful manner. If it cannot be resolved through these debates, then Wikipedia's adminstrators were wise enough to provide Dispute Resolution when conflicts arise. Hopefully we can all come to a fair agreement on how this should be handled without having to engage futher procedures.</p>
<p>I will stand by my opinion that the Editors need to apply reasonable standards when reviewing articles and submitting them for deletion. What may be appropriate for one category may not be for another. You should consider each topic carefully and apply standards that relate directly to the subject matter being adressed in the article.</p>
<p>God bless and Happy Holidays to everyone this season. --Jkris97 20:57, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In reviewing Wikipedia's category of Acting Techniques, there are just 5 entries (including Symbiosis System of Acting). In reality, there are many more techniques and programs than those 5. Based on the arguments of Dhartung and others, I can understand why there are so few. If these same guidelines are being applied to other entries, then Wikipedia will never become a reliable resource of information on this particular subject. Just the Dawn Wells Film Actors Boot Camp or the Bob Fraser programs would be disqualified as "spam", yet both of those programs are valuable to the CONTEMPORARY film acting community and information about these programs should be available under any datebase or informational resource that includes Acting Techniques or Methods as a category. Each are different, just as Symbiosis System is. But just like Symbiosis System, they lack the history, but that doesn't make them less important than Meisner or Stanislavsky. In fact, for film acting, Symbiosis, Wells and Fraser's programs are more important because they are part of the evolution of acting itself and a part of the history of modern film acting. The arguments being applied to this debate is based on "opinions" rather than an understanding of film or theatre. Just like you wouldn't go to a Psychiatrist if you need brain surgery, you also wouldn't go to a computer tech if you want to understand filmmaking, theatre or photography. When making decisions about film, theatre or artistic articles and categories, Wikipedia needs to use editors and adminstrators who are competent in this fields to make those decisions rather than rely upon editors who lack any true knowledge (or interest) in these areas. Would Britannica hire computer experts to draft, edit or make decisions regarding Film Editing? No, they would hire someone with direct experience and knowledge of film editing. Sorry Dhartung, but your computer experience doesn't make you an expert in this particular category. --Jkris97 21:00, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Repeat: While <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is a guideline on which we can be slightly flexible in the interests of having a useful encyclopedia, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is a policy on which we must be firm. We need verifiable information sourced to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third parties</a>. Name recognition within a field is not the same thing as notability. If this is not an acting technique that has been written about by independent, trustworthy publications, there is no possibility of writing a complete, objective article on it. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:02, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Dhartung, I regret that you have made this personal with your debates in the associated forum. It's clear that your objective is the deletion of both of these articles with prejudice. Based on your arguments, there's no question of that. You keep referring to "notibility" and yet in the other forum (J. Kristian O'Daugherty) you fail to recognize the reliability of a source such as IMDB which was purchased by Amazon.com but operated as as an independent entity. Read their guidelines, Dhartung. As I made clear in the other forum, if the articles need to be rewritten or reclassified then so be it. But you can not accurately claim that my career hasn't been notable under the definitions you have offered. I would love to see you try and get a job as a still photographer with Warner Brothers shooting stills for any $100 million PLUS film production. You wouldn't even make it past the front gate. I have five of those productions under my belt. So please consider what your motivation is in this, and look a little closer at the source of my credits on the internet (IMDB) and demonstrate to me the reason why IMDb should not be taken as a serious nor reliable source. My work is deplayed on any website that includes <b>X-Men: The Last Stand</b>, <b>Superman Returns</b>, <b>Poseidon</b>, <b>The Queen</b> and <b>Babel</b>. Could you make such a claim?--Jkris97 22:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry you think I've "made this personal", but I have not. I reiterate that articles must follow Wikipedia guidelines and policies. I'm glad you are proud of your professional accomplishments, but our requirements go beyond people who are proud of their work. We have repeatedly explained why IMDB listings are not proof of notability, and those are irrelevant to the discussion of the notability of your acting instruction theory anyway. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Deletion Request from Subject</b></li>
</ul>
<p>It pains me to come to this decision, but I personally prefer not to have Symbiosis System of Acting nor my name associated with these discussions further. I appreciate that Ilson Lakosky considered me accomplished enough to draft an article documenting my film work and my development of the Symbiosis System of Acting. However, based on these discussions, I am request that all traces of my name and my acting program be immediately removed from Wikipedia, including all discussions in these forums. I will also expand that to include future articles that may include my name or my work, even if it passes Dhartung and Stevietheman's definition of "Notable".</p>
<p>At this time, I am finding ABC, CNN and MSNBC's questions concerning the value of Wikipedia and WikiNews more accurate than I prefer based on two very unpleasant experiences I've had, both centered around the decision on one of this organization's editors. Therefore, I ask that my request be immediately implemented without delay.--Jkris97 00:37, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> Don't think 'speedy as recreation' applies, since it was speedied before, not AfDed, but sources look slim, and it seems a fairly obvious ad (written in first-person, soliciting submissions, the usual) and might be speediable on those grounds.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The tone is better now, but the other problems still remain. Has this magazine been mentioned by any independent, third-party sources? The information about the award itself (as opposed to the magazine's receipt of it) doesn't belong -- it would on the UNESCO Prize for the Promotion of the Arts article, though (addition: if we had one...). And I remain unconvinced that an honorary mention makes this magazine noteworthy -- a reference to the award in an independent source (not UNESCO or Moondance, and not a reprint of a UNESCO or Moondance press release) would go a long way toward addressing this issue. Thank you for your efforts to address the issue, though; you've made a good start. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 01:42, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>More information (again) for article has just been added.</b> Still working to improve entirety. Please check newest version. In reference to noteworthiness of publication. The start date for the mag (1996) places it as one of the earliest serial online mag/journals. 187,000 readers per issue may have some merit also for this case. UNESCO gave web awards up to the year 2003... so current pages showing the award for 1999 (which applies here) are much harder to produce but might be found. I'm looking now. It is possible for me to contact UNESCO directly to get an email letter issued on this for your validation needs.

<li><s>Changing to <b>Weak Delete</b></s> -- it's a much better article, but I still see no independent sources. All of the links provided are to Moondance's site, except for one to UNESCO (referencing an UNESCO award -- so not independent for that purpose) and one to the IMDB (referencing the magazine's creator's former career, which doesn't seem relevant to the article -- and IMDB certainly doesn't mention the magazine). I would <b>support relisting</b> to allow extra time to find sources, because I see a good-faith effort is being made and I don't think a firm consensus has yet been reached, but without at least one independent source confirming the information, I'm afraid I can't&#160;!vote keep. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 07:55, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oops, I missed a couple of the links at the bottom. There are, in fact, a few more that are not to Moondance's site. However, none of them seem to actually mention Moondance. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A recreation should only be speedily deleted if it's substantially similar. That is not the case here; the page I deleted was very short and lacked sources, the page as it is now has neither of those problems. I'm not entirely happy with its layout (e.g. the list under 'readership' should be prose instead), but that's a matter of cleanup, not deletion. However, the weird thing is that I can't find mention of Moondance in any of the sources mentioned, except for the Unesco one (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Abrookes.ac.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Abrookes.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Anethistory.info" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Anethistory.info" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Azakon.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=moondance+site%3Azakon.org" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Radiant! Just added many external links to many university (collage level) sites that have this magazine listed in their cirriculum (most are Women's Studies Depts, some English Depts and a Political Science Consortium of 80 universities). I am pleasantly surprised so many universities are using this magazine in their classes.You can link over to review this at <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondance_magazine.html" title="Moondance magazine">Moondance magazine</a>.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm impressed that it has been around for so long, but its Alexa ranking is over 2 million; I have a hard time believing it has the readership that it claims.

<li><b>Hi Guy, Thanks for taking a look at the article for <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moondance_magazine.html" title="Moondance magazine">Moondance magazine</a>. I have just added a large number of sources (embedded citations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Embedded_Citations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Embedded_Citations" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>) for the magazine and its use in the public eye(spec. w/academia). The info added is a list of universities inside the U.S. and one in Spain that currently does use the quarterly in their their class cirriculum(s). When you said the article needed more "sources" not sure you had a chance to see this. If it's alright could you detail more comment info (in the AfD discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Moondance_magazine" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Moondance_magazine" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>) about your needs that makes you want to delete this article?

<li>Changing (again) to <b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm concerned that a lot of the new links look less like curriculum usage than like pages of links to websites vaguely related to women's studies. I'm not fully convinced that these pages are substantially significant. However, I'm willing to accept them for now -- as an indication of notability, all those listings do put it at least marginally above a random website. Would still very much like to see a solid secondary source, but I'm willing to err on the side of caution for now and revisit the matter in a couple of months if necessary. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 04:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This looks like something that should be notable, because of the UNESCO honorable mention and the fact that a few university departments link to the magazine, but I'm not sure how we're supposed to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article without <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, independent</a> sources that have more than one line about this organization. The result is the article is based solely on the organization's website, and that isn't encyclopediadic. I mean, for all the Gender Studies departments listed that are linking to this page, no one has written anything about this?? Find one or two, and the case for keeping this gets stronger. - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 04:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You should take as much time as you need to put together a proper article that shows this is a notable and important person. Gather your sources and do a thorough job. If he's not notable enough now, but you believe he is on the path to stardom, maybe you want to wait a little while till he gets a little closer to there. Wikipedia will still be here, I promise. If the article is deleted and later on it becomes possible to write a stronger one, you can create a new article about the topic, but it can't be pretty much the same one that was deleted, it should contain sources and proof of notability. You might want to explain on the talk page of the new article why it the subject is more notable or the article is better sourced than it was when it was deleted.</dd>
<dd>I know this is your first article and that you are obviously a fan of this wrestler.

<p>Contested prod. I can find nothing about this 'language' in any major papers (using Lexis-Nexis) or using Google Scholar. Google does give a fair number of hits, but most appear to be Yahoo groups, blogs, or similar non <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources. At best, this appears non-notable, at worst, a hoax, or something <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>. As such, I think this should be <b>deleted</b>, unless notability can be established. Author replied to notice I put on his User Talk stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suggest that you compare Ygyde with other oligosynthetic languages, for example, Sona (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sona_language" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sona_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sona_language</a>) and aUI (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUI" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUI" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUI</a>). Ygyde is superior to both of them. The Ygyde site (<a href="http://www.medianet.pl/~andrew/ygyde/ygyde.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.medianet.pl/~andrew/ygyde/ygyde.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medianet.pl/~andrew/ygyde/ygyde.htm</a>) is the equivalent of a small book (114 letter size pages). Let Ygyde be judged on its own merits.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>I wouldn't consider either of the first two "reviews" to be independent, considering the obvious COI. Any website that is trying to sell you a book will call its advertisement a "review" but it is hardly unbiased. Now, I'm not trying to imply that only negative reviews qualify, but I don't feel that an advertisement counts as a review. If an impartial (no COI) source reviewed the book, that would qualify, but an advertisement is simply an advertisement. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 11:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>*After rereading SWAdair's comment about the reviewers selling books thus having conflicts of interest, I went back to Bookstandard and Kircus sites - they are independent sources which sell their reports either through subscription or individually.

We as part time volunteers should be reasonable and not be forcing each other to visit the library daily to support notability with printed material, when online commercial sources reprint reviews, this should be sufficient.

<li><b>Delete</b> The google test seems to be a circular series of references in this instance. There seems to be no evidence from related professional organizations or by virtue of a note-worthy trail of speaking engagements that he hold a position of notariety.

<li>Droliver seems to be critiqing the work of the subject (primary reseach) rather than evaluating notability using WP guidelines. We are judging whether the article's writer has supported notability. Whether Droliver thinks the work is meaningful is irrelevant. If Moalem's books only received poor reviews he would still be notable as an "author".

<li>I rewrote the introductory paragraph to more accurately reflect his notability as an author rather than a leader in medical research "<i>Sharon Moalem is a recognized author and researcher in the field of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_medicine.html" title="Evolutionary medicine">evolutionary medicine</a>. Though notable as an author, there is little published evidence that he is yet recognized as a leader among his peers.

(Another suggestion I thought of (that I'd like to see more) is "Okay, I'll withdraw the nom if those references are added".)

<li>I don't really get this... that a PROD is contested doesn't mean it has to go to AfD, and no other rational was given.

The mall is one of the 3 largest in a major city, it was the largest when it opened... but mostly there's plenty of reliable information and it's referenced. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:20, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> With the large merchants mentioned and size, it seems to meet the standards of many malls included in Wikipedia. There is no specific notability standard yet for malls although there is much discussion on the talk pages for notability. At notability precedents the following is mentioned: "While the notability of large malls is in dispute, strip malls and individual shops are not generally notable." So what is small? I would say that a mall with Dillard's, J.C. Penney, Macy's, and Sears, and 120 stores could not be considered small. Since the leadership of Wikipediea is undecided on largeer malls, how can we arbitraily delete this article? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 07:52, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is not an advertising space, neither is it a discussion forum. Your site violates norms of factual accuracy and any effort to publish an underground site whether it's about Jesus being alien or Pakhub, will meet with an afd tag. Indian or not Indian is not the issue here, the issue is do underground, factually incorrect websites with two articles and a forum deserve a mention in Enclopedia Britannica or Wikipedia&#160;? Can we write an enclyclopedic article about people who spell worse than porn sites? The answer is an emphatic <b>no</b>. Live with it.</dd>

<p>Fine. Delete the article. but please note this place is full of Hindu extremist who have attacked the site, and been on my back since I argued with them. They will obviously make sure nobody willing to argue will be heard. Mods like you show you couldnt care less. Good luck. I am out of here.

There is, imo, no reason for this article to be created; its hard to see how it can be expanded - and any information that is added can be incorporated into the album article. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 21:20, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Teesside Futsal Club; It is small minded people like you and the FA that are holding Futsal back.... There are professional teams, such as Tranmere Victoria, Futsal even has its own FA Cup which the winners of that go into the Uefa Futsal Cup. Its going Fully pro next season with its own Premier League. The National Team have played over 40 matches so to say its minor is incorrect, please undelete it</p>

<dd>It's worth an inclusion for what is mentioned on the internet. I don't think Wikipedia articles should be based on the number of Google hits a topic has. It is mentioned on other notable websites, which I have included as <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinsel_and_Marzipan_7eb3.html#External_links" title="Tinsel and Marzipan">external links</a>. The single charted in the Irish Top 40 too. Also I notice the person who has nominated this article for deletion is from California and therefore is presumably not Irish. There are possibly numerous articles I could find from California which have little relevance to me but I would not try to delete them as I know they may be relevant to someone elsewhere. Wikipedia is a worldwide project, is it not? Shouldn't it have articles that are relevant to a certain country even if not on a large international scale? <b>Strong Keep.</b> --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandlewicke_cb5b.html" title="User:Candlewicke">Candlewicke</a> Consortiums Limited 22:14, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with the idea that a song ranking on the charts may soon lose any notability. Likewise there are many notable songs and bands who have not ranked in the charts. It seems an unfair policy that perfectly decent songs should be disregarded simply for not appearing there. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandlewicke_cb5b.html" title="User:Candlewicke">Candlewicke</a> Consortiums Limited 12:09, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Neologism. The term hasn't gained acceptance, and according to the XORG page it was a term made up by a single company. Nothing in the article suggests that the term has expanded its use beyond that company's marketing.

According to the article, the subject's claim to fame is being a model for automobile tires and having appeared as one of the throngs of dancers on Soul Train. As for her modeling career, the article says she's been on "some covers," but fails to mention any of these covers. No individual fact contained in this entry is individually sourced. The final line of the article - "Still single, her ideal man is "charming, intelligent, charismatic...and taller than me!"" indicates that this page might better be suited on Match.com than Wikipedia.

I clicked on all 6 of the articles retrieved by Google. Here's what they are: (1) The Wikipedia entry (2) A Google Video of a soccer game (3) Another Google Video -the English text attached is "Shot in Bucharest, Romania - Nimrod Kamer, Yoni Raz Portugali and Toony are guests of Hotel Classa Vilor." (4) YouTube versions of the previously-mentioned Google Videos (5) &amp; (6) "Israeli shows in USA &amp; Canada information Website" (couldn't find the subject of the article on these pages). None of the entries returned by Google contain writing by Yoni Raz Portugali (or יוני רז פורטוגלי) despite the fact that this is supposedly what he's famous for. I'm begging you to watch the production value of any of these videos and come away believing this is a person of note in any country.TruthGal

<li>I checked these returns from Google. Here's what they are. The first one is the subject's Wikipedia page in Hebrew. The 2nd Google entry is also the Hebrew Wiki. The 3rd is an entry in another Israeli online encyclopedia. The 4th is a food magazine. The 5th is one of those YouTube videos I mentioned earlier. If the subject's writings can only be found in Hebrew, then at best he's only entitled to an entry on the Hebrew version of Wikipedia. In any event, I can't imagine that anyone would make the case that this paragraph from the article has any place in an encyclopedia: "In 2005 Portugali had absorbed the stylish fashion of the Dandy and started dressing up accordingly..."

<dd>I'm sure as the article's author you'd feel that way. However, there are only 17 Google references. And I did a search at Israel's largest online newspaper for this person and only came up with two search results<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/home/1,7340,L-3341,00.html?SearchType=TopNav&amp;criteria=&amp;sog=&amp;keyword=&amp;txtSearchString=oren+zarif&amp;txtChanID=3083&amp;select1=Site" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/home/1,7340,L-3341,00.html?SearchType=TopNav&amp;criteria=&amp;sog=&amp;keyword=&amp;txtSearchString=oren+zarif&amp;txtChanID=3083&amp;select1=Site" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> neither of them were about the subject being a psychic - in fact, both of the articles were about the subject adopting a parrot who wouldn't stop swearing (much to the annoyance of his neighbors). The articles describe Zarif <b>not</b> as a famous psychic, but as <b>"a Ramat Gan resident practicing alternative medicine."</b><a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3257798,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3257798,00.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> If this person were truly famous, the headline would begin "Zarif's Dirty Bird..." or "Famous Psychic's Naughty Parrot..." - instead, the headline leads with the bird ("Cussing parrot’s sentence: Death") and the subject is referred to as a <b>"Ramat Gam resident."</b></dd>
<dd>Furthermore, the article is still of questionable accuracy - especially with regard to Uri Geller, whom you claim is Zarif's "long-time rival." After hundreds of edits since 2003, there is <b>no mention of Zarif</b> on the Uri Geller Wiki page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> I'm now beginning to believe this entry is a joke and should be a <b>Speedy Delete</b>.TruthGal 16:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I'm definitely biased to keeping it, since I wrote the article and since I'm the "inventor" of this term. If the submission isn't neutral enough, I would happy to work with you all to make it neutral. Nevertheless, I do think that the term does accurately describe the great new Web 2.0-based projects out there today (not just my own, but other projects like Kiva.org). The mission of these projects is clearly social stewardship focused--yet we can't quite lump them with the broad term of "community service" because they are truly driven by technology. Anyway, I don't make the rules here, so my feelings won't be hurt if you all decide to axe this. Sooner or later though, this term (or some permutation) will become accepted by the mainstream.

It has now been 6 months since this article was last nominated for deletion. During that period the article has been tagged as needing verifiable sources, none have appeared. And it is my belief that none ever will. This article is simply not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. The entire premise of this supposed game leads to having no verifiability at all. As such, any user can add their interpretation of "the game," and claim it as the truth.

<dd>(This again?) No, I'm not - that's a logical fallacy. Just because a person has heard about the Game, doesn't mean they chose to play it.

<dd>Just because it's of no consequence to them doesn't mean they're not playing it.

<dd>I can't find where you explained why this is a logical fallacy. Someone does not have to give consent to be a player of a game. In the example I gave in previous discussions, I can create a new game right now called Kernow's Game. Whoever next edits this page will win Kernow's Game. Now the next person to edit this page will win Kernow's Game whether they want to or not. I'm sure that many of the gladiators of ancient Rome did not want to participate either, but if they got killed they lost.

Furthermore, the presence of a website with the self-stated goal of convincing otherwise reliable sources to cover the topic <i>for the purpose</i> of earning recognition as a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable topic</a> here is disturbing. Keeping in mind that the article <i>itself</i> suggests that knowledge of the game is scant in the article's likely audience (but high in places with heavy Wikipedia participation), I do not think it is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">a violation of good faith</a> to believe the website's goal was successful, and that this article exists because <i>De Morgan</i> did not realize it was being used by those wishing to prop up a Wikipedia article. With the danger of incestuous amplification so high in this case, we should be demanding correspondingly stringent references ... not one unserious article in a relatively minor foreign-language newspaper. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 12:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(ec) A great many articles require further verifi<i>cation</i>. That is one of the long-term challenges facing Wikipedia.

(There are also 500+ group "hits" when searching "I lost the game", and many of them seem to be similar groups, raising the number even more.) That's easily 10,000 members, and even with a high incidence of overlap (which I haven't seen, considering the other groups aren't usually found in the "related groups" section, which seems to highlight groups with large overlap), there must be at least 4,000 considering the one group of 3,975. The groups state similar rules, if not the same rules, just using different words. To me, considering I'd guess that most people on Facebook are real people with real names, and that Facebook is a major Internet site, it looks like this is an activity participated in by many people from many places in the world, from a source that can't be discounted. It also seems unlikely that someone would join such a group without at least learning about the game. Also, while it is true that many groups link to the Wikipedia article, if the article was removed it wouldn't stop people from playing the game. Most of these groups are unlikely to change or be removed and anybody with a Facebook account can check that these groups exist. I'm not sure how best to include this in the article, but based on this, The Game seems verifiable, reliable and notable to me. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 03:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

This is one of those situations were a consensus departure from the notability/RS guidelines is the right thing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject is known to be real and notable. There is no doubt of its existence and nature. To destroy the article is to harm Wikipedia as a reference work.

<dl>
<dd>The argument against the De Morgen article is <b>not</b> that its in a foreign language. The argument is that the article does not appear to be a news report subject to the factual vetting process assumed by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but is rather a whimsical column. Furthermore, this column is the only published source that had been found. Moreover, the column asserts that this game is predominantly played in the USA and the UK - the two major English-speaking countries - and yet only this one Flemish newspaper column is available as published source. And keeping such an article with such tenuous and sligh referencing <i>does</i> do more harm than good to Wikipedia as it suggests that other articles can get away with such minimal and dubious referencing too, making a mockery out of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed with Bwithh here. I don't care at all that the article is in Dutch. A quality source is a quality source whether it is in English, Dutch, or Bantu. But this is not a quality source -- it does not read <i>even a little bit</i> like a serious newspaper article, and it is the only remotely appropriate source besides. WP inclusion policies typically require multiple, independent, non-trivial, reliable coverage. This is not multiple. It is arguably less than reliable and quite possibly less than independent: the efforts that the game's advocates have been using off-WP serve only to raise the necessary bar; when an advocacy website <i>states</i> that it is attempting to arrange for media coverage <i>for the purpose</i> of concocting reliable sources, it should be absolutely guaranteed that WP will hold every single proposed reference to the highest possible standard. Wikipedia is not for this kind of bald-faced system gaming. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:43, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also agree with Bwitth that the Dutch newspaper reference is lousy in terms of reliability and with Serpent's Choice that any new sourcing should be held to the highest standard. However, good documentation or not, I don't share Kizor's view that Wikipedia is harmed (in any substantial way) by losing this article. See <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> for how there's already a huge amount of stuff that we don't currently document that we really should (maybe we'll get to some of it, but for now, we're not exactly suffering from the absence). This article under discussion is just a drop in the bucket compared to that. It would matter if it was an <i>important</i> article (and we do rate some articles for importance). If it's unimportant, we can by definition afford to lose it no matter how thoroughly documented it is. The bottom line is: notability by RS is an argument favoring inclusion, but not an automatic discussion-stopper. In this case, it's outweighed by the other issues. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 10:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, as that template itself notes, in AFDs where there is a reason to suspect outside organization might influence the discussion, it is completely appropriate to indicate which participants have little other Wikipedia presence. That is because established editors are more likely to understand concepts like verifiability, notability, and reliable sources <i>as they are used here</i> than are newcomers and outsiders, who, in this case, could conceivably include individuals rallied from savethegame. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 14:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As close to patent nonsense as I've seen outside articles speedied within minutes. The only reason I don't go for "delete and salt" is that there is at least one actual phenomenon called simply "The Game," a word game once popular in New York theatrical and social circles (whose rules I've completely forgotten). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 16:53, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I come not as a drone propelled by the senseless campaign to support the article (indeed, I was unaware of such a campaign until reading this AfD), but as an interested project participant. Article quality could certainly be improved, but it seems rather unfair to call this "patent nonsense." As additional evidence for verifiability and notability, I offer a Facebook group dedicated to the game <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204300302" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204300302" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> with 4,000 members spanning the US. The game exists, it's been around longer then the Wikipedia article, and this article presents a publicly visible view of the game, not hidden behind the login walls of social networking sites. While outside campaigning for VfDs is certainly to be frowned upon, the article should be reviewed on its own merits, not the actions of its supporters. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachlipton_a56e.html" title="User:Zachlipton">Zachlipton</a> 20:11, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The second sentence of WP:RS reads "This page is a guideline, not a policy, and is therefore mandatory only insofar as it repeats material from policy pages."

(See for example the rules listed in [Mao (game)].) If we can verify facts about the game, from this reading it seems that the existence of any reliable sources at all is not necessary. 71.225.71.44 17:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, it's just not adequately verified yet.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> has changed significantly since the last AfD. It now requires <i>multiple</i> published sources which this article does not have. Editors that want this article kept should really be discussing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and whether a topic with only one published source can still be notable. Someone should find out the reason it was changed to require multiple sources in the first place. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 06:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I have commented below, WP:N is a guideline, not policy.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Regardless of the number of available published sources, this is a real game with widespread popularity, and is obviously notable. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlereon_9ed2.html" title="User:Alereon">Alereon</a> 07:18, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, mostly for pragmatic reasons. At this point, it should be obvious that Wikipedia policy doesn't make this a slam dunk delete or a slam dunk keep. (Anyone who included "speedy" in their vote needs to put their view of WP policy in perspective, I'd say.) This AfD is nothing but the old deletionist vs. inclusionist debate rehashed for a thousandth time. If the policies and guidelines about inclusion are clearer someday and happen to swing it toward "delete", bring it up again. But right now, the choices are a sketchy delete and a sketchy keep, and sketchy deletes create many more hard feelings. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 07:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It has one reliable source right now, and needs at least one more to pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But WP:RS is a guideline, not policy, so occasional exceptions are allowed. One is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is policy. I think in this case we can allow the article to stay. It would certainly be nice to have more sources since the article can't expand beyond what is currently there, but I don't think it should be deleted until more are found, since the source provided seems reliable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 07:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It really bothers me that people try to observe guidelines only when it is convenient to do so—guidelines are not sacrosanct, but shouldn't be discarded without very good reason. One source in a foreign language which requires registration (which someone above suggested was not working at the moment) should hardly be the exception to the guideline's two reliable sources. Ideally someone who wants to keep this article can just find a published, accessable source, and make this all moot. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 17:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, only because the whole point of this game is to forget about it. therefore by deleting this article, we wikipedians are all winning. i am sure that the continued existence of this game in increasing numbers of social circles will cause this article to be brought back again and again. the repeated deletion only serves to exemplify the purpose of the game, so delete away, winners of the game! --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeones_life_3af1.html" title="User:Someones life">Someones life</a> 11:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I guess I base it on the fact that if this were a band and all the bands fans were clamouring keep, and had some foreign language reference I couldn't access I'd say the same. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:45, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and salt</b>. It requires stretching multiple policies/guidelines to justify keeping this article. At some point, we reach the elastic limit. Foreign-language sources without reliable translation are a stretch to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So is an article that depends on subscription-only sources. A single source cannot satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, so we need to stretch that guideline. Keeping an article on a topic that derives much of its notability from its presence in Wikipedia is a stretch to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. I just don't stretch that far. If we aren't going to salt, we may as well not bother deleting. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I have no doubt that the game is real and that some people have heard of it. I also have no doubt that I'm real and some people have heard of me, but I don't get an article.
