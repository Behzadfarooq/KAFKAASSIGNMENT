<li><b>Keep</b> this is more than just a stub. Also, you said "Non notable elementary school", which is the same thing you said in all the other noms. Except this is a *middle school*. Please at least *read* an article before nominating. Don't bother telling me the grades count as elementary elsewhere, since it's obvous you copy/pasted the *exact* same text every where. For some time now, I've been finding wikipedia really slow and non-responsive, meaning a save can take a minute or two, and often-times out. Often, I have leave it for several minutes or longer. Now, you've gone and nominated at least 22 schools in one day, and I would have to spend hours, if I wanted to vote against each. That's as bad as cheating. We shouldn't make decisions based on who's faster at the computer. That's why have rules like 3RR. Also, you're pushing others into doing the quick vote-without-thinking approach, which I resent greatly. I think all the noms for today by this nom, should be withdrawn as bad-faith, and the user prohibited from further for a period of time. I've seen automated vandals cause less damage than this. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:45, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't copy and paste the words "elementary school" in my nominations. And yes, to me grades 1-8 are elementary schools. The only thing I copy/pasted were the tags so that I didn't mistype the tag itself. I did read the articles. This one, though longer than the others, is still in my opinion just a collection of trivia about a non-noteworthy school. I'll admit that I missed the line in the talk page about the previous AfD vote. If there is a policy that I have missed about not relisting an article for AfD twice, then the nomination for this school should be taken down. No, I will not keep relisting it until it is gone as has been assumed by some. When all is said and done though, I still feel that this article is "schoolcruft". <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:42, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrespective of your claims, this mass-nomination (which despite your denial includes a middle school as an elementary school) is not only <b>disruptive</b> but borders on vandalism. Further, this is a <b>clear</b> attempt to thwart any attempt at concensus (although I believe true concensus is impossible on schools) by purposely mass-nominating instead of grouping the schools together in a format where an AfD discussion on schools from Miami-Dade could reasonably take place. It is fine that you "feel" that schools should be deleted, but mass-nominations is not an acceptable way of expressing that "feeling".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 21:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I find it hilarious that someone who cut-and-pasted exactly the same text as his vote in multiple nominations is such a state of high dudgeon over what he sees as cutting-and-pasting of text. Find a dictionary and look up <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chutzpah.html" title="Chutzpah">chutzpah</a> to see what I mean. Secondly, while you've got that dictionary out, look up "disruption", "vandalism", and "clear", since I do not think those words mean what you think they mean. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nominating over 20 schools in a single day is disruptive, and after reviewing the way in which you carelessly describe this <b>middle school</b> as a "Non notable elementary school" now makes it difficult to assume good faith on your behalf. This article is not a stub, it is quite informative and beneficial to its community or anyone else interested in learning about this school.
