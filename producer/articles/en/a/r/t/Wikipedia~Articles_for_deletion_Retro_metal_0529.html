<dd><b>Comment</b> I have to disagree with this, for the sole reason it has nothing to do with Wolfmother. It is someone's opinion that it does just because they are influenced by old band, which doesn't make this true. "Retro metal" is, by the definition of the term, a neologism and shouldn't be added to any article just because MTV or Rolling Stone Magazine decided to describe them as such. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 19:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have been watching this article for some time. It has not improved, and is still based on some sources trivially mentioning the term "retro metal" or "hipster metal", making the article <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

Retro <i>everything</i> seems to be "hip" these days, but we can't have articles to document all such usage, and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a vehicle to promote certain terms or bands to make them more popular. Even persons listening to the supposed bands of this genre don't use these terms. <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/retro%20metal" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/tag/retro%20metal" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/hipster%20metal" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/tag/hipster%20metal" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The bands mentioned in the article were already situated in their well-documented genres (post-rock, hard rock, heavy metal), until the recent adding of "retro metal" to these bands' respective infoboxes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Answer_%28band%29&amp;diff=97202327&amp;oldid=93786810" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Answer_%28band%29&amp;diff=97202327&amp;oldid=93786810" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dungen&amp;diff=97340942&amp;oldid=97202999" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dungen&amp;diff=97340942&amp;oldid=97202999" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roadstar&amp;diff=97339128&amp;oldid=97203336" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roadstar&amp;diff=97339128&amp;oldid=97203336" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> The newly-created Category:Retro metal and Category:Retro metal bands should go too. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 19:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Resources can be found to satisfy all parties involved, as well as additional information. Retro metal is one of the fastest growing genres in the world, and is worthy of an encyclopedic entry for that purpose alone.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article seems pointless - the scene for bands and music like this (stoner rock / doom) has existed for decades already, it hardly requires a new definition because certain elements of the media have decided to pick up on it. Thinginajar 14:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is already an article on <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom_metal.html" title="Doom metal">doom metal</a> and a ton of subgenres there of. This is redundant and a term that nobody uses. Also, Wolfmother is not metal, so this should be retro rock if anything. Most bands that are forcibly being lumped in would consider retro metal or hipster metal a derogatory term. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlliegrind_3d05.html" title="User:Olliegrind">Olliegrind</a> 02:49, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, you may not be familiar with the genre, but it isn't a part of doom, nor are there any sources to state it as that.

<dd><b>Comment</b> What about all the bands from the 90s that fit the retro metal description (like <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_%28band%29.html" title="Sleep (band)">Sleep</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_Caravan_abbd.html" title="Spirit Caravan">Spirit Caravan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Raven_e334.html" title="Count Raven">Count Raven</a>) or all the bands from the 80s (<a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Vitus_%28band%29_10f0.html" title="Saint Vitus (band)">Saint Vitus</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Obsessed_ec3c.html" title="The Obsessed">The Obsessed</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouble_%28band%29.html" title="Trouble (band)">Trouble</a>). Should all these now be retroactively placed into "Retro Metal". This scene has been around since the 80s so why should new bands coming out suddenly be at the forefront of some overhyped music revolution? Bands in the article like <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft_%28band%29.html" title="Witchcraft (band)">Witchcraft</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_a09f.html" title="The Sword">The Sword</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_%28band%29.html" title="Witch (band)">Witch</a> are doom metal. I don't see how this genre can be seen as a new genre when bands have been making this music for decades. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlliegrind_3d05.html" title="User:Olliegrind">Olliegrind</a> 18:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deleting it on the grounds that the term is relitively new would be foolish, the genre has only been around since the early 2000s, of course the term isn't going to be decades old... but as shown, it has been mentioned in numerous prominent music media forums, and the bands who are a part of it are breaking through into commerical success (thus it passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) Wolfmother were one of the most famous bands of 05/06.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article has a serious <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem: Notes do not contain information they are cited to contain, and might even be considered faked. Notes 1 and 2: Trivial mentions of the term "retro metal" on a page about <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfmother.html" title="Wolfmother">Wolfmother</a>. Note 3: Theilluminati.net, a band's (The Illuminati) own website, containing Revolver screenshot which is titled "Heavy Meta", and the article starts "Hipster rock acts Wolfmother, Witch and The Illuminati...". Thus, magazine article is not about "Hipster Metal" as claimed in the WP article and also, does not verify the sentence before it: <i>It is not entirely clear the origins of the term "hipster metal", but music journalists have been using it in popular magazines such as Revolver, Classic Rock, Guitar World and Kerrang! since around 2005.</i> Note 4: Again, about Wolfmother and used as a source for sentence <i>Bands in this movement take influences from the originators of heavy metal such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and Deep Purple.</i> Incorrect. Note 5: A commercial link (Amazon.com) to a compilation album, that could be considered promotional and spam. This seems both unverified and unverifiable. Also, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> clearly states that "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <i>about</i> the term — not books and papers <i>that use</i> the term." Trivial mentions do not help the fact that the article is original research, and the only way to avoid that would be turning it into a one-sentence stub, a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">dictionary definition</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 08:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not familiar with the genre, but if that's truly all it is then the information needs to be merged into the article relevant to the "old sound" and the current article needs to be deleted. New terms for something that hasn't changed don't deserve their own article; it's not like Holocaust Revisionisn has its own article seperate from Holocaust denial, is it? <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 06:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
