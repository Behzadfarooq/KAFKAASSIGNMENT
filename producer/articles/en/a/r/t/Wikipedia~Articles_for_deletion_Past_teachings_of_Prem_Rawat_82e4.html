<li><b>Comment</b>. The references that are on the article seem to refer to speeches by this guru which happen to be stored at the guru's official website. That seems like an ok source to me. The article needs more sources. But this does not seem like a valid reason for deletion. The next charge is that it is gurucruft -- another way of saying that Prem Rawat is not notable enough to justify these large articles. That is possible, but needs to be argued for rather than simply asserted. It is deeply ironic and revealing to see <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">User:Andries</a>, who has made a career out of uploading vast reams of tangientially relevent <b>negative</b> data on <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">gurus</a> — and who once claimed that the <i>objective</i> of Wikipedia was to store all of the information in the world's libraries — now attempting to delete and suppress information. — <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <a href="../../../g/o/e/User_talk%7EGoethean_f9d1.html" title="User talk:Goethean">ॐ</a> 19:22, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Like all articles in Wikipedia, this one began with a small amount of information that has accumulated. Much of it is claimed to be true by editors, and I am one of those. The record of these early teachings should be kept and verified when those sources are both re-found and documented. For example, for such a topical subject, written documentation might be light on; however, interviews with various people and other written, secondary sources may support what has been written. The point is that, simply because someone said/wrote it does not make it POV. It simply makes it unsourced. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrol_Vieth_11b0.html" title="User:Errol Vieth">Errol V</a> 04:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> This whole section reads as if Prem Rawat himself had dictated it, except the use of language is more logically coherent than Rawat can manage. In itself, that would not be a problem if the content were comprehensive and accurate. However, the last paragraph in particular reads as something of a whitewash of the facts regarding the 'superdevotional' era of the late seventies and early eighties. There is ample documented evidence archived at ex-premie.org which tells a very different story to this account, which appears, above all, an attempt to rewrite DLM/EV history and re-assign culpability for decisions and practises that came *always* from the top. When I say 'delete', what I really mean is scrap the thing and start again. A well-researched and objective entry on 'the past teachings of Prem Rawat' has to be an essential part of the story.
