<li><b>Keep</b> Seemed pretty easy to document all the sources if I did it right.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikki_Lee_Travolta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikki_Lee_Travolta" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Easy to find tons of references to family, career, everything. It was fun and not that hard. I wouldn't delete it at all. Apparently John Travolta only has a half-brother named Michael, which might be the cause of all this commotion. Once I stumbled on that discovery it was easy to see the glaring fact that the listing of John Travolta's siblings specifies not total number of siblings, but total number of siblings from the union of Salvatore Travolta and Helen Burke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Big difference when you look at it in that light. References in all the press to Rikki Lee Travolta are all to grandfather being Salvatore Travolta and father being born outside US (as in shamed outside of marital grounds pregnancy). No mention to Grandmother being Helen Burke. That is further hit home in the brand new category by Arniep Travolta Family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Travolta_family" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Travolta_family" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> that again stipulates only decedents of the union of Salvatore Travolta and Helen Burke Travolta. That would exclude any half siblings and descendents. I suggest Rikki Lee Travolta be kept and category "Travolta Family" should be changed to "Travolta-Burke Family"? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingJamesCav_b946.html" title="User:KingJamesCav">KingJamesCav</a> 05:33, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I started the Annie Travolta page and have been a contributor to many of the Travolta family pages including Margaret Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta, Annie Travolta, and John Travolta. Many of those changes are reverting vandalism. It is right there in the history. There is no way, shape, or form that could remotely be confused as being in an “advertising scam”. I have NEVER removed members of the Travolta family from listings. I have worked hard to keep the integrity in tact. I think upon closer inspection you’ll see there was an influx of attempts by an anon (66.121.40.132) to vandalizing different Travolta family sites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> (changing facts without providing sources or citations). When the anon seemed to be starting a revert war with different users I followed Wiki policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revert_war" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>and contacted them on their discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> to request documentation for the changes being made.</li>

<dd><i>Its been noticed that you have made several repeated changes to the family elements of the John Travolta page and related pages. The policy at Wikipedia is to try to avoid revert wars going back and forth over the same territory. As follows are what we have confirmed as members of the Travolta family: Margaret Travolta, John Travolta, Ellen Travolta, Joey Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta; Jack Bannon, Rachel Travolta, Nicole Travolta, Michael Salvatore Travolta, Helen (Burke) Travolta, Kelly Preston, Salvatore Travolta, Molly Allen Ritter, Jonathan Rau, Jet Travolta, Tom Fridley, Sam Travolta, Ella Blue Travolta, Valentino Travolta, and Annie Travolta. This is not an all inclusive list, but all those listed are confirmed. In respecting Wikipedia policy it is always necessary to approach differences of opinion in good faith. Although we have documented each of these individuals as relatives (of different levels of removal or closeness of course) within the extended Travolta family, ff you disagree with any person(s) on this list please provide the documentation and we should be able to come to a simple understanding relatively quickly (no pun intended).

<dd>THERE'S a strange postscipt to our item the other day about the Internet rumor that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have created a computer-generated actor called "Rikki Lee Travolta." A rather odd actor named Rikki Lee Travolta does in fact exist, and held a press conference in Chicago Tuesday to prove it. "It's good to be alive," he stated. "I am an actor. I am a human being." Travolta, who is of Italian and Native American extraction and claims some family connection with John Travolta, appeared in "West Side Story" on Broadway. He wrote a novel, sports a gunshot wound and claims a doctorate in religious studies. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Bottom line, no matter if he's related to John Travolta or not, how does anything he's done make him notable enough for an article? I am on record as having had strong disagreements with Arniep in the past, but he cares about Wikipedia. It sounds to me like these "sources" are all bits that came from a very good publicist. So again we get into my own problem, which is what Wikipedia considers a good source. Just because something's in print doesn't make it so. And Rikki Lee Travolta has publicity mill written all over him. I don't know the criteria for putting a person in Wikipedia - but if there is criteria, on that alone, I vote for deletion.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 22:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On the imdb profile two of the entries are uncredited parts and the other film probably did not actually exist and was created for resume purposes. Arniep 00:59, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You actually cannot put in a fake film on imdb - their criteria and the information they required is strict and verifiable - but it probably was an independent, right to DVD movie. Anyone who has worked in a film gets an imdb profile and will have verifiable credits listed. The bio, however, can be written by the person, a friend, a publicist, and can make all sorts of outrageous claims. There is still nothing that makes him noted enough for a bio on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 01:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well. In 2000 I submitted to the IMDB the full cast and credits of the film "The Prophecy 3" (with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Walken_2eec.html" title="Christopher Walken">Christopher Walken</a>). However, I added actress <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linnea_Quigley_ad62.html" title="Linnea Quigley">Linnea Quigley</a> to the cast, as playing a character I labelled "Hooker". The IMDB put her in along with everyone else. The credit is still there today, and will no doubt stay. Quigley was actually asked about how it was working with Walken in an interview! The best part? She said she didn't remember if she was in the movie, and she thought she might have been! That's how reliable your IMDB is. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 01:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said a fake film, not adding someone to a film. Try submitting a fake film and see how far you get. And try submitting a fake actor. If the actor has an imdb profile and the film is real, I suppose you can put someone in the cast who wasn't there because they could have been cut. I have independent films on DVD on my desk that I can't get on the imdb site, and I was a guest on 7 episodes of a TV show and can't get my own name on the episode lists that I myself added (I'm not currently on imdb as a "name" only as a contributor).<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChandler75_a033.html" title="User:Chandler75">Chandler75</a> 02:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, there must have been some first-time actors in a video movie like Prophecy 3. And obviously, the IMDB would have accepted them and created profiles for them, if say, I had submitted them as part of the whole cast, like I did Quigley. So it is fairly easy to create a first-time actor, and "maintain" them, if you submit a bunch of reliable looking credits for films. You can find Quigley's reaction (funny because it reflects the reality of the video horror industry) to being asked about the film in this interview, <a href="http://www.horror-asylum.com/frameset.asp?page=http%3A//72.14.207.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3A7jNCVNqo_n4J%3Awww.horror-asylum.com/interview/specials/screamqueens/linneaquigley/interview.asp+%2522Linnea+Quigley%2522+Prophecy%26hl%3Den%26gl%3Dca%26ct%3Dclnk%26cd%3D6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.horror-asylum.com/frameset.asp?page=http%3A//72.14.207.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3A7jNCVNqo_n4J%3Awww.horror-asylum.com/interview/specials/screamqueens/linneaquigley/interview.asp+%2522Linnea+Quigley%2522+Prophecy%26hl%3Den%26gl%3Dca%26ct%3Dclnk%26cd%3D6" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackO%27Lantern_5fea.html" title="User:JackO'Lantern">JackO'Lantern</a> 02:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There have been fake films added to IMDb before and also ones that were announced but never made or released. They generally get deleted if evidence accrues that it never existed or is not going to be made. <i>Black the Ripper</i> was deleted I think after a TV Guide column in which people who were supposed to have been involved with it were interviewed, and entries for the 4th and 5th <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> movies disappeared and reappeared as it went through development hell. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 15:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, then I'd like my own page. I've had three books published, had my own weekly column in an international magazine, and have appeared on stage and television -more than Rikki Lee. I also generate more hits than he does since I now write a daily column. I'll add to my website that I was considered for a Bond girl, claim to be Madonna's cousin, and we're good to go. If someone tried to write me up and submit me for an article here, I think it would be proposed for deletion - probably by Arnie!

<dd>I worded that a little wrong. What I meant by "might be fake" is that it (the Bond rumor)might have been self-promoted by him. Still though, he has over 20,000 google hits, and while it's hard to find one true reason to give him an article, it's hard to find a reason to get rid of it completely. He seems to be a guy that puts up a facade about himself, definitely.

<li><b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to start by following the guidelines and announcing for the whole wide world that I have contributed to editing the Rikki Lee Travolta wikipedia page. This is the point that I get attacked for having contributed to the Rikki Lee Travolta wikipedia page and it should somehow disqualify me from voting on whether it should be deleted or not. See, there’s a flaw there. I contributed. I have an active interest. I have an established knowledge that proceeds this debate. Therefore it makes full sense that I should cast a vote.</p>
<p>In fact, the wikipedia guidelines specifically state that when someone submits a page for deletion the principle contributers should be notified for the very reason that their input would be valuable. To go one step further the wikipedia guidelines actual encourage notifying the key contributors prior to submitting a deletion nomination so see if a simple fix is possible.</p>
<p>Guess what? I was never contacted. I stumbled on the fact all this kangaroo kourt business is going on when someone changed a page I was watching that I contributed to and I followed the links back to here. Boy was I surprised.</p>
<p>Guess what else? I did a little research in following talk links. Not only was this page put up for deletion without notifying me, who admittedly only did a few edits, but NOBODY who made ANY positive comments or contributions was contacted. That’s not the policy.</p>
<p>Wait? You mean this little kangaroo kourt might not be on the up and up. No! Don’t say it.</p>
<p>Guess what else? There people contacted, it seems everyone who had something negative to contribute at any point in history was contacted and encouraged and invited to come vote for deletion.</p>
<p>AND, everyone who voted to keep the page was contacted and encouraged to change their vote.</p>
<p>Not understand that I don’t particularly give a poppycock whether the page stays or goes, but it should be done by the rules. When someone is so committed to fast-tracking a kangaroo kourt deletion that they lie, sock puppet, and break rules left and right then something is wrong with the picture.</p>
<p>I made a point on the discussion page. The attacker is misrepresenting all his or her opinions as fact and then disregarding the true facts because he/she doesn’t like them.</p>
<p>The wikipedia site is referenced. It points to documented sources. Good hard news sources.</p>
<p>The attackers seem to make up quotes and expect them to believed. The mention parts of articles and leave off the parts that they don’t like – you know, the parts with facts in them.</p>
<p>You have hundreds of thousands of sources stating Rikki Lee Travolta is John Travolta’s nephew. The attacker says none of them count because one article in the Chicago Sun Times stated he is not. In fact the Sun Times went back and corrected that statement, but the attacker leave that part out…just like the attacker leaves off that the article in question that they are claiming is the one true fact out of hundreds of thousands of counter-articles is all about the guy being the star of syndicated television series. Why leave that part out of the quote? Not because that part would make the guy notable – right? That would be unfair. That would be breaking the rules.</p>
<p>The attacker lists 2006 sales figures for a 2002 book Travolta wrote. In 2002 Amazon had it as a Top 25 recommendation. (I couldn’t find the Top 10 proof but there are were more than enough Top 25 references). In 2003 there was a New York Times Best Seller named “Dad, Dames, Demons and a Dwarf” by radio personality Mancow Muller. In 2006 it’s sales figures are a worse ranking than Travolta’s book. That doesn’t mean the books weren’t popular in their day.</p>
<p>I read all these comments. Every time someone voices a positive opinion, the attacker (or appropriate puppet) jumps in and bashes and trashes with no facts, just accusations and falsehoods.</p>
<p>Do you need to be told what your opinion is? I don’t.</p>
<p>Attack me. I don’t care. At least I can stand by my opinion and interpret facts without being swayed by bullying attacks.</p>
<p>Fact: 2 albums Fact: Nominated for Grammy Fact: Movie credits Fact: TV credits Fact: Ranked in top 5 in world as star of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Broadway World News Fact: Member of Travolta Family Fact: He wrote a novel that was really popular in its time. Fact: A movie company is making the book into a movie Fact: Was reported around the world as possible James Bond Fact: Check the current news and there’s articles about him. Fact: Google hits over 20,000</p>
<p>I don’t care what you decide. I don’t care how you vote. But the vote on facts, not how some joker wants to sway you to vote just to prove he or she knows more than you do. ~ Bostic5.0 05:49, 8 April 2006 (UTC) <small>This user's only edits have been to this article or to add this person's name to other pages.

I was only just notified by another. editor because of other actions by this person. Votes to keep have been attacked and bullied. He has gone out to recruit and ask people to come vote to delete.

<dd>As someone who has been on the opposite side of Arniep, I will tell you that your recruitment theory is incorrect. He asked me only, as someone involved in film and theater research, to see what I could learn about Rikki Lee's career. He never once asked me to vote or put my opinions on this page. These accusations you bring are nothing new for Arniep, but as in the case I was involved in, they're also not true. I will agree that sometimes he has a way of doing things that seem to stomp all over other views, but this is a discussion about whether or not this person warrants an article in Wikipedia at this time, nothing else. It doesn't mean that if it's deleted now, there will not be an article at a future date.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am proud to have been the editor to start the Joey Travolta page. I know a lot about the Travolta family. I have contributed as an editor to the Rikki Lee Travolta page. Undoubtedly Rikki Lee Travolta is a real person, is related to Joey, Ellen, John, Maggie, Sam, Annie, Tommy, Jonathan, Rachel, Jet, so on and so forth on and on et al.... That is not and should not be his claim to fame. He is an accomplished actor, well known and well respected. Clearly "Arniep" (and his pseudonyms) has an issue with Rikki Lee Travolta and is making a personal attack. I've looked at his contributions. He has gone recruiting to get people to vote 'Delete'. See the warning at the top of the page. Ballot stuffing shouldn't be the goal. The truth should be the goal.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not certain if I am in fact allowed a vote. I contributed in the past to the Rikki Lee Article in minor fashion. I do not consider myself of any ranking of expertise. The dialogue presented in these proceedings suggests all parties who have contributed to the article in question or any article concerning a member of the Travolta family is not qualified, nor allowed, to register a vote for consideration in this discussion. That said, revue of the governing ordinances suggests otherwise. If my vote is allowed, so be it. If it is not, please disregard it. I was not advised of these proceedings by the instigator the nomination as is suggested by governing ordinances but upon notification by 3rd party via talk/discussion I have voluntarily added myself to the proceedings in effort towards positive resolution. I have done a modicum of research towards adding references to information contained within the article in question. References now exceed 30, which in comparison to other articles is clearly indicative of a larger than is usual. I hope this information should prove useful.

<li><b>Comment</b> You are not forbidden from expressing your opinion, but this is not a vote. The fact that you have never made any edit that did not relate to Rikki Lee Travolta does have some bearing on your credibility. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem is that very if any of the references count as reliable source. For example, if you look at the claim he is being considered for the role of Thor, you have four citations but they all trace back to a single announcement by ComicBoards.com. The book <i>My Fractured Life</i> has never been mentioned in a major newspaper or magazine either as a book review or in connection with the alleged movie deal. His IMDB entry was written by his personal manager. And so on. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rikki_Lee_Travolta_3569.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta">Wikipedia Talk:Articles for deletion/Rikki Lee Travolta</a> for more information. On the flip side, I am curious as to how it comes to pass that at least eight people join wikipedia in November, 2005; only edit articles about Rikki Lee Travolta, and never edit any other articles until his article is challenged. At the very least, it is a staggering example of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a> and I'm sure the eight of you have an awful lot to talk about (if you don't know each other already.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, apologies if I'm repeating what someone else said about (there are a lot of comments to read through up there) but I went to the imdb page for "Twilight Serenade" and I have to say there is something a bit off about it. If you click on all of the names of the people purported to be in the cast of this movie, every single person in this movie, with two exceptions, has <i>exactly one role in their entire lives ever</i>, and of those two, one has other credits as gay porn, and the other has a credit as an "Ewok". Now, I'm sure it's possible that a movie existed and every single person in the cast did that one exact movie and then disappeared, but this seems really fishy to me. Of course, aside from all this, <b>delete</b> in any case because this is unnotability at its finest. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 04:22, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not all the refs are to IMDb: look at <a href="http://chicago.about.com/cs/events1/a/Fabio_Travolta.htm" class="external text" title="http://chicago.about.com/cs/events1/a/Fabio_Travolta.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/cgi-bin/news/newsbrief.plx?id=2240162384&amp;fa=1" class="external text" title="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/cgi-bin/news/newsbrief.plx?id=2240162384&amp;fa=1" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, for instance. For me to believe that this is an elaborate hoax strains credibility; I can't begin to imagine how a person could manage such a thing. And yet there is indeed something quite odd about it all, and the idea that he is a exceptionally prolific self-promoter also seems totally plausible. I could not possibly vote on this as I have absolutely no idea whether the article is entirely true, partially true, or entirely false. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: If there is doubt, if there is murkiness in the references, then, <i>as an encyclopedia,</i> we don't include it. Let's be simple about this: Wikipedia is not a primary source. If the person is a great astroturfer, then his fame will last only as long as the electrons fly, which isn't long. Until there are real and inarguable roles of substance, there is no article.

<li><b>Keep - flag for Cleanup</b> I started the Annie Travolta page and have been a contributor to many of the Travolta family pages including Margaret Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta, Annie Travolta, and John Travolta. Many of those changes are reverting vandalism. It is right there in the history. There is no way, shape, or form that could remotely be confused as being in an “advertising scam”. I have NEVER removed members of the Travolta family from listings. I have worked hard to keep the integrity in tact. I think upon closer inspection you’ll see there was an influx of attempts by an anon (66.121.40.132) to vandalizing different Travolta family sites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.121.40.132" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> (changing facts without providing sources or citations).

<dd><i>Its been noticed that you have made several repeated changes to the family elements of the John Travolta page and related pages. The policy at Wikipedia is to try to avoid revert wars going back and forth over the same territory. As follows are what we have confirmed as members of the Travolta family: Margaret Travolta, John Travolta, Ellen Travolta, Joey Travolta, Rikki Lee Travolta; Jack Bannon, Rachel Travolta, Nicole Travolta, Michael Salvatore Travolta, Helen (Burke) Travolta, Kelly Preston, Salvatore Travolta, Molly Allen Ritter, Jonathan Rau, Jet Travolta, Tom Fridley, Sam Travolta, Ella Blue Travolta, Valentino Travolta, and Annie Travolta. This is not an all inclusive list, but all those listed are confirmed. In respecting Wikipedia policy it is always necessary to approach differences of opinion in good faith. Although we have documented each of these individuals as relatives (of different levels of removal or closeness of course) within the extended Travolta family, ff you disagree with any person(s) on this list please provide the documentation and we should be able to come to a simple understanding relatively quickly (no pun intended).

<p>This is a page for a D&amp;D spell. The spell was never notable enough for the encyclopedia to begin with. It is now a redirect to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spells_of_Dungeons_and_Dragons_4439.html" title="Spells of Dungeons and Dragons">Spells of Dungeons and Dragons</a>, and the list at that article now includes the <i>skull trap</i> spell. The spell isn't significant enough for inclusion in that list, however (we're trying to keep the list to the most iconic), but I'm told I can't remove the spell from the list as long as this page redirects to it! So I'm asking for this redirect to be deleted so I can remove its merged text from the target article. I'd previously proposed the deletion of this article but <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">User:TigerShark</a> removed the tag. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 02:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am writing this note to record the fact that my first experience in creating an article has exposed me to ridicule, offensive behavior and a systematic pattern of argumentation from one of the wikipedia editors, "calton" whose comments are on this page. I was told by several friends and colleagues that wikipedia was untrustworthy and unreliable and a place so contentious that it wasnt worth the bother, since you merely ended up combatting spiteful and immature people more interested in proving their points than in creating a worthwhile body of knowledge. While I was making minor edits, I only occaisonally found this to be true, but when I posted an original article, I was made the subect of namecalling and defending my entries against systematic deletion with little or no positive input into the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now spend my time erasing all contributions that I have made to nuance the subjects upon which I have contributed, both as an unregistered user and a registered one.</p>
<p>This exceedingly sharp process of harrassment has not been limited to this page, but has been conducted on multiple forums where my edits were immediately nominated for speedy deletes while I was actually still in the process of posting them.</p>
<p>I have no problem with input, constructive criticism, or an honest difference of opinion, but being called a liar and having hours of my time wasted,---not out of a desire to improve the project but merely to assert dominance over another persons thoughts goes far beyond that pale.</p>
<p>The merits of the individual which I listed in this entry are obvious and many, and the consensus process is obviously free to come to whatever conclusions it likes regarding the entry's eventual inclusion or deletion, but I acted on behalf of perceived unfairness meted out to the very clever and entertaining author at hand. I had asked for the opportunity to edit the post in such a way as to make it a proper entry, replete with over 25 printed references to his preinternet published work, but Calton has been so aggressive and offensive that I doubt this will be very likely.</p>
<p>The bigoted motivations which prompted the original deletion discussion motivated me to take action to correct this basic injustice, but I see now that this organization is sadly the victim of its trolls.</p>
<p>Calton, and the people who share his approach: You win. I won't be posting anything else, and I will remove all of the content which I have provided so that you can be free from opinions which diverge from yours.</p>
<p>To the several people who did offer advice and sympathy, thank you: your comments were decent and very helpful, I wish you well in your endeavors.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an all new article which clearly outlines notable contribution on the part of the subject. Not to mention that there is good reason why Dare should be retained on wikipedia. (Besides the overwhelming mantra that Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia) A previous post was defaced on numerous occasions and then nominated for deletion in what clearly arose from homophobia. I have taken the time to accurately research and document this individual, being a bit of a buff on witty writers. The original article was a mess, and very inaccurate. I have cleaned up all of the inaccuracies, and am glad to have this article reviewed by other wikipedians.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarstenboswell_4f17.html" title="User:Carstenboswell">Carstenboswell</a> 03:37, 5 April 2006 (UTC)carstenboswell</li>

My favorite for the moment is the <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOTNOTE_26e2.html" title="WP:FOOTNOTE">WP:FOOTNOTE</a> method, in which you place the note at the spot in the text where you want it, enclosed by &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt; tags, and a &lt;references/&gt; tag at the bottom of the page creates a auto-numbered footnote list. What you enclose at the note could be a url, a free-form text note, or a citation template. Research paper format (author, article title, publication title, volume/issue, date, page) is fine. There are citation templates to do that automatically or you can write it free-hand. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:14, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I remember looking through Lexis/Nexis the last time this came up and finding a few articles from Jacksonville newspapers that mentioned Dare and/or the Boomtown Cafe in the context of urban revitalization and creating an "artsy" downtown (for lack of a better word). I did not find evidence supporting other claims, such as a series of essays on urban redevelopment. In addition the article lacks an encyclopedic tone with comments like "by far his wittiest writing." Was Dare really "the first in the United States to identify computerization of the workforce as the driving factor of urban decline in the 80s and 90s, and to chronicle the various efforts of American cities to counter urban blight"? I have added {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags where I thought they were most important. Many of these claims are pre-internet but newspaper and magazine articles can still be found in libraries (remember them?) and the citations added (title, author, date, volume, page number, etc) I would support a <b>keep</b> provided the article was trimmed to include those things for which Dare is verifiably notable, which so far only includes the Boomtown Cafe and related urban revitalization in Jacksonville. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:35, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Like the <i>Social Policy</i> reference? I dug up the abstract:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Deifell notes how From the Hip assigned 280 writers and photographers aged 25 and under to document how young people are defining and doing service in their communities. By providing a description of a wide range of service activities and perspectives, From the Hip hopes to promote an understanding of the diversity of opinions on service. (SH)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suspect Dare's name is mentioned, at best, as one of the collective 280 young people that are the real subject of the article.
<ul>
<li>Or maybe you mean <i>Social Issues</i>, a journal which seems not have left a trace of its existence anywhere, nor does any article called “The Eternal Cities” seem to be anywhere found.</li>
<li>Let's face it, about the only reference that checks out is being quoted in a Jacksonville buiness journal -- as a café owner.

<dd><b>Comment 1:</b> The nominator seems to think (as per the talk page) that this is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">content fork</a> of <a href="../../../a/d/s/Adsorption.html" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a>. I'll let the resident scientists decide that, as I have no clue about physics, but unless the information is indeed replicated in full, it probably warrants a <i>merge</i> at most.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment 2:</b> Note that the nominator has also created <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Expansivity_c46a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Expansivity">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Expansivity</a> (but not linked to it on the article or AfD page), which seems to raise the same concerns about <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expansivity.html" title="Expansivity">Expansivity</a> with regard to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_expansion.html" title="Thermal expansion">Thermal expansion</a>. For the sake of expeditiveness, we probably should deal with both issues together here.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../a/d/s/Adsorption.html" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a> per Sandstein. Note also that the article name is misspelled. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 17:35, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This article is indeed a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">content fork</a> of <a href="../../../a/d/s/Adsorption.html" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a>, which covers both the Langmuir isotherm and the BET isotherm. A merge would not be appropriate because 1) This information is replicated entirely on <a href="../../../a/d/s/Adsorption.html" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a> and 2) information here is incorrect, namely the discussion of a desorption isotherm. An isotherm is derived by setting rate of adsorption equal to rate desorption, so there is no desorption isotherm since desorption is already contained in the adsorption isotherm. This article really just needs to be deleted. Simsea 23:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Sinsea, in such cases, AfD nomination is not really necessary. Just replace the entire text of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absorption_isotherm.html" title="Absorption isotherm">Absorption isotherm</a> with #REDIRECT[[Adsorption]]. This will create a redirection page to <a href="../../../a/d/s/Adsorption.html" title="Adsorption">Adsorption</a>. If the original author of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absorption_isotherm.html" title="Absorption isotherm">Absorption isotherm</a> has problems with that, he or she will bring them up with you. No need to involve the wider community at this point. However, now you should probably wait until the AfD is over. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 04:52, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that there is a category for 1896 Olympic shooters, and most of them are even less notable than this guy, as in they didnt finish the competition or their finishing place was not known.

<p>I tried to add those names, but my list was lost, and Im not about to redo it. Either way, the others are even less notable than Baumann. They have no dates of birth or death, most only have one name given, and most of their finishes are not known at all, or atleast only to the extent that they didnt finish very high. If there was more biographical information known, or they received a medal, I would say differently, but as it is now, they didnt, so I continue to support my AfD.--<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal5017_9170.html" title="User:Pal5017">Pal5017</a> 05:20, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm inclined to support "keep", but it should be noted that the fact of one's competing in the Olympics in 1896 (or even 1900, 1904, or 1908) surely doesn't resolve the question of notability as might the fact of one's competing in, say, the Athens or Turin Games. Importantly, few countries participated in the first several iterations of the Modern Olympics, and, in some cases, all competitors in a given event hailed from the host country. One's participating, then, didn't necessarily mean that he/she was at the top of his/her sport internationally, only that he/she was in the right place at the right time (see, e.g., <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis_at_the_1896_Summer_Olympics_aaad.html" title="Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics">Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics</a>, where the singles competition was won by an Irishman on vacation in Greece who was entered by a friend on a whim and where the doubles competition was won by that Irishman and his first-round singles opponent, who was at the games to compete in athletics). While medalling in an Olympic event is notable per se (such that the Irishman, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pius_Boland_3d74.html" title="John Pius Boland">John Pius Boland</a>, irrespective of his competition at the Games or of his general tennis history, merits an article), it is probably fair to say that an athlete who competed in the an early Summer Games is not necessarily notable solely for his/her having participated. It's a close call, though, and I certainly understand that some may think it best to consider participation in the Olympics as passing a bright-line rule. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:12, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> As I wrote in my comment above, participation in an early edition of the modern Olympics didn't necessarily denote anything about a participant's athletic proficiency; many participants in the first few modern iterations weren't athletes by trade and weren't required to qualify in the contemporary sense, such that one can't infer anything about an athlete's general level of participation in international (such as it was) or national competition from the fact of his/her participation in the Olympics. That said, I am inclined to think that participation qua participation is sufficient to establish notability, and that, given the difficulties one would have in establishing which of the "modern Olympics" should be treated with the reverence with which we treat "recent 'modern Olympics'", it is perhaps best that we err on the side of including any participants for whom any information is available. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:35, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apologies in advance for the length; from what I can gather, this one has a bit of a backstory. The subject of the article is a short-range radio station broadcasting from a summer camp, with a listenership that, by the nature of the station, as the article readily concedes, does not exceed the membership of the camp. The article's creator has on several occasions appended the information to the article about the camp (<a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Timberlane_for_Boys_be9e.html" title="Camp Timberlane for Boys">Camp Timberlane for Boys</a>), but his edits have been reverted by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">User:BaronLarf</a> on the grounds that the information is insufficiently notable and, in any case, rather unencyclopedic; having inferred that BaronLarf meant that a new article on the topic should be created, the user created this article. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKTIM_Online&amp;diff=47036351&amp;oldid=47033916" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKTIM_Online&amp;diff=47036351&amp;oldid=47033916" rel="nofollow">explained</a> to the user that he might remove my PROD tag, and he did, although he seems amenable to merging. Of course, if the information doesn't belong in the original article (I think it does not), that isn't much help; I think, then, that here <b>delete</b> surely is in order and that the debate about the inclusion of the information in the original article should likely be had by those editors most familiar with that article and general Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:59, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree. I think I should briefly mention KTIM Online in the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Timberlane_for_Boys_be9e.html" title="Camp Timberlane for Boys">Camp Timberlane for Boys</a> article, but significantly shorten it into only a few sentences in the History section of the Camp Timberlane article. After all, the podcast is a large part of the camp, and deserves a brief mewntion (but not a full article, or even a full paragraph) Sounds good? <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax">Ccool2ax</a> 11:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC) (same user who made all those edits last night, diffrent rotated IP)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yeah. It's not notable (even though I don't like the notability guideline at all), and the summary in the main article is decent enough. I still thinks that WIkipedia is "the combined sum of all human knowledge", as it's fundraising slogan says. But this article is well-enough represented in it's main article that this can be deleted. 66.82.9.89 02:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, the Livejournal Community 'cakepieces' shows that it has a good amount of viewers.

<p>-I am still new with the entire system of Wikipedia. I am not sure what is ment by the ranking. There is no definate way to say how big the following is, but judging the IRC chat, which is also held, it has a generous sized following. What does it matter, really, if its notable? A lot of entries on Wikipedia contain only one or two lines about things which are even less known than this comic. -- <i><a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">User:Vidyaranya</a></i></p>

<p>Since you guys are so adamant about Alexa, may I ask one thing. On Wikipedia's own entry for Alexa, it says:</p>
<p>Alexa themselves admit several sources of bias - for instance, sites with relatively low traffic will not be accurately ranked, nor sites with a disproportionate amount of users who use non-IE browsers; and subdomains are included in the main domain's rank/trend figures. [2]</p>
<p>How do you know it is being accurate in this particular case? <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a> 18:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you really want to know why there's an increase in the fandom's demands its because the community has been heavily discriminated against. Even some of the material that is in Wikipedia about the community is negative and upsets people who are true to the fandom. Quite basically, a lot of people who are part of the fandom and have been persecuted for being so are fed up with it to the point they don't tolerate resistance. I still question Alexa since there is controversy about it. If you're going to get reliable statistics, then you should use a system that covers all broswers instead of just IE. Now, I don't about you guys, but when I first came here I was lead to believe Wikipedia was for the providing of information about everything. This entire notability issue, especially with an established comic which has been nominated, as GreenReaper point out--still it seems even that was ignored. But the fact there is a policy on notability denotes a form of elitism.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not attacking anyone by saying this, but is it right to only include things that thousands of people are aware of? What matters to most people is the fact an object is out there and there is information on it...not how notable something is. The level of notability does not change the fact it still exists. The purpose of an encylopedia is to provide truthful information regardless of how well known it something is. I'm sorry I ever believed in this place's credibility. I don't intend assisting the mainstream wikipedia section any longer due to this issue. From now on I'll stick to the WikiFur and make Fandom based pages on what is important and known to the fandom.</p>
<p>I heard how Wikipedia even gave WikiFur, at one time, trouble when it first started out. I've made this decision to fully support WikiFur's prominence to the benefit of WikiFur, not Wikipedia as a whole. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidyaranya_efbc.html" title="User:Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a> 00:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"But is it right to only include things that thousands of people are aware of?" Pretty much, yes; that's what makes Wikipedia an encylopedia and not a blog or a bulletin board. I'm sorry you presumed Wikipedia was something other than it is, but I'm likewise sure you understand that (as with any online website, blog, project, whatever) it is far less likely that Wikipedia will change its rules and practices to accommodate your personal preferences than the reverse. I note, for instance, that WikiFur has its own set of policies and guidelines <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/WikiFur:Policies_and_guidelines" class="external autonumber" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/WikiFur:Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> to which I imagine I would be expected to conform on that site. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as, unfortunately, not notable enough to keep. Wow. Vidyaranya, I was going to post on your talk page, but you indicated not to; please, understand that this is a process that ensures only truly notable and encyclopedic topics are part of Wikipedia. As much as I myself enjoy V&amp;A, read it all the time and think its creators are great, if Wiki allowed it to remain with little in the way of notability - and as much as there is a large following, there's no way to gauge it and no indication of it in referrable sources - it would open the floodgates to all kinds of crap that I've watched being deleted lately. Don't take it personally that it's being considered here. (And as a furry, I'm fine with the efforts that other furries have given to keep the related articles NPOV, for the record.)<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 01:02, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Not all are authors of works that have actually been physically printed, such as into a book, and distributed by a company. Also, for the first two on the list, they were delisted from Aozora Bunko's database because their URLed works could no longer be found, and judging from their Google count, they've only reached notability in Aozora Bunko mirrors that are slow to update their lists.

<li><b>Keep</b> 69.219.154.4 11:12, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It's unfortunate that some of the shenanigans is distracting people from discussing the actual issues. Lee Asher is undoubted a well-known close-up magician; it's a discipline that is very difficult to make a regular living in, let alone get your name recognized, even if you are very good. The fact that his tricks are carried by major magic supply houses and that he is a somewhat sought-after lecturer should clearly show he is somewhat noteworthy. On the other hand, I'm not sure if in analogy to university professors and the "professor test", he is far enough above the average recognized magician to merit inclusion. I don't know, as I no longer keep up with the magic community (although I used to as a teenager). Nor do I know if we should apply that kind of stringent criterion here (as I think people are). I would say that winning IBM close-up champ twice in a row is a notable feat; however, web searches show it was probably junior close-up champ which I suspect has a lower level of competition. There's also the issue of whether he won the actual IBM international competition or some local Ring version.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> (continued): I should add that a magician's credentials are not really suited to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia: Verifiability</a>, unfortunately. It's true that many magic manuals are for those "in the trade"; thus one has some extremely well-known and influential books that don't have ISBN numbers or are known outside of the magic community. Using the analogy with professors, one can imagine a pretty famous physicist that publishes in very specialized journals whose names or fame aren't known by those outside of physics. If you were to take a <i>very</i> famous close up magician such as David Roth, I suspect it would be extremely difficult to verify he was famous without knowing a lot about magic. One might get a suspicion he was when one notices his books are sometimes very prominently displayed on some magic store webpages, but that could easily be dismissed by someone who wants to paint Roth as just "someone good at self-promotion". Another clue would be when one searches say, Hank Lee's magic factory's webpage (a pretty well known magic supplier), one finds that on various product descriptions of various magic products, there is included a quote by Roth saying this product is the finest such-and-such he's had the pleasure of using. These endorsements by Roth indicates, to someone who knows what to look for, that he is pretty influential. On the other hand, searching for endorsements in ads is not the way we usually establish notability. Anyway, this long diatribe is just to point out something I think has not really been understood by everyone: Wikipedia has very little experience in verifying magician's credentials. In conclusion, my own feeling is that if we were to have a reasonable bar for inclusion for magicians in Wikipedia, Asher would probably make it, even if by a thin margin; on the other hand, there are plenty of famous guys like Roth that don't have bios. I feel we should be working on those as in the end, they add more to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 04:07, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I started this mess, and I still don't know. I searched the major trade magazines in magic, The Linking Ring (the International Brotherhood of Magicians) and Genii, and Lee Asher has one hit in each. So he's at least known. I can't judge "notable". I'm inclined to let him have his article, but I think the product list needs to come out, on the grounds that it's advertising. Wikipedia ordinarly doesn't allow vendors to post their whole product line. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 06:00, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> John Nagle's and Chan-Ho's recent posts are very helpful. Wikipedia already does have guidelines for notability of performing artists, e.g. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and for authors (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). Being mentioned a few times in trade mags doesn't seem to be enough. People who develop magic effects are maybe more like instrument makers; <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Mayer_2fcf.html" title="Roger Mayer">Roger Mayer</a> (developer of guitar effects used by Jimi Hendrix), is very easy to find verifiable cites for, Stradivari is still famous after many centuries, etc. As for David Roth, a ProQuest search found numerous national newspaper hits for him (with the keyword "magic"), e.g., an NYT article about David Copperfield (1996-12-26 p. C11) described Roth as "commonly called the best coin man in the world". But it found zero hits for Lee Asher with "magic". So I'd say David Roth is reasonably notable but Lee Asher's notability is marginal at best. I agree with John Nagle that if the article is kept, the product list has to go. I thought magicians wanted to keep that kind of stuff out of view of the public anyway, so it's odd that he's trying so hard to flog it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 08:25, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Found some more cites indicating notability:</li>

<dd>And he's apparently a regular performer at the Magic Castle, the private magician's club in LA.

This third nomination derives from a content dispute on <a href="../../../a/r/y/Talk%7EAryan_Nations_0162.html" title="Talk:Aryan Nations">Talk:Aryan Nations</a> in whch some editors feel they are "real" members of the Aryan Nation but Williams is not.

Regarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, Williams is quoted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press in articles dated October 2004 and October 2005 as "Jonathan Williams, Aryan Nations communications director in Atlanta" and "senior pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations." It seems like there has been a split within the organization and this AfD is the result of one faction trying to suppress the other. Based on the newspaper quotes I believe he is notable as well, although I can see why it was a no consensus previously; its a borderline case. <b>Keep.</b> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:22, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually there's an awful lot in the article that is at least unverified. "His views differ little from those expressed since the 18th and 19th century," or "His Pentecostal beliefs weakened as he became more involved with Conspiracy theorists" or "Williams holds degrees in theology, as well as political history, which makes him seem easier to stomach than some of the same element." For a more notable person his views on religion, politics, and so on might be recorded in multiple media interviews or published biographies. In this case I'm not sure what we can rely on; someone listening to his radio show I guess, or hearing him in church. Which I why I think this is a borderline case; he seems to be quoted in the local papers and is verifiably a Christian Identity minister, but can we verifiy his other statements and beliefs? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not only a Fraud but not popular enough.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is all hear say, Thatcher you act like you have some personal ties to this Williams Fraud, please refrain from posting POV's, need not comment everytime someone votes to delete this kid, people do not need your persuasion here. Williams openly admits is not &amp; never has been a Member of the Aryan Nations. And is not &amp; was not @ anytime a Aryan Nations pastor as to be a Aryan Nations Pastor you must be ordained by the Aryan Nations therefore he can not even claim to be what he's trying to be known famous for. Williams is just a highschool kid, he don't no Degrees in Theology LOL &amp; that's besides the fact he's never even met a Aryan Nations Pastor or Leader. Jonathan Williams is a 20 year old kid who lies &amp; has not only no credibility but no proof or fame @ all. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.171.16.151 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.171.16.151.html" title="User talk:24.171.16.151">talk</a> •</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per neutrality! The above comments, other than maybe 2, were all posted by the same user. Williams is cited in just as many articles as Kreiss. The fact is, if you go to other racial websites and see who they acknowledge as successors, it looks as if they think Kreiss is a "joke". Nonetheless, I say keep both sites listed and both individuals listed out of fairness. Everyone involved watching this revert war take place is fully aware that it isn't going to end unless these pages are permanently protected. 24.171.16.151 is the only person vandalizing these articles. If you follow the history of this IP address, you see that this person is a "Daily" VANDAL.

<p>Ok, granted Austin Purfleet is not the most famous of 19th century figures, but I don't think he deserves his entry deleted. The books mentioning Purfleet I've cited are by Nick Grene and Leon Green (coincidently enough) neither of which are high profile authors, but i'm trying to find other sources that mention him, as well as trying to get in contact with the two authors. My interest in Purfleet stems from the fact that my father claims that we're descended from him. Green's book makes mention of Purfleet's children with his second wife, but until this disbute is all sorted out I don't really want to go to the trouble of typing it all into wikipedia just for it to be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/u/p/User%7ERupertknowles64_3430.html" title="User:Rupertknowles64">Rupertknowles64</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/p/User_talk%7ERupertknowles64_a753.html" title="User talk:Rupertknowles64">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rupertknowles64_e776.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rupertknowles64">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>This is the end of Austin Purfleet's short-lived life</b> Ok on behalf of the others I will confess: this is a huge hoax, I can see how much damage it has caused our dear country. I can confirm though that Tromlitz is a real flautist (according to the linked website at least) so his article should remain (although be renamed to Johann Tromlitz - I realised too late and could not see how to revert this). I appologise to Biedermann for using his image. I have checked all "collateral damage" (good film btw) I personally caused (or can remember causing at this instant) and all have been reverted. We can rest pleased with the following comment above: "A pretty good, well written, funny, hoax, but clearly a hoax." I am glad we weren't the only to enjoy this article. I leave it up to the appropriate people to take the necessary action. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyS_UK_3a2d.html" title="User:AndyS UK">AndyS UK</a> 17:57, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Very odd lack of information on this anywhere--it does have an IMDB entry with very little info besides cast and crew, and doesn't have 5 votes yet despite having been in release for 8 years.

<p>This article is about the unfortunate experiences of a high school baseball coach. I would have nominated it for speedy deletion, but there is a possible claim to notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I created the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_replacement_players_855e.html" title="List of Major League Baseball replacement players">List of Major League Baseball replacement players</a>, and the list contains only replacement players who played in MLB at some point in their careers, while Mr. Tatarian does not appear to have ever advanced beyond the minors. (Replacement players did not play any games of record; they went through spring training, appeared in exhibitions, and then were disbanded before the start of the regular season.) If the list included all replacement players, it would contain more than a thousand names, 95% of them redlinks. I recognize that the inclusion statement for the list was ambiguous in this respect, and have corrected it. I'm not offering an opinion on the notability of his minor-league career because I'm at work and I don't have access to any of the relevant reference materials, and it's not out of the question that he could've been a minor-league All-Star or a notable amateur, something like that. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 16:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I tagged this as cleanup after a browse that took me from List of famous strike-breakers. I think my keep/delete vote would sit on the fence of how 'famous' this strike-break made him; if it was notable at the time, it would be suitable for inclusion. However presumably in order to be able to be a strike-breaker, there would have to be 17 other strike-breakers too; this page should then be summarised and included into a page on the more general strike-breaking, as it is too biographical in and of itself. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirien_62ef.html" title="User:Firien">User:Firien</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirien_191d.html" title="User talk:Firien">§</a> 13:57, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> Term is not used in the scientific community or elsewhere. This is the second nomination for deletion of this article; the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pseudowallerian_degeneration_2272.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pseudowallerian degeneration">first one</a> in May 2005 ended in a consensus of "keep", finding that "pseudowallerian degeneration" is a term used in neuroscience. Evidence presented at the time consisted of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=788098&amp;query_hl=2" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=788098&amp;query_hl=2" rel="nofollow">a single Medline abstract</a> from 1976, translated from the French. It appears that the authors were describing an obscure phenomenon similar to but different from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallerian_degeneration.html" title="Wallerian degeneration">Wallerian degeneration</a> and labeled it "pseudo-Wallerian degeneration" (just like one might call wikinfo a pseudo-Wikipedia, for instance) without the intent or result of creating a new technical term. No other Medline abstract has ever used the phrases "pseudowallerian degeneration" or "pseudo-wallerian degeneration" or "pseudo Wallerian degeneration". A fulltext search of 3 standard neuroscience text books at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Books" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> yields no hits for those terms. At the time of the first nomination, Google yielded zero hits for those terms; today there are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22pseudo-wallerian+degeneration%22+OR+%22pseudo+wallerian+degeneration%22+OR+%22pseudowallerian+degeneration%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22pseudo-wallerian+degeneration%22+OR+%22pseudo+wallerian+degeneration%22+OR+%22pseudowallerian+degeneration%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">some 150 hits</a>, all traceable back to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Response re: Paul Escandon - should <b>NOT</b> be deleted because of the following guidelines listed in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - "<i>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</i>". Paul Escandon has edited over 30 tv shows that appear on a national cable network (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Outdoor_Channel_d56b.html" title="The Outdoor Channel">The Outdoor Channel</a>) with a viewership of over 26.7 million households in the United States alone. That alone meets the criteria to be listed in Wikipedia, and that is not even to mention his independant film work. This is verifiable. The "Google test" is listed as purely an alternative means to verify notability... in this case an alternate means need not be used. You nominated Paul seemingly because of his connection to Downrising, however, without the passage that related to his former band the article still merits inclusion. <a href="../../../d/r/s/User%7EDrshabazz_4bbb.html" title="User:Drshabazz">Drshabazz</a> 08:37, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: You asked for an outside link that showed "some information on Paul Escandon" and that has been provided. IMDB has a long approval process and waits for individuals to submit show and credit information (just like Wikipedia) and as an effect not all credits will show up on that site in a timely fasion. You will note that while <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Outdoor_Channel_d56b.html" title="The Outdoor Channel">The Outdoor Channel</a> has a Wikipedia entry, there are very few of its shows that actually have listings on IMDB. As previously stated, based on the acceptable publishing rules in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the fact that current shows he's edited have been viewed by over hundred's of thousands of individual times more than warrants an entry.

<li>I've read it, thanks. I'm pretty sure it refers to editors who compile works (and are hence the "author"). Simply editing a text or some video is hardly notable.

<li>I don't know where you've obtained such a blase attitude about film editing but the fact of the matter is that editing episodic television or drama is incredibly creative and meaningful and the profession is essential to a finished work. I'm going to chalk it up to ignorance on your part as I'm sure you're not in the profession or even the industry...but editing is not "simple" and a newsroom editor has a far different task then someone who's job it is to tell a coherent story in episodic tv. Just my $.02 on the matter. 68.70.209.150 10:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So your response to my question is "yes"? I'm not dissing film editing here. I've edited film myself and I know it's hard. But that doesn't make this guy notable. Thousands of people will work on any feature film. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 14:06, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question/comment</b> - I've been searching the web looking for the term 'Downrising' in conjunction with the band members and can't find results that aren't Xanga, MySpace, or the band's website. Could you perhaps post a link here to some information about the band/members that wasn't written by the band/members? I would encourage others who would be voting to keep this article based on what they read here, to hold off until some facts outside of the band's own website are presented.<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:41, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep 1 and 3, merge 2 with 1</b>. Notability, in my honest opinion, is anything anyone can find useful, and in my view is that notability should not warrent an argument. However, the 1st is notable since they have performed, and thus gained their name on the program, meaning they are part of the world's collection of Rock Bands. The 2nd article is too small to warrent an article, and is really a sub-article of the 1st, so it should be merged. The 3rd article seems unrelated, and should be kept since it is a stub, meaning it is still developing.68.192.25.106 01:43, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Anyway</b> - no information on the band is verifiable as to its notability as of yet imo, as the only source of info regarding the band is the band's own website.

<dd>I definitely understand what you mean. What i was saying was that I have seen, for example, fan websites that are not just about the band itself, but also sites specifically devoted to deciphering their messages. I love BoC as well, but I don't think I'm too off the mark by saying that someone who takes the time to listen to their music front-and-backwards, isolate samples behind the music, write down every word and research from where it is extracted, and then build/contribute to a website about what it all means is a "rabid fan". Don't see that kind of thing with too many other artists. Right? -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 18:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You see that kind of thing with a whole lot of artists, and many far more prominent than BoC, but wikipedia is not the kind of place for any of that stuff, because it is all original research.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The references that are on the article seem to refer to speeches by this guru which happen to be stored at the guru's official website. That seems like an ok source to me. The article needs more sources. But this does not seem like a valid reason for deletion.

<li><b>keep</b> Like all articles in Wikipedia, this one began with a small amount of information that has accumulated. Much of it is claimed to be true by editors, and I am one of those. The record of these early teachings should be kept and verified when those sources are both re-found and documented. For example, for such a topical subject, written documentation might be light on; however, interviews with various people and other written, secondary sources may support what has been written. The point is that, simply because someone said/wrote it does not make it POV. It simply makes it unsourced. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrol_Vieth_11b0.html" title="User:Errol Vieth">Errol V</a> 04:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> This whole section reads as if Prem Rawat himself had dictated it, except the use of language is more logically coherent than Rawat can manage. In itself, that would not be a problem if the content were comprehensive and accurate. However, the last paragraph in particular reads as something of a whitewash of the facts regarding the 'superdevotional' era of the late seventies and early eighties. There is ample documented evidence archived at ex-premie.org which tells a very different story to this account, which appears, above all, an attempt to rewrite DLM/EV history and re-assign culpability for decisions and practises that came *always* from the top. When I say 'delete', what I really mean is scrap the thing and start again. A well-researched and objective entry on 'the past teachings of Prem Rawat' has to be an essential part of the story.

<li>Keep all. It is interesting for every student who wants to know this movement. It would be a lack in the wikipedia that a person who is giving conferences all over the world included several important universities in the west wasn´t have any reference in this encyclopedia. It is a social phenomena important to Know for pchycologists and sociologists as well. It is important to know the spiritual influence in western cultura.

<li>"Keep all." This part of the entries on Prem Rawat is more valuable than the main biographical segment, going through in a clear way every area of his teaching and how it has changed or been modified. It begins to give a sense of the gravity of the teaching itself which is overlooked by critics who focus on the life and personality of the teacher.Marvin Khan 12:05, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As the original author of the specific article, I will not deny that I have a personal interest in the specific company, but I do not have a personal profit out of it. The article does not describe my company or my website. My personal interest in the technology behind the company and it's products is no different to the interest of someone to, lets say, <a href="../../../b/m/r/BMRT_b913.html" title="BMRT">BMRT</a> (arguably this is not a more notable technology to most than a very small percentance of people who use Wikipedia - but for very few is important indeed). My intentions are not different than these. Please dont overlook also that I personaly characterised the article as <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>, inviting other people to add their knowledge in it. As you know I am new in wikipedia and I have to put effort to learn how to write properly according to all rules. I just had time to write a couple of sentences to learn how the system works! I will not be afraid to say that you were too quick in exercising your administrative rights and propose the article for deletion; I am afraid it appears like an intimidation strategy!! I think that according to the philosophy of wikipedia you should respect other peoples' interests and be more patient to judge other peoples' intentions. You could say that the article is spam if I had put links all over and no content, but this is not the case; only people who have direct interest to the company and its technology will search for it. So, wikipedia sysops, decide whether is a better policy to intimidate newcomers with threats or help them learn to write proper articles ... --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiou_Xu_2193.html" title="User:Haiou Xu">Haiou Xu</a> 19:09, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, Haio Xu. Please be assured that it was never my intention to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> you, or even to intimidate you with threats, of which none at all have been made. Please also note that, as per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, this is not an accusation one should make lightly.</dd>
<dd>I am happy that you have joined Wikipedia as a contributor. I am also certainly not holding it against you as a person that you have created this article as part of your learning experience. However, I have simply followed applicable policy, in this case <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, to nominate this article for deletion as a part of our collaborative effort to make sure that only encyclopedic content is featured in Wikipedia. I encourage you to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in order to find out more about this. Unfortunately, Wikipedia does receive many spam articles that often do resemble very much the article you wrote - with glowing descriptions of the company, phone numbers, etc. - so I hope you understand why I assessed it as spam.</dd>
<dd>By the way, now that you have stated that you are not affiliated with the corporation, I have to advise you that it is forbidden to use copyrighted material on Wikipedia, e.g. from a company website. It even says so below the edit window: "Content must not violate any copyright." Please read <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a> to find out more.</dd>
<dd>My advice to you is that you chalk this up as part of a very normal Wikipedia learning experience - incidentally, my first article, as an anonymous user, was also nominated for deletion within a short time - and have fun continuing to contribute to Wikipedia. Once again, welcome! <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 19:57, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> It does not appear to me that this company is particularly notable or worthy of inclusion in a general purpose encyclopedia per the stated guidelines. If they were <i>the first</i> or <i>the largest</i> of something it would make them more notable, or if they developed a significant technological advance in water purification that changed the industry, or something like that, it would help. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am sorry for continuing to argue against the proposal for deleting the article that I have started, but I think that the arguments against it are mostly untrue and, again, show too quick judgment. Please respect the fact that in a strange way the proposal appears offensive to me since it is like saying to me that I dont have interesting enough interests. Click any number of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Random Articles</a> and 8 out of 10, at least, will appear uninteresting to any one of us. As far as I have read in Wikipedia's 'policies' I haven't seen anywhere that articles have to be interesting to everyone or indeed that a company should be the <i>the first</i> or <i>the largest</i> of something or that has changed the world to be included in it. In fact most of the companies listed in 'Category:Manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom' or indeed in manufacturing company stubs are not more 'notable' that the company I am interested in. The specific manufacturing sector has only a handful or two of players and BW Technologies is one of the strongest ones; it needs an expert to know, not just a look through the website. Again... I think the article was judged too quickly, before I had the time to edit it (I am sorry that I dont have the time to write the article only in one go, but I have seen hundreds of one-liner stubs in wikipedia).The only problem that I can see with my article is that is not edited very nicely but I think I have shown my interest to improve. In any case, if you decide to delete the article ... let it be, but I think that the reason will not be that the article is a 'vanity page' (as I think you call it) but rather that it was quickly judged. --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiou_Xu_2193.html" title="User:Haiou Xu">Haiou Xu</a> 22:21, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. How about writing/extending one on water purification, even water purification in Britain? THose are both encyclopedic topics. THis is not. That view, and the inevitable deletion, say nothing at all about the company or the author, just about what is an encyclopeadia. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 22:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Comments like 'Speedy delete' and 'inevitable deletion' demonstrate the reasons for feeling victim of an 'intimidation strategy'. Wikipedia is not a battleground. In wikipedia decisions should be made though discusion. There must be a neutral point of view, not personal attacks. The author may write in 'water purification' or about 'water purification in Britain' in the future if he is not too scared to do so. And in any case, wikipedia accepts articles about companies, which should not be judged by whom is the author. Any encyclopedia includes companies, and in wikipedia the notability of the company should be jugded by how nmany people are interested in it. Maybe at the and ot the day I must chalk this up, as <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> adviced, and accept the inevitable deletion since in wikipedia, at the end of the day, decisions are are predecided. --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiou_Xu_2193.html" title="User:Haiou Xu">Haiou Xu</a> 23:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think you understand what Sandstein is saying. This process is not a personal attack against you - it deals with specific requirements for articles that are not met in this one. Yes, there are some corporations listed here, but they all meet the requirements of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> while the company referred to in this article does not.

<li><b>week keep</b>&#160;: The problem I see is that this only has one source the company web page. Get some 3rd party quotes or facts. ie.: notability... (ex.: make filters for carnaval cruises etc... or sell to Walmart.) blah balh.... dunno just making this up. Perhaps then we'll be looking at getting some real keep votes. Sadly, wikipedia may seem like it's based on notability but really it's all about having the right sources and enought. Good nomination but I'd actually give this one a chance to develop, hopefully someone will be able to find some sources and facts. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 04:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>High level bureaucrat + high sensitivity department + high level sex offense = more than notable enough by Wikipedia's excessively weak standards.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Premature nomination; whether a newsworthy item is encyclopedic can only be judged in retrospect, and, as always, we should err on the side of keeping, as there's much less complication and bureaucracy involved in renominating an article for deletion than in undeleting it at Deletion Review. Also, from a purely practical standpoint, there's much, much more value to our readers if we have an article for this highly newsworthy topic on Wikipedia, and then provide a link to WikiNews here, rather than having a soft redirect or something confusing like that. Also, WikiNews and Wikipedia overlap in many places; there are some things on WikiNews that shouldn't be on Wikipedia, and lots of things on Wikipedia that don't belong on WikiNews, but something being important for one does not, in itself, make it off-limits for the other. Almost all articles on criminals on Wikipedia wouldn't have existed before the crime; it's just a statistical fact that more (otherwise) non-noteworthy people commit noteworthy crimes than noteworthy people commit crimes (that would have been noteworthy enough even if they themselves weren't). Rushing to judge this article as only a temporary, brief newsworthy item is both hasty and forces Wikipedia to express an original-research POV: that this news entry, unlike many others on Wikipedia currently, is only a passing, transient article of minimal interest. We aren't forced to make such a judgment call, so I don't see why we should go out of our way to do so and risk inconveniencing hundreds of users who, like myself, randomly looked this up on Wikipedia to get the scoop after seeing dozens of references to it in all sorts of noteworthy media. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:13, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

CBCs have jurisdiction over ca. 50,000 Bahais each (5m/100), and have significant power. e.g. investigating covenant-breakers, recommending people for dısenrollment etc. The CBCs is also a stepping stone to the UHJ - and hence important to understand the workings of the Bahai admınıstration. Bahai loyalists want to delete because they want to play down the role of individuals in the BA - for predomınantly theologıcal reasons. I say 'not sure' because I don't know now whether they meet the criteria for inclusion as can be seen with a google test. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 13:33, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just to add to the above comment, I originally had a list of all present and past CBCs in the article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Counsellors_a1f3.html" title="Continental Counsellors">Continental Counsellors</a> but I now realise this has been removed. I would like to have this list reinstated for the same reasons as above. I would be happy with a compromise to remove the individual articles on CBCs if the list of names is re-inserted into the main article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 14:34, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Non-notable - forthcoming thesis citations for contribution to the production of original research; external 'spin-off' cake clubs currently nascent</li>
<li>vanity bait - no biographies of members created as sign of good faith</li>
<li>encyclopedic - wikipedia benefits from a broad, rounded and exhaustive view of the world. Wikipedia would be the premier source of reference for readers of the above mentioned citations (Britannica rejected a similar article)</li>
<li>The article is neutral, verifiable and original as stipulated: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion</a> -- Gazurtoids 11:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for the response. However, I should point out that Wikipedia is not in the habit of posting original research of any sort. While the publications <i>may eventually</i> be individually notable, we are discussing the notability of Cake club and not those later publications. Spin-off cake clubs might eventually be notable as well, but the article can be recreated if the phenomenon gains widespread traction or significant press coverage. The "vanity bait" comment may have been a bit snarky, but it's true that many names have been included as red links. This is typically viewed as an invitation to create articles about the subjects. Finally, while your article is neutral in tone, that doesn't make it encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 21:38, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dude, it may be that you feel Wikipedia is <i>very important</i> and the doings of its community are exciting, but the world largely ignores the latter and doesn't pay much mind to how the former gets made. Daniel Brandt is "notable" to people active in the project space but not to the outside world. Why not give the guy what he wants? Other articles have been censored on less ground.

<li>But they <i>don't</i> permanently lock anything; those office-action locks are temporary, and the "controversial info" might also only be temporarily deleted; it can usually return if it's meticulously sourced. Partisans against the article's subject usually still don't like it, since much of their critical info has to stay out because it doesn't have a reliable source (blogs and Usenet generally don't count), but it doesn't end up deleted altogether, locked permanently, or a total whitewash in favor of the article's subject either. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 04:59, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The question was whether he has the power and the answer is yes. Front Office locks are the power. How they choose to use it to protect Wikimedia Foundation is up to them. It is a smart thing to do because societies laws are different than the rules on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:10, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The laws are indeed different but as wikipedia clearly isn't breaking the laws of the United States it would be really silly to pretend otherwise. I don't believe Jimbo has the power to permanently lock this article without bringing wikipedia into such a state of uncredibility that the project would rapidly collapse as that isn't how wikipedia works and to imagine Jimbo is some super-dictator with the power to go against consensu is misplaced, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 05:16, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be against consensus. Certainly, and this goes to the group dynamics of Wikipedia, if Jimbo put a vote up for delete, he would get enough support. Also, Wikipedia is not a democracy. The warning at the top clearly states that this really isn't a vote. Daniel Brandt's user page was deleted outright because he cited the new Florida law and editors assessed that as a violation of internal wikipedia policy. Rather than just remove the threat and leave his requests, his page was completely deleted. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 16:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> How easy do you guys forget that Daniel Brandt saved all of Wikipedia's necks by identifying <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_c5c1.html" title="Brian Chase">Brian Chase</a> as the hoaxer? If it had not been for Brandt, Wikipedia would have been in worse conditions and its credibility would have been destroyed forever, not that it isn't already seriously damaged, due to the Seigenthaler controversy. Wikipedia has a debt to owe to Brandt, whether they like it or not, and thus Wikipedia must fulfil the terms of Quid Pro Quo. Brandt saves Wikipedia from further embarassment in the Seigenthaler scandal, and Wikipedia therefore deletes his article <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_777_9412.html" title="User:Jonathan 777">Jonathan 777</a> 10:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>How did invading the privacy of a prankster whose false edit had already been reverted and deleted from the history save anybody's necks? And since when is Wikipedia edited on the basis of "Quid Pro Quo" or personal debts? How is the site's credibility changed, one way or the other, by finding out who was responsible for the prank? Anyway, Wikipedia's popularity (e.g., as measured by Alexa) went up through the roof when the scandal, and its resulting publicity, hit, so it hardly seems to have been harmful to it (not that I favor intentionally starting hoaxes like that to promote this site, no sirree!) <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 11:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not true, Chase being uncovered didn't help wikipedia at all, the problem was identifying his vandalism not identifying him, arguably his identification didn't do wikipedia a favour though Dan is 100% right that wikipedia's popularity went through the roof due to that incident, eg becoming mainstream in the UK press for the first time ever, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wow. Both of those posts are amazing. Brandt is not the bad guy for identifying the libelous editor. Libel is the enemy of wikipedia. Anonymity should not survive libel.

<li>You are certainly entitled to your interpretataion as well. Certainly he was frustrated with the law. I think his use of an attorney with Bell South and his obvious research into the law meant he was preparing to challenge it. He may still be lobbying for changes to the law based on his experience. I think his contact with Chase (made possible by Brandt) smoothed a lot of ruffled feathers.

What Brandt is NOT notable for however is, for example, to quote: "Brandt was born in China to missionary parents." nor is he notable for having his "student deferment classification was withdrawn by the local Selective Service System in December 1968 due to his public non-cooperation with his draft board, Brandt was convicted of failure to report for a pre-induction physical exam and refusal to submit to induction. Brandt appealed and his convictions were reversed on the grounds that he was entitled to student status as an undergraduate at USC (see U.S. v. Brandt, 435 F.2d 324 (9th Cir. 1970))." No, the consumers are interested in only 5 things about Brandt: Google Watch, Wikipedia Watch, NameBase, Yahoo Watch, and Wikipedia Review. That's it.

<li>Under what moral authority does wikipedia decide who is notable and who is not? For newspapers, I know who to hold accountable for errors, slander, etc. If I don't want my name in the phonebook anymore, I know where to go even if it was once in the phonebook. But Wikipedia is a vast anonymous, permanent archive of information about, in this case, people. Long after the links have died and the newspapers been destroyed, the claims and words (right or wrong) of wikipedia will live on. Wikipedia has no inherent right to be "gap free" in it's information. It has Great Goals, but that has to be juxtaposed against it's potential for Great Harm. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:48, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Morality doesn't (or at least, shouldn't) enter into the consideration.

<dd>It certainly does come into play. If I found your name in www.whitepages.com along with your address, Wikipedia would not let me use it's space to publish it.

<li>Moral tiebreakers don't enter into the equation for the example you cite, because it's already disqualified on other grounds before the question even arises. If you found my name in www.whitepages.com, you wouldn't be permitted to add it to Wikipedia because www.whitepages.com is not a legitimate source, as defined by policies and guidelines. The only circumstances under which my address would appear in a legitimate source would involve some sort of noteworthy event happening at my home, and thus receiving coverage in mainstream media sources. Situations of this type have already been successfully resolved on numerous occasions, such as the removal of the alleged "real names" of several porn stars (which were not adequately sourced).</li>
<li>The doctrine of notability, while not formally defined within policy, is a reasonable and logical extension of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (in that things which are not notable are not covered by legitimate sources), as well as <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> (in that things which are not notable are only known to those who are directly involved with them, who are strongly discouraged from creating articles on those topics). Thus, the encyclopedia's resistance to articles about non-notable subjects is eminently reasonable, rooted within policies and guidelines. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 06:26, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you misunderstand. I could get plenty of evidence from government documents alone that would not be allowed to be posted on wikipedia because of it's privacy policies. The title on your home is a public document. Brandt, on his own Website, lists public domain information about Wikipedia editors. Even outside of Wikipedia, wikipedians apply internal website rules and he was banned under <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia policy: No personal attacks</a></i> for this external behavior. And to counter this, there are other Notability requirements beyond being in the newspaper that are applied (somewhat haphazardly). Case in point: <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Doyle_2de1.html" title="Brian Doyle">Brian Doyle</a> and Lori Weiner. Both worked in politics. Both committed crimes (or one is accused and one has plead guilty). One crime was related to their political job and one crime was done outside the scope of their job. One is a serious felony one is misdemeanor. All of these come in to play when determining notability for an encyclopedia. Both of those people are WAY more notable than Daniel Brandt. But one will likely be deleted and one will likely be kept. There is no reason or standard to choose one over the other but the community will. There is no oversight to remove or check systematic biases in the community. Systematic biases don't harm science or dead people. They DO have the potential to harm living people by invading privacy, libelling them real time and putting them in harms way. I find it ironic that Wikipedia has a policy about revealing personal information about editors (public domain or not) but a "no holds barred" attitude on whatever "notability" standard it creates. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tbeatty suggests that there is information in the public domain that would not be allowed on Wikipedia solely in view of our privacy policies; this is, to my knowledge and in view of my interpretations of Wikipedia policies, plainly incorrect. The revelant concerns we would confront in deciding whether "public domain" knowledge should be included in a Wikipedia article would be whether the information, if entered, would represent original research (where we would, I think, apply that appellative--the nebulous quality of which I readily recognize--to mean that information one posts on Wikipedia otherwise unpublished from a city's property tax record site would be original research, whilst information featured in a newspaper article about a given person's property tax records would not be original research; upon the latter determination, and in view of the publication of information elsewhere, a link could then be given to the primary source [i.e., here, the city's property tax record site]) and whether the information would be relevant to the article and of sufficient notability to be encyclopedic (as the privacy policy explains, even accurate phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc., are not considered encyclopedic; I don't believe the policy is framed as it is exclusively in view of privacy concerns, but also in view of notability/encyclopedic quality concerns). Notwithstanding Tbeatty's reasoned points apropos of the difficulties of creating a notability calculus by which to judge articles categorically, it is plainly wrong to say that there is public domain information that Wikipedia would not post out of privacy concerns; never would privacy concerns exclusively militate sufficiently against the inclusion of information to lead to the outcome of our removing/not adding information (of course, some users may feel different morally--I surely do not--but their views do not seem represented in the policies or guidelines of Wikipedia; in any case, there is surely no legal claim one can essay against another's posting publicly-available information about the former, so on those narrow grounds--which aren't exactly "on all fours" with the Brandt case but are with the hypos of which Tbeatty and I write--there can be made no legitimate objection to the inclusion of public information). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What I saying there is a <i>notability standard</i> that is arbitrary. The standard isn't whether there is public domain documents about a person. The standard isn't that the person was in the newspaper. The person who commented above me seemed to be saying that notability means there is a public record and therefore all people who have a public record could be notable. Certainly if we found original conviction documents of a notable person, that original document would be referenced. But what is a notable person? It is extremely arbitrary. I would argue Lauren B. Weiner is way more notable than Daniel Brandt. But Brandt pissed off a lot of Wikipedians so he is more notable to Wikipedians. That's an interesting standard but not exactly encyclopedic. It seems to me that it is a community vanity of sorts. As for privacy, if I posted information about "jaheigel" schooling, city of residence, POB, parental heritage, etc on my user page, it's a privacy violation and I would get banned. But if I create an article based on some dubious clame of notability, all that information would be up for a vote and editing. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 22:56, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>FWIW, I do provide all of that information on request and divulge most of it on my disorganized userpage. Irrespective of that, though, I have conceded that the "notability standards" are arbitrary, but I think it should be said that "notability", as I understand it, doesn't mean "popular notability", but, rather, "encyclopedic notability". Even as Lauren Weiner is better known to the public writ large at this time, Daniel Brandt is better known to &lt;elitism&gt; well-educated people &lt;/elitism&gt; and to the public writ large in general (that is, he surely will be, over time, a more prominent personnage). I certainly don't think that notability stems from one's having publicly-accessible records, but I do think one's having 72,000 Ghits (cf., my having 173, of which more than half are about others who share my name) creates a presumption of notability, especially when the several on the first three pages are articles about the Brandt that feature interviews or quotes. Fundamentally, the question to be resolved, I think, is whether, absent Brandt's dealings with Wikipedia, anyone would still be suggesting that he's notable. I am sure that some who find him notable now do so largely or only in view of his involvement with Wikipedia (which isn't altogether wrong; I simply think that our project is still esoteric enough that his involvement with us isn't encylcopedic [as against, for example, his involvement with Google]), but I think the majority of us would find him notable irrespective of his Wikipedia involvement, toward which proposition I adduce the many failed AfD nominations for articles the subjects of which are surely "less notable" than Brandt my any standard, even one that he might create. Were you to create a page about me giving my city of residence, schooling, parentage, and POB, you almost surely would not be banned; we regularly have users create pages about individuals whom they think to be notable, and those users, where they are not acting in bad faith or attempting to damage the encyclopedia, are not banned. It is true that there is no singular standard by which to adjudge notability, such that not every Wikipedian would have the same reasons for thinking Brandt to be notable and me not to be notable, but, of course, there's some beauty in that; each Wikipedian has somewhat different views, the conflation of which becomes policy, with the idea that "the more voices, the better". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having looked up Ms. Weiner, I think your comparison is something of a stretch. Mr. Doyle's job arguably made him notable even before his arrest, while Ms. Weiner's almost certainly didn't, and Mr. Doyle committed a much more serious crime (and as a result received substantially more media coverage). I'm not upset that we have an article on Ms. Weiner, but I wouldn't be upset if her article got deleted or merged back to the scandal, either. It's pretty borderline, in my opinion. Once the community arrives at an "arbitrary" consensus, we'll go forward with that. Arbitrary doesn't always equal bad, y'know; pretty much every organized system is made up of a succession of arbitrary decisions, once you look at a certain level of granularity. If it really bothers you that much in this case, though, you could always start a centralized discussion on notability standards for activists, cranks and media gadflies, to apply to people like Mr. Brandt in the future (serving a function analagous to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for musicians). As to what you're saying about Mr. Brandt himself, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. I think that if he'd received the same amount of media coverage for criticizing something else (Flickr, say), he'd still have an article. The article is probably more highly developed now than it'd be if he'd criticized something with which the user base was less familiar, but that doesn't really matter, since on a long enough time frame the improvement by successive approximations will essentially even out. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 23:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> due to inability to maintain any sense of neutrality with the article. Its existed for a long time now, and its never been even vaguely neutral. Whilst its true that he might be vaguely notable, he wouldn't exist in any paper encyclopaedia, and hence he's not so notable to be an automatic inclusion. This article is meta. It talks about Wikipedia Watch, a criticism of when Brandt used Wikipedia, and it talks about Wikipedia's responses. How can you have such an article when the people writing it all come from such an obviously biased place? At best, someone else should write this, and then we should copy that over to Wikipedia. But seriously, why do we include an article that the subject does not want, when what we are saying is wholly negative? The article itself must be verging on a personal attack and possibly even constitute libel. It is wrong on so many levels to even consider this article. <a href="../../../5/9/2E/User%7E59.167.131.8.html" title="User:59.167.131.8">59.167.131.8</a> 06:42, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: You know something's wrong with the world when you have six nested lists. Also, what I meant is that by a prior concensus which led to an implementation of a policy, there is no obligation placed upon any individual user to censor or Bowdlerize an article, and that the only obligation that the Wikipedia organization has as a whole is to the State of Florida (and even that is theoretical, as there is no legislation that directly affects Wikipedia that I know of, and we have never been taken to court!). - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 07:42, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

I am unable to understand how "virtually the same moment" and an edit conflict resulting in a simple cut and paste could account for this single individual instance, <b>but</b>... if it did then a more reasonable response would be along the lines of "I'm very sorry I inadvertently copied your previous omment over your current one". That is not the meaning offered as explanation. Out of band, would anyone care to join in an RFC that Ombudsman be enjoined from ever editing any comment by anyone else again?

I repeat, that <b>in several other afd discussions, Ombudsman has altered comments by other editors.</b> This is not regarded as generally acceptable.

<dd>Midgley, you throw around accusations of policies and rules but have nothing to back up these accusations with. Autism/incidence was written just around the time this article was nominated for deletion, and I don't think it's a coincidence - you cited it yourself in the opening hours of this nomination. There is absolutely nothing to substantiate your assertion that I "own" all of autism. I too have expressed reservations about the title of the article, but the remedy for that is that we rename/move it. The article you want to delete is full of source citations, goes to great lengths to outline the controversy, and presents both sides of the controversy fairly.

<dd>It is accepted that autism is at epidemic levels in the USA [Increases in Identified Cases of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Trudy Steuernagel, Kent State University JOURNAL OF DISABILITY POLICY STUDIES VOL. 16/NO. 3/2005 138].</dd>
<dd>The Steuernagel paper very early on quotes the AAP "there is no disputing the fact that autism now affects a significant number of people in this country (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001)" and refers throughout to autism as epidemic. The paper commences by quoting Time magazine on the issue because it has become so important with so many Americans now seriously affected. Also early on the paper states "The purpose of this article is to make a contribution to the development of policies to address the autism epidemic". This paper is all the more significant because it is sceptical of the autism/vaccines/mercury neuro-toxin connection.</dd>
<dd>This paper says in no uncertain terms "Autism is NOW a big problem. What the hell are we going to do about it?" and sets out to address the policy to be adopted to what it refers throughout as the autism epidemic. And it does so whilst acknowledging what is becoming a rear-guard fight to downplay the problem by the medical profession (the seeming overseers of the epidemic, if, as many believe, it is caused by vaccinations). It is also scholarly, well-read and evidence-based, quoting evidence and other authority for the proposition.</dd>

Gurney, PhD - Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland Divisions of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota - PEDIATRICS Vol. 115 No. 3 March 2005, pp. e277-e282 (doi:10.1542/peds.2004-1958.)</dd>

<dd>The authors say:-
<dl>
<dd><i>The drastic increase in the prevalence of the autism classification presents a major challenge to the nation’s special education service systems and is one that has already triggered responses from federal, state, and local agencies.32</i></dd>
<dd>"It has been suggested that increased substitution of autism for mental retardation3 and/or language impairment27 diagnoses might be accounting for some of the apparent increase in autism prevalence. If this substitution occurred with special education classifications, then increases in autism prevalence with subsequent birth cohorts would be accompanied by decreases in mental retardation and/or speech/language impairment prevalences. As shown in Fig 1, mental retardation prevalence shows no birth cohort effect; in other words, there is no suggestion that prevalence is decreasing (or increasing) among younger cohorts. The cohort curves overlap to reproduce faithfully the shape of a cross-sectional curve of prevalence according to age (curve not shown). Trends with age are as expected for mental retardation, with prevalence increasing steadily through age 8 and then leveling."</dd>
<dd>"Similarly, the curves for speech/language impairment indicate no cohort differences. The patterns with respect to age are as expected. At young ages, speech/language impairment prevalence is many times higher than that of autism; however, prevalence decreases dramatically from age 7 to age 17 years. The decrease in the prevalence of speech and language impairment is likely a result of children losing this disability category classification, which is expected to occur to a greater extent for this category (ie, in cases of articulation disorders and dysfluency that resolve with time), compared with the other categories."</dd>
<dd>"The curves for other health impairments are notable for 2 reasons, ie, because this is the disability classification that typically includes children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and because there are strong cohort differences. Prevalence is higher for successive birth cohorts, with the greatest annual increases occurring between the 1980 and 1984 birth cohorts. Within cohorts, the prevalence of other health impairments increases sharply through 11 years of age, with the rate of increase gradually decreasing in successive years."</dd>

<dd>The issue here is nothing to do with the autism epidemic. This is the allopathic medical lobby on Wikipedia trying yet again to delete anything that shows how their version of medicine is causing great harm. Keep on doing this because it demonstrates very clearly that you cannot answer the arguments nor can you deal with the facts and issues. The end result is that you do your best to suppress the facts and here the usual people can be seen working hard at it on Wikipedia. People are turning off allopathic medicine in droves. Trust is earnt and here distrust is being earnt instead. I note the usual individuals appear here as always <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a>, <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>, <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> etc. etc. And if <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> continues to behave as he has elsewhere no doubt the usual admins will bail him out again.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. For the avoidance of doubt let me say that at least until this evening* there was not one word in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28Incidence%29_a6eb.html" title="Autism (Incidence)">Autism (Incidence)</a> which did not get there by being left behind when the rest of a copy of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">Autism epidemic</a> was deleted from around it. The description of the risen incidence of autism as <i>epidemic</i> (adj.) has been in there from the start, and is as much as you need really, why take a page over a word when you can put numbers in instead and let people know what the incidecen is? Even if the deletion was over-enthusiastic (and I think the reverse is true, that I was too conservative in not throwing out stuff that should be, fortunately collaboration has followed and improved it) there is nothing actually different to merge in. It is in fact a fork, although it is the sort of fork that involves picking out one topic from a collection in an article, and discarding all the others in order to leave a focussed and leaner article. <b>Replacing</b> the epidemic article with the article on incidence - viewed as a candidate rewrite for it from the start along with its renaming - has always been a perfectly good possibility, if people want to do it, but they are two separate articles at present, this is an rfa on one of them on its merits, and we may well get the cahnce to debate an rfa on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_%28Incidence%29_a6eb.html" title="Autism (Incidence)">Autism (Incidence)</a> any moment now. I've been tempted to copy a few remarks out of here and put it up for rfa myself, but instead I think I'll propose it for <a href="../../../g/a/_/GA_cd95.html" title="GA">GA</a>.

<li><b>Rename</b> &amp; some rewording/restyling &amp; POV balance (not keep as is, nor delete). - current article contains arguments cited for &amp; against possible increasing rates and that evidence inconlusive re cause (e.g. Russia banned thimerosal yet still increase). However I don't think the majority accept an "epidemic" either in terms of absolute incidence or of rate increasing numbers. NPOV requires fair inclusion of the minority, but that does not have to take precidence over the majority. As in wikipedia's own article <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">Epidemic</a>'s definition: <i>a disease that appears as new cases in a given human population, during a given period, at a rate that substantially exceeds what is "expected",</i> and notes: <i>Defining an epidemic can be subjective, depending in part on what is "expected"</i>. So stating that autism is an epidemic is "subjective" (1 in 86, to 1 in 150, figures seem quoted in article, which at approx 1% seems to me significant, but not an epidemic). No one can dispute that autism has an incidence, nor that this incidence has increased since autism was first described. <b>Autism incidence</b> is perhaps a little bland and <b>Autism incidence debate</b> is perhaps more literally what the article covers; i.e. both measured rates and discussion/disagreements over their interpretation &amp; significance. I think a merger into <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> would be quite wrong - that article is already quite long and is better as an introduction to the topic and related issues. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> quite rightly already directs to sub-topics that expand on individual themes, e.g. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">Autistic spectrum</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_therapies.html" title="Autism therapies">Autism therapies</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_community.html" title="Autistic community">Autistic community</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_savant.html" title="Autistic savant">autistic savant</a>, so why not to incidence&#160;? Issues of incidence are critically important, especially with how concerns have been raised over whether the introducion of some vaccines is partially contributable. The topic is too large to include in one Autism article and has too much interesting info on rates in different countries. However all that information by area makes for a very long list - would reformating some of the smaller entries into a table (or least a bulleted list) rather than the padded paragraphs separated by sub-section headers, neaten the article&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:05, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly rename, or add redirect, for Epidemiology of Autism, per JFW. This article can help keep a massive load of speculation off of the autism article and yet allow exploration and development of the reasoning and data, pro &amp; con, about various possible causes of the "explosion". Clearly "a work in progress," I think this AfD topic is of large public concern and should be kept. Generally, I would prefer a more concise and focused main Autism article anyway by having this separate article. I also view the alternate late starter, Autism (incidence), coupled with an AfD request, an ugly form of POV pushing. --66.58.130.26 13:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But of _what_ point of view? I can see why the epidemic article and various others have languished, if any attempt to produce a large improvement receives such hostility.

Need dialogue without the total breakdowns that have continuely occurred over outside doubts about the compelling net benefits of vaccines &amp; public policy, as some previous editors here will recall. In Autism (Incidence), the hypotheses of causation (list of causation topics still incomlete?) are deleted en masse - I think they should remain, be discussed and edited at length until some kind of NPOV construction and agreement is reached, even if the article looks bimodal/bipolar in some places ("agreed disagreement") Even if the autism count is a combination of artifacts and fads.

<p><b>Additional comment</b> On reflection, I see possible merit to two specialty articles under a stable Autism parent article, one article a hard quantitative and definitions article (epidemiology or incidence of...), the other article more directly addressing individually listed social concerns, hypotheses, speculation, politics and policy trends ("epidemic"). The definitional effects of naming are important here - epidemiology and incidence don't quite have the scope right for "epidemic". One recurring point is that Autism (incidence) is consistent with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AContent_forking" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AContent_forking" rel="nofollow">POV fork</a>. There may be significant utility in two complementary (ahem, even if antagonistic) articles: one a "straight" discussion of definitions and epidemiogy/incidence of autism, the other "epidemic" article including the implications and hypotheses of causation - sliced, diced and utterly minced.</p>
<p>I think this latter "epidemic" article is important beyond the ever lurking (and clashing) medical controversies and public policy questions. Of course the "epidemic" part presumes a real nonzero rise in incidence but the subject is also a reflection of the unanswered questions and doubts in the public mind. Rather than simple stern denials or silence, cumulative address of questions/fears properly deposed, analyzed, weighted, cited and balanced is a more informative, useful way. On an individual level, there are a lot of issues that ordinary citizens/parents want to see discussed in real time with some detail. They are not looking for mere repetition of what government position has been adopted, often with varying degrees of ex cathedra stmts, "official science" or finally some accurately detailed article (oops) after multigenerational studies, if ever. I think the technical, actuarial article would suffer less dilution and edit warring while the ongoing speculative subtopics could be better addressed, individually with more reassuring detail, on a cumulative basis in an "epidemic" article. Can this be abused? Yes, of course - the forking issue. But it actually addresses two overlapping audiences with much different objectives and might avoid some of the vitriolic confrontation in a struggle for priority from different perspectives. "Is too" - "is not" arguments often involve multiple factors and (as yet) unknown facts/data that turn out differently anyway (i.e. 5% is the economic rise of superior programmers rather than 5% vaccine damage, vice versa or both, with 20% - 80% definitional and xx% "we still simply don't know"). <b>Perhaps evolving two articles</b> is a better way forward. After my initial pique with Adrian, I may be validating his article, too. <b>Epidemiology of autism</b> for solid definitional and data issues; <b>autism "epidemic"</b>, hopefully better renamed, to track hypotheses, fears, speculation, trends, policies as the story evolves.

<dd>I have to disagree to this idea. This would be a one-sided POV fork in that case. If people allow a speculative article of an autism epidemic, which has been described as OR, it also must allow the existence of The Neanderthal theory of the autism spectrum. The latter article enjoys just as much support among autistics as the vaccine / toxin / epidemic view enjoys among parents. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Song isn't notable enough to warrant its own article; in the U.S. at least, it did not reach the Top 40.

<li><b>Delete</b>. For the record, I'm the bloke who created the article for this song's parent album, <i><a href="../../../e/x/i/Exile_%28Gary_Numan_album%29_d59b.html" title="Exile (Gary Numan album)">Exile</a></i>, as well as many other Numan releases. This article was already in existence when I did the album but I didn't see a reason to put it up for deletion then because it appeared to have some interesting info even though I don't think most commentators would see it as a notable song in the Numan catalogue. Yes there's an extended version but the whole album came out in an extended version so no big deal there; also it was never a single. More importantly, having researched a bit further, it appears that practically all the content in the song article is flawed or redundant. <i>Angel Wars: Guardian Force</i> seems to have been released in 2004, seven years after Numan wrote his song so if that's the case then obviously he wasn't 'taking off' the movie with the song! The rest of the stuff on his 'vocal atheism' is covered extensively in the <i>Exile</i> article and elsewhere, including his Wikipedia <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Numan_1986.html" title="Gary Numan">bio</a>.
