<li><b>Comment</b> Fran's was a chain of 24 hour diners, something like the Golden Griddle. Used to have about half a dozen restarants around town. I remember at least Yonge &amp; College, Yonge &amp; St. Clair, and Yonge &amp; Eglinton branches. Last time I was in Toronto only the Yonge &amp; College remained. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmason888_4d94.html" title="User:Jmason888">Jamie</a> 03:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>According to its <a href="http://www.fransrestaurant.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.fransrestaurant.com/" rel="nofollow">official site</a>, they have two restaurants. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 06:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A new one opened within the past year-to-year-and-a-half at Shuter and Victoria. "Upscale Fran's" was a running gag between me and a couple of friends for a while. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Fran's is a very well-known institution in Toronto, and is a piece of local history. It went bankrupt a few years back, and was reduced to one location. When a second location opened last year at Shuter and Victoria, it received a fair amount of media coverage. The chain has a lot of local notariety -- people either love it or hate it. The article right now is just a stub, but could be made into something quite worthy. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:36, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<p>I just noticed that the external link in the article (which links to a piece in Eye, a local paper) even says the following in the first line: "For 52 years, Fran's Restaurants has been a Toronto landmark, as much a part of the city as the Leafs or High Park." <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>When I was nine years old, growing up hundreds of miles from Toronto, I already knew what Fran's was. It <i>really</i> is <i>that</i> famous. To have <i>lived</i> in Toronto without ever having heard of Fran's, when I'd heard of Fran's before I'd ever been here for a <i>day</i>, frankly suggests that someone — either the nominator or me — is living in an alternate version of reality that doesn't even faintly resemble the one most people live in. I'm not entirely sure that things of purely local notability <i>really</i> deserve articles, but when an article is nominated for deletion based on reasoning that's so wildly out of accordance with my own understanding of things, a <b>keep</b> vote is really the only thing I <i>can</i> do. If I'm the one living in a weird mirror universe, so be it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:19, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To suggest that its as much of a cultural institution as the Leafs are is pure patent madness - doing a quick survey of a half a dozen friends who all lived in Toronto for 15+ years, not a single one had heard of it. I just made the natural assumption upon seeing a random looking article about a restaurant I've never heard of that's in the city I grew up in and live in - that it was a vaniety article placed there by someone affliated with the restaurant. With a number of Torontonians (and non-Torontonians!) having at least heard of it, it may be worthy of an article, though it'd be nice if the article somehow distinguished its importance compared to say, Hollinger's or Ted's Restaurant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilyD_17e3.html" title="User talk:WilyD">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilyD_d35f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilyD">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 16:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the comments that Torontonians haven't heard of it to be suspect. <s>Keep in mind that these comments come from an anonymous editor, and the nominator, who seems to be new to Wikipedia.</s> Fran's is a Toronto institution, and anyone who has lived here for any period of time will know of it. New arrivals may not know it because the chain was shrunk down to one location recently. It is the sort of place that I take out of town visitors to for a diner breakfast because of its heritage. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I beg to disagree here. The fact that someone is new to Wikipedia does not mean we shouldn't trust this person's capacity to know what is and what isn't notable.

<li>I'll withdraw that comment on the basis of WilyD's comment below, which show that the nomination was made in good faith. I don't think that it is unfair to point out that a nominator is new because a new user may not be familiar with the deletion process. Furthermore, new users may, in some cases, be sockpuppets. In WilyD's case, however, I am sure that s/he is legitimate. I will point out, however, that notability has <b>not</b> been accepted by the Wikipedia community as grounds for deletion, no matter how much people keep using it as their reason for deleting an article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 17:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but I haven't found any mention to notability on the first article you indicated. Could you please point it to me? Thanks for providing the link to the poll, I wasn't aware one had ever ocurred. However, Wales' opinion, with all due respect to you, is a) irrelevant, since I don't work for him and neither follow his guidance in any way; b) not suited to this occasion, since he talks about fame and importance, and we were talking about notability, which is a diferent concept. What is being discussed here is not wether Fran's Cafe is famous (ie, lots of people from Toronto have heard about it), but wether it is notable (ie, it stands out from all the other hundreds or thousands of Toronto restaurants). I don't mean to be rude, Ground Zero, and I hope you don't take offense on what I have said. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 22:56, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I guess that I should have been clearer: you didn't find any reference to notability at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> because there is none. Another way of putting it is that lack of notability is not an accepted grounds for deletion -- it's not in the policy on deletion. The Jimbo Wales thing was for interest only, and not intended to be for guidance. "Fame and importance" and "notability" were being used interchangably in that debate, I think. I don't see how you've been rude, and I haven't taken offence. If you'd be so kind as to point out how you've been rude, however, I'd gladly taken offence since I am so accommodating.&#160;;-) Regards, <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 23:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the unsigned comment was my bad Ground Zero. It is true that I'm fairly new to Wikipedia, having joined only a couple of months ago. This is, in fact, my first nomination under AfD. It certainly seems fairly certain the consensus will be to keep, and I'm not particularly opposed to it, given the large number of opinions that it has significance. However, multiple users making the assertion that one can't live in Toronto and be unaware of the place is awfully strange - maybe it's a generational thing? I'm 23, and no one I asked about it was older than about 27 - mayhaps I should ask my grandparents if they've ever heard of it? If it historically was a somewhat big deal, but is just faded into obscurity, that would make more sense to me - but to claim is as much of a landmark as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_bc61.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> or the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_%28baseball%29_9728.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs (baseball)">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> is pretty absrud - I'd even find it tough to believe it has as much cultural significance as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Lynx_5f88.html" title="Toronto Lynx">Toronto Lynx</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You could ask your parents, too. They should know. If they don't, they should get out more. The Wikipedia article makes no claim to Fran's being on a par with either Leafs. The <i>Eye</i> article calls it a landmark, and "as much as part of Toronto as the Leafs". This may be an exaggeration, but I'm not here to defend <i>Eye</i>. The <i>Eye</i> reference serves only to support the claim in the Wiki article that Fran's is a "historic restaurant chain". <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 17:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seeing as how Fran's has been at Yonge + College for ages, just a block or two away from Maple Leaf Gardens, hockey fans likely filled up Fran's before and after the Leafs games for decades. As much of an exaggeration as the <i>Eye</i> reference might be, I am sure that there are thousands of older hockey fans in this city who think of Fran's when they think of the Leafs. So, the reference might not be as absurd as some people are suggesting. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mild Keep</b> I have been going to restaurants in Toronto for upwards of 30 years, and I have not been to Fran's, but I do know of it, however it's not famous to suburbanites. I've been here so long, most of the great restaurants of Fran's age have all closed down leaving me in the lurch. I would guess downtowners would make more of a historical fuss about it. I've had to move on to the newer restaurants, very few of which are here on Wikipedia.

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i> I hate Fran's, but it's definitely a cultural landmark. Speaking of the Maple Leafs, my memories of Fran's are intertwined with Hockey. My dad used to take me to Frans for a milkshake after taking me to a Leafs game at Maple Leaf Gardens. It was open 24 hours at the time, and I think in many ways, Frans was to our parents something similar to what Sneaky Dees or the Green Room are to us. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFade_3c05.html" title="User:Fade">Fade</a> 19:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

From a CBC profile: "Sometime between two and three every morning Gould would go to Fran's, a 24-hour diner a block away from his Toronto apartment, sit in the same booth and order the same meal of scrambled eggs" (source: <a href="http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-68-320-1673/arts_entertainment/glenn_gould/" class="external free" title="http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-68-320-1673/arts_entertainment/glenn_gould/" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-68-320-1673/arts_entertainment/glenn_gould/</a>). Another reason Fran's continues to hold significance for many. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.106.188.79 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.106.188.79_da55.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.106.188.79">contribs</a>).</small></li>
