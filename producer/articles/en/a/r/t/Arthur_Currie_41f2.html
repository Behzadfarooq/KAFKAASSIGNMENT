There, he joined the army militia and over the years prior to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">Great War</a> he rose through the ranks to become his regiment's Commanding Officer.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Currie_41f2.html" title="Edit section: World War I">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h2>
<p>With Garnet Hughes, son of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Militia_and_Defence_%28Canada%29_5a33.html" title="Minister of Militia and Defence (Canada)">Canadian minister of militia</a> <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Hughes_84b6.html" title="Sam Hughes">Sam Hughes</a>, he was sent to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> upon the outbreak of the First World War in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>. He commanded a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">brigade</a> at the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Ypres_86d3.html" title="Second Battle of Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, and by <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> he had been promoted to general, the first Canadian to receive this honour during the war.</p>
<p>Serving under General <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Byng%2C_1st_Viscount_Byng_of_Vimy_1867.html" title="Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy">Julian Byng</a>, Currie was largely responsible for the tactics and careful planning that led to the unexpected triumph by Canadian battalions at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge_31ed.html" title="Battle of Vimy Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> in April, 1917. One of his most useful innovations introduced at this battle was the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creeping_barrage.html" title="Creeping barrage">creeping barrage</a>, which consisted of troops walking just behind an advancing line of shell fire from Canadian and British artillery, shielding soldiers as they approached the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a>. In addition, constant practice and new troop organization in which each platoon member was trained to carry out all platoon responsibilities, briefing of the frontline troops, the use of counter-battery fire measures and constant patrolling of the enemy defences all contributed to the effectiveness of the Canadian Corps at Vimy and for the rest of the War.</p>
<p>Currie and the Canadian Corps were successful again at <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passchendaele.html" title="Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a> (the Third Battle of <a href="../../../y/p/r/Ypres.html" title="Ypres">Ypres</a>) in November, but at the cost of 16,000 men. Currie had accurately predicted these high casualty figures when British General <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Haig%2C_1st_Earl_Haig_ea8a.html" title="Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig">Douglas Haig</a> ordered his troops to attack.</p>
<p>At the Battle of the Canal du Nord in September of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, Currie flatly refused to carry out Haig's orders to attack across a canal and into a fortified German trench. With the support of General Byng, Currie had bridges quickly assembled, and crossed the canal at night, surprising the Germans with an attack in the morning. This proved the effectiveness of Canadian engineers. Currie believed in the specialization of troops and formally organised battalions of combat engineers to move with the troops.</p>
<p>As the war neared its end, the Canadian Corps pressed on towards Germany, strengthening their reputation as one of the most feared and respected military formations of the war during <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%27s_Hundred_Days_8aa1.html" title="Canada's Hundred Days">Canada's Hundred Days</a>, which included the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Amiens_4086.html" title="Battle of Amiens">Battle of Amiens</a> from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>–<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, 1918. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lawrence_Price_ea04.html" title="George Lawrence Price">George Lawrence Price</a>, the last Canadian to die and likely the third last allied soldier to die in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> was under Currie's command at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mons.html" title="Mons">Mons</a>, and was killed by German <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a> fire at 10:58am just before the 11:00am <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_with_Germany_%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29_4a34.html" title="Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)">Armistice</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">November 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>.</p>
<p>Currie was respected by his men as a competent general, who would not waste their lives needlessly. Currie also refused to allow his former friend Garnet Hughes to serve under him, because of what Currie perceived to be incompetence he had witnessed when they fought together at Ypres in 1915. This also did not endear him to Garnet's father, who constantly lobbied for his son's promotion.</p>
<p>Currie, along with General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Monash_4547.html" title="John Monash">John Monash</a> of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, were both civilians prior to the war, who during the War rose to lead their respective armies.</p>

<p>Currie was also involved in a scandal stemming from his time in Victoria just before the war began, in which he allegedly defrauded his regiment of money to buy new uniforms. The information came to light in 1917, however <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Prime_Minister_2bd8.html" title="Canadian Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Laird_Borden_defd.html" title="Robert Laird Borden">Robert Laird Borden</a> did not wish to disgrace a war hero and let the matter drop.</p>

Currie successfully sued the newspaper for libel in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, during a trial held in <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobourg%2C_Ontario_d67d.html" title="Cobourg, Ontario">Cobourg, Ontario</a>.</p>
