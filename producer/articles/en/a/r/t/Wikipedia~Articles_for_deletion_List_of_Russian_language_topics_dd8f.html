<p>The result was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). There are good and valid arguments for deletion here, but arguments have been presented by Mikka among others that we have a number of other lists which bundle together topics related to a particular subject and that the list might be useful for navigation. I find that the people arguing for "keep" have sufficient merit in the arguments that I will call this 12d/9k a no consensus. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wikipedia is not a "Mere collections of internal links, except for disambiguation pages when an article title is ambiguous, and for structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles." This is obviously not a disambiguation page and the list's theme seems to be "things that might mention <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> and if they don't they should." In addition, while the article states that doesn't overlap with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Category%7ERussian_language_911a.html" title="Category:Russian language">category:Russian language</a>, anything that is appropriately linked to Russian could easily go into that category, thus making this article redundant. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 02:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There could be an infinite number of such topics, no basis for a coherent article.

<li><b>Delete</b>, a list is not a indiscriminatory collection of articles. If it lists all Russian language topics, it becomes by definition unmaintainable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This vote is outrageous.
<ul>
<li>This is a list of grammar topics that discuss <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>, not an "indiscriminate collection". You keep <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang.html" title="List of sexual slang">List of sexual slang</a>, yet you delete list of Russian language. Mind-boggling. We have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_basic_archaeology_topics.html" title="List of basic archaeology topics">List of basic archaeology topics</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_topics.html" title="List of mathematics topics">List of mathematics topics</a>, and hundreds of other topical lists.</li>
<li>"plenty of potential for harm" haha very funny. Russian language is going to inflict harm.</li>
<li>This is not supposed to be a "coherent article", this is a list.</li>
<li>And there is no "infinite number" of topics. Grammar books are of fnite size, you know, and perfectly maintainable.</li>
<li>"Combing thru wikipedia" is how such lists are created.</li>
<li>"unnecessary" is personal POV, not an argument.</li>
<li><b>Not</b> superfluous. There are quite a few esoteric topics that are not discussed in the main <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> article. This list helps to keep trak of them.</li>
<li>No cleanup necessary. This is <b>list</b>, and well-defined, too, for God's sake!</li>

<dd>What I find outrageous is your accusation that "unnecessary" is POV while asserting your own POV such as "well-defined" and "no cleanup necessary." Is your POV better than other people's? <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 04:44, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"well-defined", as opposed to "indiscriminate collection" is a fact, not POV: it is list of topics that discuss Russian language. It does not include porn stars, gay rights, pokemon and other popular topics. "no cleanup necessary": if a cleanup is necessary, please explain which exactly. I may be wrong here, but still I don't see why it must be "severe". Are you going to delete 5/7 of entries? In summary, yes, my POV is better, because I can argument for it. And it is not an accusation, but a statement of fact: "unnecessary" <b>is</b> a POV, not an argument. The voter who thinks it is "unnecessary" <b>must</b> provide arguments by which rules there is "no need for such list", out of simple courtesy to fellow wikipedians. We are not discussing deletion of a vanity page here. Lists are tools for search information. And like I said, we have hundreds of them. Why don't you go and try to delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_whose_title_includes_a_phone_number.html" title="List of songs whose title includes a phone number">List of songs whose title includes a phone number</a>? If the operson who says "no need" provided a solid argument, there could have been a fat chance I agrreed with him. The issue is not like inter-ethnic conflict, where people just stand for their political POV. I will not die or kill for Russian language, you know. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 05:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Rationale</b> for the list. It comes to my mind that those who hastily voted to delete probably do not know the reason why all these <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_topics.html" title="List of mathematics topics">List of mathematics topics</a>, etc. have been created. There is a useful link "Related changes".

<p><b>Example of usefulness</b>: did you know that Russian is <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress-timed_language.html" title="Stress-timed language">stress-timed language</a>?

I bet my beard that 90% of native Russian speakers do not know it (and 99.8% do not know now to translate this term into Russian (or whether the corresponding Russian term exists), and 999.8% would not know where to find this fact). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 05:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the reasons for there being no need have already been listed in the nomination. Your POV is not better than others. Your comparative examples are poor ones because they're lists of (arguably) non-notable trivia while the argument against this article is that it is not a "structured list." Linguistics pages that mention/should mention Russian is not a well-defined or discrete topic. Why, for example, are <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_trill.html" title="Alveolar trill">alveolar trill</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_velar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless velar fricative">voiceless velar fricative</a> listed but not any of the other phonemes?</dd>
<dd>That you use the list as an addition to your watchlist to monitor pages is not a compelling argument.</dd>
<dd>Apparantly 99.99% percent of users named Mikkalai don't know to put important information about Russian in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> article. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 06:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> At the risk of getting my head bitten off, surely the place for the fact that (for example) Russian is a stress-timed language is in the article on stress-timed languages (which it already is) and the article on the language itself (which it doesn't appear to be). While the argument that "other equally large lists already exist" doesn't really get us anywhere (they might simply exist because nobody's got around to nominating them here yet), I'd argue that the difference would be that the articles linked in that list actually talk about "archaeology" or "mathematics" or whatever else it's a list of. When this list links exclusively to pages which mention the word "Russian" or "Russian Language", it might - and I do stress <i>might</i> - be a useful analogy. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 07:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suggest you to <i>try</i> to count the number of pages that mention the word <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> before jumping to weird analogies. For all others: precisely because "Rus Lang" page is linked to countless articles that say <b>nothing</b> about the language this list is highly useful: it points to <b>linguistics pages</b>, in other words, it is not "an indiscriminate collection". (Of course, you are free to maintain that "Linguistics" itself is an indiscriminate collection. &lt;Shrug&gt;.)`'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 07:57, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I meant was that not all of the articles <i>on this list here</i> mention Russian. This is admitted on the list itself and is (I would suggest) not the case in the other "List of X Topics" lists, which presumably link only to articles which <i>do</i> mention "archaeology", "mathematics", "dog-breeding" or whatever value X has. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 08:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a list of articles that discuss peculiarities of Russian language, period. When, say, the artile Mondegreens in Russian language will be written and placed into <a href="../../../r/u/s/Category%7ERussian_language_911a.html" title="Category:Russian language">category:Russian language</a>, then the entry "*<a href="../../../m/o/n/Mondegreen.html" title="Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a>" may be deleted from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Russian_language_topics_d9b3.html" title="List of Russian language topics">List of Russian language topics</a>. When the list becomes empty, I swear delete it myself (I pledge to delete it even earlier: when it will contain less than 6 items). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, why not move this to a subpage of your userpage for your own reference? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 21:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because this is a <i>reference</i>, not "my own reference". You don't like it, don't use it. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair cop, but might it be a valid suggestion in case the list <i>does</i> get deleted? It seems as though you're saying that the list serves two purposes - it can provide links to topics connected in various ways to Russian and it can remind you (or another user who's interested in doing the same thing) to create articles about "X in Russian". I would respectfully suggest that if it's deemed to be unencyclopedic to do the former, userfication would make a lot of sense to achieve the latter. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 22:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually this discussion gave me an idea how to make this list into something "bullet-proof" against deletionists. And such lists wil be useful for other languages as well. My observation (which triggerred the creation of this hapless list) is that it is nearly impossible to quiclky find out whether a particular feature exist in the language. For example, is Russian an <a href="../../../a/g/g/Agglutinative_language.html" title="Agglutinative language">agglutinative language</a>? The corresponding article gives "examples" of languages only, and it may well be that Russian is agglutinative, but simply was not among handpicked examples. Further, if it is not agglutinative, then which kind is it? Luckily, there sits the {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinguistic_typology_topics_a47c.html" title="Template:Linguistic typology topics">Linguistic typology topics</a>}} template, and I can try and find Russian language in articles from the same category. OK here we go: it turns out it is <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthetic_language.html" title="Synthetic language">synthetic language</a>. But is it fusional or olygosynthetic (listed as subcategoeries in the template)? Dunno. Stuck. And this problem is especially acute with more obscure topics, such as does Russian have <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequentative.html" title="Frequentative">frequentatives</a>? Right now I noticed that <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_grammar.html" title="Russian grammar">Russian grammar</a> article has a statement that there is no <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nominative_absolute.html" title="Nominative absolute">Nominative absolute</a> it modern Russian, which is false. My list is an attempt to add some search structure to the chaotic presentation of linguistic topics. And here come some deletionists who cannot tell ablaut from umlaut and tell me that this list is useless. Of course you don't need it when you write pokemon articles. Just take a look into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_songs_7fe6.html" title="Category:Lists of songs">category:Lists of songs</a>. How much effort is put into this songcruft, and all are happy. But my list useful for searches in a serious topic somehow makes someone sleepless. Sheesh! `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and move to Wikipedia:List of Russian language topics. Once it's there, editors working on Russian language articles can use it as they see fit. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 00:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The title is fraudulent. What we have here is a list of articles on <i>general</i> linguistics. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 03:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacy. We have a list of articles in <i>general</i> linguistics that are releted to <b>Russian language</b>, not the list of <b>all</b> articles in gen ling. Besides, wrong title is a reason for renaming, not for deleting. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What would you rename it to? "List of general language topics"? I'm sorry, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_linguistic_topics.html" title="List of linguistic topics">List of linguistic topics</a> already exists. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 05:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lead could use a bit more clarification about the linguistic part, but the idea is useful organizationally. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The article doesn't describe what should be included, nor (apparently) can it do so. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:36, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. Although the list requires some structuring. Some entries are related to language, i.e., of linguistic character. Some others (<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palindrome.html" title="Palindrome">Palindrome</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/s/Paschal_greeting.html" title="Paschal greeting">Paschal greeting</a>) are articles on important topics where examples are given in several languages. This list somehow resembles me article like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Turkish_origin_ed82.html" title="List of English words of Turkish origin">List of English words of Turkish origin</a>, only vice versa. Since this is English-langauage encyclopedia, certain topics which may be interesting in Turkish or Russian langauge cannot have an article of reasonable size in English wikipedia. And it makes sense to have a kind of "table of contents" for them. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 17:57, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Will it be reasonable to expand this article with the <b>full</b> list of topics related to Russian language, with indications where they are discussed? for example, Dialects of Russian language (and make a redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> for now), Cases in Russian langauage, etc. Does it make sense? The two my examples clearly have a potential for large articles. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 17:57, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
