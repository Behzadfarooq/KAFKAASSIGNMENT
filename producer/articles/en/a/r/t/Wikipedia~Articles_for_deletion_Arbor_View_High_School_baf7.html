<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. This is a difficult debate to close, and I will do my best to explain my logic in closing it as "delete." The nomination has been proposed on grounds of non-notability. This is a common accusation against articles which turn up here, and an important one. Articles which fail to establish notability may be deleted even if they are verifiable and referenced. Now, there are four broad categories of "keep" votes present here.</p>
<p>The first asserts that all high schools are notable. One user cited <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> in support of this; this policy was rejected by the community and has no bearing here. Nowhere is there a binding assertion of notability for <i>high schools</i>, as opposed to four-year colleges and universities. No one has linked to any policies or guidelines which would reinforce such a view. The fact that previous articles on high schools are generally kept does not reinforce this debate. Therefore, such an assertion must be treated as a question of personal preference. The second category brings forth news sources to demonstrate notability. These sources discuss the school's construction. While the design of the school is indeed interesting, discussion of said design belongs in an article on urban design trends or architecture. The school itself cannot be notable in this instance simply for being built. Hundreds if not thousands are built or renovated every year; any local newspaper is bound to cover such a thing. There is no demonstrable evidence of wider notability for the <i>school</i> as opposed to the <i>design</i>. The third category is that of utility. Allow me to quote a user: "This is a valuable article for people that live near the school." That may be the case, but utility is not and never has been a reason to keep an article. Plenty of things are "useful." I find the walk-throughs on gameFaqs.com useful, but that doesn't make them worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia (not that such a consideration has prevented the ballooning of some game-related articles). The fourth category, finally, is the X, so Y category. Broadly, this is the assertion that because X exists, Y should exist; conversely, if Y is deleted, so should X. This has never been a proper keep/deletion criteria on Wikipedia. An article must stand or fall on its own merits or lack thereof, particularly when X and Y are not remotely similar in scope or quality.</p>
<p>In summation, then, this debate has failed to demonstrate a wider notability for this high school that would <i>at this time</i> merit inclusion in Wikipedia. It is entirely possible that future events will render said judgement obsolete, but Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Therefore: delete the current article, without prejudice to re-creation.

Heck, it's a featured article. Secondly, I think a place that hundreds if not thousands of people are forced to attend every day assumes some sort of intrinsic notability. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>1.</b> After the three seconds I looked at the SHS article I have no doubts that the article establishes notability. After looking at the AVHS article for three seconds I also had no doubts that notability was <i>not</i> established (although I did a Google news search just to be sure). <b>2.</b> There is no such thing as intrinsic notability. There are classes of objects that are considered notable because as a class they receive enough outside coverage that the discussion is moot. A Fortune 500 company is notable. A Formula 1 driver is notable. An accredited university is notable. High schools are not as a class notable. This doesn't mean there aren't high schools that are notable, it means that the listed articles have to establish notability for themselves. This one doesn't. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> AVHS began last year and was heralded by the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Sun_6e2b.html" title="Las Vegas Sun">Las Vegas Sun</a> as the "biggest and potentially most efficient campus the district has built" <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2005/aug/29/519273478.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2005/aug/29/519273478.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The school was built to hold 2700 students, but currently only holds 1500. The building was designed to "rewrites the book on modern high school construction" according to the architect that designed it. The point to all of this is that this high school is completely notable, even though it isn't Stuyvesant. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:48, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am usually a defender of school articles, however, I firmly believe that this article has no place on Wikipedia. I also disagree with Truthbringer's rationale, not every school is notable. If that rationale was true then we would have to extend it to every single establishment that exists within most towns and cities. This school was recently created and there is absolutely not claim to notability and it does no stress it's subject's notability. We speedy delete any article that comes through new pages that doesn't stress the importance of it's subject. What gives this school a special exception to go around the rules? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 06:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I think the difference between a school and "every single establishment that exists within most towns and cities" is that a school is a place that children are forced to attend 6-8 hours 5 days a week. In that our children spend 30-40 hours in school each week, individual schools assume an extremely notable role in our society. The microcosm of their politics often reflects those of society as a whole. --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 07:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But that doesn't make it notable. That makes it the standard normality. A school has to at least stress it's importance. I'll use a good example: <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_High_2e9a.html" title="BC High">the school I went to</a>. The reason for it's notability is not just the alumni lisy and the 140+ year history, but was also affliated with a college, gets mentioned in large papers for academics and athletics, and it actually does whatever it can to stick out. If we keep a high school article that DOESN'T stress any importance at all, and suggest we keep it because it's the normality, that just doesn't click. This school is also too recently formed. I don't object to most school articles since they at least present interesting facts and at least attempt to seperate the school from others. But this article in it's current condition, and with the current facts just doesn't merit an article yet. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 13:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strongest possible non-speedy delete</b>. I said this before - schools have <b>no</b> inherent notability. Give me a reason why this should be here (besides the fact that it exists), and I'll change my mind, but from the looks of it, there is nothing notable or newsworthy (on a national/international scale, mind you) about the school, any of its students, or any of its alumni. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a> 06:54, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, schools are not instantly notable institutions, they are institutions but just because they belong to the general public does NOT make it a notable establishment. If this logic were true would we draw it to fire stations, police stations, etc. Since they also are part of public works. Something, I mean I use a small measure of something when dealing with school, has to happen to make in notable. There is nothing in a recently created school that makes it stand out. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 21:59, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I rarely vote in these school debates, but this one is too much. A recently-created high school that got a lot of local news coverage because it was created and has almost no other claim to importance? I'm sorry, but this fails any standard. If being a public building that people attend regularly is enough to be notable, then why is it that houses of worship that cannot assert notability are frequently deleted? Voluntary or involuntary attendance really doesn't change much. As far as I can tell, this article fails to assert its subject's notability, and were it anything other than a school (or maybe a Pokemon...) it would be nowhere near as controversial a deletion. GassyGuy 07:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per joturner; if there was anything notable or important about the school, the editors who created the article didn't include it and Alphachimp's findings above don't appear to add much. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I have stated before I regularly defend high school articles and help them grow when they approach from NPP. However, this article has nothing to help it out. No history, nothing that makes it unique, nothing that makes it stick out. It's just too recent and there is nothing to elaborate upon this for now. Also, in regards to storage: You can defend alot of articles that run through AfD as innocent, benevolent little pieces. But roughly half of them, don't deserve or merit an article. Look at any regular <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_High_2e9a.html" title="BC High">High</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brockton_High_School_8b47.html" title="Brockton High School">school</a> article, there is at something interesting in the history or something to elaborate upon.
