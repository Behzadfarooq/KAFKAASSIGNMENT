<p>I'm really puzzled by this. In my view, a decision was made about an article that was not originally part of Cal Poly Pomona, with no notice on the Cal Poly Pomona discussion page, that in effect forces a paragraph of content into the Cal Poly Pomona article. How can this be?</p>
<p>I have no intention of starting an edit war, so I plan to encourage other student organizations to add their bit, but I still don't think it is encyclopedic, even if it were made NPOV.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 01:12, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK, the only decision an AFD can make that is binding is to delete an article. Merging and/or redirecting is not binding, nor is even keeping. A kept article can be unilaterally merged and redirected. A redirected an article can be recreated. JJay is wrong here, IMO. The AFD is not binding, even more so on an article that was not the subject of the AFD. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 03:06, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> is correct that AFD is basically limited to just the "keep/delete" decision on the article in question. All further issues should be sorted out through our normal processes on the respective article Talk pages. However, AFD discussions <i>do</i> get a fair amount of visibility and attention from the community at large. Most AFD participants carefully evaluate the article(s) before making their recommendation. In many cases, it's more attention than the article's ever had before. We have traditionally given AFD decisions a certain deference in proportion to the degree of serious thought and consideration that went into the discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:10, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I've run into similiar issues. Many people seem to believe that a prior Afd prevents normal editing of the article after it's over, specifically with respect to merges. At Talk:Mootstormfront and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29_023f.html" title="Talk:Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)">Talk:Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)</a>, I've seen people argue that a merge cannot be done, since the prior Afd did not result in a "merge" decision. This is bizarrely incomprehensible logic to me, and I assumed most experienced editors would not agree with this reasoning. I decided to get more opinions on this here, and I see it's pretty much the same issue already brought up above, only in reverse. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cannot recreat Doosan article for long?</span></h2>
<p>Dear administrator, I wanna write an article on Doosan, but the 'doosan' page informs 'cannot be recreated without a good reason'. But I just want to talk about the Korean top 10~12 company Doosan with other users, and get more information and oppinion of the others. So, please let me create the 'Doosan' page(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doosan" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doosan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doosan</a>). Thank you. Sincerely, truism77</p>
<dl>
<dd>The old article was deleted as a copyright violation. Rather than rewrite the article, a number of users (apparently including you according to the edit history) kept reposting the copyvio text. The page had to be repeatedly deleted and was finally protected to prevent further abuse. If you want to create a completely new version with no copyright violations, you may do so but but given the history, I believe we are justified in some skepticism.</dd>
<dd>I recommend that you create a completely new draft as a sub-page of your user page - user:Truism77/Doosan. When you have a completely new page that is <i>not</i> a copyright violation, bring your petition to Deletion review to have the page unprotected and your draft moved into the main article space. It does not have to be a perfect article, but it should be more than a mere placeholder. And given the history, please assume that other readers will scrutinize it very carefully for a recurrence of copyright violations. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 15:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">etiquette and VfD</span></h2>
<p>When an article is added to VfD, contributors to that article do not necessarily know of the VfD nomination. If the contributor is busy with other wikitasks or is otherwise distracted from visiting said article, that contributor might not be able to chime in.</p>
<p>I have come across on article in VfD that is nearly 3 years old and has close to 1000 edits. I feel compelled to contact many of the contributors and alert them of the VfD nomination - but I also wonder if such solicitation is considered poor etiquette in Wikipedia. My messages to these contributors can be phrased in a way so as not campaign - such as "I just wanted to inform you that the article insert article name here has been nominated for VfD. I saw that you made contributions to this article, so I thought you'd like to know. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a>"</p>
<p>Is such action wrong? Is it considered campaigning? Are there any rules preventing this? I think it is important that contributors to an article have the right to know that their work is under review.</p>
<p>Please advise, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 19:32, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>AfD noms show up in watchlists just like everything else, so I don't see the need for this. However, if you want to determine who the handful of main contributors are to the article, and let them know, that's probably acceptable. Which article? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 19:40, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Part of my concern is that things can slip through watchlists. If someone makes a VfD edit and then another edit to the article occurs the same day, the VfD edit doesn't necessarily make the watchlist. Also, if someone worked on an article two years ago, they may have removed it from their watchlist later. I'm withholding the article name for now, because I want to get unbiased responses to my question - but I will let you know once I get an idea of the feelings out there about my question. thanks for your quick response. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 19:57, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the alert is presented neutrally, it's probably okay. The real question is whether the recipients will appreciate the alert or not. If I've taken the article off my watchlist or if I'm not watching it closely enough to run a diff on the edit history, then I really wouldn't consider myself sufficiently current on the article to justify an opinion. I'd probably ignore it.<br />
However, if we do formally decide that this is an acceptable practice, I feel quite strongly that it should never be required.<br />
I also feel strongly that such an alert should never be posted to an anon user's page. Too many anons come in from dynamic IPs but don't understand what that means. They will either be confused about alerts to articles they've never edited or will complain that they weren't notified not realizing that the notice is sitting on the IP userpage from their prior connection. If we try to make this a policy or even a guideline, it will set an unrealistic expectation for them. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:19, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very interesting points you've made. I too feel it inappropriate to alert IP addresses. I would only alert those registered users whom made non-minor edits to said article. I wouldn't want such notifications to be required - except for one....I think it should be common courtesy to notify via TALK the creator of said article (unless the creator was from an IP address). <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 01:40, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see. I interpreted "keep" as meaning that the article was notable, worthy of belonging at Wikipedia. Of course editing would continue afterwards.

<dd>Well, I meant more in context to the above discussion. Also, technically as I recall <b>merge and delete</b> means a merge without a redirect (obviously problematic due to the GFDL, but there are <a href="../../../m/o/v/Wikipedia%7EMoving_guidelines_for_administrators_c6fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Moving guidelines for administrators">ways</a> to get around that) - <b>merge or delete</b> means <b>merge and redirect</b> if something useful otherwise <b>delete</b> - <b>merge</b> means <b>merge and redirect</b> and <b>do not delete</b> (if that makes sense, it does after you've been doing it for a while...). So, rule of thumb to me is, if you want an article merged but would rather it be deleted then kept, <b>merge or delete</b> or plain <b>merge</b> and specify that you would rather the article not be kept - otherwise, if you want it merged but don't want it deleted use <b>merge</b> or <b>merge or keep</b>. Finally, if you want something merged but don't want a redirect (bad spelling etc.) then <b>merge and delete</b> and specify it as such (although many administrators probably just won't do this anyway and interpret it as a <b>merge or delete</b>). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">WhiteNight</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 06:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are not the only one confused by this. Before you "hack on the instructions section", I'd recommend approaching the problem from a different direction. The problem is not the dozen permutations of "merge ..." but that many people are still confused about the requirement in GFDL to preserve attribution history. But the truth is that most people don't have to understand the intricacies of that policy. That's why we ask admins to close discussions - they've been here long enough to be familiar with the rule. For everyone else, if you take the time to write out your thoughts and your intent in plain english, it doesn't matter what codewords you put at the front of your comment.

<p>Closing admins are expected to use judgement, and if they see a last minute surge, they can always relist, for extra input. A closing admin has to use their judgement. If the last-minute keep votes are based on a revised article, fixing the problems the nominator and early voters had, they may close as keep. If last minute keep votes are just a sneaky way of keeping a non-notable bio, then the admin can relist the AFD, or if they're sock/meatpuppets, they can disregard those votes entirely (deleting if there's consensus amongst valid voters). In many cases of the pile-ons, the article has been abandoned by the creator, and ther isn't a single person in all of Wikipedia who wishes the article kept. I think before anybody decides to be the fifth unanimous delete voter, they should first check all the other AFDs, which haven't had a single vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:05, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree, and I was just thinking this. Ideally the closing admin should only have to consider two or more competing meritorious rationales for Keep or Delete, not 99 'me toos'.

<p>When looking at AFD, one should remember that a person's main contribution to the AFD dicussion is not on the AFD subpage itself, but should be to the actual article, especially if they're voting keep. Adding relevent information, providing sources, removing unverified information, and generally improving accuracy is vastly more valuable then the usual monologue delivered in an AFD. Often, the talk page of the article, is also appropriate (sources are found, but not ready for the article). There is something seriously wrong wit some of the massive long-winded AFD discussion, which are many times the size of the article itself. Once the AFD is over, all the AFD discussion, though archived, provides almost no ongoing value. Comments/suggestions in it are almost never implemented. Sometimes references are put in the AFD, yet the article remains unsourced after the AFD! Frankly, I think one "keep per rewrite" vote, if given by the rewriter, should often (not always) outweight any *preceeding* delete vote, no matter how long-winded the delete voter is. I've seen many votes changed based on article improvement (usually towards keep, but also towards delete). We really don't need to encourage people to write more essays in AFDs (I get rather tired of reading the same arguements a hundred times, with the same link to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> thrown in, by the same person, over and over). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:57, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you think about it, all this is is a required quorum for deletion that would only apply to a very small number of AfDs which unnecessarily complicates the deletion process.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jimbo on the warpath re *FD</span></h2>
<p>*FD, AFD/DRV in particular, is causing noticeable problems for the Foundation, as Jimbo has noted of late on wikien-l. (See <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/" rel="nofollow">archive</a> - there's a lot of posts on the subject this month.) The idiocy over <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a>'s nomination was the last straw.</p>
<p>I realise AFD/DRV regulars don't like this sort of discussion happening outside WT:AFD and similar places, but it does happen and it will affect *FD — call this a notice to participate in the discussions that are happening.</p>
<p>So the question is how to better ensure (a) intelligence-insultingly crap nominations don't get in or can be killed quickly (b) better behaviour from AFD contributors (assuming better faith of non-regulars editing, and so forth) (c) cutting down the crippling weight of deletion/undeletion process which leads some admins (e.g. me) to go "fuck it".</p>
<p>Ideas? Assume for this discussion that nothing changing is not an option, because it isn't.</p>
<p>(Note: my personal opinion is that almost everything nominated on AFD does in fact deserve as quick, messy and painful a death as can be managed.

<dd>I think we need to reduce the size of AFD before we do anything else. This isn't just a matter of scaling anymore. The way I see it, people are abrupt and brief (to the point of ludicrosity, i.e. "delete nn-bio") because there are so many AfDs to tackle. As a result, a disproportionate amount of time is spent on articles that nobody would argue should be kept. This creates a culture of insularity and impenetrable jargon and abruptness that can easily be misunderstood (for instance, words like "vanity" have a totally different meaning on AFD) and is carried over to serious debates (generally any debate where more than two or three people object to deletion and expound on why) where people need to mull their words carefully and a reasoned debate should be carried out. Allowing people more time to handle fewer articles would give people breathing room to ponder their words, behave in a civil manner, and carefully decide whether to delete or keep something. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

WRT early closings, I'm not sure -- the way I see it, we should be eliminating the need to have all but the controversial AfDs actually debated on AfD. Obviously those where the nominator meant a merge should be closed early (this can be easily done within the present system), but for other AfDs...? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 14:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

OK, we can say that some time was wasted on that, but when the final result was clear, nobody complained nor did anyone have reason to complain. No lasting harm was done. Oh, perhaps a few of our readers wondered why we would seriously consider this article for deletion when they saw the AFD tag, but they would also see a system which works, properly flooding such an AFD with a load of "keep" votes. Keep in mind that trollish nominations like that are really very rare, and not a big problem on Wikipedia. If we ever get major trouble with such nominations, there will develop a consensus for a policy change the same way a consensus for expansion of the speedy deletion criteria emerged due to the number of vanity-bio articles on AFD back in July. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:17, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't there a way to tinker at the edges here? If there were less articles in the AfD process, perhaps people would be less terse. That suggests finding ways to reduce the number that make it to AfD. Expanding CSD seems one way. Another way would be introducing CSK (criteria for speedy KEEP). Another way is to offer more early exits, that is for closing AfD's early when it is obviously a keep. Yet another way would be closing early when it's obviously a merge (with the proviso that someone has to actually go off and do the merge (so yes, as DG says, close the AFD early if the merge is done). All those things might help people have more time to be more thoughtful on the ones that are borderline. I'd also support not using quite such terse abbreviations, and not (EVER) using strikeouts for comments made by others. Eoth those are offputting to newbies. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:37, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems to me that a lot of the problem is inexperienced users creating articles (though there's nothing wrong with that per sey). Yes there are links to guidelines shown when you create a page, but not prominently, and you can't really expect new users to read 20 pages of documentation before creating an article. If you look at newpages, something like 20-30% of new articles are by brand new users. I know 20-30% of all edits aren't by such people... so it seems obvious that new users seem to want to create new articles a lot. And a lot of these are obviously articles that won't survive AfD... while they vary from things made up in school to band vanity to attack pages to articles about some game their buddy made that 4 people have ever played, they are all unverifiable.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is that we should have an article creation process (at least for new users) that stresses verifiability. I think a second window during article creation, asking for a third party source confirming the new article, would be a major asset here. It would help a lot of people realize "Hey maybe Wikipedia isn't the place for what I'm trying to do here..." and it would automatically provide a source for new articles. Articles with invalid or incorrect sources (e.g. linking to google results, the website being plugged, etc.) could be deleted. If the source checks out, that actually would mean the article probably shouldn't be deleted anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah I know everyone has an idea for a new policy and no one wants to read all the new ideas for new policies, but trust me on this one... most of my work on WP has been dealing with this kind of stuff. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 18:30, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>To put it another way, sure we can create tons of new guidelines for dealing with the slew of unverifiable articles people create under the current process. But wouldn't it be a better use of our time just to have a good system to help them avoid the very common mistakes new users make? Creating lots and lots of rules is, at best, a reactive solution. Being proactive would lead to better articles and less hassle for us. It's win win. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 18:53, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This entire discussion needs to be assessed based on the consequences of any change. Fundamentally, this is because this entire project is based on unclear and conflicting goals, inclusiveness vs efficiency. You can't base an entire project on consensus and respecting every editor as an equal and then characterize <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith efforts</a> as <b>intelligence-insultingly crap nominations</b> or expect to deal with them quickly. By that statement, you are saying "My judgment is superior". As of now, we already have a process to identify "crap". Everyone has a different perspective, and what may be "intelligence-insulting" to you may not be so obvious to someone else. In fact the example given <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> is still extremely unpopular and probably would not exist if Jimbo had not made his decree. Yet both the nominators and the people voting were clearly acting in good faith. If the idea of consensus is important, then let the process continue. If efficiency in dealing with "crap nominations" is what you want, you will have to abridge the rights of average editors in some way (limit afd rights only to admins, or assign individuals who have the right to deny afd without discussion). There is no way of both respecting consensus and "dealing with crap nominations". The current process is based on the consensus model, and consensus must be reached before deletion. You only have two meta-options, concentrate power in fewer people (appoint super-users of some type), or slow down the process with more bureaucracy (make all AFD's go through a talk page vote first). Either will have long-lasting and unforeseen consequences. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 19:21, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a proposal to go partway to solving this. We should have a policy page called Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy keep, where if any article meeting the criteria is nominated, its nomination can be immediately removed. Things that have in the past had overwhelming consensus for keeping, such as articles about real towns or widely-known fictional characters, etc., can be listed here. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:10, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a clarification. My point above is that the current model leaves all substantive decisions in the hands of the users, super-users such as admins, arbcomm, even Jimbo are theoretically no more equal than regular users in the decision process regarding content. Superusers only become involved when due process consensus cannot be reached. Any process change that still leaves the content decision in the hands of the users will not address this issue of "crap nominations". This is because new policies such as WP:Criteria for speedy keep are still subject to interpretation, especially since the criteria will have to be primarily negative. This may adress a truly and egregiously bad faith AFD/CFD attempt, but those rarely occur anyway. Most are in good faith based on reasoning, perhaps incorrect, but still not without basis. In essence you will be adding one extra layer to the AFD/CFD process which would not have aborted the CFD for <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> since it was done in good faith. That is unless you make such a WP:Criteria for speedy keep into essentially a criteria for undeletable articles. You could mandate at least x many days of discussion on the talk page of article or category prior to AFD/CFD, but again that adds another layer to the process.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 13:48, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One small practical thing which would help is to have a possibility to <b>flag items on the watchlist</b> and sort according to flag, alternatively hide items with a certain flag. That way one could put things on the watchlist and be sure to easily get them up to the surface again in a few weeks to see if anything significant has happened. Too many articles are probably nominated for deletion or tagged for speedy just because people neither want to wait until they scroll off RC or Newpages and disappear into the sea of articles, nor contaminate their normal watchlist with various dubious items. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 11:38, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that being in good faith does not make a nomination or (not-a-)vote (a) not intelligence-insultingly crap (b) not a problem. There is a problem, and claiming there isn't one or there shouldn't be one or that we should act as though there isn't one won't make it go away. I'm placing this here for discussion of real problems so that AFD won't have a solution imposed on it by the Foundation, because that's what's likely coming without some severe internal reform.

<dd>I mentioned 4 possible solutions above and their probable ramifications. The issue is analysis of those ramifications and making the appropriate choice. And a meta-issue if you will, or subtext of this entire discussion is the question of <b>who decides something is (a) intelligence-insultingly crap (b) a problem</b>. The choices are "the community consensus" or "a subgroup with more merit". I am inferring from several comments both here and the mailing list that the prevailing opinion is that there is a group that feels they have more merit with which to decide these issues. One corollary is that all of us, every single contributor feels that we belong in that subgroup. Most projects are hierarchical and the only way order prevails is with hierarchy. In that case, explicitly say within the AFD process that All decisions are subject to veto by arbcomm members or some other subgroup. Problem solved. Also, we need to ask Jimbo to clarify the problem. Was the problem that the article might get deleted? <i>Solution, limit deletion rights</i>. Was the problem that they were voting? <i>Explicitly say no voting</i>. Was the problem that the process was on the A/CFD page? <i>make a mandatory discussion period on the talk page of X many days</i>. Was the problem that a contribution by a "longtime contributor" was being disrespected? <i>Make contributions by "longtime contributors" exempt from the deletion process</i>. Was the problem that a new contribution was being nominated for deletion? <i>Make all new contributions exempt from the deletion process for X many days.</i> But I hope that everyone is aware that any change in this process will essentially be a shift within the inclusionist/deletionist axis or else a move away from the egalitarian concepts of wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 13:35, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regrettably (and I understand why you would prefer an internal solution), I think we'll find this one needs to come from the top. If a Foundation-approved first draft of a new approach was put forward for comment (on the proviso that something will happen, but a draft is released to iron out difficulties, rather than for approval/rejection), we should hopefully have something workable. I'm concerned myself about how the <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a></i> issue has been dealt with - not because I disagree with the premise that something needs to be done - but more because I'm not convinced this is the best way to achieve Jimbo's aims (which I totally agree with) - however, I'm at a loss to know where to suggest better alternatives, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 12:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was personally disturbed that Jimbo had that little faith in the process. There was absolutely no way <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> was going to be deleted. The CFD process takes at least 5 days. There were plenty of people who said keep. If he had weighed in and just said "Keep" that would have <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">snowballed</a> and created more keep votes.

<dd>With reference to <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, I am worrying about another snowball effect here if we start allowing people to break rules by speedying things which don't meet the speedy deletion criteria. Except for a very limited range of cases (such as blatant attack pages), there is no urgency in getting rid of poor articles. The <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> are deliberately narrow to avoid speedying articles which actually shouldn't be deleted. We give the AFDs at least five days to make sure that anyone who is reasonably active will get a chance to view the article (and sometimes a single discovery of something which establishes notability can turn a unanimous "delete" with 10 votes to a "no consensus" so we should not just say "it has no chance in hell".)</dd>
<dd>One scenario I don't want is admins who don't bother asking for permission at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and instead speedy delete things and then hope for forgiveness on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> since a 50%+ is needed there to overturn a speedy. Some time ago I saw one administrator vote "keep deleted" on a speedy deleted userbox and openly said he thought it would be kept if sent to TFD.</dd>
<dd>Remember, speedy deletions are not open to review by non-admins because they don't have access to the content.

The ArbComm's job is <i>not</i> to enforce the rules. The ArbComm's job is to protect the encyclopedia. That end necessarily and sufficiently justifies the means.

This same discussion is rekindled by the same few editors every few months on this talk page.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Public relations</span></h3>
<p>I did an interview yesterday and got a taste of the effects of AFD on Wikipedia's relations with the outside world. The guy's a podcaster of minor notability - <a href="http://bicyclemark.org/" class="external free" title="http://bicyclemark.org/" rel="nofollow">http://bicyclemark.org/</a> . (Though he has listeners, so is doing better for notability than a lot of podcasters.)</p>
<p>The thorny bit was talking about WP:AFD and its ... little ways. He sprung on me in the interview that he had created an article on himself, it was deleted as "vanity", several of his readers recreated it, it was deleted all those times too, and apparently some of the deletion discussion comments were more than a little spiky. I think I talked my way past that one OK ("this user is a native speaker of Bullshit"), but it was a tricky moment. I explained that if he got referenceable notice from third parties, that may show that he was notable enough to probably rate an article; that next month he might become vastly popular and clearly rate an article; and emphasised that the edge cases are always the painful ones.</p>
<p>(He says the podcast should be up tonight or Saturday morning.)</p>
<p>This is a minor podcaster, not broadcast media. But the point remains that this sort of thing causes real problems. Many think we shouldn't care about media image, but those dealing with our sometimes shaky relations with the outside world are understandably sensitive to potential PR disasters of this sort. It would be almost no effort at all to go through AFD and find a hundred diffs "proving" that Wikipedians are rude bastards, for example.</p>

<dd>I suggest that policy pages, guidelines, categories and templates not use "vanity" and similar words, when possible. Also, the AfD page should remind nominators and voters that those who created or worked on the page might be reading it and that their comments will affect how these people, usually newcomers, feel about Wikipedia. It does somewhat now, but it could be made more explicit. Another warning could be put on the nominating instructions, AfD2 specifically. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:48, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word "vanity" in particular needs to be abolished. Even if it's the correct word for most of it, in the cases where it turns out not to be, it's <i>vastly insulting</i> in the real world. (This is a real case - an author whose article was nominated as "vanity" contacting the Foundation considerably aggrieved. The author had been published by Fawcett and Playboy Press, but the nominator hadn't heard of either, or bothered doing a dot of research. That's the sort of thing I mean by a damagingly crap nomination that needs to be dealt with internally by AFD or it'll be dealt with externally and with a heavy hand by the Foundation.) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:50, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word "vanity" isn't going away; it's just too useful. It very accurately describes a large class of articles that appear on Wikipedia.

<dd>It can be done away with, and quite easily (we just write a bot that periodically looks at all the AfD pages and deletes the word). Not only is using the term "vanity" spiteful (when either it's an article not written by the subject or is an article written by a newbie or someone editing in good faith who isn't aware of the details of our policies), it's entirely unnecessary. Either an article should exist in the namespace or it shouldn't - who wrote it is irrelevant to that discussion.

<p>My 2c, worth not a cent more, is that we could try not voting. Nominator must give reasons concordant with the policy. Anyone who disagrees should give reason. Anyone with something to add should add it. "Delete, nn" is not "something to add". It's a vote. No one disagrees after a couple of days, bin it. Use judgement instead of rules. Loosen up a bit (a lot) about article re-creation. I'm interested in the pure wiki thing. Decentralising debate might help, because the temptation to sit in AfD deleting content would be somewhat lessened. And the articles we all agree on could be soft-speedied in that way, without much fuss.</p>
<p>I'm also with David Gerard on this one. I steer well clear of AfD, bar rare cases, because it's a pit. Queues of editors smash into articles. There isn't much wikilove going down. But you have to try to remember, the people who wrote those "vanity" articles are human beings. This is often their first sight of Wikipedia. I have sometimes looked over AfD debates and felt quite angry at the treatment meted out to people who have committed no worse crime than create content. I think that atmosphere has been very much fuelled by the tacit acceptance of just turning up, voting on articles with one word comments and being quite unconscionably rude about contributors. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 12:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The majority of nominations to AfD present a slam-dunk case for deletion. All that's required is for a couple of people to sanity-check them. Read the nomination, look at the article, maybe try one Google search and then write a terse comment like "Delete per nom." or "Delete, nn." People writing short recommendations like that are contributing usefully to the process as it is currently conceived. If those who agree with a deletion nomination but have nothing in particular to add don't comment then the nomination may get no comment at all - except perhaps from the creator of the article, eager to keep it and clueless of policy. Then if the article is deleted with only the recommendation of the nominator people will scream bloody murder&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Long diatribes on why an article should be deleted are far more damaging than a simple "Delete per nom". We should never be rude but we must be allowed to be terse. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:10, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand what you're saying but in effect all you're doing is endorsing voting. People writing short recommendations are adding nothing but a vote. They're not clarifying anything, or adding anything, just piling on. And Haukur, one person's "long diatribe" is another person's "bothered to talk about it". If editors had to write considered opinions rather than cursory votes, they might vote less, and consider more. I don't think we'd lose out by that.<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 13:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fifth "Delete per nom." is overkill which doesn't add anything but the first two or three are valuable in confirming that the nominator did not make an obvious mistake. Sanity-checking five nominations may be as valuable as adding a detailed argument to one nomination. The process must be reasonably efficient, we've got to keep deleting articles. We don't have the manpower for multiple essays on each nomination. "Delete per nom." can be a considered opinion based on a careful study of a case. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 13:57, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>AfD is more about the debate and less about voting, but it's a hybrid system because it still includes elements of voting. Voting is especially useful in cases where there is nothing to debate; as Haukur noted, it shows that yes, people did look at the article and agree it needs to go. A lack of votes can either indicate the latter or that nobody noticed the debate. Turning AfD into a pure debate system is just too impractical to work, because it assumes that each nomination is debateable when, as David Gerard has noted, much of what goes into AfD is pure junk that needs to go as soon as possible. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 14:14, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it be possible to delegate more work to WikiProjects? At the moment most WikiProjects have some sort of system whereby they "adopt" the articles which fall within their purview. Would it be possible to make this more "official"? Maybe we could be more systematic in sorting articles and assigning them to WikiProjects; we could create more projects to cover areas which aren't currently managed.

<li>It would still mean that out internal search would fail to find the discussion, it would not turn up on what-links-here, and the like. I think this is not desirable, and I don't see that it gains us any benefits that changing robots.txt does not. An ill-constructed spider could traverse history pages, after all. It also would meant that things would be different in the archives before and after the effective date of the proposal, or else require significant work changing old logs <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:11, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, you're right: we should obviously retain the link to the page under discussion, otherwise the sectionising will go all awry, and the back-linking will break.

</li>
<li>Not necessarily. As long as whatever template we use explicitly says "look in the page history", blanking only adds two clicks to the process of finding or linking to the discussion. Non-admins will still be able to review the full discussion because the page is not deleted, just archived a bit differently. Second, it <i>will</i> still show up on what-links-here and through the internal search engine as long as we leave the link to the article name visible (unless you are suggesting that people normally search for keywords from inside the discussion rather than just the title).<br />
While you're right that a spider could crawl through history pages, so far, none do. Lastly, I'd suggest that there is no compelling reason to immediately rework all the old logs. Lots of our archives are inconsistent with current forms and practices. We can fix the problematic ones as one-offs when they're found. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 19:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>IMO 24 hours is not long enough -- too mamny poeple do not log on to wikipedia every day, much less visit AfD every day. This will also lead to nomintors notifing people to try to get "co-sponsoers" for nominations.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The problem is that how many people comment in an AfD varies widely. Usually the nominations with the fewest votes are the ones that clearly need to be deleted, not kept, as there just isn't much argument to be made against deletion, often no one bothers commenting at all. I've seen lots of clear-cut hoaxes and clear violations of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> go 5 days without a comment... your proposal would speedy keep them? That seems like a very bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The vast majority of AfDs aren't controversial and don't get a lot of comments, they're procedural and boring, and the lack of comments means no one really objects to deletion. Until something better exists, it's the only way that non-admins have of dealing with articles that need to be deleted. In practice, AfDs that get an overwhelming consensus towards keep are closed early anyway. So uh, sorry to keep opposing, but I don't see how this proposal would help in its current incarnation. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:06, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm new here but I have to agree with W.marsh. I just read over AfD because a page I was looking at was marked for deletion and I wanted to explore the process. I considered voting to delete nearly all of today's candidates, but then I read this in Section 2 of <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a>: "consider not participating if . . . you agree with what has already been formed." So I didn't vote for any.

<li>Remeber, <i>there is no urgency</i> in getting these things processed. Except for a very small number of cases, it does not matter if a bad article stays for a few days before being deleted or if a good article stays on AFD for a few days before being kept. If a hoax article appears and is tagged, readers will se that our processes for getting rid of such things <i>work</i>. A "speed up AFD" proposal is not needed because the speed of AFD is not a problem. At the moment we have several admins willing to close debates and the backlog is short now. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:11, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As an admin who closes most of the last AfDs of the day, I can tell you that the backlog is kept short only because of three or four dedicated admins closing debates, with a few dilettantes joining in. Just take away one or two of those dedicated admins and the backlog will pile up again. While I'm not saying that this justifies drastically speeding up the AfD process (I think that wouldn't solve the basic problem of excess volume), I do think it should be made clear that the more admins joining in to help close AfDs, the better -- as far as I can tell, we're precariously close to returning to the time when <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_Old_da15.html" title="WP:AFD/Old">WP:AFD/Old</a> has three or four days backed up on it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:05, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>We've been discussing the merits and suggesting changes to AFD for at least half a year now. So it's about time we stop talking and actually do something. The simplest variant to AFD would be to list all proposed deletions, and delete all that nobody objects to within several days.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is AFD really "broken"?</span></h2>
<p>Most of the discussion above, initiated by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> on the mailing list and brought here for further analysis, takes for granted that there is something major that is wrong with AFD and needs to be fixed. But I'm not at all sure that this is the case. Yes, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> has some concerns about the process. But Jimbo, as important as he is to the project, is still only human and can (gasp!) be wrong. So the fact that he believes that there's a problem is not the end of the story.</p>
<p>Jimbo is, understandably, frustrated that he has received a bunch of irate e-mails from people whose articles were AFD'd, and to whom the shop talk on AFD sounded abrasive and harsh. I absolutely agree that AFD discussions should be kept off Google for precisely that reason. I have no objection to removing it from <code>robots.txt</code> and/or blanking the debates (as long as people can view them in the history) when they're closed.</p>
<p>But, in the big picture, is this <i>really</i> the serious "PR problem" that people are claiming it is? From my perspective, the most common criticisms of Wikipedia regard its reliability and accuracy. Major media isn't complaining that we're deleting as "vanity" a tiny handful of articles that really aren't. They're complaining that our open editing process is flawed or that Wikipedia has <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">been used as a venue for libel</a>. Of course, these criticisms are often misguided, and even when legitimate (as the Siegenthaler issue) they are hard to address, but they are the criticisms that are out there. I'm concerned that this AFD issue is a case of "letting the squeaky wheel get the grease". To put it bluntly, some people are upset that their NN-bios got deleted as vanity, so they're complaining about it. Why should that be surprising? We need to take such criticisms with a grain of salt. I don't see that happening. Individual bad deletions can be handled on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> (though, ideally, I'd prefer to allow administrators the discretion to undelete instead).

<dd>Debates should absolutely <i>not</i> be blanked - at least in the case where the article originator did not participate. They deserve to see the reasons why their article was deleted, whether spoken in a kindly or a not-so-kindly manner. I've seen people on the Village Pump who were very upset and confused because their article "vanished" while they were gone for a couple weeks and they don't know what happened. This is the reason I added a link to the VfD debate (if it exists) to the two "this page does not exist" MediaWiki messages. Do not blank debates - but do feel free to clean them up for politeness ("Vanity page" -&gt; "Seems intended to promote its subject", something like that.) <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:16, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What we should be asking ourselves is not whether AFD is "broken". What we should be asking ourselves is <i>how can we improve it</i>.</li>
<li>For instance, it's likely possible to purge Wikipedia of the "vanity" meme, even if it'd take several months (trust me on this one, I'm personally responsible for the creation and downfall of several other memes here).</li>
<li>Robots.txt should be an easy fix to prevent Google from finding AFD pages, but of course this won't invalidate their listing of pages already found. Then again, given the Google cache, <i>neither</i> will blanking those pages.</li>

<li>Okay, reading up on it now. I just wanted to point out that this remark (incidentally, by you) hits the nail right on the head... <i>"there are certain portions of the Wikipedia population which LIKE the culture of AFD ... so long as AFD continues to operate, they have no incentive to negotiate over the issue."</i> EXACTLY. Wikipedia is supposed to work by consensus, but any sufficiently large group of people that isn't strictly into POV-pushing or vandalism (and sometimes even then) can and <i>do</i> force their will on the community, with admin support and bullying if necessary, and get away with it. And I should note this goes for both inclusionists and deletionists. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:18, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, frankly, most of the problem lies in large assumptions. I'm willing to accept that ComixPedia and DollPedia started out of incivility with AFD. But note that PokemonPedia and WookieeePedia already started for a variety of other reasons. I've seen numerous assertions that AFD people are always like that, or that DRV doesn't work (or that WP:MUSIC is bad, or that WP:COMIC turned out evil), but when questioned people never seem to cite an iota of sourcing for those statements. As such I'm not inclined to believe those statements.</li>
<li>The problem, then, is not in that new wikis are created, but in that we lose good contributors as a result of incivility. This is indeed a problem, and the Wiki could benefit from being more civil. But this goes for both sides. As far as I've followed the Webcomic debate, it mostly turned into a revert war and flame war between Snowspinner and Aaron Brenneman, both parties being at fault. I believe WP:COMIC has now stabilized to a useful form, thanks to other parties. However, there's now a few people that say "I am right and will do my way regardless of what consensus says". That's also incivil, and also drives off people.</li>
<li>So the problem would be lack of discussion, lack of cooperation, lack of civility, and FUD. Other than giving people a daily dose of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> pills, does anyone have a good solution? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 00:30, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I admit that there are problems with AfD, I do not consider it "broken" at this time. Improvements and supplements are probably needed, but IMO a total replacement is not. I agree with <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">User:Crotalus horridus</a> at the start of this thread, and with <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">User:Deco</a> that blanking debates is a very bad idea --no matter who participated, aomeone did not, and any such person should be entitled to see after the fact what was done and why. Debates should be open to our internal search tools when looking for precedents or prior uses of particular arguments, or for the matter of that prior participation by particular users, all of which is significantly harder if debates are blanked. The search result issue can be dealt with perfectly well by a change in robots.txt, no more is needed or IMO desirable. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:36, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Simple logic can tell you that AfD is borked -- it isn't going to scale. On a technical basis, note how fast AfD has grown from just a year ago. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Wikipedia%7EPreliminary_Deletion_39f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Preliminary Deletion">Preliminary Deletion</a> documents an "astonishing" 71 new nominations on AfD in one day. Today, we'd be lucky to get twice that number in a day. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_VfD_statistics_a8a4.html" title="User:Johnleemk/VfD statistics">A year ago</a> AfD was somewhere between half to two-thirds of its current size. As the community keeps growing (exponentially, mind you), we're eventually going to find ourselves with four or five hundred nominations in a day. Last time I expressed concern for technical reasons, i.e. dial-up users. But now I see that this huge volume has more repercussions than just that. The huge amount of crap encourages a trigger-happy knee-jerk "delete" reaction to anything resembling the mountains of junk we get everyday, even if buried under that facade there's something worth keeping. The need to spread out one's "voting" time over dozens of debates also makes people work fast, leading to abrupt and (to outsiders) rude statements like "delete vanity bio". Is AfD borked? I have no doubt about it. It's not just the culture -- as Rossami has said, that's just a symptom of the larger problem. It's the fact that this sort of thing isn't going to scale for much longer. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 04:32, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The above is a very good point. One problem (and possible avenue of solution) is that we currently have all kinds of articles thrown together into AfDs. Garage bands, stuff that barely escaped a speedy, all the way up to articles that have been around for three years and edited by hundreds of people, but up for AfD because of POV / unmaintanability /etc. issues. It would be nice to categorize these a little. Most of the controversial and/or most active AfDs are for articles that have been around for a while. Some sort of separation would be a great start to reducing the page size and hopefully increase the overall scrutiny of each article. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 18:46, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AfD etiquette additions</span></h2>
<p>I have two suggestions for the AfD etiquette section. I noticed that some editors are again using "speedy delete" as if it means "strong delete" and others are using criteria that don't exist. If recommending speedy delete, I think that the reason for speedy deletion should be given. Here is the suggested text:</p>
<p>If recommending that the article be speedily deleted, please give the criteria that it meets, such as "A7" or "non-notable biography".</p>
<p><br />
Another issue is people saying "keep" or "delete" more than once. I've noticed two situations where this happens. Sometimes an editor thinks that he or she must reaffirm their position if they make another comment. Other times the editor thinks that each argument for or against an article can be given a separate keep or delete suggestion. For example, they might say that an article should be deleted because the subject is non-notable, and after considering it further, say that it should be deleted because it is unverifiable, too. Here is the suggested text:</p>
<p>Editors usually state their suggested course of action in bold. Giving it more than once makes the nomination seem to have more or less support than it actually has. If you change your mind, modify your original recommendation.</p>

<dd>Agreed, but since most people starting AFD simply jump in instead of reading all the rules, the real best way to convey matters of etiquette is to simply tell them on their talk pages.

<dd>It's probably true that most people just jump in, but after I have informed users about things like this, they sometimes say that they did not see it on the main AfD page, so I guess some people read it.

<p>The obvious response is to say that a deletion nomination is no big deal. But content creators frequently don't feel that way about their work.</p>

<dd>That's fine, if everybody takes a turn and the situation remains friendly. What has happened is that a little group of "employees" who have hunkered down in the "restroom" and have taken to roundly abusing anybody who dares actually use the toilets for their intended purpose, which "ruins all the nice cleaning they've just done". Thing is, some visiting dignitaries tried to freshen themselves up and received a bucketful of abuse too, which is embarrassing to the company: said "employees" will need to smarten their act up, or the MD will smarten it up for them.

<dd>The problem isn't having a deletion mechanism at all (that's not in question), but the current operations and culture of the current one.

<p>As for the actual concern here, I frequently express concerns on article talk pages if I think the article might be a candidate for deletion, rather than jumping straight to Afd. I try to avoid Afd whenever possible, through the use of any and every alternative way of dealing with problem articles. And yes, I think that avoiding the use of Afd should be highly encouraged. I would say that bringing it up on the article talk page is more useful than on the author's user talk page, though. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:21, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I go both ways on this. If an article is very short and has a single anonymous or new user contributor, and is obviously deletable, raising it on the talk page is silly, as it's unlikely you'll even get a timely response. If <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> is permanently adopted, this should help take care of this kind of article, to the point where I wouldn't mind mandating that the remainder be discussed on the talk page prior to AfD nomination. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 18:36, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was the one who actually nominated the article in question. Having read this discussion, I will make a better attempt to contact the creator of the article in the future before proposing articles for deletion and encourage others to do the same. However, I think we need to get away from the idea that an article creator <i>owns</i> their articles or has a right to be notified about changes to them. Theres a similar discussion occuring at <a href="../../../m/a/i/Template_talk%7EMaintained_50f6.html" title="Template talk:Maintained">Template_talk:Maintained</a>. If the article creator in question had not been an administrator, I doubt anyone would have questioned my actions. In fact, I find it hard to believe that an administrator would find my rationale for nomination "cryptic". Non-notable neologisims are deleted all the time, and should continue to be. This one happened to be self-referential because half of the content was talking about how this term was used on Wikipedia. Given these warning signs, I believe that most people who patrol <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> would have seen this as a likely candidate for deletion. In fact, several other editors in good standing voted to delete. I don't think there is any need to assume bad faith on my part, as <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCart00ney&amp;diff=39080456&amp;oldid=39077434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCart00ney&amp;diff=39080456&amp;oldid=39077434" rel="nofollow">has</a>. I had no reason to believe that this article was any more "obviously in progress" than the thousands of such stubs which are createdly every day. Every article on wikipedia is in-progress. In fact, I still believe that this article should be deleted or at least merged. There is no way there will ever be more than five notable sentences to say about this. I think that its possible to have a discussion within the current framework of AfD about this without assuming bad faith or making ad hominem attacks. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 20:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but cryptic to a newbie. Deletion reasons have two audiences, the voters (experienced Wikipedians), and the contributors, often clueless newbies. Avoid jargon or use links to describe them in more detail. Consider making a set of reasons you can copy paste together to save keystrokes. This should be some kind of guideline in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:30, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I and most other AfD regulars use links when possible and will try to increase my use of them in the future. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for reading the deletion policy which is linked from every AfD notice. Newcomers to wikipedia are generally given little to no weight in votes because of concerns over sockpuppetry. At the very least, a "newbie" should familiarize his- or herself with the guidelines before participating in AfD. But, yes, I agree. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 21:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Would it be possible to create a page that lists all open AfD votes? Currently, users have to click on the listings by day which causes listing which were created more than 24 hours ago to receive far less traffic, with most of what they receive coming from users who were directed there by the article's main page or by a third party. "AfD regulars" are much less likely to click on older pages because many of these debates have closed and thus it is more time consuming to wade though them. This appears to create a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_hazard.html" title="Moral hazard">moral hazard</a> because disinterested parties are less likely to find the vote just when they are needed the most.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Copyright violations being speedily deleted</span></h2>
<p>Previously, copyright violations were listed on copyright problems when they are discovered after being nominated for deletion and the nomination was closed.

<dd>Well, there is the abject failure of a policy that is <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A8" title="WP:CSD">CSD A8</a>. I imagine Capitalistroadster decided that the site amounted to a commercial content provider. Or, he may have decided that we can't keep copyright violations whether we want to or not and removed it accordingly as one that self-confessed to not being the owner of the material. (Trust me on that; it did.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:30, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There have been others, though. Anyway, we should do something about A8, either get rid of it, clarify it, or delete all copyrighted material unless permission is asserted, which is my favorite. I did try to clarify it, but people seemed to think I was changing its meaning instead because it is so misunderstood. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:17, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think there are many cases in which material which is not clearly copyrighted is put on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. Such claims are often made with little knowledge of copyright law. Many articles are taken directly from government websites and other sources that make them look like copyvios when they're not, and some content is contributed by the original author, which legitimately donates it under the GFDL. I don't think there should be any expansion of the already too-expansive right to delete copyrighted material. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 05:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My experience may not be representative, but out of the hundreds of copy and pastes that I've found, very few were from public domain sources or posted by the copyright owners. Some were from government websites, but the majority of those were from a government that does not make its work public domain. The number of mistaken deletions is further reduced by the fact that for the content to be deleted, the poster must make no assertion that it is public domain or that they have permission to post it. Finally, an admin has to confirm that it is a copyright violation whether it is speedied or listed on copyright problems and there is undeletion if mistakes are made. Given the amount of copyrighted material that is posted on Wikipedia, I would rather occasionally delete article by mistake than let a large number of copyright violations go uncaught. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 23:50, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that it was around 180 to 200 for most days until recently. I suspect that prod has a lot to do with it. However, there are other possible factors. A big one that I can think of is not allowing anonymous users to create articles. Some of those users are probably just signing up for accounts to create bad articles, but new articles have been noticeably better on the whole. There was probably a big backlog in deletion candidates, and there still might be. However, the drop was sudden and occured around the time prod got going, so I think that it is probably the main reason for the reduction. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:27, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal for AfD script</span></h2>
<p>To work alongside something like <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_ce8b.html" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary">User:Dragons flight/AFD summary</a>, and solve a couple other problems along the way, I propose a simplified AfD script that will standardize the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting terminology (a pulldown with a list of 5 or 6 options will help to automize the vote counting process, and largely eliminate votes like <b>keep and rewrite, or delete</b>)</li>
<li>Terms used in justifying votes (e.g. nn, vanity, cruft, and other terms which may offend the public should be <i>automatically</i> instituted by a script in a way so as not to offent the public, such as "Notability is debated", "Article may not justify claims of notability", "Scope of popularity is debated". Such lubricated terms will never make it into common use if they are being input manually, and thus a script that can be used universally would be a huge plus)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the functions could be shared between the adding and voting procedures, and it would save time, face, pain, and also make the AfD much more welcoming for bots and scripts to analyze, as well as other projects such as WikiProject Deletion sorting. The script could build on AutoAFD.js and afd_helper, though I don't know how much of a help that would be. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 08:46, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I understand your proposal correctly, I agree with Splash. This would seem to lock us into true "voting" and basing our decisions on pre-established positions rather than discussion and consensus-seeking. It might work for the simpler discussions but often the best solution is one which can not be reduced to 5 or 6 preset options. The complicated decisions require nuance and thought. Our current process requires effort both on the part of the participants and on the part of the closer. That seems appropriate for a decision as important as whether or not a topic should be included in the encyclopedia.<br />
As to your second bullet about automatically re-editing comments so as not to offend, frankly, that seems like a slippery slope. No matter what wording you choose, some people will decide to be offended. Readers who choose to be offended today are already ignoring what we've written many different places about how specific terms are defined and used here.

Architecturally, I always felt that the nearby catering college, called the Toast Rack because (believe it or not) the main building was designed after a toast rack and the hall was shaped like a gigantic fried egg, were more interesting architecturally.

<p>After three "keep" contributions, the nominator decided to withdraw the AfD, and removed the notice from the article. I've replaced it, and explained that things aren't that easy — but what next?

<ul>
<li>We've generally held that the nomination may not be withdrawn but that it may be permissible for the deletion nomination to be closed early. In this case, that seems appropriate. I think you did the right thing by letting someone else close the discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:57, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As far as I know, pretty much anyone can close an afd and remove the tag from an article when the nominator withdraws and there are no votes to delete, per <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a>.

<li>If everybody is voting keep, I see no reason the nominator can't just close the thing themself. Anybody wishing ot pursue deletion is free to either re-open, or launch a new AFD (as a speedy close, doesn't set a precedent in such cases). Surely, this is a nice time-saver for everybody. Often, people make nominations, having no idea of the level of support for an article. Or they make mistakes, like nominating, when they want an unconsented merge/redirect (like a duplicate article, with a misspelling) or just some general cleanup. Let's just make things easy. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:44, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, nominators have been known to attempt to control "their" discussions. I've seen too many where the nominator tried to close the discussion in a fit of pique rather than as a result of reasoned discussion. That just creates more work and dissension when the other participants have to reopen the debate. I would not say that a nominator closing a discussion is automatically a bad-faith action but I would say that our general advice should encourage letting someone else speedy-close it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 20:48, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I removed the following sentence from this section: "*<b>Make a good-faith effort to notify the creator and/or main contributor(s)</b> of the article <b>before nominating</b>, as they may be able to address concerns raised." I have nominated many articles for deletion, using AfD, prod, and the speedy deletion tags, and never notified anyone. I find the whole process of getting articles deleted to be cumbersome enough without the extra step of notifying the author and then, presumably, waiting around for days for them to respond or whatever. If the original authors should be notified, then Wikipedia's software should do this automatically. I assume someone will revert my change, but please discuss this here after you do so. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 02:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no extra "waiting around". You make the nomination, and notify the user, who has five days, like everybody else. It avoids somebody coming back after a weak break, to find an article gone for no reason. Often the creator is able to answer important questions, and fix the article. That's a good thing, especially for certain topic areas, such as with mainly non-English sources, or requiring specialized knowledge to understand. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:20, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I misinterpreted it slightly. As written, with the emphasis on "before nominating", it seemed to me that one was supposed to notify the person and then not nominate until they had a chance to respond, which would certainly have been cumbersome. Still, though, if it's so important that the original author be notified, why doesn't the software do this automatically? It's a waste of everyone's time making people do this manually. And is it really necessary for some vandal to be notified that his "bob johnson is a fag" article is about to be speedy deleted, or for some teenager to be notified that his garage band article is up for deletion? --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 02:37, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I revised it, to be less demanding, in insisting "before". I think often talking to the creator before is good, but circumstances vary. I think even in obvious delete cases, like a kid's garage bands, its good to notify them, as it avoids them just remaking it when it goes "missing", it helps educate them about wikipedia, and it promotes good faith if worded properly. We might not want a particular article, but we still want them. I think you're {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-attack_4f04.html" title="Template:Db-attack">db-attack</a>}} example is something to be addressed on <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, not here. I think in such cases, a message should be given to the creator, warning them not to repeat it. As for getting a bot to do the notices, that would be great. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:56, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To me this has always implied article ownership. No one owns an article just because they made the first edit... right? You shouldn't have to run deletion by the "owner" of the article. If you want to, fine... sometimes it does make sense... but only in situations where you aren't sure about something and think they can help. -<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:01, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notifying somebody you're going to try and delete something, is not conceding ownership, as the deletion will go forward regardless. Anybody who thinks they "own" an article, probably won't need notice, as they're probably watching "their articles" like a hawk. Notification is more for the person who made something and doesn't think about it every day since (but might still have helpful input). A common reason for AFDs, is lack of sources. The creator is almost always in the best position to add such sources, which can then be reviewed. Often, something isn't findable in Google, but once the sources are cited, it's easily verifiable by others. Also, if somebody made a really bad article, surely they should be told, before they proceed to make a slew more, each to be deleted. Why not prevent such articles from being created? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying it's a bad idea to notify. Just the idea of forcing it rubs me the wrong way, and I still say it implies ownership (forcing it creates a right to notification, and why do they get special rights concerning "their" articles unless they "own" them?) I see it as optional, but definently strongly encouraged, to notify. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:26, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I put it in after the discussion above. The purpose is to get <i>someone who might have a clue about the article</i>, so it doesn't get nominated by one person on the basis of their own ignorance and voted "delete" by three others on the basis of their ignorance.

It boils down to how important people think it is to make a good argument... but I don't think trying to force people into it is going to work. Encourage it yes, but forcing it isn't practical.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AfD notification template</span></h2>
<p>Since one didn't seem to exist, I have created a template to notify people that an article they've editted is being listed on AfD. See <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAFDWarning_4e8e.html" title="Template:AFDWarning">Template:AFDWarning</a> if interested. If we're going to try to encourage nominators inform various editors of AfDs, we might as well make it less tedius. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subsections in AfD entries?</span></h2>
<p>Several AfD have had subsections added to them by the use of multiple "equal sign" symbols. Is there a policy on that? Personally I think it confuses things - after it's done, which section are additional contributors supposed to add their comments to? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 06:05, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggesting notification rather than forcing it</span></h2>
<p>I've changed the wording on <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_footer_abd7.html" title="Template:AfD footer">Template:AfD footer</a> to suggest but not require editor notification. As I stated above, I believe creating a "right to notification" implies article ownership. I don't think there's consensus to require notification <i>before</i> nominating. I mean, if I'm wrong, this is not something I want to go against consensus on, but I think we need to clear this up before adding mandatory rules to the process. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:10, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guideline is fine. (Difference: policy is hard rules for everyone; guidelines are for clueful good-faith editors.) Making a good-faith effort is all we can ask, in practice. Basically, if they're a logged-in editor, they deserve the courtesy.</dd>

<dd>I've also added "If you created the article, please don't take offense. Instead, please do consider improving the article so that it meets the Wikipedia inclusion criteria." to {{<a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">vfd</a>}}, as I did to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} (where it seems to be accepted). Despite rules on article ownership, having your creation nominated for deletion feels like someone's knifing your baby (even when it's well-deserved, which it usually is); there's no reason to fail to be polite about it - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 19:50, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only thing I object to about this notice (on both vfd and prod) is that some topics just aren't suitable for inclusion, like vanity articles. Asking them to improve it and subsequently deleting it anyway might seem disingenuous. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:15, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wonder if ""If you contributed to the article" might not be better. Creator makes sense if the article was recently created and no one else has worked on it, which is not always true of AfD. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:47, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
