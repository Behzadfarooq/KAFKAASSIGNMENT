<li>SPUI is right. The thing is that while Interstates were built with 90% Federal funding, they were built by state highway departments, so there would be discontinuities anyway until the various parts were connected. Moreover, within states they were often built in segments. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 16:23, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that something like <a href="http://www.us-highways.com/tempi.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.us-highways.com/tempi.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> would be useful, as it documents the specific cases when the in-between nonupgraded sections were actually <b>signed</b> as a <i>TEMPORARY</i> Interstate. It might be useful to have a page with more details of that (probably actually combined with a list of Interstates signed as <i>FUTURE</i>). More details would be nice, as some of these may have only existed on maps, while old signage photos could prove the existence (and believe me, those signage photos do often exist, though they are many times very hard to find - the state DOT is one option, as many have photolog systems). --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 17:02, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>These 20+ articles about the town of <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmeston%2C_New_York_1b7f.html" title="Edmeston, New York">Edmeston, New York</a> contain very detailed data about a small New York town over the past 250 years. Some of the pages contain oddly-formatted or frivolous text; letters, poems, pov comments glorifying the town. Others contain one-line bios of major town figures (and list where those figures have been referenced in the wider world).</p>

<dd><i>Why not a separate "History of Edmeston, New York" article?</i> Because the town isn't important enough for people to expect to find an article by that title.</dd>
<dd><i>Why not a subpage</i>? Because subpages are often considered harmful in the main namespace.</dd>
<dd><i>How easy will the merge be?</i> The source material is not in a very natural format for merging; different sections have wilely varying tones. But the sectioning into people/schools/businesses/churches/houses is excellent (and a model for future city articles), so an improved outline would not be difficult.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Initially I was excited to see such a well-crossreferenced collection of local information, but then I saw there were places where the subarticles had random text that suggested someone (the uploader? the authors of some original source material?) was just fooling around. And clearly the pages need extensive sourcing to avoid being removed as original research. I'd like to hear Nonenmac weigh in on these points.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd like to see us cut Nonenmac some slack. I see no harm in unevenness of coverage, that's endemic to Wikipedia, so the fact that Edmeston is covered ten or fifty times more thoroughly than other towns is OK. I do <i>not</i> like to see the material splattered around a score of separate articles. Given that 32K is hallowed by tradition as an acceptable article length, and that there's general agreement that 32K is not a hard limit—I think <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is over 70K now—I'd suggest that the information be merged into as small a number of articles, preferably one, that the merge be done as soon as possible, and gradually cleaned up and trimmed of extraneous matter over time.</dd>
<dd>One humongously long undisciplined article that needs cleanup is perfectly acceptable to me.</dd>
<dd>Many of the source quotations, "oral-history-like" material should be trimmed down or omitted. They should illustrate some point that's being said about the town, not just appear unexplained on their own. The full versions can go in Wikisource.</dd>
<dd>I don't think there could be any possible objection to Nonenmac keeping any or all of this material as subpages of his user page while he's working on it, as the work is obviously Wikipedia-related.</dd>
<dd>In the Wikipedia main namespace, the final result should look like a long, detailed article about Edmeston, not like the loose contents of an "Edmeston historic archive" file drawer in a dusty cabinet in the back room of the public library. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:36, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is NOT about whether it is notable or not! Please understand that! At the time of listing it looked like an ad. The User therefore did the right thing, WP does not allow ads.

<li><b>Keep</b> I see no reason to delete it. I created the article mostly because it was already linked to, also I have seen articles for other wikis on Wikipedia.

<li>Yawn. No, I'm not a member of NSF, but I do have a vested interest in its well-being, that's all I meant. The NSF isn't a subgroup, either...it's more like a semi-autonomous collective under the cDc umbrella. But whatever. I didn't mean that cDc's having done more than BO was relevant to this discussion; I was merely responding to the previous "delete" vote that seemed to imply that it did. I was actually about to suggest that the NSF article be reverted to a redirect to <a href="../../../c/u/l/CULT_OF_THE_DEAD_COW_6e76.html" title="CULT OF THE DEAD COW">CULT OF THE DEAD COW</a>, but I see that you've already suggested that. So, that's my vote. <strike><b>Redirect</b></strike> for now, until when/if there's ever more notable content. And what does Sn0wflake mean by cDc being "contestably notable?" Just curious. I have no interest in arguing about this. --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long</a> 12:33, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It becomes clear now. Your original paragraph can be read two ways. I read it as your putting forward the fact that you are a cDc member as the actual rationale for keeping this article, rather than as your simply providing full disclosure of a personal bias. I cannot answer your question about what <a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> wrote; but it wasn't really addressed to me. In turn my second question still stands, addressed to the world in general. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:37, 2005 Apr 18 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I realize that my original comment was ambiguous. I just meant to disclose personal bias. And no, right now, I don't think the NSF is particular encyclopedic. Hence my vote for redirect. That isn't to say that it will not someday be encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">Myles Long</a> 17:01, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>None of the articles linked on this disambiguation page actually need disambiguation.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a>. The list of "famous Roberts" is pretty useless though, don't merge. We've got dozens of similar pages; this one's more legit than <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan.html" title="Joan">Joan</a>, for example. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> | <a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">Talk</a> 04:32, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that it's silly, but redirects are cheap and harmless. Anyway, no one's actually going to <i>search</i> for "Robert (disambiguation)". Maybe you meant <i>wikilink</i>. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> | <a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">Talk</a> 16:30, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I mean "search". The main purpose of a redirect page is to help with searches. If the name of the page is something nobody ever searchs for, that purpose isn't served. You could still link to it, but you usually want to avoid linking to redirect pages. Especially when the name of the redirect page is "Robert (disambiguation)"!!!! ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 20:56, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Searching is <i>one</i> of the purposes for a redirect page but hardly the "main purpose" and certainly not the only purpose. Redirects also preserve attribution history (a requirement of GFDL), prevent broken links, aid in accidental linking, etc. See <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/redirect" class="extiw" title="meta:redirect">meta:redirect</a> for more. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:26, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right. My statement of the purpose of redirects was much too narrow, and there are many other purposes. But you haven't demonstrated that <i>any</i> of those purposes is served by having a redirect page named "Robert (disambiguation)". ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:31, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: I stumbled across this when trying to write up <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Robert_a44d.html" title="Saint Robert">Saint Robert</a>. In most cases, given name articles go to the most famous person known only by that name <b>if</b> there is only one. Otherwise, they're disambiguations. After I saw the wretchedness of the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> article, where it <i>wasn't</i> a dab but rather yet another bar-bet trivia game "List of," I decided to manually merge in the people who needed to be disambiguated, and then let the silliness go forth. If <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> is a proper dab, then there is no need for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a>, and it should be deleted as duplicate content. Further, I would love to see the "list of favorite Roberts" have a mysterious accident in the night and disappear from the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> page as well. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:39, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW, no articles link to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:42, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I realize now that the above was not clear. Here is a chronology, as best as I can see it:
<dl>
<dd>Someone wrote <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> as a "List of Famous Roberts."</dd>
<dd>When that conflicted with the usual Wikipedia practice, the answer (!) was to create a <i>new</i> page called <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a> rather than knocking the stuffing out of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a>.</dd>
<dd>When I went to write up the saint, I was full of outrage, so I looked up all the "Robert of" people I could find and listed them in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> above the silly list. I left the silly list as something not worth fighting over.</dd>
<dd>Given that the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> article now has that disambiguation, there is no need for the disambiguation page as a separate entity. I'm not responsible for the "Famous Robert" stuff, and I would love to see it go away altogether. Any editor can do that, of course. Once the disambig. page goes away, the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a> page should get the dab tag, and then it will be in order to delete all that trivia contest stuff. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:36, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's two votes to merge with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a>, but still no positive statement to justify having a list of people named "Robert".

<li>Comment: Ok, so folks were arguing that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a> should be merged into <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a>. That has been done. Now that it <i>has</i> been done, the only question that remains is whether or not to have a redirect from <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert.html" title="Robert">Robert</a>. I assume no one thinks such a thing is logical? Since no articles link to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Robert (disambiguation)">Robert (disambiguation)</a> and there is no unique content and it is a secondary search term, I will, if I see no objections, delete it as in process. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:09, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The whole concept of "<a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronations</a>" is lame -- most of them are nothing more than social clubs, and none of them have any legal basis.

So they're entitled to articles. I <i>would</i> like to see articles that don't assume that Micronations have exactly the same status as "real" countries. They need to present themselves to a sceptical outer world. That means more talk more about what they're trying to accomplish, and less about their organizational trivia.

<li>I didn't strawman your argument. Your very words were "<i>So they're entitled to articles.</i>".

<li>Not having month or two to spare, I can do no more than skim your list. Maybe there's a strong precedent for not giving Micronations articles. If so, I'm not inclined to fight the trend -- as I said before, I consider the whole concept lame. Still, I notice that, after a lengthy battle, the most notorious micronation, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>, retained its article. Indeed, that article would be a nice model for other Micronation articles, since it takes the time to document the scepticism over its premise. Another model: <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_%28group%29_9579.html" title="Republic of Texas (group)">the Republic of Texas</a>.---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 22:07, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Maybe there's a strong precedent for not giving Micronations articles.</i> — The precedent is mixed, because the issue is complex, and varies from case to case.

<li><i>that article would be a nice model for other Micronation articles</i> — You're thinking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about model articles, and clearly thinking that the criteria are whether the article has been polished to some standard of presentation. The actual criteria applied are far more to do with the <i>subject</i> rather than the quality of the article. Note that <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_%28group%29_9579.html" title="Republic of Texas (group)">Republic of Texas</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Sealand_4512.html" title="Principality of Sealand">Principality of Sealand</a> <i>both stake claims to physical territory</i>, and indeed have both been in (somewhat one-sided) conflicts over those claims, whereas the Republic of Atlasia has no claimed geography at all, for example. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:34, 2005 Apr 23 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b>: I'd like to point out that there is another micronation on Wikipedia, the Virtual Commonwealth of Cyberia, that is much smaller than our own, and yet their page is for some reason allowed to remain.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Vanity. Advertising. Non-notable micronation. Wikipedia is inconsistent. The existence of other micronation articles is not a reason to keep this one. Nominate the others for deletion if they are not notable. I don't think a traffic court would revoke a ticket for going 15 mph over the limit just because other cars were going 20 mph over.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable in terms of its impact on hip-hop, or in terms of its record sales. See also its Talk Page where I discuss this same thing. It's just another out of thousands and thousands of unnotable rap songs. Note that this is not the similarly titled song by Eminem, which is more noteworthy, one can say. This is a single by Knocc-Turn'Al (featuring Snoop Dogg) that was released last year or so, without making much of a buzz. Decius 05:36, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and someone should add info about the Eminem song. The fact that other rap songs don't yet have articles is not a valid justification for deleting this article. Also, please remember to properly follow the instructions when nominating an article for deletion. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 06:18, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As I said, this song is a lame-duck, and it shouldn't have an article. I know my Hip-Hop, and this song is literally nothing. But aside from that, the "justification for deletion" is that it is not notable enough to have an Encyclopedia article: like I said, it has virtually no significance in Hip-Hop, and its sales were sluggish. I'm in Los Angeles, and nobody blinked an eye over this song when it came out (and the artist is from Los Angeles). Dj's in Los Angeles Radio Stations barely played the record for a few weeks, then dropped it in the bin. Decius 06:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have a compromise: the single "The Way I Am" is not notable to have an article, but this single is contained on his Album, which was also titled "The Way I Am". The Album, though it was modest in sales &amp; impact, is worth having an article, so I'm going to redirect the song article to the new Album article. Decius 07:50, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's been settled---the article is now about the Album. If someone is interested in this artist, then please expand the article and format it as other Album articles are formatted. And I would hope that next time a person thinks before starting an article about an inconsequential song. The former article about the song no longer exists, and we are no longer taking votes on it. The new article about the Album is not being voted on here. Decius 08:44, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>thank you Anilocra for wikifying article. Its much better now. According to Nixie, it sounds like "vanity" just because the band has yet to release a single. Well, according to Wikipedia <i>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional."</i> Anilocra rectified the tone of the whole thing, it sounds RIGHT now, and the band has been given consistent press-coverage from some papers for months now, just for the record: Neston News, Ellesmere Port Standard, Ellesmere Port Pioneer, Wirral Globe, Liverpool Daily Post. The band has done radio shows in Brazil (Garagem, one of the most popular shows on one of Sao Paulo's biggest stations,Brasil 2000 FM) and they were played on BBC Radio by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Lamacq_8dac.html" title="Steve Lamacq">Steve_Lamacq</a> as well. I say, just leave it. Given time, it'll naturally grow, its not Vanity. Starcrossed</li>

The single "Hangmen" is being released next Mondaywith artwork by Jamie Reid who did the covers for the Sex Pistols albums. This is borderline.

<li>Yes, IMO the lack of an allmusic.com or artistdirect.com entry for most bands would have seen a delete vote, however the BBC and Channel 4 coverage at least verifies their existance and some degree, albeit small, of notability. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:52, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also it is mentioned on other pages -- <a href="http://www.googlism.com/what_is/s/shithead/" class="external text" title="http://www.googlism.com/what_is/s/shithead/" rel="nofollow">like this</a>. When I was involved with a website called nofuncharlie we sponsored this festival and there was a story about it on our website. It was quite funny, and apparently got some feedback from burning man people (there was something on the website for it). The festival definitely exists (or existed). It's true that copies of wikipedia come up most on google but that just shows how pervasive wikipedia is, IMHO. I think this is a legitimate parody and should not be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 12:41, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>! - Just because this site is down now doesn't mean that it wasn't real for a long time. I should know, I hosted it. I own the domain and will put the site up again when time allows. I have been to every Burning Shithead Festival that ever existed. If you don't believe it's real, come to the Best Western Inn and Gardens in Twenty Nine Palms California over Labor Day and see what happens there... shithead is indeed burned... This isn't even a parody of burning man, it is real!... NoFunCharlie

<li>What constitutes "happening" in your estimation? According to archive.org, the website for the festival goes back 5 years.

<li>The fact these sites tell me zilch about this event is what I consider to be "happening." I took your opinion under consideration and checked the links you posted. An impromtu gathering on public land isn't encyclopedic, isn't notable and barely verifiable if it's verifiable at all. I see press releases every day. The local papers do a good job of covering local events, even the esoteric ones. It wouldn't be hard to remember something called the "Burning Shithead Festival." I stand by my vote and my opinion. - Lucky 6.9 22:29, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe that we've made it quite clear that we don't consider this to be a hoax, so much as a satirical website created as a joke.

<li>Again, fair enough; I was just responding to those who have been calling this a hoax. I agree that this festival is satire; when I originally put the page up it said this was created as a parody of burning man, and I think it is fair to say it is satirical.

<li>Ah, our good friend the Wayback Machine! Well, I don't really know. Burning cereal sounds a bit naff to me. I could grab a couple of inebriated friends, burn (object here), eventually recruit more and more friends for future years, set up a website about it, and say it is an important part of Wikipedia. Now maybe that's a bit exaggerated, and I'm not intending to offend anyone by saying that, but, really, where do we draw the line?</li>

<li>As per Idont's suggestion, I had a look round Google to see what's up with our man Renato. As it happens, all three of his names are exceedingly common in Portuguese, and that's why Google produces so many hits. It's as if an English-speaker were named John Smith Brown or similar. This particular Renato is what he says he is; a 26-year-old Brazilian living in South Africa, which is a fine thing to be, but info better left to a user page.

(I've also blanked a whole load of personally identifying information including telephone numbers and home addresses.)

Although their assertion of 500+ converts may be non-factual, due to the nature of religious freedom burden of proof is on those claiming Matrixism is a hoax, and currently there's nothing other than negative data (specifically, that there's nothing indicating its existence but the website and a number of posts on various boards from a few IP addresses). Under the circumstances, removing references to Matrixism soley because it might be a hoax asserts the POV that it is a hoax. Removing references to it for other reasons (lacks numbers/significance for its own artcle, doesn't belong in articles about the movie) may well be valid, but these don't prevent reference to Matrixism in an article where it evidently does belong, specifically <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">New religious movement</a>; and they should not prevent redirect of this stub to that article. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickAir8P__511d.html" title="User:KickAir8P~">KickAir8P~</a> 16:49, 2005 Apr 19 (UTC)

<li>Well, see, here's the thing. The two oracle games (Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Time) partially overlap, and allow you to take powerups from one to the other. They contain 64 rings in various hidden places (such as gasha trees), most of which have minor or trivial effects, and none of which are required to complete the game. Zelda fans strive to collect them all, which is significantly harder (because of randomness, mainly) than getting all heart pieces. A list of all 64 rings and where to find them would be appropriate on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamefaqs.html" title="Gamefaqs">Gamefaqs</a>. But probably not here. <b>Weak delete</b> as such, althouhgh a merge would be a possibility as well. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:54, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)
