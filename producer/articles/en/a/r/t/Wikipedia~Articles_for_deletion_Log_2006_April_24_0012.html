<p>This is part of a walled garden of almost a hundred articles that I proposed for deletion. All PROD tags have been removed, so they come here. I'll nominate them one at a time or in small groups to avoid problems like those seen with the mass nomination of Polynesian mythology articles. This is obviously fancruft, highly specific material about a fictional world. These articles go into excrutiating detail on the specifications of fictional giant robots from a Japanese cartoon. It's not of general or encyclopedic appeal, and this series already has a Wiki at WikiCities anyway. It needs to go. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Declaring your intention to mass-nominate articles relating to a massively popular, genre-defining franchise seems like bad faith to me. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 06:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While I don't like SEED much, it's worth to keep. No general interest? Gundam is consider to be largest mecha franchise in Japan. Delete these article would be like delete all <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>'s article like <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-AT_3fef.html" title="AT-AT">AT-AT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-ST</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-PT_191c.html" title="AT-PT">AT-PT</a>(and there are TWO wiki web for Star Wars already as well). Not that I don't like Star Wars, but Japaneese anime is a form of art too. If mecha and spaceship from American's sci-fi movie can be include here in Wikipedia, why mecha from Japaneese sci-fi anime can't? <a href="../../../l/-/z/User%7EL-Zwei_cc56.html" title="User:L-Zwei">L-Zwei</a> 06:15, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would vote the same way on those article. I do want to reiterate your point and Redxiv's though; Gundam is a huge franchise and arguably genre defining. Kotepho 06:27, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> summaries into some kind of list if there isn't one already. <b>Delete</b> if such a list already exists. Fictional robots that are not actually iconic (like <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> or <a href="../../../r/2/d/R2D2_f23a.html" title="R2D2">R2D2</a>) do not need articles of their own; but the Gundam series is important enough to deserve more detail than most mecha anime. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcherXRin_d58e.html" title="User:ArcherXRin">ArcherXRin</a> 11:08, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, we'll still have articles on porn stars.

Obviously without all the detailed in depth articles on a robot that appeared for three seconds in a Japanese anime in 1997, there's no point. After all, Wikipedia is such a pathetic idea we couldn't possibly compete with *real* encyclopedias.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> into Weapons in Gundam universe or somesuch -- there are two or three orders of magnitude in terms of cultural notability between SW/ST and even the world's most popular manga, and even the SW cruft should be merged into less nerdily completist articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 04:02, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> as explained above Lone Jobber 06:34, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<li><b>Delete</b> its a pity since a bit of effort has gone into it, but unsourced and POV issues are troublesome. "Ansatsuken" comes up with less than 1,000 sites in google which is pretty low in regards to Street Fighter and raises doubts about notability. Decent addition to the Ryu, Sean etc pages, but not encyclopedic enough for an individual article. --Cini 02:22, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here is that "Ansatsuken" is not notable enough for an entry as it merely is a name for lethal martial arts that can apply to any number of styles; whereas "Goutetsu-ryu Ansatsuken" is not even a term recognized by canon but sounds plausible enough to give the novice an impression that Ansatsuken is somehow tied to the general Hadoken/Shoryuken styles of the SF stars. Neither one is encyclopedic, and the latter is extremely tenuous as Capcom-sanctioned guides have next to nothing about the "Hadou" and "Shoryuu" style beyond their names. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 19:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, lots of original research here, I'm afraid. I've <i>never</i> heard these terms "Ansatsuken-Jitsu" and "Ansatsuken-Do" before and I'd really like to see some sources for them. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan1975_6e49.html" title="User:Evan1975">Evan1975</a> 23:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Rename, Restore or Move</b> I think the major stem source for this problem is that people gave the martial arts a non-canon name. There IS a fictional martial arts practiced in the SF universe, much like 'Special Forces' style, but it doesn't require it's own page. It could easily be broken up and placed on Ryu and Akuma's pages respectively, much like how Dan has Saiyko-ryuu on his page. There's alot of good content and information on that page that can't be found anywhere else, and while I admit that alot of people went overboard, adding a bunch of move names on the list that could easily be placed on the respective characters profile pages, deleting it would sever alot of good tidbits and a single merging of alot of netural information. I think the page should just be restored to one of it's older variations. Sean Matsuda 03:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and merge</b> at the current time. This article was bare-bones fact and essential in one of its older versions, but as time accumulated more content was added for the sake of inclusion. Its become stupidly large and unsourced. We don't do that at wikipedia. I'm afraid I can no longer support the entire exsistance of this article. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 17:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom.

<li>A single user deciding he'll go on a one-man crusade against a subject he's too unfamiliar with to tell what's notable and what's not seems like bad faith to me. And he's admitted that he wants to wipe out the Gundam articles. He said as much in his cluster of AfDs. Also, his methodology seems disengenuous to me. He's arbitrarily grouped articles together for mass AfDs, but logically the should all be in a single AfD. The debate is over whether any articles along the lines of the ones nominated should exist, not over any specific article. The impression I get is that he's going for a shotgun approach. If he succeeds in getting some of these articles deleted, even if others survive AfD, he'll use the deleted ones as precedent for a new round of AfDs. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 23:06, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I thought much the same myself, come to that. There's a lot of "said as much" and "seems like" in Redxiv's reply, and not a lot of actual fact in the heap of inferences ... never mind complaining that this isn't in one giant AfD, given the complaints about giant AfDs. Should we start speculating about the lack of good faith of the Gundam crowd in passionately defending each and every article, no matter how trivial (an article for every individual <b>weapon system</b>?!?) and launching unprovoked personal attacks? This would work a great deal more smoothly if there was less "he's out to GET US" rhetoric and more focusing on the merits of the argument. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

Furthermore, Wikipedia is meant to be a treasure trove of knowledge on almost ANY subject that anyone can add to and enhance, these Wikis are nothing more than the culmination of hard work from various fans. And finally, just because someone else made their own Wiki doesn't mean that any and all articles on the subject of the Fan-Wiki should be deleted from the real Wikipedia, this is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguement.

<li><small>Actually, Star Trek does have its own wiki, and Star Trek articles are nominated for deletion and deleted or merged on a regular basis. It's not that we don't want articles on fictional subjects. But those fictional subjects have to be notable, meaning they have to have been referenced by reliable, third-party sources. The Star Trek wiki (MemoryAlpha) was created precisely for this reason, because a lot of hard-core fans were writing articles that were obscure even within the Star Trek universe. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 18:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If it would be possible I would like to know Mr. Crawford's reasons for deleting this article. The Gundam series is a very successful and old series. It is more popular than most anime out there. So why are we trying to delete something that is viewed by its hundreds of thousand fans. This article is very informative despite it being a made up show about "anthropomorphic robots with japanese swords" (extreme paraphrase).

<li>I won't comment on whether this article should be kept or deleted. I will say that the "car fender" comments in the nomination are unhelpful, irrelevant, and do not help the impression that this nomination and others like it are based on personal dislike of the subject rather than an effort to improve the encyclopedia. I'll also echo Iceberg3k's comment above, in that the vast majority of Brian G. Crawford's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brian_G._Crawford_d18e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brian G. Crawford">contributions</a> consist of participating in the deletion proccess, often times supporting the deletion of articles on fictional characters and the like.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Gundam is a highly verfiable, notable, and revalant to the topic. If you delete this, than all other fictional conflicts would have to be delted as well. How can you understand a series if you have no context of it? What's the War in star wars? Why is Starfleet going arround and doing stuff? Without this context, the reader will have little idea what the point of the series, or why it is important. --Eldarone 18:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi, I meant to imply that I was Irish by the placement of my vote above, but that was bit subtle&#160;:-) The case itself is pretty notable in Ireland but I'd never heard of Salafia before Wiki. He has been mentioned a few times in the media all right but they had escaped me - someone who followed the news closely would probably have heard the name but I'd be surprised if 5% of a random sample in a Dublin street would know who he is. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 21:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you for taking the time to debate my entry to Wikipedia. Today I sent to following mail to Mr Haworth, who nominated the article for deletion:</li>
</ul>
<p>Dear Mr Haworth,</p>
<p>Thank you for putting the issue of the proposed deletion of my Wikipedia entry up for discussion. I am new, as you know, and am not sure how and where to respond to the issues.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I decided to write the page is because I was surprised to discover that I am mentioned in Wikipedia a few times, and thought it would be useful for everyone if I provided a link to basic factual information about myself.</p>
<p>In addition, I have appeared in a good deal of newspaper articles around the world, as a spokesperson for various groups and issues. I think it is important to those groups and issues that accurate information be available, in order to lend credibility to the statements made. Because it is my job to make the statements. For example I have been featured in the Irish Times 127 times since 2002. One of the latest is reprinted below.</p>
<p>As an aside, while I am taking evening classes, I am not a 'student' in the sense that I do work as a lawyer, but do not want to advertise that.</p>
<p>The Tara issue is high profile here in Ireland, and my case has just been appealed to the Supreme Court, so it will run for another couple of years. Much inaccurate information has appeared about me in the media, where I have been branded a "legal terrorist" and other things I won't mention.</p>

<dd><s>Forgot to mention I'm Irish, but I think this has more to do with policy than notoriety. Due to the contentious road building program in Ireland, this guy, who is at the forefront of opposition campaigns is going to come up in articles related to the program, and Ireland is seeing huge development in this area, so I would expect articles to be developed around this topic see <a href="../../../n/3/_/N3_road.html" title="N3 road">N3 road</a> &amp; <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_of_Tara_05aa.html" title="Hill of Tara">Hill of Tara</a>, so having bio article about this guy would not conflict with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but it cannot be created and substantially written by himself.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> is a guideline, not a policy. There is no reason to Delete this article just because it is written by the subject. If it contains factual information and is NPOV (which it seems to me it does) it is fine as it is. If it does have some NPOV, that can be salvaged by others editing the article, there is no reason to delete it and then start from scratch IMHO. <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETuathal_b8c8.html" title="User:Tuathal">User:Tuathal</a> did not try to hide that it was an autobiography and there is no reason to suspect foul play.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article actually answered a question of mine. About the poem of Mörike, not about the comic book.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Due to the use of the word prior to Elfen Lied, there is a valid claim for an article separate to EL, as per Azate. But yes, it could do with tidying.

<dd>You missed my point, which was that if all the timelines are added to the list that should be (it doesn't matter by whom) then the list will be too long to be one page anymore.

<dd>When it gets that long where it is almost complete then we can examine our options such as deletion. For the time being, considering it is all on one page and far from complete, deletion is obviously premature. Of course, it is also possible that many of our existing timeline pages would themselves be merged or deleted over time, thereby eliminating the risk that the list would ever achieve a length that would even suggest the need for deconsolidation. Not that this is intended in any way to disparage the often very real benefits derived from spinning-off articles and lists. Despite your well-meaning question that seems to view AfD as a discounting mechanism establishing a net present value for articles based on future editing flows, my personal timeline for forming an opinion on AfD only runs for five days. Put simply, I am uncomfortable with a capital sentence rendered for alleged future crimes. In the present case, now well beyond my timeline due to the quite unfortunate initial close, no crime has been committed so the judgement must be to acquit. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see absolutely no legitimate reason to delete this perfectly good, well establiahed article.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Whilst many editors seem to be convinced that this is either a game guide or "cruft", it actually has the form of a glossary of the type that is quite common on Wikipedia, and there is significant evidence that the bulk of the terms are in common use and are referenced on relevant gaming sites. The popularity of this particular game and the sheer size of the population of players is also a factor here. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:48, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While video games may be set in fictional "worlds", they, themselves, are <i>not</i> fictional - I'm looking at one sitting on my desk right now.

<dd>My apologies, I realized after I wrote "fictional" the way I did that it could be misconstrued as negative; I didn't mean it that way. What I meant was that while the video game industry itself is a specialized(and lucrative) field, I don't think the product itself is deserving of that consideration. Users of the game may specialize, but to me that is fandom.

<li><b>Keep</b> as a valid, non game-guide glossary. At the very least, the crustophobes should realize that having a single page to put all of this stuff is better than having people create and recreate all the items on this page over and over as separate pages.

<li>I was thinking mnore of an anti-video-game. Whether conscious or not, people often have a POV about video games that they are less respectable(and therefore something you'd less likely associate with an encyclopedia) than non-video games and I'm betting many people that voted delete here would vote keep should the bridge glossary go up for deletion(the fact that it hasn't seems to support this). If you have a good reason for how video game glossaries violate WP:NOT when non-video game glossaries don't, type it up and I'll change my vote. I'm not a fan of WoW myself, but I can't see how we can base a deletion on whether glossaries seem "encyclopedic" or "cruftish" and not be POV. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 02:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but <b>Expand/Rewrite</b>. The bridge glossary is a precedent, but this article is mostly a list of abbreviations common in the game. Arguably, some of this information, i.e. defining corpse camping, is glossary fodder as much as defining various bidding/signaling strategies in bridge. Bridge has a larger number of players, but that does not make a bridge glossary more encyclopaedic than a WoW glossary.

<p>We need consistency.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is the most absurd thing I have heard in a long time. Almost everyone I know has a particular hobby or interest, be it sports, gaming, art, models, etc. For just about every hobby I can think of, there are terms used to describe various elements within the hobby, but they are rarely heard outside of the special interest groups in which they are used. There is nothing wrong with that.

<li><b>Delete</b>. References to notability isnt provided. The article contends his study was "revolutionary", but only links to the research itself. Without specific proof that the study was indeed revolutionary, we should assume it probably wasnt.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The article IS sourced--it provides a link to his study, which was published in a peer review publication; it is clearly not "original research" because it was actually published in a respectable source and is therefore verifiable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Due to the haste with which some editors believe incomplete articles should be dealt with, I recommend you copy the article to your <b>user</b> space, work on it there, and bring it back to the main space when it is finished.

When expanding the article pay attention to the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline. There is no question that he co-wrote an article on paper-making technology, the question is whether it is "revolutionary."

<li><b>Comment</b> since I don't want to spam every single AFD this happened on, I'll just say it once here. Opining speedy keep based on "bad faith nomination" on a series of AfDs of deproded articles is the pot calling the kettle black. If you are going to opine Keep or Delete, at least do it based on the merits of the article.

<dd>Hence the "Pot and Kettle" comment.

<p>Non-notable is an interesting term. Just who gets to decide that and what are the implications to one of throwing it around flippantly? 105 people appoint someone a ranging expert...the august REDVERS...on whatever he wishes to rudely lambast and that is the basis of governance? Talk about the Wild West!</p>
<p>I notice there are not articles concerning Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones--easily two of the most important active political scientists in America by any serious expert's opinion...but no article on them? Obviously not notable. No article on Charles Perrow? Insignificant? No, forgive me, not notable. What would qualify one to call Charles Perrow or Dwight Waldo not notable, I wonder. Waldo has probably been read in Korean more than the sum total of all the people who will ever gaze upon REDVER's obscure writings he lists so pridefully at the bottom of his user page. What expertise and degree would you have called upon to state that Frederick C. Mosher is not notable when his work is translated in 8 languages and could probably be discussed by senior government officials in 10s of countries? I'm just curious what sort of definition of encyclopedia that might fulfill?</p>
<p>I was obviously mistaken in thinking that the purpose here is to start a thread that expands underexplored knowledge based on one's legitimate and demonstrable learning as expressed in articles. Now I find I did that only to have it ridiculed by the ignorant Mr. X...or REDVERS as he prefers. The Encyclopedia of Public Administration which would mirror most of what I put in here costs hundreds of dollars but would have been neither succinct nor wholly accurate. Just what is the point of the silly articles on obscure European punk bands and photos of even more obscure Belgian fountains you seem to prefer as content (if WP is not a free resource) when there is almost no discussion of the primary field that studies government bureaucracy and dozens of allied areas? I suppose it's just yet another Internet power trip of some frustrated and indenty-starved persons without the guts to sign their name or to discuss their qualifications on their web pages or in their edits. I suppose this resort to insult by REDVERS when someone has donated their time and expertise is deemed acceptable etiquette here. Shame. What a puny thing to do...to use your administrative authority to go through a contrib file to systematically delete contributions. That is strikingly ugly and remarkably small. People like you are exactly what the idea of free software and knowledge is not about. Oh dear. I had heard this was the deal of late here, but I was so naively hopeful. What a bizarre ethic you have; thank goodness we have relatively few power abusers as serious editors in the print world.

<li>Thank you for your kind response. First, I had read the BIO page specifically on professors just before reading your note. All of the above easily qualify if anyone bothered to speak to a human about their reputations and works. I was myself setting place markers in a field I was encouraging others including world famous professors regularly invited to speak to many persons listed in wiki articles (deemed now not-notable by REDVERS) to contribute. Dream on concerning that point now. Second, it was not me who launched into a systematic edit begun with a rather sociopathic insult. I believe REDVERS claims to be an administrator on his user page. I hope it is not the case, but he claimed 105 users gave him the "keys to the janitor closet." NPA is a fine policy. Where does the right to self-defense get written up? Where does the right to know what you are talking about prior to using an AfD get described? As an academic I am inclined to defend my words. Criticize the merit, but if you delete because you believe you think things are not significant, the burden should fall to you for justification in print prior to having the AfD power. I accept your other points and agree with them.</li>

It is not enough for you to assert that the accomplishments of these scholars is notable in their fields; each article needs to point to some independent reliable sources (as Uppland shows below through JSTOR). Also, the burden for any edit (whether a minor content change or the creation of a new article) is on the editor, to show with reference to Notability and Verifiability that the edit or article is justified. However, it certainly would have been more polite for someone to contact you and refer you to these policies, giving you a few days to work on the articles, before proposing them for deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:14, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you Thatcher131. Does verifiability mean consensus? Or does it mean expert opinion? There are trivially hundreds of articles written with facts that are not "verifiable" in some hard form every day. I am all for journalistic standards--to pitifully invoke credentialism, I have worked for someone on the Pulitizer Committee (who is not in Wikipedia) for the last two years. That is easily discoverable by someone who wishes to search about me. Is it "verified?" No. It is counter-sourced. I think this is a good and worthy project overall, but the goverance and the standards are where the hardcore should vett their expertise, not in AfD'ing article stubs. That should be a democratic process of the marketplace. If a new article is now hit within 30 days by an outsider, simply bot delete it as insignificant. Don't rely on the power-crazed to serial AfD with a two-word explanation. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Lanham_450b.html" title="User:Ryan Lanham">Ryan Lanham</a> 13:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verifability does not mean consensus or expert opinion. It means the claims are sourced in what would be considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As it states on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> page: "the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> Yes, there are loads of article out there that are not verifiably sourced... and there are at least a few people around here who go around tagging them for missing sources, contacting creators, etc. That's pretty much the nature of an open collaboration such as Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verifiability in some respects depends on the claim being made. If you are writing an article on John Smith that says he teaches and writes in the field of public administration, you should be able to provide a bibliography; not his entire CV, but selections showing his more notable accomplishments. If you want to say john Smith is the leading PA theoretician of the 21st century, you will need rather stronger proof, such as winning important prizes, or being recognized by the leading expert group in the field (for science in the US this would be the National Academy; I don't know what it would be in PA). If it is the unwritten consensus of the field that he is a leading figure, you will have a problem, but maybe he was the keynote speaker at an international conference, which would validate the unwritten consensus. To give one specific example, <i>you</i> can't say that Waldo's <i>The Administrative State</i> is the classic work in PA but you can quote <i>other sources</i> as saying so (such as textbooks, articles or reviews in peer-reviewed journals, and so forth). Post to my talk page if you want to discuss it further. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks again Isotope23. I apologize for my ignorance and will be more thoughtful in laying out pointers to sourcing in the future if I cool down enough to write again. What Uppland quite authoritatively and appropriately researched and wrote below I could have written off the top of my head, but I did not...I was trying to learn how to start writing here...what the style is. Perhaps one could tag new authors for particularly helpful comments until they reach a standard deemed "experienced" rather than spanking and alienating them. That is what many academic journals try to do. It is what all newspaper editors do. Regardless, I understand the point you make and that which is in the rules, and I agree to comply with it. Still, I would not be so quick to fall back on the rules as perfected. Those with more experience, I reiterate, probably can do more good by thinking through how those can work better and offering encouragement rather than using a heavy hand which is alienating in the extreme--accuracy is great as a norm in WP--public is an even better norm. There are trade-offs.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep all</b>, as this mass-nomination is clearly insufficiently researched. Recognized academic fields, recognized academic journals and leading academics in those fields are all notable. I just made a sample search for <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Waldo_6335.html" title="Dwight Waldo">Dwight Waldo</a>, as his was the longest of the biographical articles. "Dwight Waldo" gets 16,500 Google hits, 573 <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Books_5e58.html" title="Google Books">Google Books</a> hits and 906 <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Scholar_5e38.html" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> hits. "Dwight Waldo" also gets 1096 hits in the academic journals incuded in <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>. Hits on Waldo include books titled <i>Mastering Public Administration: From <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> to Dwight Waldo</i> (Chatham, N.J.: Chatham House, cop. 1989) and <i>A Search for Public Administration: The Ideas and Career of Dwight Waldo</i>, by Brack Brown &amp; Richard J. Stillman, II (College Station, Texas: Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1986). I am convinced of the good faith of the author and suspect that we would get similar results with several of the other articles. I might add that I had personally never heard of Waldo before. The <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Waldo_6335.html" title="Dwight Waldo">Dwight Waldo</a> article is actually posted on April 23 – any reason not to just give it more time, and perhaps add a {{unreferenced}} tag or something? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 03:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here is an ethic I can admire even if it serves my interests. Frankly, Max Stephenson is iffy at best. The rest are no brainers to public administration experts--as was budget theory which was summarily deleted--perhaps the most important topic in PA. On that I would frankly sign my name and stake my reputation--that is what academics do every day. Imagine the power of the summary delete. Imagine it. You can erase the words of another with 5 characters--that sort of power without a review--without a countersignature? This is the sort of governance issue that should constitute the meat of what is meant by "verifiability"--in short, checks and balances--not reputation is what should matter. Why not make all new articles provisional until they have been edited by at least 5 independent persons? Again, I would argue that these are the sorts of administrative ethical processes that need to exist in WP...not some empowered idea of an administrator who relies hugely on discretion. By the way, anyone who knows something about administrative discretion of public bureaucrats--which clearly WP administrators are--would associate the idea with the "not-notable" John A. Rohr and his not-notable contributions to Refounding Public Administration while he was at an non-notable CPAP studying the non-notable theorist Dwight Waldo and other things.

<li><b>Keep all</b> per Uppland, and thanks for his principled intervention. "Non-notable" is too easily thrown around here for non-pop culture subjects. Unless you have some standing to assess notability in public administration, you simply aren't credible.

Take the Waldo article, for example. It sets off with: <i>Perhaps the defining figure in modern public administration and public management and recognized the world over for his contributions to the theory of bureaucratic government, Waldo is only now taking his place as one of the most important political scientists of the last 100 years.</i> That's quite a congeries of claims, and, intended or otherwise, it has a strong reek of PoV.

As far as notability goes, there's no clear precedent on whether groups like this are considered notable for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> this article -- as I stated in my vote in the AfD for Revolve (Translation Group), it strikes me that there do exists separate specialized wikis in which an article like this would not only be appropriate, it would be welcome. However, in the context of Wikipedia, I agree with the original poster that this article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, group is unrelated to the <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsukihime.html" title="Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> article so there's nothing to merge (although you could link to their project page at the bottom) <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 02:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the article, although not under the articles of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The group is nearly under beta testing and they've already finished up their rewrite of Tsukihime. That can be seen under their <a href="http://mirrormoon.org/node" class="external text" title="http://mirrormoon.org/node" rel="nofollow">home page</a>. However, under articles <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, is a completely different issue all together. However, I do not think, personally, that this is much of a problem. My only reason for voting delete is that the information about the team project is pretty excessive, and a merge is also unnecessary seeing as how both <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsukihime.html" title="Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fate_stay_night_9d5f.html" title="Fate/stay night">Fate/stay night</a> pages already have information on their cause anyway. There is no way to infer their works on Kara no Kyoukai due to lack of a <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara_no_Kyoukai_48d0.html" title="Kara no Kyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a> page, but that can easily be solved by making one. Also, no offense but, I do not believe Mirror Moon is notable enough to have their own wiki page... <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirioki_e3d0.html" title="User:Mirioki">Mirioki</a> 03:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Hold</b> This appears to be an Indian venture of some kind, that most wikipedians are likely to know very little about (see <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systematic bias</a>). English-language google is likely to be of limited use as well. What I would really like is to be able to tag some problematic articles like this to allow a hold or timeout for a few days, in this case to try and recruit a couple of Indian editors to tell us whether this is a notable venture, and if so, to clean up the article. I have noticed that AfDs for some things get cross-posted to get more attention (webcomics and Australian issues being two areas that come to mind). Is there a similar forum for India-related articles? I guess I have no problem with deletion in its current form but I would prefer someone with more local knowledge to weigh in. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:14, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Disagree - delete his entry he is an oxygen thief. Tim Rue is not a programmer (despite his own claims) and he was never a popular figure in the NGs except as a figure of fun. His appearances on his local TV, etc. mean nothing, he self promoted and his claims therein were not critically evaluated. The VIC is merely a set of scripts to automate some tasks - not even innovative since it was actually very similar to a previous Amiga application. He plagued usenet NGs (not just Amiga related) with his rants and was frequently banned by his ISPs. I agree he is well known but noteriety is not notability. The man (by his own admission) is mentally unstable and his claims for the VIC have never been substantiated. He gained his noteriety by abusive and OT posting not by being intelligent and posting worthwhile or interesting comments. If you leave this entry then you only pander to his self delusion that he is some sort of computing guru.</p>
<p>FYI he has also claimed to be a messiah and that the film "The Matrix" is based on his life!). A wacko.</p>

<p>Wikipedia does not have the resources to spend on verifying whether or not the claims others make about me are honest or acts of deception. This goes back to the original article. And simpler things to verify are not being considered, such as how contridictary it is for usent posters and trolls to claim they don't understand and are some sort of authority, yet I can hire a programmer to code the very same thing with no difficulty in communication. The wikipedia entry has been on the side of libel since its beginning and I only ever edited it to provide links to more current references (I said "ok" for a while.) Should I be supprised for it then to evolve to this state? Trolls are easy to manipulate and I did call on them (meat puppets you could claim - there is always a way to twist thing - simple bit flipping abstraction physics.) but not to keep the article. To remove it and it libel bias, if only for its lack of research to uncover honesty. I don't need to vote, the trolls are doing it for me and wikipedia make that possible. And doing it this way, I control it rather than me not know about it, while others use wikipedia to commit libel against me. People want to find me, there is google web, images and groups, and archive.org. Far more coverage than wikipedia could ever allow a single topic. And without the voting control of a few. That's what is real! By its own policies, wikipedia is not allowed to be an authoritive publication, to better cover its butt, perhaps such a statement should be a sub header on articles with potential issues. Even the trolls and bullies of usenet have helped me to establish prior art as in the virtual interaction configuration, by their helping to ingrain my communications about it into the archives.Wikipedia is not an archive, just another of many places I have passed, whether I knew about it or not.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Threeseas (<a href="../../../t/h/r/User_talk%7EThreeseas_f281.html" title="User talk:Threeseas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Threeseas_5115.html" title="Special:Contributions/Threeseas">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>There is alot of useless junk in usenet, a place where its easy to find those who have nothing better to do than to give others a hard time. But there is also some good stuff. And then there is the usefulness of it regardless of content value, that of multipule generated and integrated time stamps and archiving. The sort of thing that is useful for establishing prior art (re: patents and copyright issues). There are those who claim they don't understand what I'm on about and there are those who do. but the simple fact is, its an identification of unavoidable actions we all, everyone of us, apply in creating and using abstractions. In other words if someone doesn't understand these actions, it can only be due their inability to know what they themselves do. To make these actions available within the environment of computing, as functionality, simple provides the mechanism control points to enable the automation of anything, and by anyone. There is a battle over intellectual property in the form of software patents and this is what is going to break it. But that is "abstraction Physics" where the connection I (Tim Rue) have to it is making damn sure nobody can patent it, due prior art I've established thru usenet, and many other communications. Search google for "Tim rue and abstraction physics" and access the cache of teh wikipedia entry that was deleted under the arguement of it being original research. Why Amiga newsgroups? cause it was teh amiga that had all three primary user interfaces available in a usable and common enough manner that inspired me to toss together a very primitive form of the virtual interaction configuration. Or at least try to only to find there seemed to always be something lacking, but for no good reason. I know plenty enough about computer electronics and programming to know better, as I'm damn well sure others do as well.</p>
<p>A rather small collective of people gave me a hard time on usenet, but in a bigger picture, such as slashdot I have "excellent karma" it goes on and on and still this entry make a faulty claim that my posting style is difficult if not impossible for others to understand. Why? Further more the code to one of the VIC commands "IQ" can be run with a switch (the existance of a filename (see source code) that enable one to watch what the program does when it is run. After some simple editing of the arexx documentation for imageFX (and image process program), using IQ I was able to set in motion teh examples given in the documentation. QAlso see my comment the the discussion link to the article of my name.</p>
<p>As I have said, I'm findable thru google groups, web and images as well as archive.org. I don't need wikipedia, I didn't put myself here, especially if wikipedia is going to be used against its own policies to commit libel against me. I can except "computer specialist" as I am by default the leading authority on abstraction physics, but I don't crank out enough code (regardless of my education) to call myself a programmer in the traditional or old hat sense.

<p>The subject of this page does not seem prominent enough to appear in Wikipedia. Although the article has no references, I found the subject's <a href="http://www.daviddewar.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.daviddewar.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">homepage</a> via Google. Dewar describes himself there as a "choral director, organist and conductor" but he has not held a major position with any well-known orchestra, choir or cathedral. His career as summarized on his homepage is no more distinguished than those of hundreds of other professional musicians working in the churches of England, none of whom appear in Wikipedia. No other Wikipedia pages link to this article. The history of this article shows that most of the content was created by a user "Drjad" who no longer exists. Other content was added by anonymous IPs. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 22:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is about a fairly non-notable "rivalry," if such a rivalry even really exists at all. As a Yankee fan living in Minnesota, I can honestly say that this "rivalry" probably only exists as part of a larger "everyone wants to beat the Yankees" thing, which was previously mentioned on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> page but now seems to be missing.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't see anything wrong with this article other than it being a stub. I don't think "non-notable" really applies here; why does a sports rivalry have to be one of the most important ones in order to have an article? I can imagine a perfect article, that would detail penant races and championship series played between the two teams. Just because nominator isn't aware of this as a rivalry doesn't mean the two teams aren't rivals. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 15:52, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: By this standard, again, you could call every baseball team a "rival" of every other team. Playing a couple of playoff series against each other doesn't create a "rivalry" except perhaps in the minds of a few people. It's certainly not widely noted. -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklemotion_f79f.html" title="User:Sparklemotion">Sparklemotion</a> 17:53, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This doesn't even pretend to be notable or NPOV. At best, it's original research. Nothing has been written about a "rivalry" existing between these two teams.

<dd>I don't see why Wiki can't end up with articles on a million books. Besides which, books which have a niche market can be notable within that and not have mass appeal. The numbers game is only one yardstick. This book has been given a good accolade in the review of it. The current article is not good, I agree. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:59, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The guideline for inclusion in Wikipedia is notability, not truth. Whilst it is true that this book exists, you need to (at least) assert what makes it notable. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 01:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel it has recognition within the market that would be interested in the genre, as in the review: "by far the most outstanding piece of work I have read in the genré of soul-mates." Interestingly <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability</a> talks of authors, "who have written books with an audience of 5,000" (as opposed to sales—which are less than "audience" figures). The <a href="http://extremetracking.com/open;sum?login=flat8" class="external text" title="http://extremetracking.com/open;sum?login=flat8" rel="nofollow">web site for the book</a> has had 15,955 unique visitors to date, so the author may qualify for an article, even if the book doesn't. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:03, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Audience is usually defined as people who have read the book, or studied it, or in some way has <i>significant</i> interaction with it. Going to a website is not significant interaction. So let us - conservatively - divide the number of website views by ten, and then - liberally - triple the sales (cos people might buy it anyway). Even on that measure, we are not yet up to 5,000. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 23:39, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Audiences come in all types and some are very inattentive. All we know is that there are as of today's date 16017 "unique" visitors, and 17333 including reloads. The latter figure using your calculations actually comes to 5199. But, hey, let's not get all legalistic about it. The book might even help someone to find their soulmate - that would be useful. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:12, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> — Non-notable; very, very low Amazon sales rating. The Amazon rank would appear to indicate the book rank among present books in print. Overall rank would be much lower.

<dd>Thanks for the note. My only reason for wanting to keep this is the review by the good Dr McKinley, who is established in this field, and rates the work:<i>"“The Science of Soulmates” is by far the most outstanding piece of work I have read in the genré of soul-mates. Henderson literally takes off where Redfield’s Celestine Prophecy ended, exploring some of the most challenging studies on life and love I have seen."</i> This evaluation to me makes it notable in a different way to the usual standard. I would like to think Wiki has the flexibility to take each case on its own merits. It is not vanity (any more) as I have copy-edited the article. I expect consensus will be to delete, and, if so, full accept this. However, I have to be honest, that I would like to retain this article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The page clearly states that the concept of notability is contentious. The political process that makes Democracy like governments great is the participation of those people who win and lose. To claim that those who lose elections are not important is silly. Anyone seeking to do any research on Congressman Bobby Jindal (a "notable person" by the guidelines listed by those above) should be able to get data on all of his opponents. Wikipedia would be an incomplete reference if it only contained information about the winners and failed to mention those who tried to win the seat but lost.

If Wikipedia will only contain information about the winners of election, it can hardly be said to be unbiased. Should every person on the face of the Earth have a wikipedia page? Absolutely not. However, those to take part in the political process, win or lose, play an important part. Obviously Wikipedia agrees that those who run and win are worthy of mention.

<dd>The losers of national elections are deserving of mention. However, that does not mean that each one deserves an entire article devoted to their person. As far as I'm concerned, the only significant information I'd want to know pertaining to losers of elections who are otherwise non-notable is their political party and the voting results by tally and percentage, which is most easily listed in a collective article such as the one to which you linked. If you could update the article to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> by noting references, especially those to "significant media coverage" as has been mentioned, then I would change my vote to keep. On a side note, my high school civics teacher ran for state senate as an independent party candidate. He ran quite a campaign, and received a significant number of votes, but lost (as is usually the case with independent party candidates). All of his students, including myself, thought it was quite a remarkable event given the amount of effort he put into campaigning. Despite my opinion of him, which is that he was a great teacher and person and would have made an excellent state senator, I do not think him notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. The same goes for you; it's nothing personal. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 06:41, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the people who participated in Congressional elections are not "deserving" of a Wikipedia page then why does the 2004 Congressional Race section of Wikipedia include links to each and every page belonging to each and every candidate in that race? I could understand your point IF that page was written and only included textual references of the candidates. However, the page includes links to Wikipedia pages of each and every person who ran.

The only way this article will not be deleted is if you prove notability using multiple verifiable sources. As the article currently stands, I would guess that there is some media coverage on the election information presented in the first paragraph, but as for the last two paragraphs, if the information presented there cannot be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, then it is <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity information</a> and should be removed. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 18:06, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why would the editor of that page make each person's name linked if the editor did not think all where deserving of a Wikipedia page? The page can be created with plain text for the names of candidates and when one of those candidates has a page that is added, the Election page could then be edited. On the verifiable issue, I have just added some pages linking to several different sources verifying certain facts stated on the election. Some of those pages not only mention the races, but they also mention the information in the next paragraphs. (For example, articles referring to the election mention the fact that I am seeking my Masters in Computer Science). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 21:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have listed articles that verify information in <b>all</b> of the paragraphs, not just the candidate paragraph. Some facts are verified on Wikipedia itself (the fact that I am an alumni of the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute is verified on Wikipedia. Other facts, like me seeking my Masters Degree in Computer Science are verified in the articles pertaining to my running for office. Everything that I have put up there should already be verified by the information that I just linked to.

<li><b>Comment</b> Irrespective of the spirit in which the nomination was brought, other delete "votes" resting on adequate, independent grounds had been cast, so "speedy keep" is likely inappropriate, even in view of criterion four. If the argument is to be that, where a nomination is thought to be brought in bad faith, any deletes that espouse the same position as the nomination ought to be discarded under criterion four (or ought not to be recognized for the purposes of closing a debate as "speedy keep"), we are left then with the prospective situation in which a nomination, evidently brought in bad faith yet nevertheless justified on other grounds enumerated by the nominator, is to be closed as "speedy keep" even where our guidelines, generally, would seem to militate in favor of "delete". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:58, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Its no wonder why so few people run for office or even have an interest in politics. The way you people trivialize those who take part in a major election is really disgusting. What % do you think makes a candidate "notable" enough to qualify for your approval? I was PROUD of my campaign, not necessarily because of the results but because I was able to help victims of Hurricane Ivan by collecting goods to be donated to them. The ONLY reason I dont have that information on the page currently is because there was no news coverage of that event so under Wikipedias policy it would not be verifiable. But people are willing to let campaigns for national office to be forgotten because of some %. I also want to state, yet again, that if Wikipedia allows for one candidate to be listed then it should allow for all candidates to be listed otherwise it will be seen as biased towards certain candidates and against others. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 14:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "Disagreements" are common on WP, if fact, "disagreement" are probably par for the course here. It is only through mutual, logical dialogue and constructive debate that meaningful articles will be created. If we all were constantly in agreement, there would be no need for "talk pages", "AfDs", "RfCs", etc. I submit that a "disagreement" at another article is not a valid reason to discount my opinion regarding this one. I constantly monitor the AfD page, nominate AfDs and vote in AfDs in my areas of expertise often.

You have shown that when it comes to the Sean Hannity article you will not be attempting any "mutual, logical dialogue" or any "constructive debate" and that you will unilaterally remove my addition to the Sean Hannity article when I have provided multiple, verifiable, sources that show Sean Hannity incorrectly representing the Preamble.

If this issue was merely about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> then I would simply appologize for being ignorant of that specific Wikipedia policy.

<p>This conversation is about more than just <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, it is also about notability. Perhaps it seems vain that I am making a stand on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> issue on the article that I wrote about myself. However, I personally do not care if I have a Wikipedia page about me. My life will go on just fine without it and if it is the opinion that my page should be deleted then so be it. That does not change the fact that I strongly disagree with those who wish to delete ANY article just because the topic of the article is not deemed "notable" by that user's standards. My proposed compromise would be that someone else should go through the article and delete all of the information that is not verifiable, and making sure that the remaining information is follows the NPOV policy. And i will only stick my head in to the page in the manner deemed appropriate by the BLP polcy. We can then go to the other places like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> and start the discussion over there as to what political races and candidates should qualify for inclusion in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 23:31, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also a little <b>comment:</b> Even if other less-notable people or subjects have articles here on Wikipedia, it does not mean that they set the lower limit for notability. Wikipedia has more than one million users, and as I see it the only person who can set a definitive notability requirement would be <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimbo</a> himself!

There are candidates who, as a result of events during a given campaign, become notable, but solely standing for election, even as the nominee of a major party, does not a notable bio make. DZ's position that, where verifiable and neutrally constructed, all articles, irrespective of the notability of their subjects, ought to be kept is often essayed, but there is surely not a consensus for that view (neither, further, do I think ever there will be nor do I think ever there should be). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep without setting precedent that all such comparisons will be kept</b> - I think comparisons can be encyclopedic. I do think we need some sort of standard for what comparisons are notable enough to be included. I'm tempted to list some that we should not have, but that would violate <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 19:49, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>You know as well as I do that this will become a de facto precedent if it is kept. Calton's examples below will be reality within a few months, and as soon as someone AfD's them the author(s) will cry fould and cite Historical comparison of economy cars 2006. Personally I don't know how you can keep this comparison without opening the door to all comparisons. What possible reason could someone put forth to keep Historical comparison of economy cars 2006 as important and encyclopedic and not extend it to Historical comparison of gaming consoles 2006, Historical comparison of Plasma Televisions 2004, or any of Calton's examples below. Comparison pages are an all or none proposition: either they are encyclopedic or they are not.</li>

<dd>Furthermore, what is the long term usefulness of this information? In 2010, who is going to care how 3 arbitrarily selected vehicles stacked up? Why just these 3 vehicles? Where is the 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid? I imagine there are at least a few other cars that meet this criteria. Beyond that, where did this definition of "economy car" come from? What is to stop me from arbitrarily deciding that "economy cars" only need to get 30 mpg and add another 20 vehicles to the list... or decide that hybrids are not included and remove the 3 cars currently listed? This concept is just not in any way maintainable.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:14, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm the original author. It helps people research what alternatives people had with concern to global warming and smog. Initial cars chosen are best in class. For example Honda Fit was rated best by "Car and Driver". I'm expecting more cars will be added.

<li><b>Delete</b> just can't see how this would become a complete list, which is certainly what it should aspire to. No need to invite readers to use WP to make their own original comparisons, ala the consumer reports case made above. Great idea, wrong place.

<ul>
<li><b><s>Delete all</s>, Yikes.</b> Okay, I definitely think all this cruft needs to get removed from Wikipedia, I just want to make sure the editors are given fair warning, and I hope the closing admin will be willing to temporarily undelete these articles in order to assist transwiki'ing.

<li>While I'm at it, let me point out that none of these articles have sources. However, the amount of specific detail on all of these robots makes me think a specific published source exists, which actually is WORSE: this might be massive copyright infringement. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 18:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, process objection</b>. I've changed my mind. These articles are not sufficiently similar to warrant bundling them together in this group while others get bundled together in a different group. I still don't like all this Gundam cruft, but these small-group AfDs are a bad way to decide the question. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I knew somebody would accuse me of bad process, it was just a matter of time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Are you kidding? You collect a hefty bundle of related articles, and then divide the entries from said bundle through no resonably discernable criteria into multiple AfD projects. The thing is, the articles you've split up have no reason being split up, and if even one of these AfDs pulls through, we can readily await your attempting to delete still more material (rather, previously kept material...) while citing your one success as precedent.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I strongly oppose Mr. Crawford's attempt at a one-man purge of everything Gundam. The fact that somebody's created their own Wiki for Gundam doesn't mean it shouldn't be on Wikipedia. If anything, that should be taken as <i>more</i> evidence of the notability of Gundam. And let me note, Mangojuice, that you need something more than "there's a lot of detail, I think it might be a copyvio!" before you can make credible accusations. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> At least you should have to wait and see result of other page's nomination. Keep made AfD to several page daily make it very nuisance.

Wikipedia is, in case you missed it, an encyclopdeia, which is "a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field". It isn't simply a dictionary wherein one gives quick little definitions and moves on; it's MEANT to go into depth. All these accusations of cruft just seem like a cheap excuse to remove something that the Mr. Crawford here dislikes. If we're using his logic for deletion, then we ought to go and subsidize all movie and video game sequels onto a single page, and smash everything together into homogenous articles, because cruft is cruft, right? --<a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmuroNT1_7f94.html" title="User:AmuroNT1">AmuroNT1</a> 02:21 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 04:00, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- To me, the idea of removing these articles seems absurd.

Now, as another user mentioned, if this is deleted, then you will also have to delete almost everything from other TV shows. If you are going to delete MS Gundam, while letting so many other shows have their articles remain intact, then I am to assume that you are doing this out of simple hatred of a show that you know almost nothing about. If you are to delete everything, or even, anything, Gundam, then I would also suggest that you delete everything that is Star Trek, Star Wars, related to copyrighted video games, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Space Runaway Ideon, the Simpsons, Lost, 24, American Idol, and every other show that has ever aired on any TV on earth. Simply put, if having Mobile Suit Gundam on Wikipedia breaks any rules, then so do all of these shows.--AEUG16:14, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of the characters have piloted a lot of suits, so their pages would be huge and take up more room than their biographies. Unless there's huge bandwidth problems, it seems like it'd be simpler to leave things as they are, though having these pages seems to really bother people so whatever.

<dl>
<dd>There's also the issue of machines which were only piloted by minor or nameless characters, such as the standard model GINN. While I think that merging the machines with the appropriate pilot would be a good alternative, there are some that just can't be done with such a play. <a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmuroNT1_7f94.html" title="User:AmuroNT1">AmuroNT1</a> 21:14 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The bigger problem with such a solution is that we would then have multiple instances of repeating data... or rather, multiple identical articles describing a mobile suit on the page of anyone whose piloted one over the course of the series. What happens then when someone decides to edit said article? Correct something, is it then the user's responsibility to make the same change to every single article? Wasteful! If the articles continue to exist, they should remain in a singular form. A better method (if a mandate to do so becomes more convincing that the one presented here...) would be to create large articles labled 'Mobile weapons of the Earth Aliance,' and 'Mobile weapons of the ZAFT forces' that sport the article's contents in a more compact format, organized based on which faction produced the weapon in question...--KefkaTheClown 21:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No theorem is stated. The method is not different from ordinary substitutions; the author seems to think that a separate article is warranted merely because the conventional substitution method is used twice rather than once in a single example. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry to the author for all the effort to produce an example, but now at least I understand. This is clearly based on the author's misconception that a substitution must be uniform throughout the term, which may be due to the fact that in teaching mathematics the notions of "bound variable" and "variable scope" are usually not introduced and substitution is only taught by example. This "method" does not deserve to be named.

The idea behind this when thought about is very logical. so again I state <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>DELETE</b> --Blacdize 21:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>i agree with blacdize 100%. Wikipedia has many phrase defintions for instance 'the gadget show' taking this phrase off simply shows that wikipedia is not as up to date with common terms as it would think. i myself and many of my colleagues have used this phrase on a day to day basis so i say <b>keep</b> <b>this</b> <b>definition</b> --freeofchange 22:20 , 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is no substantially new claim from the deleted version that would meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Really this hinges on one thing: Do you consider the "2004 BMI John Lennon Scholarship Competition" win and "Grand Prize Winners for Session II of the 2005 John Lennon Songwriting Contest" to meet <i>Has won or placed in a major music competition</i>? I don't personally see the John Lennon Songwriting/Scholarship competitions as "major music competitions", but this could be open to interpretation so I brought it here instead of PROD. One could also consider the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albino Blacksheep</a> claim, but at least in my opinion, that falls short of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:08, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per my nomination. Admittedly, Tally Hall doesn't fully qualify for any of the criteria listed on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. However, and this is indeed opinion/feel, the combination of events concerning the band make it a qualifier in my mind. It takes some notability to sell out two shows (800 spots/show) at a location in one night. They <i>did</i> produce a full album (under a minor indy label), and from what I know, have signed on to a bigger label for the future. They're producing enough for the sustenence of the band members' lives, to the degree that two or three have chosen to not finish university degrees. Finally, this is not a band that has stagnated; in all likelyhood it <i>will</i> produce multiple new albums (they've started performing some of their songs for the next album), again, probably under a more significant label. Thus, it is my opinion that it is a waste of time to delete this article, as it's somewhat notable now, and WILL qualify as notable in the not so distant future. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGertlex_2999.html" title="User:Gertlex">Gertlex</a> 00:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per my nomination. I live in Connecticut and I heard about these guys from word of mouth. They're incredibly talented. If it hadn't been for this very Wikipedia entry, I'm not sure that I would have given them a chance. I've relied on this entry for almost everything I know about this band. Please don't take it away.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not a major band. At this stage, this page seems self promotional</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd definitely say that the John Lennon Songwriting Contest is a major award, and the band is the most prominent part of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor_9c66.html" title="Ann Arbor">Ann Arbor</a> music scene, which is saying something in a city with a college as large as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>.

<p>I have edited the entry removing any references to online speculation, and have cited a source which links to a heated discussion between so called 'chipmonkeys' and genuine musicians.

Author proceeded to blank the page on the 14th, where it's stood since. This would have gone through as a prod if the anon hadn't de-prodded it (as they have done to a number of other articles), and it would probably have been a speedy G7 (author request) if various authors hadn't modified it since. As it stands, there's little choice but to AFD this.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I don't particularly like the attitude displayed in the nomination. PROD is for uncontroversial deletion. If someone feels that the article should go for AfD instead, if the nominator still desires deletion, because the article has some value, then that's a good reason to unPROD it. Nominator's nomination delcaration is antagonistic. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 19:10, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I am one of the composers and creative consultants on the project, and I mainly wrote the article to let more people know about it.

<li><b>comment</b> This article does not and will not include "things made up in school one day". Everything in the article is a real event that actually occurred at the school. Memorial is the most notable high school in the Houston-metro area, in the same vein as Laguna Beach High School is to Orange County. The Wikipedia community seems content with having content regarding the California high school; why are other areas not afforded the same privilege? <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.113.14.172.html" title="User:137.113.14.172">137.113.14.172</a> 22:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> My issue with this article is whether it is encyclopedic - I have no problem with articles about schools, but that is not what this is, it is a collection of high-school students' memories, and explicitly stats that it "should not be used as a reference source for factual information regarding Memorial High School". With regard to "Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day", maybe I shouldn't have cited that policy, but in my view Wikipedia is also not for thing that happened in school one day unless those events are notable. If you want to have a website for your high school memories, there are many places that will host such content, often for free, but Wikipedia is not one of them. If there are other "hish school memories" articles like this one then in my view those should also be deleted, I nominated this after seeing it in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 23:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>As an avid wikipedia user, i do not think that this article should be deleted. It is the chronicles of the 2005 graduating class at memorial high school, and includes real information and events. I know of many previous and current students at memorial high school who find this page to be an interesting, informative, ENCYCLOPEDIC, read. I find it insulting that editors at Wikipedia find this harmless and INFORMATIVE content delete-worthy, but find it in their hearts to host hundreds of articles chronicling different Pornography stars and the different types of current porn. If Milf Hunter can have an article on Wikipedia, why can't Memorial High Schools 2005 graduating class? - hawkril324 (<a href="../../../h/a/w/User_talk%7EHawkril324_a4f7.html" title="User talk:Hawkril324">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_hawkril324_cc2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/hawkril324">contribs</a>)</li>

<li><b>My Stance</b> Memorial High School is reputed to be one of the best public high schools in the country. The school is prominant in its community because it promotes the idea of original thought. This article does nothing other then attempt to show the true culture inside a memorial high school classroom, the experiences inside a class as it relates to the high school, and memories therein. I feel that if i was looking for a high school for my children, a site like this would be greatly benificial. Oftentimes, it is hard to find the nature of a community, especially if you are on the outside coming in. If someone were looking whether or not to enroll their students in a high school, magazine rankings and other national highschool rankings are too broad to suit the specific needs of that individual. The job of wiki-pedia is to allow the exchange of information to happen silmutaniously inside this network of fact finding individuals. If the comments included in this article were in fact false, and not condusive to a fact finding mission, it will be immediately edited by others, as such is the nature of wiki-pedia. I dont see any reason this article should not be included, and i dont see that it poses any threat whatsoever to the general wiki-pedia community as a whole. Many who come and look here will find the website to be very helpful, nastoglic, and often times amusing. There is nothing wrong with merging fact and fun, it can be done in a responsible manner that will endorse the community of Memorial, wiki-pedia, and all parties affected by it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.17.52.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.17.52.96_ae96.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.17.52.96">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Shutting it down would go agianst everything Wikipedia stands for, regardless of the ideas of a few misguided individuals(see above). Even if it only services a few hundred people a year, i doubt that a wikipedia page on the Pornography star Brittney Skye services more. (I'm not going to make the obvious joke...).

<dd>It has nothing to do with envy. I loved my high school, great teachers for the most part, great people, great times, etc. That's not the point though, it's simply about how notable and verifiable this information is. The fact that a student often yells out "Penis!" in class is not notable in any way, unless it's someone who him or herself is notable (in which case it could be mentioned in said person's own article, if it's somehow relevant). The best thing to do is make your own website, even your own wiki. You can make your own rules there, but this page doesn't meet Wikipedia's rules.-- <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicAD_bfdb.html" title="User:SonicAD">SonicAD</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonicAD_f5e8.html" title="User talk:SonicAD">talk</a>) 05:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> but please note that three of the first five links don't even work if you aren't accessing them from the University of Toronto.

<li><b>Comment</b>: We can't really "merge and delete" because we then lose contributor history as required by the GFDL.
