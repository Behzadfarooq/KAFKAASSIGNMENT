<p>The terminology 3rd site by its virtue came from a hadith by Prophet Muhammad. It is really wrong to cite from here and there to prove otherwise. If this article is written to explain this terminology used in Islam, it is fine. The article went far beyond explaining this to actually try and dispute it. Something that cannot be really understood and is certainly not anymore explaining an Islamic terminology. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 10:25, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is just a bombastic collection of any page/article/post on the internet wherever any other 'third' holiest site is mentioned without any consideration to the reliability of the source to try to dispute a well-established claim. Already 2 links that are the only sources for 2 sections in this article no longer exist or have been updated, yet the creator(s) of this article insists that they be in the article (Why cite an outdated article which the original author himself said was erroneous).I suggest this article be deleted and any third holiest site claim be entered into the respective articles of the proposed sites and clearly mentioning which sect (from the reliable sources ONLY eg: "The shrine at Karbala is considered the third holiest site by many Shiite Muslims") since this article makes it look like a dispute. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 17:33, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This article is not necessarily about what traditional Sunni Muslims consider the third holiest site. That is made quite clear on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> page and the top of this page. The article provides information as to what the world at large, including many Muslims regard as the third holiest site in Islam. Advocates for deletion of this page accuse the creators of being politically motivated. However, is not their own proposition for deletion of the page itself politically motivated, to try and deny others of this interesting information? As far as I can see, this page doesn't fall under <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> But surely you realize that the article makes no attempt at distinguishing between so-called "claims," beliefs or opinions gathered from various sources, that could be mistaken, from any actual differences in theology between various sects of Islam? The article regards any and all sources with any reference to a third Islamic holy site as equal, rendering undue weight <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight</a> to spurious material and suggesting that all these assorted assertions should be taken equally seriously. This is specious logic. Any actual differences between various sects of Islam, or any religion, would be appropriately discussed within the pages devoted to documenting these distinct religions, including the pages devoted to particular sites that for reasons I can't pretend to know are holy to them, rather than mixing all such sites up with spurious references in an apparent attempt to denature the significance of all forms of Islam and the meaning any such site has within particular forms of Islam. This page seems to me entirely intended to stir up unnecessary conflict and while this is not strictly prohibited on WP I don't find it at all usefull for most users except those users who would get a laugh out of doing this.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 11:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>That</b> claims, beliefs or opinions could be mistaken is a very strange thing to assume. Let’s take the example of the tour guides. They are not just bits of information thought up by the writer. Someone has actually gone to the place, done research, interacted with the locals to get a review of the place. These are then placed in the guide. Their beliefs are mistaken according to you because in your opinion they are wrong! But I agree we could tidy it up and emphasise more clearly where the theological disputes lie. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Undue weight</a> doesn’t apply here, because the original article was included under <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Al Aqsa Mosque</a>, but was considered to be “undue weight” and therefore a new article was created to conform with the following statement in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight</a>: <i>views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented <b>except in articles devoted to those views</b></i>. This article is devoted to the subject. Additionally, if all the views were to be added to their respective articles it would be difficult to assess all the claims simultaneously. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Someone has actually gone to the place, done research, interacted with the locals to get a review of the place. These are then placed in the guide." Are you forgetting that travel agencies exist to do business? Do you think that they'll show any miserable poverty, organized crime and such in a tourist brochure?. And there is 1 dead link, and another outdated faculty handbook that the author himself said contained an error, yet you insist that the old version be linked to and you uploaded it to a freewebs account bearing my username. Also this topic is very well discussed in the List of holy cities article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There is no need to make separate articles for such things like "The fourth tallest building in every country in Asia" etc. Then why not create several articles like "Sixth holiest city in Christianity", "Fourth Holiest site in Buddhism" etc. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 14:59, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thestick, you state that the old edition contained an "error", an error left undetected for 2 years 4 months? Was it you who has been in touch with the author for the sole reason of discrediting the source and arranged for a new version to be downloaded on the same link dated 2003 (not 2005)?! The new edition may not mention anything about the mosque, but neither is there a “places to visit” section. In the new version the whole section was left out completely; so who’s to say that just the mosque bit was an “error”?!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Btw travel guides regularly warn tourists of “no-go” areas and to be cautious of pickpockets, etc. They also give a brief synopsis of the area, including details of whether there is poverty, etc. Take the following from <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Gaza/" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Gaza/" rel="nofollow">wikitravel</a> as an example: <i>Gaza isn't quite the pure hellhole you might expect given TV coverage, although needless to say the birthplace of the Intifada and one of the most overpopulated bits on the entire planet <b>isn't exactly paradise on earth</b> either. A UN report in 1952 stated that the Strip is too small to support its population of 300,000; there are now well over one million inhabitants and the January 2002 latest figures from the Palestinian Authority put <b>unemployment at a whopping 79%</b>. Most inhabitants are Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 war but were denied entry into Egypt proper.</i> <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 16:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>“There is no need to make separate articles for such things like "The fourth tallest building in every country in Asia”</dd>
<dd>That’s because they are concrete (excuse the pun) facts and are not the subject of ambiguity. (They are listed on wikipedia’s more exclusive pages, e.g: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Toronto_7391.html" title="List of tallest buildings in Toronto">List of tallest buildings in Toronto</a>). However the third holiest site is a common term, and itself a matter of debate with numerous other sites vying for the position! That is why it requires its own page.<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 16:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not going to bother arguing since any source that states anything else other than the Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam is perfectly acceptable to the creator of the article. Wikitravel is different from some travel agency that needs to make money. And yes, that error went undetected for more than 2 years, until you brought it to their attention. Also, there is <b>no other source on the internet</b> that says the Jawatha mosque is the third holiest site in Islam. To understand the political inclination just take a look at the first version of the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Mosque&amp;oldid=71605576#.E2.80.9CThird_holiest_site.E2.80.9D_.E2.80.93_rival_claims" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Aqsa_Mosque&amp;oldid=71605576#.E2.80.9CThird_holiest_site.E2.80.9D_.E2.80.93_rival_claims" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 16:35, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no question that this article is not written to explain an Islamic concept but rather to spread confusion about it and false information. You cannot just bring any claim and say that some muslims believe that this is a 3rd Holy site etc. I wonder why not finding out also what some muslims consider the fourth site in Islam? What might be also the Second? What is the first? This article is becoming a polling station and not explaining a well-established undisputed Islamic terminology appearing in authentic Islamic texts? When saying "in Islam", is different than saying "by some Muslims". I believe the article is just written to dispute the <b>Importance of Jerusalem in Islam</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 15:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thestick, it is interesting that whenever the al aqsa mosque is mentioned the need to assert it as the “third holiest site”, goes hand in hand. THIS is the recent creation. A recent creation aimed at aiding the political intentions of the Muslim world. If, as you demonstrated, it IS the 3rd holiest, why stop there, whenever a Muslim holy site is mentioned, say what number down the list it comes? Is Baghdad known as the fourth holiest, Samarkand as the tenth holiest? Etc. I will settle for deleting the page if on the Al Aqsa mosque page or any other on wikipedia, no reference is made that it known as the “third holiest site”.</li>
<li>Almaqdisi, no one doubts the importance in Islam of Jerusalem. However whenever the term “third holiest” is applied to the temple mount complex, the absolute holiness of the place to another, older religion is disputed, dented, and sidelined. Why the need to emphasise the third, fourth, etc.? It is to bolster the claim. This is an unnecessary politically motivated term which should be discarded. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 17:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thestick: <i>"why not create several articles like "Sixth holiest city in Christianity", "Fourth Holiest site in Buddhism" etc.</i> Well, it seems it is only Muslims who insist on short listing there sites! If there are enough of a variety for the other religions, why not? In fact I intend to do so, and I'm sure it won't cause such a ruckus as it has done with the Muslims. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 17:32, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Al Aqsa mosque has been mentioned as the third holiest site in Islamic doctrine for over ~1400 years. This has already been shown to you time and time again, yet you still keep saying it is a recent political creation based on an erroneous and hardline article circulating through some hardline Jewish POV websites that does not qualify for WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NPOV.

<li><b>"</b>it IS the 3rd holiest, why stop there, whenever a Muslim holy site is mentioned, say what number down the list it comes<b>"</b>. - There are only '3' according to mainstream Islam, and the articles about all 3 of them contain which number down the list it comes.</li>

<li>Chesdovi, The word third comes from a hadith that says, that the virtue of praying at the site of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, or al-Masjid al-Haram or Masjid al-Madina is not like any other place. The hadith talks about the virtue and reward of praying at these sites. It does not talk about Holiness. The word Holy, 'Mukaddas' is not mentioned in the Hadith. Therefore, the Hadith continues, only to these 3 sites you may go on journey, and anywhere else on this earth, the prayer has the same virtue. There are no political agendas etc, this has been said 1400 years ago. These sites were chosen by the following <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a>: Ibrahim and his sons, Yakub and his sons, and Muhammad.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>According to Islamic teachings, the Quran allocates much of its text arguing that the Message of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a> as being one message, from the same God (Allah, or Elohim). Furthermore, regarding the Temple Mount, historical sources show that when Muslims entered Jerusalem during the time of Umar, they did not find Jews having any temple or worshiping at the site. Hence, the Covenant of Umar did not address that, and only mentioned protecting the Churchs of the Christians etc. No mentionig of protecting the Temple Mount as a site for Jews. Having said so, Muslims believe they fullfilled the Prophecy of other previous <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a> by re-constructing the Masjid, 2nd after Mecca' masjid, that was mentioned and illuded at various places in the Quran text. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 18:06, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The site is among the 3 holiest sites in Islam. First it is the Masjid Al-Haram, second is Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at last is Al-Aqsa Mosque. There are several virtues of the Al-Aqsa Mosque which ave been shown to you time and time again yet still fail to understand it. It's obvious from your previous comments that all you are trying to do is discredit this well established historical and theological fact by any means necessary because for some reason you feel by saying it is the third holiest site in Islam "the absolute holiness of the place to another, older religion is disputed, dented, and sidelined.".This article is a result of that, and it's content is just WikiLawyering <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 16:39, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as I have not been convinced that the title “third holiest site in Islam” refers solely to Jerusalem. Millions of Shia do not agree with this and although “mainstream” Muslims currently refer to the al aqsa as third holiest, there has been no unambiguous proof from the hadith or Koran or any other Islamic holy book that any site, let alone Jerusalem was to be considered 'Mukaddas' or holier than any other place. That others sites are also considered third holiest must not be subdued and should not be seen as a slight against Islamic sentiment…. Just as I would personally not take issue with a page devoted to whether <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel%27s_Tomb_1a1b.html" title="Rachel's Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberius.html" title="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safed.html" title="Safed">Safed</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebron.html" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> is considered the third holiest site in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 17:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Chesdovi, I repeat. There are many hadiths that discusses al-Masjid al-Aqsa. There is one of them mentioning that it is the second masjid designated to worhsip Allah on earth. The first was masjid al-Haram, the second is masjid al-Aqsa. These spots were chosen by God according to muslims long long before the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. In Quran, prophet Muhammad is the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal_of_the_Prophets_6a4d.html" title="Seal of the Prophets">Seal of the Prophets</a> of Islam. Prophet Muhammad called to the same Religion of Ibrahim and Ismail and Isaac and Jacob according to Quran. These are Quranic statements. Hence, 1400 years ago, these Hadiths mentioned the virtue of praying at al-Aqsa mosque. Only these sites which were built by Prophets have such a virtue. Anywhere else, does not. This is mentioend in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque#The_importance_of_Al-Aqsa_in_Islam|al-Aqsa" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque#The_importance_of_Al-Aqsa_in_Islam|al-Aqsa" rel="nofollow">Mosque</a>] article anyway. There is really no need to confuse things up. It is not true to keep arguing that the Shiites discredit Jerusalem position in Islam. Do you have a conclusive evidence. <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, which is Shiite, would strongly disgree with this. AhmadiNajad himself disagree with that. Finally, there is no point to keep looking around to find and Quote just any muslims who talks about what he thinks is holy and what is not. I can find many websites on the internet which mentions that no vistited that moon!! This is a distortion and are not considered authentic sources. Just giving names here and there will not be as credible as sources muslims continue to use for 1400 all attributed to the Prophet of Islam Muhammad. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 20:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b>: The reason being that that there is a misuse of terminology here. Muslim resources describe al-Masjid al-Aqsa as the third virtuous masjid in Islam. The origin of the word 'third' really comes from this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> quotes <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_al-Dardaa_8db6.html" title="Abu al-Dardaa">Abu al-Dardaa</a> as saying: "the Prophet of Allah <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> said a prayer in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjid_al-Haram_4143.html" title="Masjid al-Haram">Sacred Mosque</a> (in <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>) is worth 100,000 prayers; a prayer in <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Masjid_al-Nabawi_02ad.html" title="Al-Masjid al-Nabawi">my mosque</a> (in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>) is worth 1,000 prayers; and a prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is worth 500 prayers more than in an any other mosque.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Then Mecca should be known as the most holiest site in Islam and Jerusalem as “the least holiest site in Islam”? I mean 500 is quite a drop from 100,000.

<dd>Praying anywhere else on the earth apart from these three mosques has the same virtue according to the Islamic teachings. It is also described as being the second masjid established on earth (by Jacob) after the one in Mecca (by Abraham). Finally, the same spot was the first Qibla. Hence, if the terminology Third Holiest is used by some, it is really meant to be Third masjid by its virtue. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 06:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>what about the following: It should also be noted that in regard to Fazilat (auspiciousness), as per few references, it is learnt that the Great Mosque of Kufa is <i>better than the mosque of Al-Aqsa</i>. Hazrat Imam <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abi_Bakr_f4e6.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr">Muhammad Bakar</a> had told that if anybody who performs his essential prayer in this mosque, shall be given a benefit of one Haj and if any person performs non-essential prayer in this mosque shall be given the benefit of one Umra. And Dargah Sharief in Ajmer, the most famous Muslim pilgrimage center in India. It is considered the second holiest pilgrim site after Mecca - it is believed that <i>seven pilgrimages to Ajmer equal one to Mecca</i>.<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ah, these are just POV issues and that is no good reason to delete articles I hear <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> say. No it isn't a mere POV issue at all! A pure POV dispute relating to an article does not merit AFD, except perhaps in extreme cases. You can imagine someone starting an article on some topic, and some other editors come along and they have a genuine debate on that topic. Here we are dealing with articles that are created for POV reasons relating to some other topic. This is similar to the POV Forking problem with the difference that the POV issue does not have to stem from another wiki article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> could just have well started an article on poodles with the first sentence saying that it is a type of dog but then diverting to Blair and framing the whole article around the relation Bush-Blair. AFD would then be warranted because the issue then has nothing to do with a POV debate on poodles. It's also no good saying that the article should be kept because an article on poodles has potential. A genuine article on poodles would be so different from the original that it would be best created by a good faith editor who wants to write about poodles. Also, by keeping the article <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> would have shifted the burden on writing a NPOV article on poodles to others. The only good reason to vote to keep would be if you are willing to put in the effort to transform the article to a genuine article about the subject yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This issue reminds me of the recent AFD debate on <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">Heim theory</a>. There the source of the problem was different than in this case but there are some parallels. There you have POV pushers who want to promote a particular pseudoscientific topic. It then became too much of a burden for the editors of wiki project physics (who are mostly professional physicists) to keep the article in a "NO OR" and "No POV" form. They wanted to delete the article. I voted for keep because like some who voted for keep here, I am of the opinion that the pseudoscientific topic was notable. But then I was told by the others of the physics project that I should then become personally involved in editing that article. It is no good to just say "keep" because it can be made NPOV and then run away from the task of actually putting in the effort to improve the article. After the AFD vote I rewrote the article in an aceptable form.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in conclusion, my opinion is that the article should be deleted unless good faith editors with no agenda stand up right now who are willing to invest the time and effort to rewrite the article. The option of keeping and "let's see later how we improve it", is not adequate because <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> can create new articles written in bad faith faster than good faith editors can be found to step in every time he does so. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:34, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You obviously did not see my edit on the Hamas page changing "attacks" to "military action and terrorism". I don't shy away from being neutral at all. I stand by my opinion that the article was created in bad faith.

Not only you've recruited many POV pushers including the banned Yas121 to influence articles violating the basis of wikipedia, now you have the audacity to attack other users. Sad. This original article was part of the Al Aqsa Mosque article, and it was moved to an own article as part of a proposed compromise - I suggest you see the discussion of the original article first before spreading any bull around again.

<dd>I asked some people to look at the policide article which was written for POV purposes. The fact that some of them may not be neutral in Israeli-Palestinian conflict exactly undermines your argument, because the concept of policide should have nothing to do with this conflict. To use the "poodle" analogy, it's like accusing someone for recruiting people with a pro-Blair bias to take a look at the poodle article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: (I'm not responding to anyone specifically, just making a general suggestion). I think it would be helpful if people tried their best to confine their discussion to the merits of deletion/non-deletion, and to identifying the specific policies and guidelines that apply, rather than analyzing the motivations of the article creators, and AFD commentators. The admin who closes this will do so based on the reasoning presented about <i>the article</i>, so all the comments about people's motivations, while I'm sure well intentioned, are distracting from the central issue of whether we should delete this article.

<dd>Well, the location of the Jewish Temple has also been proposed by some sources not to be in Jerusalem but other places. If you are okay with creating an article entitled "Holiest City in Judaism" based on those sources and commence with a list of every bigot, racist, or purely mistaken (or mistyped) source that has said that the Temple was actually in Saudi Arabia or Nablus or the Sinai, then you would have more of a reason to argue for the existence of an <i>entire</i> article dedicated to such nonsense. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 13:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You might not realise it but the question of the place of Al Aqsa was highly disputed in Islamic circles at the time. As the sources show, it's still disputed by some today. Other muslims believe that other sites are more important. Even the pov proposer like Almaqdisi admits that there's a big difference between what sunni and shia think on the subject, and this is all relevant info to depict. It was already in the Al Aqsa Article but people thought it was given undue weight so it was moved in compromise. Obviously, this is all pertinent information. <b>These other sites exist and are very imporant for Muslims and many regard them as the most important behind the undisputed Mecca</b> (and Medina). <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 14:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "dispute" you speak of is because '<i>some</i> Muslims did not feel comfortable with the notion that the Masjid Al-Aqsa is the very same "Temple of Bani Isra'il" (Bnei Yisrael) because that's (according to how I've always interpreted it) how it's described in the Qur'an. The verse that describes the 'Masjid al Aqsa' in the Qur'an is immediately followed by sentences mentioning 'Bani Isra'il' a number of times. In Islam, G-d has commanded the 'faithful' to fill in and take over from the followers of Moses and "the son of Mary" because they betrayed their covenant with Him. So He sends his final message to the world through the Qur'an. Jerusalem was the first Qibla in Islam, partly because of the Jewish influence on Mohammad in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>. Things changed after he had a falling out with them. But there is no question in my mind that any dispute over the 'Masjid al-Aqsa' is marginal and irrelevant. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been following the discussion on this board for quite sometime, and I could not let this go on without intervention. This article deals with a Islamic site. This, then has to be decided based on Islamic references, i.e the Holy Quran, Prophet Mohammad's Hadith, and trusted time-proven text that rely solely on those two. Citing any text or references other than those is, by all means, an attempt to cause confusion and dispute over facts that are known for all muslims. The site of al masjid Alaqsa is 3rd in virtue, that is they believe that praying in these sites multiplies their hasanat (the good deed for the judgement day). Muslims do NOT pray for these sites. I strongly believe that since this site deals with Islamic understandings, it should be STRONGLY DELETED, due to its unprecedented inclusion of disputed material that does not rely on the Islamic references mentioned above.<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboosh_85a8.html" title="User:Aboosh">Aboosh</a> 17:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)Aboosh</p>

<p><b>Comments for DELETE</b>, Amoruso, you are very wrong if you think that Shiites dispute the importance of Jerusalem and its rank after Mecca and Medina. The narrations regarding Prophet Muhammad <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a> are the most studied of any other human being ever existed. The narrations are divded to more than 70 degree, and Muslims have rigorously studied these and settled whatever controversies or mis communication regarding some of the Narrations by weakening some and strengthening some. Hence, I noticed that Amuroso and Chesdovi are putting themselves at a level of what is called in Islam <a href="../../../f/a/q/Faqih.html" title="Faqih">Faqih</a>. The title of this article is about 3rd Holy cite in Islam. Okay, then it is Islamic sources that are verified here then. This article is instead talking about 3rd travel destination preference by some muslims. This does not qualify these preferences to compete with the title of 3rd Holy Sites in Islam. IT is VERY VERY wrong again to say that the Shiites dispute that. You better go and listen to nearby <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> speeches, and your beloved <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> for some info about this. In anycase, Amoruso believes that muslims disputed the location of al-<a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjid_al-Aqsa_7f02.html" title="Masjid al-Aqsa">Masjid al-Aqsa</a>... Wrong again! The Prophet Muhammad's journey is well documented in his narrations and the notion that al-Masjid al-Aqsa being in Jerusalem or Bayt al-Maqdis, was well established and well understood and explicitly mentioned in the words of the Prophet and the majority of Muslims read these narrations at his time and understood it. You keep arguing and mentioing that Jerusalem was never mentioned in Quran etc... Well, the Quran is not a travel brouchure and was not to my understanding written by Human beings! The word Mecca itself only appeared once in the Quran and illuded at others. The word Moses and Jesus appeared at least 128, 22 repectively. The word Muhammad appeared only 4 times... Please let me know Chesdovi and Amuroso some Islamic interpretation, <a href="../../../f/i/q/Fiqh.html" title="Fiqh">Fiqh</a>, about this? It is clear from Amoruso's input at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dome_of_the_Rock#Not_built_by_Jews.2C_not_intended_for_Jews.2C_and_never_used_by_Jews" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dome_of_the_Rock#Not_built_by_Jews.2C_not_intended_for_Jews.2C_and_never_used_by_Jews" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Dome of the Rock discussion that this is all politically driven dispute of Islamic authentic reports regarding the al-Aqsa mosque in general. Amoruso for some reason favors reports discredited by muslim scholars. Furthermore, Amoruso also disputes the definition of al-Aqsa mosque <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque#Dispute" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque#Dispute" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> or the term al-Masjid al-Aqsa which denotes that whole area surrounding the Rock and not only the congregational mosque per the correct Islamic terminology. Hence the issue is really larger than this article. Please note that Amoruso created this article and at the same time continues to remove the correct Islamic view and definitions regarding al-Aqsa congregational mosque and the Dome of the Rock mosque to prove his own wrong non Islamic theories part of which only appears in this article. This way, Wikipedia is getting turned to an unreliable source regarding Islamic sites and concepts. A great favor and preference should be given first to the better understood and well explained Islamic resources and cannot just be left open to travel brouchures and travel preferences by some muslims googled on the Web. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 19:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - it's a fundamentally unsound topic to be discussing in any kind of "multi-cultural" Forum. The only way this article could be valuable as a reference is if it were written entirely by Muslims (and they were going to come to some kind of consensus, which I doubt).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Dear Amoruso, I think whats dubious is your intentions of writing this article in the first place. You cannot continue to shift your argument from the core of the issue like what you showed in your response to Ramellite. Your neutrality towards the issue is questionable. The 2nd Resulotion of 2nd Islamic summet of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) (see [<a href="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/2/2nd-is-sum.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/2/2nd-is-sum.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>]) has clearly stated that the city of Jerusalem represent the Third Holiest City in Islam. There is no logical reason for debate beyond this point, other than the intent to confuse the average Wikipedia user with dubious conflecting information.<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboosh_85a8.html" title="User:Aboosh">Aboosh</a> 00:53, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> Well, my comment in that instance had to do with whether just a link or a whole section on the contested topic in the Al Asqa article was still appropriate, after you forked the content into this article. My "support" towards any solution in any case is always contingent upon critical examination and open discussion, which we are attempting to have here. The rest of my statement in that post, including my final comment, <i>I don't think a whole section on "third holiest sites" is at all necessary</i> obviously extends to the content in this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You are correct that this is "an attempt to use AfD to resolve a content dispute." I wholeheartedly wish this dispute could be resolved here. However, this is not fundamentally about <i>me</i> or my politics, or even about the politics of the other posters here. What this matter is about is whether this content is at all appropriate within the goals and policies of this encyclopedia. I've said before that any actual theological question here should be discussed strictly within theological scholarship, I would think this would be a standard policy for <i>any</i> encyclopedia article on <i>any</i> religious topic, and it frankly shocks me that I seem to be the only non-Islamic editor here that has at all voiced that opinion. Moreover, I am also shocked and suprised that editors with no possible interest in what is a completely specious article have lined up with <b>"strong keeps,"</b> as if the subject actually meant something to them. The plethora of negative responses to this AfD from editors knowledgable about Islam clearly shows that this article is flamebait and cannot be redeemed through ordinary editing practices. I reiterate my strong opinion that the best option for Wikipedia and its readership would be to <b>delete</b> this article completely.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 06:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I find your comment as somewhat not understanding and grasping what wikipedia is about IMO and from my very modest experience. Wikipedia is about sharing sources by users on a variety of subjects. There are both muslim and muslim experts <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that are relevant to the article and there are also other sources which can be used, and it's all good. There's no need to back down simply because it doesn't fit a certain narrow islamic thought as falsely one sided represented by a few users. wikipedia is open to everyone and for anyone to have research using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It's exactly informative articles like this that make wikipedia such a convenient encyclopedia and censoring information rather than discussing, changing, improving it and so on stands in contrast to everything. Therefore, the result should have been <b>speedy keep</b>... <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 07:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there is what <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is and there is what an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is. That Wikipedia does not rely on "well-educated, well-informed content experts" does not mean that <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> is so loose as to accommodate any and all references from people that might not be so well-informed, especially as presented on a topic guaranteed to piss off a huge portion of its likely readership, as this discussion has clearly shown. I still think that realistically, articles on sites sacred to distinct religions should be respectively separated, and that mixing together content on various sacred sites along with non-scholastic references in a single article can only offend religious believers, again as this discussion has clearly shown. Wikipedia is not about anyone's right to piss anyone off on the basis of race, creed or color, and if this site is to become an authoritative resource it must rely on scholastic references, especially on controversial topics, and present information with appropriate respect for the subject matter. I don't see how keeping this article can at all be justified after comments from Wikipedian Islamic experts.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 09:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Almaqdisi has said that “IT is VERY VERY wrong again to say that the Shiites dispute [that Jerusalem is 3rd holiest]" and Aboosh has stated: “This is an issue that has to have an input from Islamic scholars <b>ONLY</b>”. I repeat: Let us not only rely on theological viewpoints, let us also take into consideration the view of the “man in the Street”: The following is from a blog: <b>For us Shias - Karbala, Najaf, Kazmain (all in Iraq) and Mashad in Iran all precede Jerusalem by many a mile</b>.<a href="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:sPljIhSiyKEJ:www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D234914591+shia+imam+najaf+%22third%22+holiest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=48" class="external autonumber" title="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:sPljIhSiyKEJ:www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D234914591+shia+imam+najaf+%22third%22+holiest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=48" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.

<li>Comment: Almaqdisi I am not going to pretend I am a scholar of the stature of <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusuf_al-Qaradawi_80a1.html" title="Yusuf al-Qaradawi">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> but all I can say is that since Jerusalem is not mentioned (Is bayt-ol-maqqudas mentioned?) it gives us no conclusive evidence that Jerusalem was intended. See <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html#Location_of_the_.E2.80.9Cfarthest_mosque.E2.80.9D" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Location of the “farthest mosque”</a> for elaboration. If Jerusalem would have been mentioned only once, like Mecca, there would be no basis at all for most of the arguments on this page and others. Just that one mention would have dispelled any notion that Jerusalem was not the intended place. Unfortunately it was not, hence the ongoing debate. You are correct in saying that it is not necessarily the mere mention of a place that gives it it's importance: there are tens of name places in the Bible, most of them insignificant to Judaism. However, the fact the masjid al aqsa was not identified in the scripture as being in Jerusalem is just a strong argument whether Jerusalem was the place intended or not. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But unlike yours, his "POV" is backed by over a billion Muslims, is verifiable by authentic, historical texts, established since the very beginning of islam, readily acknowledged today, mentioned in several Islamic texts that unfortunately arent there on the internet but readily available in any bookstore selling books by Islamic scholars, and a whole lot more. Unlike your theory mostly surviving on your painstaking search for any page on the internet and which IMHO is as credible are those rumours and chain emails circulating on the internet like "Secret corporations headed by the Jews were behind 9/11", with all the alleged "evidence" they provide. - <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMlaheji_4c26.html" title="User:Mlaheji">Mlaheji</a> 17:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't get me wrong -- it shouldn't be hard to demonstrate that the vast majority of authorities consider Al-Aqsa to be the third holiest site, but that some groups of Muslims, such as the Cypriots, consider other sites to be the "third holiest." In fact, assuming that that's true (and I due), <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires that "due weight" be given to each opinion. However, "undue weight" isn't a good ground for deletion, IMHO, just for a {{sofixit}}.

<li><b>Keep</b> The belief that the furthest mosque is in Jerusalem is not universally held by Muslims, even if it is only with around 10 percent of Muslims. If the Imam Ali Mosque is holier than the Al-Aqsa Mosque to 10% of Muslims then this is significant and an informative article. You will never make everyone happy. This is the reason why there are no modern artist renderings on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> page because it disagrees with the beliefs of many Muslims (but not all). So let it be disputed, but let the article stay as it is quite informative. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 19:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the issue is clear by now. Wikipedia does not supress any information. The supporters of deletion brought examples after examples that were refuted - they said "oh wikipedia doesn't have anything dedicated to the theory that Jews were involved in 9/11" and then they were showed a page that it did have. They said "oh wikipedia doesn't have a page dedicated to the moon hoax" and then were showed a page that it did have an entire article about it, and so on. The problem here I'm afraid is broader than wikipedia... wikipedia shouldn't play a part in censoring information. I think most users acknowledged that article should be edited more and more, articulated nicely to a great article, and not to delete valid information because of POV's. I think again this is non issue according to wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 20:07, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Amuroso and Chesdovi, Please listen. Jerusalem was mentioned by the Prophet when he embarked his night Journey. There are several authentic narrations to this regard one of which is this found at al-Aqsa mosque page itself! Here is is again:</p>
<p>The hadith narrator <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam_Muslim_48cd.html" title="Imam Muslim">Imam Muslim</a> reports that the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Prophet's companion</a> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anas_ibn_Malik_fe7d.html" title="Anas ibn Malik">Anas ibn Malik</a> mentions that the Prophet said:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">
<p>I came to the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Buraq.html" title="Buraq">Buraq</a>, I rode it until we arrived at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_Jerusalem_1533.html" title="Names of Jerusalem">Bayt al-Maqdis</a>. I tied it to where the Prophets tie, then I entered the masjid I prayed two <a href="../../../r/a/k/Raka%27ah.html" title="Raka'ah">Rakaah</a>, and then ascended to the heavens.</p>

<p><b>Comments</b>: If you do not want to believe this Hadith of the Prophet, it is a problem because Islamic terminolgies we are discussing here started there and not in the Torah or the Bible. There is two more Hadiths regarding the night Journey where the term Bayt al-Maqdis is used too. I do not see why you do not want to listen to these narrations and instead favor other sources to discuss a purley Islamic term. It seems to me that you are now discussin if the Furthest Mosque was in Jerusalem at all apart from it being the third virtous mosque in Islam. Finally, Jerusalem and it surrounding is what was described in Quran as "al-Ard Al-Mubarakeh" meaning the blessed land, or the land God has bless to all nations. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 20:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (to Amoruso): The difference between those articles and this one is that those articles deal with actual orchestrated hoaxes and conspiracy theories as they occur in the real world. This article attempts to inject the same spurious reasoning into what should be a purely theological question and nothing more, the matter of which again would be more diplomatically addressed in different articles associated with particular sites sacred to respective religions. I agree that this is a manufactured dispute on a non-issue.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 21:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A lot of people are saying here that this is a Muslim topic so the Muslims have to have the first and last word on the subject. Well, there's a problem with that. This is Wikipedia, and Wikipedia has articles about Islam, but Wikipedia is not a Muslim project. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multicultural.html" title="Multicultural">multicultural</a> project. Sources from OUTSIDE of the codified Mulslim clerical world can and SHOULD speak on Muslim topics on Wikipedia so that many POVs can be neutrally stated and the reader can get a more full picture. If there were a Mulslim Wikipedia, then the people here who want Islam to have the first and last word concerning what should and shouldn't appear here would be appropriate. In the case of the english Wikipedia, however, that's just not the way things should work. On Wikipedia, omiting sourced material stated in a NPOV way just because it doesn't jive with one's accepted version of Islamic thought represents <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> and smacks of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_burning.html" title="Book burning">book burning</a>. I know this is not a particularly comfortable thing to many, especially those coming from places where individual expression is not especially encouraged, and I don't mean to insult anyone here. I just think that we need to loosen up and allow somethings to stand even if we don't agree with them because others do and also have a right to speak. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 22:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Speaking for myself, to me the matter is about what consitutes reliable sources on what is purportedly a theological issue that would be most appropriately discussed within authoritative scholastic literature. We all should know that it would be impossible and entirely against Wikipedia policy to screen editors on self-disclosed cultural or political affiliations to any or all articles. However, it does seem to me that the practical matter of "what constitutes reliable sources" is being obscured by the political matters you've just described, which however this article seems entirely designed to evoke.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 23:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Comments to Elizmr</i>: WikiPedia is not an Islamic Project I agree. But it is an Encyclopedia that should be informative. The title of this article has problems because of two things. First, it has the word "Third" and the word "Islam" in it. This article would be reasonable if it discusses holy site regarded by muslims in general. In that case, there is a space for this article. However, the people behind this article insist on using the word "Third" which comes from a narration from the Prophet Muhammad. If the word third stays there, then the authors of the article are obligated to stick to the Islamic resources discussing the word third. The problem is right here. This article if you notice is not written to discuss the first or the second site in Islam. It is only written to argue about the Third site! The numbers First, Second and Third are ranks of how virteous is a mosque. This is the only reason these are ranked in Islam and have a designated number. The article would be fine if the authors do not focus on the rankings because they are then entitled to come up with a narration or a resource which explicitly mentions that this sect of muslims reject the narration of the Prophet Muhammad regarding the Bayt al-Maqdis and explicitly demonstrate the argument of that particular sect on what is the first, second, and third site for them. The resources should include what sect is this, and whether there is a consensus in that sect regarding this site, and so for. This article is therefore failing to do so. Some users here say there are articles about the Hoax of Jews and 9/11. That is okay, but still the title say it is a Hoax. Unfortunately, this article we have here give no useful information because it gives all resources equal weight, and is written by people whom main objective is to Challenge and dispute a well established fact in Islam. They are therefore entitled to give their evidence about that from the Islamic resources itself. They need not of course to be muslims, but their evidence should come from Islamic resources and not from anything else. The reason again being in the fact that it has the in the title the word "Islam", and that it uses the word "Third" coming from an authentic narration. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 00:20, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Almaqdisi: So, it sounds like you are saying that the article could be fixed if 1) divergent Muslim views were discussed more explicitly with what they reject, etc 2) The idea of ranking of sites in Islam and what it means was discussed more explicitly 3) and the sources and how relevant they are felt to by Muslims from different sects were discussed more explicitly in the article and 4) the article touched on the first and second sites more than it does and 5) the title did not include the word "Third" and the word "Islam". <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 00:57, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I repeat, there's no compromise in it. A compromise like discussed above will be to rename the article possibly to "Islam holiest sites" and have the discussion on the third site there for example. There's no compromise possible to delete this - most of the users object to deleting this, there's no consencus obviously, and therefore article stays. <b>You can propose possible name changes to this article in the talk page of the article</b>. The information could have already appeared in the differnet articles like it did on the Al Aqsa mosque , and it's not related to the issue of keep or delete of this article.

I would withdraw it, but I'll leave it to others to decide if a compromise on these terms is potentially feasable. It could be feasable, provided better references could be found for these assertions for the sites in other articles, but right now I don't see what the use would be of forking over the bulk of this badly referenced content.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 02:52, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strongly support Amerique's Proposal</b> for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the article as it appears now is really creating a Hoax rather than Documenting a one.</li>

Only after these bits of information are verified and tested at the respective article, then one may have a single article collecting them. But so far, this article is really creating a Hoax rather than reporting it. <b>For example, if you may check <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Juwana_Mosque_d68e.html" title="Al Juwana Mosque">Al Juwana Mosque</a>, it was only created on October 25th by Chesdovi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Juwana_Mosque&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Juwana_Mosque&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> after this info was used by Amoruso on September 7th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74295402" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74295402" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>.</b>&#160;?!?!

I might have made mistakes becasue I am not a Muslim, but I tried to address the concerns that have been addressed regarding scriptural references by Almaqdisi and others.

<dd>I've taken a look, and it seems well-intentioned and well-written, but it is beyond me to evaluate the content issue in this case. All I have been doing is applying my understanding of WP policy to the references used to support these assertions, as that is where this article seems weakest and how it seems most likely to spread misunderstanding and confusion both as to the subject and as to the goals of this encyclopedia. I have nothing against what you've done, but my own concerns were mainly about the references as opposed to the language per se.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 09:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Amerique already sent this out to the respective article although some of these alleged "third Holy sites" statrted to have articles on their own recently!! Get more serious resources about this subject before doing anything else.

I think a simple mention of that fact on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is more than enough, given that it is the <i>most widely</i> accepted to <i>most</i> muslims.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is a collection of opinions, not all of them Muslim opinions, about the ranking of holy sites. Any information specifically about Al Aqsa can be put in that article, and information about the other sites, or discussion of Muslim rankings of holy sites, can go in the <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziarat.html" title="Ziarat">Ziarat</a> article, which summarizes all the material re Muslim pilgrimage sites.

<li>Don't you think that it's rather presumptuous of non-Muslims to dictate to Muslims the exact degree of reverence they should give to each site?

You object and I then tell you that I know more about your food preferences than you do!</li>
<li>I'm prepared to accept that Muslims might not agree on ranking mosques after Mecca and Medina, and that could be discussed in the <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziarat.html" title="Ziarat">Ziarat</a> article. However, I'm not sure that we could give any definitive answer. All we can do is cite a few authorities and perhaps give some statistics re number of pilgrims.
