<li><b>Comment</b>: Is this 'abuse me in deletion discussions' week? Yes, I am 16. Yes, I have hobbies that some consider odd. Guess what? I have a fair understanding of Wikipedia policy, and, as far as I can see, this article does not meet Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 18:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Dude you are nothing but a nuisance. Stop deluding yourself. Don't you see the pathetic irony. You are a COMPLETELY UNNOTABLE INDIVIDUAL WITH NO PUBLIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS!!!Yet you fly all over this site judging individuals who do have public accomplishment. You are a pubetic loser who has nothing better to do than abuse the public access features of Wikipedia. You are nothing but a troll. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li>Trolls are having a hey day here at Wikipedia. How can little dweebs who have ABSOLUTELY NO PUBLIC ACCOMPLIHMENTS be allowed to be GATEKEEPERS here. How ironic. The most pathetic of nobodys with nothing better to do than play dungeons and dragons can scan Wikipedia and delete accomplished individuals. Silly system Wikipedia. You have allowed a haven for trolls. Wikipedia is a haven for trolls as proven by the many UNNOTABLE DWEEBS who are allowed to abuse the public access features of this site. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li>Changes to the citings have been made to Pat Cottrell. We have cited to a website which validates the existence and nature of material in the entry. However we want to restate our protest that Wikipedia is being overun with editing and deleting trolls such as Wilburn and Cricket02 et all. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>
<li>Note to administrator: It is noticed by Paul Connors that "ONLY AN ADMINISTRATOR" can delete a file. Well I would expect that as an ADMINISTRATOR you would be willing to identify yourself. Is there a phone number you can be reached at? If not I would have to ask what on Earth qualifies you to be an ADMINISTRATOR. ADMINISTRATORS have POWERS and with POWERS comes RESPONSIBILITY. RESPONSIBILITY means identifying yourself with your birth name and phone contact information. Or is all that stuff just too real for you? Just asking since you obviously are OK with having a bunch of troll run this site. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>
<li>Also there is such a notion as PROBABLE CAUSE. You are allowing these trolls to run around the site and instigate deletions that amounts to suppressing the legitimacy of Wikipedia. THESE TROLLS ARE NOT SEEKING OUT ENTRYS RANDOMLY. THEY ARE TARGETING ENTRYS WHICH GIVE THEM THE BIGGEST PERSONAL THRILL. LIKE BAD COPS. Is this the kind of public relations Wikipedia wants?? <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No one who has taken part in this discussion is an administrator, and, even if they were, they would have every right not to reveal personal information about themselves. Accusing people of being trolls can be interpretted as offensive, please stop doing that. There is still nothing in the article that prooves that this person meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">the Wikipedia policy</a> on the subject. As for the matter of why this article has been 'targetted'- it appears to be about a non-notable subject. Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#It_should_be_about_everything" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">isn't about everything</a>, only notable topics. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:10, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Kid once again. What you have to say is absolutely meaningless to me. You are a certified nobody (Troll). You perfectly illustrate the downside of computers getting cheaper and cheaper. The fact that you are too timid to identify yourself in a way which would allow yourself to be contacted, yet you are enthusiastic about your trolling Activities proves my point. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: No one is questioning the existence of the subject, just the notability. I looked at the new cited material, the first link is a personal website that is nonexsitent <a href="http://www.patcottrell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.patcottrell.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The next is a band website <a href="http://www.thephiltres.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thephiltres.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, proves existence, yes, but not notability, anyone can have a website. The next link is listed twice, <a href="http://www.seeing-stars.com/ShowBiz/YourBigBreak.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.seeing-stars.com/ShowBiz/YourBigBreak.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and proves that the "Your're Big Break" show exists, yes, but does not mention this person was ever a guest, and even if it did, I still don't think the subject meets the notability guidelines for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. I still stand with <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 19:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And this discussion is just that, a discussion on Wikipedia guidelines and trying to reach a consensus of many, either delete or keep according to the notability guidelines set forth by many. It is a fair system in my opinion, and your're right, only Admins can delete this article, but an Admin will come here and read the comments and delete only if consensus warrants. Admins are voted in by the same process by the way, by a fair consensus. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 19:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Look at the last entry from the troll..."you can talk to me on my talk page..." Please I'm not here to be your friend. Sorry troll not a taker. It is so pathetic that Wikipedia attracts so many trolls and lets these pathetically lonely nobodys be the gatekeepers for who is notable. Please. Wikipedia is crack cocaine for these patheticly lonely people. The sense of "power" these trolls get by entrenching their pathetic selves here at Wikipedia "deletion central" must be unprecedented across the web. Wikipedia please change your evaluation process. You are a haven for patheticly lonely and meaningless people. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></p>
