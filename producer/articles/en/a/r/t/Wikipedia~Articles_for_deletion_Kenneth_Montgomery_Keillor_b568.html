<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm not 100% convinced that he's "notable enough" (whatever that means), but in a borderline case, I'd prefer that we let the article stay. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 04:28, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It usually means that the subject satisfies one or more of our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. In this case, as with other <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiographies</a> (Looking at earlier versions of this article, that are written in the first person by the same author, confirms what <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Petaholmes</a> says about this having been written by its subject.), that means verifying the information supplied using sources <i>other than</i> the subject. If it turns out that there is independent corroboration that this person is indeed a published author of three widely read books (at least one of which is <i>also</i> the subject's own autobiography, it is claimed), then this person satisfies those criteria. However, Amazon doesn't have them listed, and whilst ABC Bookworld does, it tells us that they are published by "The Punks Entertainment". Given that that is the name of the subject's own web site, it appears that these books were either published by a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-publishing.html" title="Self-publishing">self-published</a>. The subject certainly fails to satisfy the criteria for politicians even according to this autobiography, having apparently never actually <i>won</i> an election (see also <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Party_of_British_Columbia_79dd.html" title="Freedom Party of British Columbia">Freedom Party of British Columbia</a>). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:22, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have re-written it to bring it up to Wikipedia standards. Please review the article and reconsider your vote. He founded a minor political party, he has written books, and he was a postmaster! (Well, two out of three make him worthy of a bio here.) I have deleted all of the adulatory quotations, which have no place here. The books are legitimate: see <a href="http://www.abcbookworld.com/?state=view_author&amp;author_id=5884" class="external text" title="http://www.abcbookworld.com/?state=view_author&amp;author_id=5884" rel="nofollow">B.C Bookworld author profile</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 18:24, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Valiant attempt. The main contributor to the page has been User:70.69.206.159 who is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12490051" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12490051" rel="nofollow">Keillor himself.</a> From what I see there is nothing partcularly notable about him outside the political party thing (the books at best put me into the neutral column). Since the political party seems to be based around his views and opinions much of his bio should be in the party's article. I still feel it is best to concentrate on the party's article than this one. Also, I'd like to point you to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_Articles_to_improve_e18f.html#Articles_to_clean-up" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board/Articles to improve">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board/Articles to improve#Articles to clean-up</a> for a whole list that you can put those clean-up skills to work on. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 06:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and make a protected <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Party_of_British_Columbia_79dd.html" title="Freedom Party of British Columbia">Freedom Party of British Columbia</a>. I would say Merge, but (1) that's work for somebody and (2) it just means that <i>that</i> article will become the subject of hijinks. Look, they guy ran for office twice, got 217 votes (1.5%) and then 195 votes (1%). That's just... my dog could do that. Besides that, <i>who needs it</i>? Who needs all the nonsense associated with this? Having to deal with this guy makes Wikipedia weaker by diverting resources that could be used on improving real articles. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response:</b> He appears to meet the following criterion for inclusion: "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more." While we don't know that his books have sold that many, nor do we know that they have not. The fact that he has published three books that are included in the National Library of Canada, and that he has a profile on BC Bookworld as noted above, suggests to me that he meets the criterion. The fact that the article has been subject to vandalism is not, to me, a valid criterion for deletion. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> article is vandalized frequently, too. Vandalism can be addressed through page protection if necessary. I note also that his recent edits have not been vandalism. I think, and I may be wrong, that he is starting to get what this is about. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
