<p>Perhaps if you are not African American, or is this site not for what is notable for American of African heritage? This is a state of Mississippi Historic site. C. Baker Motley used it a the base of operations during the court sessions to integrate the Law school at Old MS University. Judge Marshall came there to work with other NAACP lawyers. Leontine Price sang there because it was one of a few places where she could sing opera to her own people in the south. It is not a Church but a 65 acre campus. The only place in this country where a Black person could legally walk on the beach or swim in a part of the Gulf of Mexico until after the passage of the Civil Rights Act.</p>

<li>My criteria for an AfD are based on objective criteria. The retreat has all of 75 unique hits on google.

There were 2 AP stories, both of which had to do with the rebuilding of the camp. Big deal, lots of stuff has to be rebuilt after the hurricanes. We don't list every apartment building and hotel on the Gulf Coast that was destroyed. I found nothing to assert the sort of notability which you claim for the place. According to the state's historical preservation, there are 588 state historical landmarks in Mississippi. <a href="http://www.mdah.state.ms.us/hpres/landmark.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mdah.state.ms.us/hpres/landmark.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> including post offices.

<dd>I disagree with the tone of this comment and the use of the term "foolheaded.

<li>The name "Fringe Festival" is self-consciously ironic; the event itself is well-known and extremely well-regarded. There are "Fringe Festivals" in major cities around the English-speaking world and more, including New York, Philadelphia, Boulder, San Francisco, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Ottawa, Melbourne, Prague, Singapore, Dublin, Brighton, Bath, and Edinburgh. Some are more substantial than others; the New York City event is extremely well-known, regularly covered in depth and treated as notable by media like the New York Times. The name, as I recall, goes back to one of the UK events in the late 1940s, staged in an area of the involved city known as "the Fringe". The last time I checked, an ironic name was not grounds for deprecating an otherwise substantial event. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:31, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I created this article some time ago, and I still believe that the information it contains is undeniably valuable. However, I have nominated it because I feel that the article is unencyclopedic in that it does not actually have a <i>topic</i>: it exists solely as a context for the scale-chart it contains—in fact, the article contains <i>absolutely no information not already in the image it's built around</i>. The GIF within it has been uploaded onto the commons, so no information will be lost. The commons is definitely a better place for this kind of thing. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo">Ingoolemo</a>&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. One reason it's so hard to find with Google is that this is actually called the "Austral-Asian <b>Christian</b> Church".

I understand it is in Adelaide, but I see also a reference to Canberra, Perth and Darwin.

<li>This whole idea was first proposed <i>by AFD'</i> as a solution to a very real and otherwise unresolvable debate. It's not an ideal solution, I grant, but it's the only way anybody's found to date to balance a very real and legitimate difference of opinion on the notability of electoral candidates.

<li><b>Keep</b> as status quo compromise. This 'List of...' article is a proactive alternative to individual candidate pages that spring up every election. Theoretically (in my mergist fantasy), all candidates get a redirect page to this kind of list page (or, more practically, as it is practised, all candidates get merged/redirected to such a page once someone creates an article on them). This page solves some rather annoying things, like endless afds on electoral candidates who just want the free ad space and get it for at least the 5 days the afd takes (hint: don't take it to afd, just merge/redirect it to the list pages) and a one-stop shop to monitor for abusive or peacock descriptions of the candidate (opposed to monitoring hundreds of pages during that grace period candidates are normally given during an election). This topic had a centralized discussion here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>; and this proposal came up here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html#A_mergist.27s_solution" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates#A mergist's solution</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 07:01, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not a solution since we just keep the (non-)information somewhere else! What does it matter which title you put it under? If we get a bunch of politico-vanity-adverts every election, then that's fine. Delete them every election. I do not see, like Steve block below, that that discussion has any particular 'consensus' so strong as to overrule ordinary notability standards and to justify a dismissal of this entire AfD on the basis of it, as some seem to be suggesting. -194.247.247.60 19:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not a "solution" to the problem you are posing, but it is a solution to the problem posed at the centralized discussion. This is an unofficial compromise, not a 'concensus' that emerged from centralized discussion (it never went to a straw poll). The reason the title matters is because it is much easier to deal with one article than a dozen. These are just little bios that illustrate what kind of people are running for these parties. They are not full-blown biographies that require hours of research. One of the reasons the centralized discussion occured was because the afd process was not working, some were <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Simon_Strelchik_2025.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik">kept</a>, some <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cindy-Lee_Robinson_a889.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cindy-Lee Robinson">deleted</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Kenneth+Montgomery+Keillor" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Kenneth+Montgomery+Keillor" rel="nofollow">(some repeatedly)</a> but most ended with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Niki_Ashton_8e1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Niki Ashton">'no concensus'.</a> --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 01:29, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm also not sure we need seperate lists for each party, when they are of these lengths. I think I'd be inclined to keep merging these lists to a point where they aren't unwieldy and aren't potential forks and aren't granting undue balance. On the last point, do the major parties <b>also</b> have lists of their failed candidates? If not, we are creating articles on an undue balance basis. At the moment, <b>delete</b>.

<li>How does keeping them get rid of them? Why do we need a place for below-average losers? One article per party that is actually relevant to the world outside their pub crew, I can understand.

<li>I'm at a loss why a party that got way way less than 1% overall (yes, individual ridings varied but they competed in what, 15 ridings tops???) needs an article about a particular election outcome. I think merging this stuff with the main party article is the way to go. To those that cite other party articles, as examples that it should be done this way, I suggest perhaps that other minor party articles need the same merging/purging treatment too. Nothing much more could ever be said here, could it? As much as it pains me to do so, given my extreme detestation for Mr. Brenneman and his deletionist ways (KIDDING!)

<li>Yes, I did. And I imagine my comment sounds quite harsh to the author of the article. But really, <i>did</i> they have any impact on any of the things I mentioned in my first sentence? Are they likely ever too? Did they even get any significant media coverage, apart from some presumable stuff about being a fringe party (or whatever the terminology appropriately is)? Is the detailed info on the candidates actually of connection to anything other than this article? If you cut that out, at least we'd get a more focussed article. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't create the 2006 article -- someone else did. As has already been noted, the list system is a compromise: the candidates don't need to be individually important to qualify. To the party's importance, it might be noteworthy the Stephen Harper, Canada's current PM, once wrote about adding the CHP's support base to a broad "right-wing coalition" (not that I'm suggesting that the page should be kept for this reason alone). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where has everyone got the idea that Wikipedia should onlyu include things that are important or "notable" (which is as vague and useless a term as one could imagine)? The main advantage that Wikipedia has over paper encyclopedias is that is can cover the nooks and crannies of the sum of knowledge in this world. There is no consensus that "notability" should be a criterion for inclusion. See the grounds for deletion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, and, for interest, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Jimbo Wales' view on notability</a>, as expressed in the poll where notability failed to become an accepted reason for deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 20:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an endlessly rehearsed argument. It fails on several key counts: Jimbo's ordinary opinions, whilst of great interest, do not form policy or guideline absent some authority being granted to them, or him speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>. Also, "non-notable" is <i>such</i> an accepted deletion criterion that non-notable bios, bands etc, can be deleted on sight per CSD A7. "Non-notable" is a frequently successful argument for deletion because it is simply a collecting-together of many different things: WP:NOT a collection of indiscriminate information, of unencyclopedic information, etc etc. It is not as simple "i don't think he's interesting". It is clearly enough not a "useless" term, it is actually a usefully adaptive term that is just oft-debated as people differ on individual items. The nooks and crannies of the sum of knowledge indeed; it is questionable whether the school-days employment of a random loser qualifies as knowledge. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:39, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And the counter-argument is that there are hundreds of articles on minor characters in Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Buffy, Pokemon, video game and lots of other <i>fictional</i> universes. There are articles on weaponry, spacecraft, battles, religions, languages and institutions of these universes <i>that do not exist</i>. These articles exist because people are interested enough to write about them, and because Wikipedia is willing to be the host for information about them. Here we are talking about real world candidates of real world political parties for real world political offices in a county that is, for the most part, a real place. There are people who are interested in writing about and reading about these people. How is Wikipedia diminished by allowing the stories of these real people sit alongside all of the articles about the stories of minor fictitional characters? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 21:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the article survives the afd process, as the primary author, I'll take responsibility for addressing all the concerns regarding references. Having said that, Browned, is there someone who wouldn't consider <a href="http://www.bctf.ca/social/homophobia/" class="external text" title="http://www.bctf.ca/social/homophobia/" rel="nofollow">this</a> to be a pro-homosexual agenda (the link was in the article but deleted by Brenneman)? That page starts with the terms "social justice activists" and "homophobia and heterosexism action group" to describe their approach. I still intend to keep all relevant facts in the revised article. Pointing out the activism of a group that <i>identifies iteself</i> as activist, is not an "attack", especially when it relates directly to the topic at hand. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeetdeet_53b9.html" title="User:Deetdeet">Deet</a> 00:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: All who are familiar with this case should know that the Kempling case has enormous ramifications. Certainly the College of Education saw it as important or they would not have pursued the matter so far. The BC Teachers' Federation saw it important in that even though they were against Kempling's statements they gave him financial backing at a higher court level than, I understand, they were required to. Practically everything in this article is neutral, and it would only take one or two minor ones to make it totally so. The facts of this case, including the decision which effectively bars teachers from independent public discussion of education unless they are politically in line with the correct thinking, is enormous.

<li><b>Keep</b> as status quo compromise. This 'List of...' article is a proactive alternative to individual candidate pages that spring up every election. Theoretically (in my mergist fantasy), all candidates get a redirect page to this kind of list page (or, more practically, as it is practised, all candidates get merged/redirected to such a page once someone creates an article on them). This page solves some rather annoying things, like endless afds on electoral candidates who just want the free ad space and get it for at least the 5 days the afd takes (hint: don't take it to afd, just merge/redirect it to the list pages) and a one-stop shop to monitor for abusive or peacock descriptions of the candidate (opposed to monitoring hundreds of pages during that grace period candidates are normally given during an election). This topic had a centralized discussion here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>; and this proposal came up here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html#A_mergist.27s_solution" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates#A mergist's solution</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 07:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not convinced, reading <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>, that this compromise has any more consensus than any other. I'm also not sure we need seperate lists for each party, when they are of these lengths. I think I'd be inclined to keep merging these lists to a point where they aren't unwieldy and aren't potential forks and aren't granting undue balance. On the last point, do the major parties <b>also</b> have lists of their failed candidates? If not, we are creating articles on an undue balance basis. At the moment, <b>delete</b>.

<li>I'm at a loss why a party that got way way less than 1% overall (yes, individual ridings varied but they competed in what, 5 ridings tops??? even less than the other party articles Brenny put up today) needs an article about a particular election outcome. I think merging this stuff with the main party article is the way to go. To those that cite other party articles, as examples that it should be done this way, I suggest perhaps that other minor party articles need the same merging/purging treatment too. Nothing much more could ever be said here, could it? It is with great and over-riding (get it?) joy that I support Mr. Brenny in his noble endeavour. (KIDDING!!! about the noble part I mean...) and therefore I must suggest that the right thing to do here is <b>Merge with redirect</b>...

<li>One prior AfD decision (that was probably wrong) and little to no precedent. I don't think that either justify spending pixels explaining what someone with &lt;1% of the vote "describes himself as". Adding a summary percentage somewhere relevant, would be fine, of course.

The statistical info in this article can be and already is elsewhere. There is not much added by this article: I mean, why does it matter that <i>"Zupansky has described himself as a business owner and salesperson"</i>? The only reason this debate might not get us anywhere is if people decide not to engage in it: asserting that it should be overruled by a largely non-existent precedent. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:15, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello.. it is a real prize and, like the X-Prize, is constantly raising new funding. That will go on until the initial prize is won. There is a Yahoo group for the prize and several film festivals are announcing participation. It involves many members of the film and archive community and will become better known over time. The fact that fundraising is going on (perpetually) shouldn't count against it. It also takes forever to show up in Google!&#160;:-) The "official" website is under construction.

<dd>Precisely my point: Making nonverifiable content visible to wikipedia <b>users</b> (as you say, "visitors") is inadmissible. If you start doing this, it will open doors to all kinds of legalized POV pushing in subpages, linked from main article space.

<dd>Mobster lobster, you voted already above. Please stop the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppetry</a>, it's not helping you. We can see if a user is very new and the administrators will discount such opinions. As to the company, it does look very much like a for-profit entity (with links like "Portal for Business Partners" etc.) and even if it were not, it would still have to establish notability. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:53, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The fact that I am new here does not mean that I cannot state my opinion. Is this place for people who search for informatio or for people who spend their time harrasing other people&#160;? Sorry for the double voting, but double voting is NOT a sockpupettery ("A sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name.", I use only one, the undersigned). Moreover I suspect you Sandstein (a.k.a. Fagstein, not to mention TheBernFiles on Wikimedia Commons, am I right&#160;?) that you use sockpuppetery yourself. I would suggest that the authors re-classify the article to something less controversial like 'non-profit organizations' or move to a domain-related classification (like: 'search techniques' or 'NLP').

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is being deleted because the nominator is not interested in little people bands, and so thinks that no one else should be able to read about them.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am a little surprised that they could be regarded as a band since <a href="http://www.kapelovitz.com/minikiss.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kapelovitz.com/minikiss.htm" rel="nofollow">they were reported in Hustler magazine in 2004</a> as: <i>"The band isn't really playing their instruments. In fact, their guitars are made out of wood, and they're singing "karaoke-style" over a Kiss CD."</i> I was advised by the main editor of the Mini Kiss article that "lip-synching is a common practice amongst cover bands." While that may be so, are cover bands that don't even play notable - surely not as bands, perhaps as entertainment acts?--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 22:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lip-sync.html#Singers_that_have_been_caught_lip-synching" title="Lip-sync">Lip-sync#Singers_that_have_been_caught_lip-synching</a> before you make a case that singing your own material has anything to do with being a band. Splitting hairs about when a 'band' becomes an 'entertainment act' is going to have huge repercussions on other articles. For great justice. 22:06, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I would distinguish between those who have ben caught lip synching and those who have never done anything else. I understand that <i>Mini Kiss</i> only lip synchs, hence presumably why there are no recordings. Those listed at <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lip-sync.html#Singers_that_have_been_caught_lip-synching" title="Lip-sync">Lip-sync#Singers that have been caught lip-synching</a> have all claimed to make recordings.

<li>I would not presume to know why they go to see them, but the issue of lip-synching, whether sometimes or all the time, is a red herring as far as deletion goes. For great justice. 23:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: Although I don't believe the band to be of particular notability in the music realm (I'd be wary of them calling a cover <i>band</i>, perhaps cover <i>performers</i> would be the more accurate representation...), I do believe they are notable.

Although I don't particularly respect this kind of exploitation (the one in process by the performers themselves), I won't allow that bias to ignore the likely notability of this band.

<li><b>Comment</b> We can't keep articles just to provide a balance of politics, notability for each individual article has to be asserted.

<li><b>Keep</b> — I'll assume good faith on the part of the nom., but really this should have been dealt with through cleanup rather than AfD.&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 15:47, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your assumption of my good faith is touching. I find that far too few articles are deleted, rather than too many. It is preferable that the word <i>tactics</i> return to the ignominy of being a red edit link, and so offer someone who knows something about it the chance to create an entirely new article; cleanup should be for articles with superficial problems, not for articles that have no good points at all. The refusal to delete poor articles is a weakness of Wikipedia, not a strength. <a href="../../../d/w/b/User%7EDwbird2_f2b7.html" title="User:Dwbird2">Dave1898</a> 17:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Charmed I'm sure. Obviously I disagree with the approach of blasting every page that doesn't immediately live up to some arbitrarily high standard. Wikipedia is still very much a work in progress.&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a>
<ul>
<li>Still, the point RJH made is a valid one. Bringing this to AFD wasn't really necessary. Placing a clean-up or expert tag on the article would have been the proper way to go. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 18:20, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, obviously, but tag appropriately (which I will do shortly). AfDing articles on notable, valid and encyclopedic subjects which are just badly written goes exactly against the stated AFD policy <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

But according to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia:Deletion Policy</a>, these two problems should cause change, not deletion.

<li><b>Clarification:</b> While the POV argument above should not solely be used as a deletion criteria, it should be considered IN ADDITION to the fact that in the context of South African politics, "One Boer, One Bullet" doesn't even register, as indicated by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a>'s argument below. While there is no inclusion criteria for slogans as such, I would assume it has to be well-known and in widespread usage, in which case there should be plenty of newspaper articles citing its use. Compared to "One Settler, One Bullet" and "Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer", this slogan is insignificant and undeserving of its own article. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 07:32, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google shows little use of this slogan (searching for variations): Mostly just the linked website (which is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>) and some sites claiming a hacker left such a message. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuka_Ja%C4%8Dov_c97d.html" title="User:Luka Jačov">Luka Jačov</a> is encouraged to read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, one of Wikipedia's three core principles.

<li>True ... and I stand behind my addition - the slogan has almost no Google hits and no coverage in any reputable press outlet that I am aware of. (And I must add that I am both a "Pretorianer" and a graduate of the University of Pretoria, where the slogan was apparently used.)

From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>"The three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus."</i> We don't even know her birth name for sure. In the article, it's listed as "Jessica Andrea Steinhauser," but on her website she says that her father is Japanese and her mother is German. If her parents were as strict and traditional as she says, she'd have a Japanese last name. That discrepancy makes me doubt Asia herself as a reliable source. This is definitely not the only discrepancy in her biographical information. Without <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, we can't have an article. I'm not objecting to how she became famous (porn), I'm objecting to the lack of reliable sources and the impossibility of verification. Should porn star articles be held to a lower or different standard of verifiability than articles on other living people? I don't think so. Erik the Rude 17:06, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Verifiable sources can be found such as imdb.com. Also this would not be the first person with disputed birthdate and name.

<dd>The Internet Movie Database contradicts itself on Asia Carrera, and is therefore not a reliable source. I don't see what Christopher Columbus has to do with this. He has reliable sources. Erik the Rude 17:40, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, he doesn't. Columbus has (partly conflicting) information in various unofficial and "official" (but not edited or peer-reviewed) documents. They qualify as "the most reliable sources available" and can be cited as such, but we don't treat them as absolute proof. IMDB, on the other hand, can have unverified information inserted by actors or wannabees or fans, so we treat it as just another pointer to possible information, whether self-contradictory or not. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> To the extent of verifying a porn actress' real name, they should be held to a slightly lower standard of verifiability than someone not in that... industry. Anonymity is part and parcel of being in porn, and the stage name is more important for their work in any case, but like the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venerable_Bede_a5f1.html" title="Venerable Bede">Venerable Bede</a>. Furthermore, in the United States children of Asian immigrants often have a non-Asian last name- whether matrilinearly acquired or invented- because of perceptions that it would reduce prejudice when interacting with government. Furthermore, the article itself cites IMDB as well as her personal website as sources, and her ethnic background is (tangentially) discussed in <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/03/30/apop.DTL" class="external text" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/03/30/apop.DTL" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from the SFGate. At any rate, there is information in the article that is a matter of public record (her marriage, for instance), and whatever controversy there might be over her name is not grounds for deleting the entire article. If you want to point out some things that you see as discrepancies in her self-provided information, I'd recommend pointing them out in cleanup or someplace other than AfD. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> 18:08, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The whole reason why I moved this article out was to avoid cluttering up the Amiga/Atari articles.

I would be willing to support if these issues are addressed but not if the article remains in this state.--Cini 19:19, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> He shows up in Peacekeeper Wars at least once, and I think twice. He's frequently discussed (or complained about) during the series and plays an important role in Rygel's backstory. As for merging, the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farscape.html" title="Farscape">Farscape</a> article isn't very well set up to list by character rather than by actor. I wouldn't be averse to a merge, but until the Farscape page is reformatted to accept it or until there's an appropriate, separate article with a list of the Farscape characters, we should keep it where it is. I strongly urge against deleting for the simple fact that he does hold some importance, and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> explicitly warns <b>not</b> to delete meaningful content.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> 00:13, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a new discussion for the current version of the Mark Henderson wiki. It currently has been hijacked from its orginal purpose as a page for Mark Henderson of the Snow Bowl fame, and is being used for MArk Henderson, lighting director. Mark Henderson, lighting director is of considerable less fame and notoriety than the Mark Henderson of the Snow Bowl fame. The current article is barely a 2 line blurb on the lighting director, and should be deleted, possibly reverted back to the original purpose, and at most a disambiguation link be added for the lighting director. Alternativly, the current article on the lighting director should be merged with the tony awards page it links to.</p>
<p>Feel free to edit this to the correct format. I tried to make a new page for this discussion, as it is on a different subject than the previous AfD, but was not able to.</p>

<dd><del>The article is neither speculative nor random. It gets the technical and social details right, and explains how the technical details mattered. It does not discuss the software piracy <b>debate</b> (<i>whether</i>, <i>why</i> and <i>why not</i>); instead it concentrates on the piracy <b>process</b> (why disk-based protection did not work <i>on the Amiga</i>, what <i>Amiga publishers</i> used instead). Note also that <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_piracy.html" title="Software piracy">Software piracy</a> redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement_of_software.html" title="Copyright infringement of software">Copyright infringement of software</a>, which address the legal and ethical aspects of piracy quite well, but says nothing whatsoever about the technical aspects.

As for <i>factual</i> -- this is a predicted event -- the scientists don't exist -- the instructions are directly from movies. Remove the crap and the article would be left saying "this is a name for a plot device".

<li><del><b>Comment</b> I do understand what the article is about and how it relates to the title, but it is so badly written that there is little that can be done with it. If there is sufficient popular demand, I could try to paraphrase it into something understandable. It is strongly POV, from the Armenian side. If someone should think that is an issue: wake up: almost all content on the issue present on Wikipedia (and elsewhere) is poisoned with POV assumptions, terms and phrases, whether from one side or the other. There is some valid but not terribly interesting content here; it would take more effort than I can muster to try and see if it is represented elsewhere. And then I'm not even mentioning the effort of finding reliable neutral sources for verifiability. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:15, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><del>That this article is POV from the Armenian side is questionable. It has been created by a Turk, the same that undangered the integrity of the main article. Why has he created an article which appear at first impression 'pro-Armenian' as you might call it, I have my suspicions but I'd rather not say it here, besides, does it make any difference that a bad quality articles POV is pro what? As it is, this entry from what it is now, doesn't have a justifiable existance. Also, I beg to disagree, and strongly, and I even find it offensive that you'd go as far as using the term 'poisoned' for 'almost all content,' but having yourself questioned the name of the main article because you considered it 'loaded,' I can't tell that it would have surprised me that the content itself isen't satisfying you, but the word poisoned was misplaced. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><del>What I mean by 'poisoned' is that if part of an article is POV it taints the whole article. I didn't mean to be offensive. I'm curious as to your suspicions, but maybe I shouldn't ask. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:25, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</del></li>

<li><del><b>keep</b> - I've done a fair amount of research on this topic since moving this page and cleaning it up many months ago. It's a real phenomenon, which is not a matter for debate at all. It is covered in a number of external sources, and is related to serious medical conditions (colovaginal fistula, for example, has related symptoms as described in the article). How, exactly is this not an encyclopedic article? Is it the cataloging of slang terms (something which many Wikipedia articles do; e.g. <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>) or is it the fact that pornography is referenced (again, this is an attempt to be complete, not to dwell on what might offend). How can we not cover this topic? How many external references are required for an article of this length? Why would an article be deleted for having less citation than that, rather than enhancing the citations? -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 21:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

The problem is that this condition is not a treatable disease or syndrom, though it can be a symptom.

It only deserves mention in the articles on these conditions.

Why should they not appear on Wikipedia? As for the first part of your comment: I'm not sure that it makes sense to discuss the same phenomenon in multiple articles without giving it an article of its own. You also claimed that the article was "woefully undersourced except for links to an urban dictionary" in the listing summary. Could you please retract that comment, since it is a rather serious misrepresentation of the article (which contains 4 inline citations and 3 external links including links to sites such as UHRAD, WebMD and Medical Tribune). If someone has better references, please feel free to add them, but I think that this article is about as well sourced as one could expect at this point. I agree that the prevention section could be re-worded to avoid an instructional tone, and rather survey techniques more objectively... which I have now done. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 18:24, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</del></dd>

<li><del><b>Weak Keep</b> Its really funny as to how this geezers name has come to light at this present moment. Im a dye hard bolton fan and last I heard of him was at a suppoters meeting back in feb and one of the topics was rumours concerning the club, He didnt actualy get the gig at bwfc coz they werent interested, then he pissed off to united, god knows what happened there! What i can say tho is that apart from the naming of bwfc as his current club, everything else seems to match up with the research I did on him (and it wasnt via google). I have a few contacts that work for bwfc and they have (sort of) heard of him. I dont think he deserves a mention on wiki coz he isnt a full-fledged premiership player. The author obviously has to do his bloody research before posting.

<dd>The question isn't whether or not a "beer run" is a real thing. I don't think anybody's unclear on that point.

<p>Not-notable. I am an alumni of the school, and I can attest to the fact it is a good band, but it do not deserve a wiki entry. Merge or Delete <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeedubber_00ec.html" title="User:Geedubber">Geedubber</a> 23:40, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There aren't any sources, specifically, that will support the idea that it is "well-recognized" as the best senior group in Vancouver OR British Columbia. In addition, with all due respect to members of this group, the regular invitations for the group to play throughout Lower Mainland does not necessarily indicate that it is a good band. The lack of sources, nevertheless, make this article extremely suspicious that this entry is used to "advertise", but not genuinely inform of readers. Good candidate for Wikipedia deletion. <a href="../../../a/w/d/User%7EAWDRacer_b5cb.html" title="User:AWDRacer">AWDRacer</a> 00:17, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's just some copied and pasted lyrics- it doesn't even tell you anything about the song. In addition, I'm pretty sure lyrics are copyrighted. --<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottesini_7f4b.html" title="User:Bottesini">Bottesini</a> 23:52, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have quickly investigated the lyrics via Google, and have discovered that these lyrics belong to a song named "Destiny" performed by the group called "Zero 7".<br />
Nevertheless, Bottesini is probably right about lyrics being copyrighted. Furthermore, this article does not add information to Wikipedia(other than the fact that the original author of this article liked it enough to place it on Wikipedia), and does not deserve a Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../a/w/d/User%7EAWDRacer_b5cb.html" title="User:AWDRacer">AWDRacer</a> 00:27, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> <s>as copyvio (without prejudice to creation of legitimate article if song is actually notable). There is nothing in this article but the lyrics. If someone wants to try again with a proper article and convince us that it is a notable song, they can. However, never having heard of this song or the apparent artist, I am somewhat skeptical that it is sufficiently notable to warrant an article.
