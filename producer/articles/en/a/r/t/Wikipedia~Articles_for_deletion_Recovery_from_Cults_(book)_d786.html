<li><b>Comment</b> another related concern expressed on the talk page of the article is that there may not be enough on-topic reputable sources for a balanced article on the book. Critiques and reviews of the book may not be available. With on-topic sources I mean sources that mention or review the book. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:33, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the book is an incredible resource for professional and laypeople alike. The fact that it has 22 contributors, some of them pretty notable in their own right, lends credence towards keeping/expanding/cleaning up some more. Perhaps, in time, some of the other more notable contributors to the book who have written numerous books/publications themselves might also merit having articles at some point.

The criteria clearly states that if <b>one</b> of the criteria is met, the book is "generally notable."

<li><b>Please keep <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recovery_from_Cults_%28book%29_6581.html" title="Recovery from Cults (book)">Recovery from Cults (book)</a> this article</b> as it is by far the most comprehensive one out there and it has by far more authentic contributors in the academic world than any other to date. Many of the contributors have wikipages here for the value of their own work, yet chose to contribute to this book because as an academic group it is harder to refute than just one academic voice. Please see the areas covered in the book in the infogami site <a href="http://xbkinfo.infogami.com/Recovery_From_Cults" class="external autonumber" title="http://xbkinfo.infogami.com/Recovery_From_Cults" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (site devoted to recovery for post <b>NRM/CULT/SECT</b> experience) <a href="http://xbkinfo.infogami.com/Recovery_From_Cults" class="external free" title="http://xbkinfo.infogami.com/Recovery_From_Cults" rel="nofollow">http://xbkinfo.infogami.com/Recovery_From_Cults</a> . Please click on any of the hot links and see how they will connect back to the wikipedia site for the pages of the contributors in the book.

<li><b>Delete.</b> From the limited description in the article so far, this book seems to represent only one POV in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-cult_trauma.html" title="Post-cult trauma">post-cult trauma</a> controversies. Perhaps it would be better to use this book as a reference to those articles to illuminate that POV. Giving it its own article would result in merely echoing the POV of the authors and essentially acting as a free advertisement for a book which some Wikipedia editors happen to have read and liked. If no sources can be found which positively or more importantly negatively review the book, then this is an indication that it does not appear to be of any notable scientific, historic, or cultural significance, and that the Wikipedia coverage of it would necessarily be original research. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 21:46, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> even though this book presents my church in a bad light. This book is crucially important to the debate over mind control and "cults". It presents a theory of "cult recruitment" which was initially very popular but later was scientifically repudiated, namely, the "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>" theory. It's hard to understand anti-cult advocacy (such as the anxiety and urgency which led to the Waco raids) without reference to the premise of this book. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> where is the indication that this book was important for the mind control theories? This 1995 book was published after the Waco raid in 1993. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>LOL, not as proof of mind control. That theory has been discredited by scientific bodies. Important for the history of <b>advocacy</b> of the mind control theory. Mangone makes the typical anti-cult arguments, and we need an article on the anti-cult POV about mind control, so readers can understand why they advised parents to seek deprogrammers (e.g., fighting fire with fire?). Keeping the article on the book is by no means an endorsement of the book's premise. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 02:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I wanted to point out that Arthur A. Dole's book-review is the <b>only</b> review to which full text is shown. Arthur A. Dole happens to be on the Board Of Directors of the ICSA (formerly known as AFF - American Family Foundation) <a href="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_profile/dole_arthur.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_profile/dole_arthur.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, whose <b>executive director</b> is Michael Langone (the author of this book) <a href="http://www.csj.org/infoserv_profile/langone_michael.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csj.org/infoserv_profile/langone_michael.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Therefore, the <b>only</b> public book-review was written by a board member belonging to a foundation to which Langone is the <b>executive director</b>. This is indicative of bias. Of course the review is going to be favorable. Since there are <b>no</b> other public book-reviews, this points directly to the non-notability of this book. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 23:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think rather it shows that there is a lot of bias in the anti-cult industry. Many groups conspired to refer worried parents to deprogrammers, and it was all justified with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a> theories. The first thing a deprogrammer tells his victim is that the real victimizers were the "cult" and the deprogrammer is going to free his mind from cult mind control. Once they get their victim to blame everything on the cult, they can easily persuade them to leave it (and they collect their $10,000 to $20,000 fee).</li>
<li>This book, like dozens of others, supports the mind control premise. It is therefore significant as being part of the controversy over whether (A) that there is such a thing a "mind control" and cults mastered the technique or (B) recruits converted of their own free will. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
