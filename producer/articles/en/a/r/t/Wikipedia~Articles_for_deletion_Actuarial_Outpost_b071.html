<li><b>Delete</b>, for now. I agree there is too much weasel wording ("...it may well be the largest and most dynamic such gathering of actuaries in the world"), "lots of assertions' not much actual sourcing." If it is dynamic, it is becuase of the chat rooms, things like palindrome post count, what's the first thing that pops into your,.... I agree that the spin off site is not significant for it's own entry, but it is noteworthy to be included in the other entry, one voice, be it Patty Sheehan can be deemed significant (source unavailable). The poster glenn above also has a personal vendetta against the spin off site, he was posting IP addresses, employer information and other information in an attempt to intimidate users of the spin off forum. I would have been fine with a neutral intervention that was a compromise, but it is clear that Avarum and his sock puppets want the entry to be nothing more than an advertisement for the owner of the domain name, an actuarial recruiting firm. Such biased advertising has no place in an encylopedia, so I would say delete it.--<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a></li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Notability has to be evaluated in context. The actuarial profession is a relatively small one and so should not be expected to achieve the same numerical results as Britney Spears. An Alexa return of 77,439 is extremely impressive in this respect.

<dd>I think even most actuaries will agree that 77K is less than 100k. What context makes something notable? Is it the largest discussion forum for "actuaries" who aren't yet actuaries and may never become actuaries, who are still taking exams, who are under 30 years old and favor liberal politics, and is supported by a recruiting company and a non-actuary in Canada? I guess if you put enough constraints on notability you can make anything notable. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a> 18:57, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment – With Alexa ranks, a smaller number is better. The site ranked at 1 is the most visited site on the Internet (by users with Alexa toolbars).

<dd>Comment – Many, if not close to 50%, of the users of the Actuarial Outpost are credentialed actuaries. It is incorrect for anyone to say that it is "only" mostly aspiring actuaries, as that is false. It includes thousands of credentialed actuaries notable in their field. – <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheActuary_5432.html" title="User:TheActuary">TheActuary</a> 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oops my BS meter just went off again. I can claim 5% credentialed actuaries at your site and you can claim 50% because there is no source. In fact if you are the site promoter (former webmaster - glenn cooke whose blog is trashing me right now and calling for my employer to take action against me) then I can easily check the Soa.org directory of membership and see that even you are not a credentialled actuary. There is NO mechanism in your sign up to check if someone is credentialed, much less if they were signing up for multiple id's in the past (until the change to non-public email requirement). Given that much of your activity (as far as diverse posters - not the 10 who regularily post to the reef or political) is in the exam section - it is fair to say that those taking exams are for the most part non-credentialed and once they stop taking exams they rarely return (although your member list is rarely if ever purged of members who posted). Bottom line, you make outrageous claims with no data.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a> 01:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well this is not a vote, but I would be happy with the article as originally edited by an outsider <a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a>, I do not believe that an insider such as <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> is going to present things in an unbiased way. From Avi's POV it is nothing more than a vanity contribution. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a> 16:15, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. An actuarial web community- how refreshingly unusual compared to the average gamer forum that is frequently noominated on AfD.

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> Against my better judgement, I've decided to post my thoughts on the whole situation. When I first encountered the article {via a post on <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a>), I came across a POV article engaged in a minor content dispute. However, as time progressed (and I attempted to informally mediate), the dispute became more profound. An edit war has insued, reversions are nonstop, and I'm pretty sure the two primary contributors (Avi and Joe Smythe) have both violated the 3RR. But I digress. This article is obviously an outlet for the two of them (and their groupies/sockpuppets) to fight over some internal dispute on their website. The talk page has become very uncivil, and personal attacks are flying from <b>BOTH</b> sides. Now, I won't give my opinions on whether the article should be kept or deleted (I can justify both viewpoints in my head), but I just thought I'd throw some general commentary about these two users into this debate for consideration by others and the closing sysop. At this point, I'm washing my hands of this article and my involvement in it. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">^</span><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">demon</span></a><sup><span style="font-size:10px"><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User_talk%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User talk:^demon"><span style="color:red">[yell at me]</span></a></span></sup>&#160;/<em style="font-size:10px;">12:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</em></li>

<dd>I am sorry you feel that way, demon. However, I would suggest you check both the article history and IP logs (if you have access) and you will see that nowhere have I reverted anything three times within 24 hours to my knowledge. As for the incivility, yes, I must admit I have been pushed to being somewhat less than absolutely proper, and that may be a personal failing for having a somewhat emotional attachement to an article I spent many hours on; I hope you can understand that human emotion. As for the person(s) who persist on trying to glorify a complete non-issue, all I can say is that if you have spent the months, let alone years, that I have as part of the community in question, your patience with some of their shenanigans would have run thin as well, I believe. Once again, I truly thank you for your efforts to both mediate and help out, and I hope it doesn't sour you from contributing to Wikipedia in that way in the future. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 13:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have another account where I regularly contribute to Wikipedia, but given the heated arguments and possible future retribution for my opinion, I prefer to use an alternate id. The site is not that notable to the profession despite the point of view of the author of the article, someone who clearly appears to be emotionally attached to the subject matter and lacking in objectivity. The actuarial community is better served by the true professional web sites of the academy, the two societies and numerous other more notable sites. I do not feel that the article is properly sourced or meets the requirements of a Wikipedia contribution. Anonymous Actuary 19:22, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability not established. The NYT article mentions it only as one of many obscure places that contain attempts to write "Fibs", haiku-ish poems with a syllabic structure based on the [[Fibbonaci_Series|]]. Members of the site should remember that Wikipedia is not generally a place where you write about your own projects.
