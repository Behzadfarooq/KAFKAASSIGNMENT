<li><b>Delete</b> I don't agree that it is inherently POV. There does seem to be an increased usage of the phrase for this president, which can be presented without bias. However, as it stands, it certainly doesn't need it's own article. -<a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasd_0960.html" title="User:Rasd">user:rasd</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Much as I despise the guy, I'm not sure this merits an article. I doubt Bush is the only one considered to have been the worst president ever (and there are many presidents besides the POTUS). I don't think the article qualifies for Speedy deletion as an attack page; WP does have similar sorts of articles like <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>. Possibly smerge some content to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> but without a redirect; the Rolling Stone article is mentioned there already but I think the HNN articles are more significant. Keep a mention in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miserable_failure.html" title="Miserable failure">Miserable failure</a> but unlink it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 05:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Nowhere in the aricle is it asserted that Bush is the worst, so the "attack page" argument is as bogus as is the POV argument. The article addresses the origins and usage of the phrase, a phrase which gets 519,000 Google hits, and is backed up with several articles from professional historians. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>-- obviously and inherently POV-- gets an article, as does <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miserable_failure.html" title="Miserable failure">miserable failure</a>, but a discussion of the history and usage of <i>this</i> phrase doesn't? There's obviously a double-standard at work. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 06:06, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> as inherently POV. Some people have called Clinton, and Bush Sr., and Reagan, and Carter, and other presidents the worst president ever. While the article as currently written does not assert that George W. Bush is the worst president ever, it discusses the belief that he is the worst president ever without considering any other possibilities. And as soon as the next president is inaugurated, some of his or her political opponents will call that person the worst president ever. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:29, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Another possibility (e.g. the "great president" Google bomb which redirects to the Bush biography) <i>was</i> in the article until just before it was recommended for deletion. Also, there is nothing to prevent further possibilities from being discussed, including discussions of any and all other presidents who have been, and still are considered the worst, if that is seen as the article's offense. As a matter of fact, it sounds to me like a very interesting area to investigate, though ultimately a futile one for a Wikipedia article if such thoughts are to be censored here. I came onto this article as a little, obviously POV stub, but thought it had informational value and hoped to shape it into a NPOV discussion of the phrase and its history. If a discussion of who professional historians consider to be the worst president is taboo, how about the best? <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 06:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm still one of those confused newbies at Wikipedia referred to above, so I'm trying to wrap my mind around the intricacies of the NPOV policy. Apparently an article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents_9992.html" title="Historical rankings of United States Presidents">Historical rankings of United States Presidents</a> is neutral, but an article on which presidents are ranked worst is an "attack article" and inherently POV. I'd be tempted to look at this historical ranking article in depth to see how the rankings are achieved with there being no best and no worst... But it dawns on me that I came to Wikipedia to avoid exactly this sort of nonsense in political forums. Guess I'll stick to film, cartoons and music articles. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 16:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article's stated intent to delve into various Presidents is ridiculous, because ALL Presidents have been, at some point, thought to be the "worst President ever" in <i>someone's</i> opinion. Even JFK was widely hated by a considerable segment of the population.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your implication seems to be that since all presidents have been disliked by <i>someone,</i> we must ignore the considered and educated opinions of non-partisan professional historians. Apparently objectivity and neutrality have long since been abandoned in the decision to delete this article. But allow me to point out that the article does <b>not</b> present just <i>someone's</i> opinion, but the opinion of professional historians, supported by articles eloquently explaining the reasons for their opinion. The article is open to present further opinions of professional historians on <i>other</i> presidents who have been legitimately considered the worst. <i>NOT</i> presidents considered worst only by partisans on the other political side. For the record, here is the quote from the article this morning (anyone is free to modify, improve, and add to it as they see fit): <i>This article will go on to discuss the history of the term "worst president ever," which Presidents <b>professional historians (not bickering partisans)</b> have generally considered the worst, and their reasons for doing so.</i>-- <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 17:59, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
