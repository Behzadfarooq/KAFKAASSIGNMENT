<li><b>Delete</b>. Possible autobiography. Orphan. Are we going to have aricles on every person sitting on any government council for every settlement in the world?

<li>Come on, do you honestly think that Wikipedia is going to have council memebrs for the tiniest remotest settlements in the world? Or that that's even an aim? Who'd update them daily? Where would people even get the information to do that? Are they any more notable than the guy who owns the local laundomat? We're talking hundreds of thousands of people who hold some sort of official position some sort of minor government body, not to mention school boards. We still don't even have articles for every member of the House of Representatives. Of course, you want to keep the principal of every high school as well. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That the House info is incomplete is entirely irrelevant. Because people are working on some pages of Wikipedia doesn't necessarily mean they're diverting their efforts from other pages. Everyone works on what they're interested in, and only what they're interested in. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> 10:46, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I only mentioned the House to give an idea of what a pipe dream including every elected official in the world is. By the time we have the House complete there will probably be a new House (although with the incumbent re-election rates it won't be terribly "new"). I admit this guy <i>may</i> be notable enough for an article (I haven't competely changed my mind) but this idea of including any person who won an election (or lost, some people want to have articles for losing candidates as well) anywhere at any time is silly. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, we aren't. The local councillors whom I vote for do a good job, but what they do is only relevant to a few thousand people, if that. I'd vote against encyclopaedia articles on them if their jobs were all that could be said about them. Unfortunately for those who also serve by keeping their eyes on vandalism and litter, politicians who are involved in scandals that reach national news outlets <i>do</i> rate the encyclopaedia articles, if only barely. TINJ. There's a lot of padding in this article, too. <b>Weak Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:44, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. How is he not notable? He is the only Tory councilor for a large constituency in Wales, and was the centre of at least a moderatly well known scandal. We have articles on many Canadian politicians holding similar positions. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 04:12, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. His age alone is almost worthy of notability. Could use a bit more expansion with regards to the scandal if in fact it was as major a news event as Samaritan says. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:56, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If there was a controversy surrounding his previous candidacy, people may come to Wikipedia for NPOV information on him.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I thought this might get listed by the author at some point (look at the similarities in all the IP addresses used, including the one at the top of this page) but I haven't been keeping an eye on it. The author, who I initially thought was John Paul Jenkins himself but claims to be someone close to him seems to object to the idea that creating a Wikipedia article doesn't give you the right to keep unwanted facts out of it, in this case the only thing that makes this man notable: his (alleged) homophobic comments. I recommend a look at the article history and the talk page where I have tried to engage in discussion with the rather reticent author of the article. I have also made efforts to NPOV it and I intend to do some digging and write a bit more on what Jenkins is alleged to have said and the controversy that ensued. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 20:46, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this looks likely to be hugely more encyclopedia-worthy than, say, anything whatever in List of vehicles in Star Wars. But I still don't see anything noteworthy about this man. Welsh tories are indeed rare, but what has he done about it? He's made homophobic comments in an internet chat room, which is routine behavior for young right-wing twits, and then claimed that they were taken out of context, which is ditto. His campaign slogan was as vacuous as they come: is anyone going to respond, "No, <i>lying down</i> with Llanelli!"? He strikes me merely as a young right-wing nonentity.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is understandable for a person (or his/her associates) to want to be <i>present</i> on the internet, meaning that a search for that person can unambiguously lead to information about that person. The vast majority of people are not <i>present</i> and of those that are the vast majority suffer from a lack of disambiguation; Michael Thorne is a case in point (take a brief look at the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michael+thorne&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=michael+thorne&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">googling of this person</a>) However, this really isn't the place for such indexing and disambiguation. What is a good place? The person wanting to be present should a) have a personal website or webpage (not an encyclopedia article) and b) be included in those online lists that reflect his/her desire to be seen. For instance, should there be a list of principals @ dmoz.org (see for instance <a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Architecture/Famous_Names/" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Architecture/Famous_Names/" rel="nofollow">architects</a> which like most such lists is largely content-free). The <i>best</i> way to handle this, or so I've come to believe, is to have an organizational ownership for such lists; for instance, <a href="http://www.ncte.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.ncte.org/" rel="nofollow">the National Council for Teachers of English</a> or <a href="http://www2.ncaa.org/" class="external text" title="http://www2.ncaa.org/" rel="nofollow">the National Collegiate Athletics Association</a>. What's the boundary beyond which someone is "famous" enough to be listed here, in Wikipedia? This type of voting system is a major method of determining just who is "famous" enough and who is not; by consensus it seems that Mr. Thorne is not ... but not all the votes are in perhaps. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> {2005-01-30 USA 14:15 <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Standard_Time_966c.html" title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</a>}

<dd>If I may address this, I think fvw is correct when he says there's an agreement that we don't need articles on <i>each</i> university building. That's not the same as saying there should be no individual articles on <i>any</i> university building. King's College Chapel, a very famous building in its own right, could get an article if the information couldn't be dealt with satisfactorally in the King's College article. There are articles for important buildings on some important colleges, but that doesn't mean everyone's encouraged to write an article on their dorm.

<li>Also, I should point out that Leckhampton is more than a hall of residence or an anonymous University building. Leckhampton is a substantial campus sprawling over many acres and including architecturally important buildings, notable sculpture and one of the UK's important gardens (much visited by connoisseurs).</li>
<li>It is controversial to what extent Leckhampton has an identity different from Corpus Christi proper and, as one similar and nearby site has already been carved off into its own college (Clare Hall), knowledge of this campus is important for those interested in Cambridge's future development.</li>
<li>The site is also important in its own right to those interested in the development and history of the Fitzwilliam Museum, parapsychology and the social history of postgraduate education. It would be convenient for article writers on these subjects to be able to link to Leckhampton directly and cleanly, rather than refer to a section buried in the main Corpus page.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I concur with the previously expressed view regarding the importance of Leckhampton as a signpost in the evolution of postgraduate education within Cambridge University. This fact alone differentiates the site from the main Corpus Christi College buildings, with the site comprising what is a separate community. It is this closely knit community that permits Leckhampton to serve the same purpose for Postgraduate students that the main College site does for the Undergraduate community. As such, I believe that Leckhampton is worthy of a separate article, being an unique development in the history of the University as a whole. --BrianColeman

<li>No, that's not quite what I'm saying (although, I'll admit my statement above is a bit misleading in that regard). What I'm saying is that there's no evidence (or at least wasn't any when I made my original vote) that the guy was notable. Certainly the paper he works for is notable, but I don't believe in notability by association. Surely there are non-notable people on staff at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, just like there are at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, etc. All of these are notable news organizations, but that doesn't make everybody who works for them notable. What I was really saying is that it's not up to me, as a reviewer, to do the research to prove that the subject is notable.

<li>I wrote this (admittedly somewhat daft) brief article because I wanted a tiny recognition for Giles Coren as both a writer of harsh wit and sheer oddity. For the most part, writers for The Times tend to be very conservative (William Rees-Mogg) or very liberal (Libby Purves). Mr. Coren stands out for his sheer 'irrelevance' and nihilistically dark humour. It would be a tad disappointing to delete this entry. I don't follow the minimalist arguments,- surely it's best to have as much knowledge as possible? Then again, I don't pay for Wikipedia's bandwidth etc. I suppose the subject is not particularly important compared with major characters in past and present society.

<dd>I don't know if we keep "pretty much every article about schools"--granted, in recent months high schools have had a reduced chance of being deleted, but I don't remember seeing a similar trend with younger schools.

<li>Yes, we do keep pretty much every article about universities and high schools. The battle of high schools has been fought and largely won by the school inclusionists, although those who think a high school needs some claim to notability haven't completely given up. We are now fighting through Middle Schools, and the school inclusionists are still mostly winning, although not as often as with high schools. I knew it was only a matter of time before we would start having to argue about nursery schools.

If we have an article on exogenous <i>factor</i>, then we will need to have articles on exogenous hormone and exogenous Cushing's syndrome and exogenous virus. <b>Exogenous</b> is just an adjective that's used commonly in biology for a lot of things—and most of those things are not factors. Also, it's confusing to have the page named <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous_factor.html" title="Exogenous factor">Exogenous factor</a> since it sounds like it's a specifically-named biologic entity like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrinsic_factor.html" title="Intrinsic factor">Intrinsic factor</a>.

We already have an article for <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous.html" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a>, which mentions some of the economics and biology uses. This is bad enough, since it is just a dicdef. Tacking on 'factor' and creating another article just compounds the issue. Both this and <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous.html" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> should be deleted as dicdef's --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:06, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exogenous.html" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> seem more appropriate. It can be broken out to a separate article when it's grown. (I note that it's an orphan so there is no complication about inbound links.) BM's argument that it's a mere dicdef is compelling, however.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Article does not establish notability outside of current events." I find the above argument to be implying that "if the guy is dead, he's notable (outside of current events since he'll be dead as the first guy executed in NE in 45 years) but not alive". I agree with the logic (this is an encyclopedia and not Wikinews) but find the end result (wait until he's dead before writing about it) perverse. --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJuntung_66a1.html" title="User:Juntung">JuntungWu</a> 16:23, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say that. I don't think he would be notable once he's dead, either.

<li>It seems to me if they guy's notable it's only for being the first person executed by a New England state in 45 years. Well, so far he hasn't been. Think of him as an American Idol contest who might win. Not notable until he does. Right now he's scheduled to be notable next week; does that make him notable already? I'm tempted to think not. If waiting until he's dead to write about him is perverse, well, I've been called worse things (hell, I spent $15 to enter a death pool for 2005). Anyway, even if he is the first person executed in these parts in 45 years, I'm not sure that makes him any more than a footnote on the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> page (or related page).

<li>like it or not but the stern show has over 20 million listeners a day and as stupid as these guys may seem to you they really have quite a fanbase and following. they arent just people who come on the show once a year but they are central to many of the shows bits and have been parts of some of the most innovative radio of the last 20 years. as far as the wack pack not being notable just because they only appear on the howard stern (they actually alos travel the country and make paid personal appearances) you cant just dismiss someones reason for notoriety just because you're personally not a fan of it. thats like saying that <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brady_122c.html" title="Tom Brady">Tom Brady</a> isnt relevant because he only plays football. <a href="../../../x/p/e/User%7EXpendersx_3edd.html" title="User:Xpendersx">Xpendersx</a></li>

<p>This article has no purpose now, because I have moved over what information on here, that was not on the larger and more important <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_2041.html" title="List of Star Wars races">List of Star Wars races</a> already. For example, since P'w'eck is a race, even as minor as it may be, it is still a race. However originally because of its minority factor it was not featured on the "List", but rather on "Minor races". But then some races ended up duplicating on both. Both had <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookiee.html" title="Wookiee">Wookiees</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawa.html" title="Jawa">Jawas</a>, etc. But the List had more and yet some sections had nothing for races. For those that I could add something I did, and I moved over Chazrach, Gorax, Massassi, P'w'eck, Shistavanen, and Teek, all of which were not in the "List". When I could no longer find new information to move over, my job was done, and now I request that the second article, the minor one, be <b>delete</b>d as a means of saving space. <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 08:41, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wouldn't standard form be for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_2041.html" title="List of Star Wars races">List of Star Wars races</a> to be a point-form list, and breakout articles describe each major race, with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_races_in_Star_Wars_60b2.html" title="Minor races in Star Wars">Minor races in Star Wars</a> for brief descriptions of minor races?

<dd>So you're all saying it only needs to be redirected, rather than all put in one area. I was seeing some of the more well-known races to have their own articles like <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookiee.html" title="Wookiee">Wookiees</a> and on that List it had one sentence. Check the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_2041.html" title="List of Star Wars races">List</a> to see what I mean. If we list all of the races on the big list and provide links to the races with their own articles, then wouldn't that work? Then the List could be for the minor ones. <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 20:00, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If someone thinks that this should be revamped rather than deleted, then what do you consider minor and major, and then would this second separation be more sufficient? I can, if given a line between true major and minor races, shift races back, and delete those in Minor that are Major. Then maybe this article doesn't have to be deleted. <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 21:04, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Updated vote: Keep or redirect. Either one is ok as long as he gets mentioned here in some form.

As for the hockey player by the same name (Google returns 22 hits for "Ronnie Martin" NHL, compared to over 1700 for "Ronnie Martin" "Joy Electric"), he only had 13 goals and 16 assists in 94 games in the NHL (his penalty minutes weren't high either) and played most of his career in the minor leagues, so he doesn't need to be mentioned in a disambiguation page or anything like that. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:22, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this were a list of notable people who were unusually tall (where I'm handwaving "unusually"), i.e. <i>as tall as or taller than</i> some boundary height that marks them as exceptional, it might be more worthwhile. But an article for only those people who were exactly 76 inches tall ... No. <b>Merge</b> to such a list, or <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:13, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is actually just one article in a series of articles, guys. I just happened to start with 6'4". <b>Lighten Up</b>. Getalis 1:48 PM, January 29, 2005.
<ul>
<li>It's actually User:12.215.72.34 who was the creator of the article. If you speak for xem, then it should be apparent to you both that this is a poor idea that a <i>lot</i> of people disagree with. As both I and <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">User:Sjorford</a> have suggested, a far better approach is to pick an arbitrary height, above which people are "exceptionally tall", and then have a <i>single</i> List of people over 2m tall (say) article. No-one reading an encyclopaedia is going to think of pulling up a 6'4" article, let alone the even more absurdly named 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m); and having to navigate from article to article to see who is taller than who renders what would probably be the most common use of a list such as this a lot harder than it should be. If we are going to have this at all, have <i>one</i> article, with everyone in height order. This is why my vote was Merge. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:04, 2005 Jan 30 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have edited the definition to remove any personal views. The word is indeed a neologism, and was coined out of a political discussion group meeting recently that I had attended.

<li>This completely misses the point of an encyclopedia; in order to even find it, they would have to already <i>know</i> the term and therefore be looking for further information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a controversial song so I tried to address the controversy. If it wanders a bit into original research then parts can be rewritten.

<li>I say <b>delete</b>. Lester Bangs wrote about it in one of his essays, the most common version was recorded live, there was a second version recorded with Ronnie Biggs and some more words, it emerged at a time when the band were severely pissed-off, and the title is a pun. That's about all you can write about 'Belsen was a Gas' in an encyclopaedic context without rambling. As an interesting paragraph in the entry for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Rock_and_Roll_Swindle_8321.html" title="The Great Rock and Roll Swindle">The Great Rock and Roll Swindle</a> a mention would be fine, but this isn't it. Although I was only a kid at the time, the analysis seems badly flawed, unaware of the contemporary context, both social and personal; people were a lot less touchy about swastikas and Nazis at the time, Johnny Rotten enjoyed shocking people, and the song's notoriety came more from the trivial pun in the title than any accusations of anti-semitism, which itself was much less of a sin in the late 1970s. The lyrics seem to be a spew of disgust and self-hate, and the article's assertations are couched in the kind of 'some people argue that' weakness which disgusts me. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 22:34, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it was less controversial at the time then that's probably worth mentioning in the article. However the song, having been recorded, still exists today, and remains controversial in present context (with the Sex Pistols still very popular today). I was a little uncomfortable with the "original researchishness" of it, but I attempted to address the song based on what I know of it and whatever information I could get off google as I waded through hundreds of pages, mostly of lyrics and tabs. If the song is seen mocking the holocaust, or as advocating killing Jews, I can't see it being not a big deal, even in the '70s. Anyway, I took out a couple lines and added a bit on the pun, which I thought too obvious to mention before, but it may not be. I wouldn't have written an article on the song myself, but the stub that was written really didn't say anything so I tried to improve it. As you seem to know a bit about it, can you confirm the article's assertion (by the original author), that the song's only studio recording is lost? It seems that the Ronnie Biggs version would have to be a studio recording, as I can't see a guy who was on the lam performing at a live concert. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:01, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. I don't think this is what was intended to be covered under "original research". Of course, documentation of the controversy would be very helpful. Nevertheless, the article overall was very informative, and the balance was factual.
