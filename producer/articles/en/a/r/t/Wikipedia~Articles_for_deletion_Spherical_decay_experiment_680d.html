<p>There is a problem with the ability of inexperienced persons interested in science introducing ostensible paradox after paradox (the oldest probably being the <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin_paradox.html" title="Twin paradox">twin paradox</a> in relativity). The result is that these fanciful "puzzles" sit and await criticism by better-versed physicists, as well as spreading like the so-called <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legends</a>. This "puzzle" has no merit, as there is no way to say when the atom decays, so there is no way to say when the inner hemisphere has been passed up. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 5 July 2005 05:14 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wouldn't it be better to edit the article to demonstrate/explain how the paradox is resolved/not a paradox? GBM 5 July 2005 11:57 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Is this notable or not? If it is a well-known <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_experiment.html" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a>, then it should be kept with notes in the body of the article. If this was made up for Wikipedia, then it should be deleted. Google was inconclusive on this point, and may not be a good source for notable QM theory. Someone with credentials or at least a decent source citation want to comment? -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 5 July 2005 13:15 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a famous paradox first formulated by the mainstream physics community in the 1920's and 1930's and is a standard part of undergraduate quantum mechanics education. The entire business of experimental high-energy physics is built upon this effect. This is a nuisance delete aka VfD vandalism. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 5 July 2005 15:41 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FWIW, I'll take the next 24/48 hours to expand the article to bring it closer to a standard presentation. I'll try to find references; I'm not sure, but I think its <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Born_83cc.html" title="Max Born">Max Born</a> who came up with this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 5 July 2005 17:18 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The text appears reasonable. It would be useful if it actually cited a source for the <a href="../../../g/e/d/Gedanken_experiment.html" title="Gedanken experiment">gedanken experiment</a>. But I don't see anything inherently irregular about it. It helps capture some of the inherent wierdness of quantum mechanics. <b>Keep</b> — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 5 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: This is a known thought experiment, but the article is unclear. It should avoid <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction_collapse.html" title="Wavefunction collapse">wavefunction collapse</a> since that is a philosophical construct, not an observable. (The state of a system <i>between</i> measurements is not part of quantum mechanics or any other science.) <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 6 July 2005 00:30 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Is this original research?</s> There is no mention of a paradox of this name in any of the quantum mechanics books in our library, nor do any of my colleagues seem to recognize this name. Furthermore, as currently written, the nature of the paradox is obscure, as pointed out by the nominator. Before calling for a <i>delete</i> I would ask the editor to <b>cleanup</b> at least in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Give <b>references</b> to prove that the effect has been described and named before.</li>
<li>Early in the article state <b>exactly</b> what the paradox is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe the editor would actualy like to add an example to the article on <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavefunction_collapse.html" title="Wavefunction collapse">wavefunction collapse</a> instead? <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBambaiah_bac4.html" title="User:Bambaiah">Bambaiah</a> July 8, 2005 15:28 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bambaiah, a better name can be found for this article, I am not yet sure of what that better name would be. The first part, about the collapse of a spherical wave function to a single trace in a cloud chamber, is due, I believe to either Wilson, the inventor of the cloud chamber, or one of his contemporaries, maybe Bohr, presumably in the 1920's. The "paradox" is obvious: how does the spherical wave function of a decaying nucleus turn into a straight ray in a cloud chamber? I will try to change the article to state this in an even more straightforward manner. I'm trying to find a reference; as that will then provide the correct name under which this is more commonly known under. You and I have had arguments in the past, and I'm sorry if I insulted your intelligence, but lashing back out with language such as "Is this original research?" is inappropriate and out-of-line. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 06:32, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, the magic of google. A breif search shows that it is known as the <b>Mott problem</b>, formulated by Mott in 1929. I added refs to the article. The only things I found on-line that mention it are to far off-topic to cite:

<dd>Since the language bothered you, I struck it out, and I hereby take it back. The revisions are nice. Maybe one could think of a name change? I mean this purely as a practical matter: since the effect that is being talked about is not usually known by the name that it has been given, people are unlikely to look for it in a pedia by this phrase. An appropriate name change would make it more useful. And my vote is now a <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A while now since I went to QM lectures. On a read through and look at the references it says the right kind of things and is interesting. Its most ardent supporter was also the guy who wrote it, and as yet I could not be certain it is not a spoof as suggested by others. But it is important that this subject be addressed by wiki. It is correctly stating that this is an important class of issue for people to think about, even if they do not know it. Don't know what other related articles exist. If there are some then it might be merged, otherwise it is a must keep.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 02:52, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe it has been revised, but doesn't it say the half life of the particle being studied is short enough that it must have decayed during the time of the experiment. It is sufficient to know it has almost certainly decayed without knowing exactly when.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">user:sandpiper</a>
<dl>
<dd>The most ardent supporter has a PhD in theoretical particle physics and feels that he knows what he's talking about, and has spent some time trying to fight off crank physics edits on wikipedia. This article was created in order to document one of the half-dozen classic pozers on quantum measurement. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 06:32, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
