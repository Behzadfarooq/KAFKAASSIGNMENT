<li><b>Delete</b>Unsourced original research going into painfully too much detail. It is appropriate to have one article for a game show, and inappropriate to write up what color clothing everyone wore in every episode. The Price is Right has been on 50 years, and only has one article for each reincarnation of the show (different format, different host).<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Keep</b>. This article includes records from the series - records which would make both the main Deal or No Deal UK article <i>and</i> the UK game show records article, far too full. This is also a very useful resource that a lot of people, myself included, use and update regularly. <b><a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECipher2006_9341.html" title="User:Cipher2006">Cipher</a></b> <sup>(<i><a href="../../../c/i/p/User_talk%7ECipher2006_91d0.html" title="User talk:Cipher2006">Yell</a></i>)</sup> 18:42, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I totally agree, Cipher. It's not as trivial as "what colour shirt" they're wearing. This show has a cult following and this information is drawn on and mentioned throughout the show's run. Things like "what box number contains which value" and "since when the 1p has been won" are subjects that have consistantly been brought up during the show. The fact that so many people have contributed to this article is surely evidence of how useful this page is. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>It MUST be Kept</b> The Deal or No Deal games are so wrapped around each others games and the contestants that it only seems right to have a log of all the games on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Series 2 article has existed since March with no objections until now, is the only list of its kind on the internet, many of which finding it a useful source.

<li><b>comment</b> Wikipedia IS a TV guide - witness all the pages for stuff like Doctor Who and Star Trek. Deal or No Deal is NOT your average "game-show", and that more than anything else seems the hub of this question - does it deserve the same respect as other TV shows on wikipedia? A small but vocal group of people seem to think it doesn't. Fans of the series are already storing this information to host it elsewhere on dedicated DonD sites. It looks like the fans have lost, but as far as I'm concerned it is wikipedia who are the losers as this IS important information for many, even just casual viewers and not hardcore fans. These are (were) the best presented stats and episode guides on the internet. I'm quite disappointed in this decision. 88.104.207.7 17:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
