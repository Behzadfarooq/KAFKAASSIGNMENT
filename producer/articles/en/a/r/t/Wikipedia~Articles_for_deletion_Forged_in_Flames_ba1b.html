<li>My understanding is that the core Wikipedia official policies are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>, along with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
<li>You would struggle to write an article on yourself without breaking these policies - it may not be so easy for someone who lives far away to verify your existence from a trusted web site like Amazon? If you made your own article based on your own memories you would be performing original research (from unverifiable sources), and the act of you (or any of your friends/family) writing the article would make it too biased and entirely unneutral point of view? You would struggle to create the article without either using original research or not using original research but having to rely on unverifiable sources. That's why these are the official policies.</li>
<li>I can see it does not meet criteria at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>, but that is not an "official policy", it is only a "guideline" and until several months ago Notability pages were classified as an "essay" that "expresses the opinions and ideas of some Wikipedians".</li>
<li>When an article containing someone's efforts is being stood up for deletion, I do think it is relevant if at least one person talks about whether the article meets criteria laid out in the official policies. - <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 23:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you would support the inclusion of articles on all 2,935,993 books with a higher SalesRank than this one? They're also verifiable by the same method. This kind of problem is the basis for notability requirements, and while they aren't core policy, the existance of SOME kind of notability policy is overwhelmingly supported. I can't imagine any notability critera this book would meet. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Many other fictional books low in the sales rank will be works of original fiction <i>not</i> related to television series that drew millions of viewers across the world. I agree the novel is still not very notable, but I think it gets just enough notability (by the skin of its teeth) from being the <i>only</i> unofficial published novel relating to hugely notable <i>Buffy/Angel</i>. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 03:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b> A listing on Amazon is only valid as a source for the existence of a book.

<dd>"Forged in Flames" is the only original unofficial Buffy novel found from "Amazon" (although it can also be found on from various other online retailers), "Google" and so on..

<dd>That's not really a noteworthy claim anyway. Anyone could write and self-publish an unofficial Buffy novel. If anything, being unofficial hurts its claim to notability. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Theoretically anyone could, but it appears that only one person has, perhaps this was the one person in the world that has had (a) written a Buffy story long enough to be a novel (b) believes it is worthwhile to go on sale, (c) the money to make it happen.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a page worth keeping to me. Article describes book well. If some people have a problem with the way it is published, maybe more could be made of that in the article, flesh out what it means that 'AuthorHouse' published this, e.g. 'means that it could have been self-published..' Anyway, I'd say <i>Buffy</i> related stuff is notable, especially if there is only one unofficial novel people can get. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazybacon_36f8.html" title="User:Crazybacon">Crazybacon</a> 13:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
