<p>Wikipedia is not a place to advertise multi-level marketing schemes. MLM's are illegal in many countries. <b>Delete</b>.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 19:37, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>:</s> Wikipedia should be a place to <i>document</i> MLM schemes (which certainly has an instructive character). We have articles on all kinds of dubious and criminal organizations and scams, and Wikipedia is often one of the better sources on them. So for me it's really a question of whether this is a <i>notable</i> MLM scheme. <s><i>If</i> in fact 13'000 people fell for it in roughly a week, it's going to be a notable RSN.</s> <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 21:26, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Change my vote to <b>Delete</b>. Fortunately, this particular scam doesn't look like it's ever going to become notable now. I still find it's an interesting variant because it involves ripping off third parties, but that's presumably the very reason it's not going anywhere. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 12:46, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Note to RickK: Yes of course its illegal. But as RI said, whether a scheme is legal or not, wikipedia is in my opinion one of the best places to document it. 13,000 people in one week is not a small number, and the amount of places i am beginning to see referral id's is so alarming that i am sure this MLM will be a big one. Sure, wikipedia aint a place to <i>promote</i> MLM's, but it is a place to document them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 23:54, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your rewrite is certainly an improvement, except that you <b>subtly</b> readded the link to their website with a referral number in it. I've removed that, but your readding it shows a lack of good faith.

<li>That's <b>Calton</b>, as the sig clearly reads. And it takes links for Google to pick up text on a page? Imagine my surprise.

<li>To clear up the controversy about how many members netbux has, please check the homepage of netbux. The other day, it said 10,000 and i updated the page to reflect this. NOW they have 15,000+ members (plz check homepage if you dont believe me) and i am going to update the page again.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is important to keep track of these schemes. As to its notability I recieved no less then 20 propositions in the past week about it so it is apparently notable enough. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a> 18:55, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wanted more info and found it. No reason not to document this. If wikipedia is concerned about commercial promotion, they should remove all pages containing references to corporate entities.

<li>This bears an interesting resemblance to the comment &amp; vote from 68.43.49.65 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.43.49.65_b692.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.43.49.65">contribs</a>) above. needless to say, this address has been used to make this edit only, and the earlier address hasn't been used to make any edits since its vote here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETHE_KING_5755.html" title="User talk:THE KING">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_THE_KING_2fca.html" title="Special:Contributions/THE KING">contribs</a>) (who is apparently desperate to earn some money, and placed the referral link on his User page) seems also to be desperate for this article to be kept. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:19, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have heard from people saying this is legit. It's not commercial promotion if all of the other companies can have their pages.

<li>i am now updating the page, based on the stats on the front page of netbux. They now have 26,000 members - very notable! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 03:29, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in its current form, or merge with <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-level_marketing.html" title="Multi-level marketing">multi-level marketing</a> or something similar. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 08:22, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Anyone can start their own mlm scheme and claim that they have 2500, 25000 or 250000 members on their website; this is still not a reason to mention it here. --<a href="../../../k/t/o/User%7EKtotam_b9c1.html" title="User:Ktotam">Ktotam</a> 14:41, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: THE KING left a nice note on my talk page asking me to reconsider my vote. While the article is better than it was, is it really an <i>encyclopedia</i> article? I fear this will balloon into yet another scheme to co-opt the site for furthering an agenda. IMO, this could be worse than all the Sollogs, GNAA's and pedophiles combined. Sorry King, but no change of vote. - Lucky 6.9 03:38, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>He left me a note as well. But I can't really find the 'substantial rewrite' he claims has occured. As such I don't really see a reason to change my vote. However, SPUI's suggestion of merging to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-level_marketing.html" title="Multi-level marketing">multi-level marketing</a> sounds like an appropriate alternative. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 07:23, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
