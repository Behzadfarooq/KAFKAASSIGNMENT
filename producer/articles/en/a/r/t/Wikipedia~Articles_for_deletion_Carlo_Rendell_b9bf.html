<p>The notion of Middlesex not being a "well known" cricket team is remarkable as it is one of the most well known proffesional sides in the world!. They play there home games at Lords Cricket ground "The Home of Cricket" and have produced many, many england players and captains including the current one. Contemporaries of Carlo Rendell included Angus Fraser, Phil Tuffnell, Andrew Strauss, Mark Ramprakash, John Emburey, Ed Joyce, Owais Shah and Nick Compton. Comments about motivatioonal speaking are true but unverafiable so have been removed.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 164.143.240.33 (<a href="../../../1/6/4/User_talk%7E164.143.240.33.html" title="User talk:164.143.240.33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_164.143.240.33_91bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/164.143.240.33">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Good speaker</b>, Carlo Rendell talks on life after sport for young cricketers and footballers who fail to make the grade. His small but relateive success after failing in his sport is a fine example for others as is reflected by his page. For those of you who have not heard of Middlesex CCC I am quite frankly appalled that you choose to make a comment to delete this man's page. Middlesex is one of the sporting institutions of this country, playing at Lords cricket ground as the above writer mentions. To bring this man's existance into question is a slight not only on him, but on the cricketing and youth coaching community as a whole. Please only comment on an individual when you have the slightest idea what you are going on about.Richardss 14:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Comment" It is fairly evident that many of the people passing judgement on Carlo Rendell’s notability have no understanding of cricket and the community that surrounds it. It is therefore impossible for them to comment on his notability within cricket circles with any authority. Perhaps they should keep there ill informed opinions to themselves or do some more research on cricket in England. I am a Middlesex member and am genuinely sickened that Middlesex County Cricket Club was called into question. I do hope these people look it up to see what a mistake they made. Carlo Rendell played for the club for the best part of three years and was a contracted professional, which I believe in its own write makes him notable! How the opinions of those in question would be swayed if it was a sport they actually had the patience or intellect to understand.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 164.143.240.33 (<a href="../../../1/6/4/User_talk%7E164.143.240.33.html" title="User talk:164.143.240.33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_164.143.240.33_91bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/164.143.240.33">contribs</a>).</small></p>

The consensus that we had in <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECricket_b112.html" title="WP:Cricket">WP:Cricket</a> is that any first class cricketer is notable enough to have an article.

<p>What a relief it is to have someone comment on this article that actually has an understanding of the game and can give acurate critisism. I refer back to previous comments and stongly urge "wikipedians" to only comment on things that they understand as some of the statments made previously are illinformed at best and could be percieved as down right ignorant by others. It seems utterly absurd for individuals from parts of the world that dont play cricket to make judgements on the game and its players. What do others feel? refering not so much in relation to this article but more generally in specific feilds of knowledge?</p>

<p>Your comments have left me somewhat chagrin. I understand your piont of veiw though, but still find the system a little frustrating. There are individuals associated with wikipedia who know alot about said subject(cricket)and they are very well placed to comment it may not be my place to ask but was offering a suggestion. Im sorry if i was not civil Brian and it was not a personal attack. I am worried that certain parts of wikipedia will be left in a detritus as a results.
