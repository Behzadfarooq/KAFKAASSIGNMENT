<li>On November 4, Chowbak tagged image:Rebecca Cummings.jpg for deletion and now 4 days later after personally attacking mine and Rebecca's integrity he lists the article for deletion. You've got to question why the article wasn't listed for deletion from the beginning?
<ul>
<li>FWIW, I wasn't trying to personally attack anyone's integrity; I just felt you had a different attitude about information distribution. That's perfectly honorable, but it does put you in conflict IMO with Wikipedia's founding principles. That's all I was trying to say. I hadn't looked closely at the article before you wrote that; upon closer examination I realized I had no idea why there was an article about her in the first place. Please assume good faith, and don't take any of this personally. I always may be wrong, but I do act for what I honestly believe is best for Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 19:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as the original admin consulted on the image pertaining to this article, I think we need to exclude any debate on the image here... that debate belongs on IFD not AFD. As for the self promotion angle, I feel this article has a very good balance between fact and promotional content. The article as written initially I feel proved that she passes the WP:PORNBIO guidelines. My initial thought was that this was self promotion, having later found out that HeartThrobs was a friend creating the bio and that it did not violated WP:AUTO changed my initial deletion decision. Having seen the article as it stands now, and after review again of the content and the references, I still feel that a strong case regarding her WP:PORNBIO "notability" is put forward. I think this belongs to stay on wikipedia. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a> <span style="font-size:130%; background:yellow; border:1px solid black;">☢</span> 05:03, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed Cummings has a case under the IMO incredibly lax <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Notability (pornographic actors)</a>.

It's not any laxer than WP:BIO, it's just more specific. Point 3 is "unique, noteworthy contributions", and gives examples of beginning a trend or starring in an iconic or blockbuster feature. She has done neither. (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> is iconic. Co-starring with him isn't, thousands have.) Being the first bisexual president of a nameless gay/lesbian/bisexual organization isn't unique unless the organization is notable itself - after all, there seem to only be three orientation possibilities, and somebody has to be first for each. Point 4 is "subject of a noteworthy news piece or controversy" and while the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines_Register_3e34.html" title="Des Moines Register">Des Moines Register</a> is a fine newspaper, the article isn't about her, it's about the fact she, among other relative unknowns, <i>has</i> a Wikipedia article, how surprising. We try hard to avoid creating news like that. Also note that the article is humorous, even satirical, pointing out such facts that her name - allegedly real - is "Cummings", while her promotion agent's name writing her Wikipedia article -- I assume that's <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartThrobs_7211.html" title="User:HeartThrobs">User:HeartThrobs</a>? -- is "Goings". I chuckled out loud reading this line: "It's been said she is the most famous porn star in Iowa but she really is the only porn star in Iowa. The other one died this spring in a car accident in Vegas." Sorry. Having an article about an apparent error in Wikipedia shouldn't stop us from correcting the error. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:51, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree. Obviously I think this should be deleted, but the fact that she has an assumed name shouldn't be a factor in consideration. <i>Especially</i> for somebody in porn. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 23:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Obviously I'm biased since I nominated it, but I have to say I'm struck that people are voting "Keep" without even addressing <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a>'s points. Since this isn't a vote but rather a discussion, I hope that the admin recognizes that and deletes regardless of the actual headcount (unless, of course, a really killer argument has been made on the "Keep" side. But I haven't seen that yet). —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 22:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - well, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> is certainly our resident expert, and his points were well made. For many of us though, Cummings seems to be in a "grey area", notability wise. While she's certainly hasn't achieved the notoriety of Ron Jeremy or Jenna Jameson (sp?), neither is she an anonymous model with a personal ad in the back of a men's magazine. I know that my next comment isn't really considered a valid argument, but if we can have articles about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> characters or cartoon strips that only appear on Blogs, then a semi-notable porn star doesn't seem like such a big stretch. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 22:40, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think "an anonymous model with a personal ad in the back of a men's magazine" basically sums it up. She's a stripper from some Iowa town selling videos of herself on her web page. You'll get no argument from me that there are lots of superfluous articles on Wikipedia, but really, that way lies madness. We could never delete <i>anything</i> if "look at all these other articles that need to be deleted" was an acceptable argument... unless every single non-notable article was put up on AFD at the same time. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 23:06, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now there's an amusing idea; nom it all at once, then sit back and watch the fireworks. Like I said, not an acceptable argument in itself, it just seems that in borderline cases it's better to err on the side of Inclusion. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 23:15, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I was not sure what to do with this one. I did not like the suggestion to basically ignore the keep votes. But your comment may sum it up. This is a borderline call so no consensus or keep is probably they right outcome. So I'll say <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 04:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
