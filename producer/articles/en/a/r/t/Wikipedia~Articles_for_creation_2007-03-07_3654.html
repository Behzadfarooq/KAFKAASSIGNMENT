<p>Jackass 3: The Next Generation takes place in Union City, PA and is a Steve-O Inc. film. It is about a bunch of morons who do stupid things for people's entertainment. They decided to do this film when the original Jackass crew said that after <i>Jackass: Number 2</i> Jackass was over with. This disappointed them because they wanted to see the trilogy be completed. Filming for this movie was supposed to begin in October 2006. Due to "money issues" the movie was pushed back to March 2007. They don't expect the budget for this movie to be very big at all. For this film so far, over $100 was spent and they only expect to spend about $50 more. Everyone from the cast contributes ideas to this film. Steve-O Mangol claims to be the director of this film, but this film seems to be directing itself.</p>
<p>In February 2007, a short segment of Jackass 3 was released to the public just featuring Talylor Hanlin and Steve-O. It featured the stunts "Extreme Mud Biking," "Ass Rocket," "Balls vs. Balls," and "Stair Sledding." At the end it asked the auidence if they would like to see a full length movie in the summer of 2007. They responded with a "Yes." The full length movie will be on Myspace and YouTube sometime in the summer of 2007.</p>

In the original spoken Latin palette, the suffix -ang traditionally ends in a soft "g" sound much like as in "sigh" and "laugh." Today's pronunciations tend to attempt to vary the sound of this suffix by over pronouncing the "g" at the end. In words such as "sing" the sound is cut short on the "g" furthermore, the -an before the "G" takes much of the pronouncement on itself. Therefore, the word "sing" ,while likely to be pronounced with a hard consonant "g" at its end, instead uses, in the traditional way of Latin and anglo-saxon speech, a softer, less pronounced "g" sound to cut the palate's resonance short, hence words like "rain" and "rang" sound almost alike except for a more annunciated "a" in the ending "-ang" This takes the longest sound in the word and cuts the "g" at the end short. As in "gang." Rather, most modern language speakers would pronounce the "g" hard at the end. This change is taken from the anglo-saxon tradition of ending a word with a longer, almost nasal pronunciation indicating that the speaker has ended his word and is going to a new one. Modern English has tried to differentiate between words like "bang" and "bane" by elongating the "g" and making it harder than traditional. In reality the ending "-ang" could be considered an entire accent due to the long sounding "a" and the following "n" which takes most of the hard "g" sound away.</p>

<p>On July 13, 1882 the provincial government began the construction of new branches of the railroad that communicated to the new provincial capital with the West Railroad and the South Railroad. The La Plata line- Empalme Pereyra (soon Villa Elisa) was inaugurated the first of January of 1889.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, soon to be inaugurated the railway stations <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolfo_Alsina_17c4.html" title="Adolfo Alsina">Adolfo Alsina</a> in that layout, the proprietors of the small farms of the zone decided to conform a society, to divide the lots and to create a town. The station is released on February 15th and 24th of that month the inauguration of Villa announces Maximum Peace, names of the then governor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the undertaking was not awaited and many years were required to obtain a stable population nucleus. Initially, the constructions were in their majority aim houses week of inhabitants of the near city of <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata_2dab.html" title="La Plata">La Plata</a>.</p>

<p>The magician and charmer the Children’s Republic rose half a century ago in an estate of 53 hectares located in Manuel B. Gonnet, on the dirt road Belgrano, party of <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata_2dab.html" title="La Plata">La Plata</a>, in earth that belonged to the old golf course of the “Swift Golf Club” destined to the seated English refrigerators in the region.</p>
<p>The construction, that began in 1949 during the government of the Cnel. Merchant Domingo, was made by financed company CAPRESA and with provincial resources through the Investing Institute of the Province of Buenos Aires with the intention of being able to construct to the complex in a time record. In the construction 1600 workers worked and lodged in the cabins within the same estate. After two years of continuous work, finally it was inaugurated on November 26, 1951 by the then president of the Nation Tte. Gral. Juan Domingo Perón. To start off that moment, numerous contingents of students of the city, with participation of schools of Buenos Aires province, choose the authorities of the Infantile Government and debate in the enclosures different interest subjects from an infantile approach.</p>
<p>Considered the greater undertaking infantile of Latin America and first thematic park of America, the Children’s Republic was founded with a double intention: the one of creative relaxation in a world of dreams and stories related to the childhood and the one to learn to exert the rights and obligations that in all democratic country have the citizens. By those years, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> visited the place and surprised by as much beauty he was inspired to construct the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> later.</p>
<p>The landscape of the Children’s Republic presents/displays waved zones, green spaces, aged woods with variety of species and a central depression that by natural drainage of waters conforms a lake to islands.</p>
<p>The estate is sectored in three areas: urban, rural and sport. The urban area has footpaths, streets and singulars buildings that constitute a central axis denominated Civic Center where the constructions are concentrated that lodge the institutions of the Government of the Republic. Being the children the addressees of this wonderful undertaking, the original objective went to construct the buildings to its scale so that they can experience the operation of the republican institutions, forming in the democratic principles.</p>
<p>Eastern castles, palaces, restaurants, public buildings and a Chapel in where usually it celebrates mass, respect that law just like their furniture. The agreed reduction to children of 10 years has not cleared enchantment or the possibility of enjoyment of the stroll on the part of the adults but that, on the contrary, force them to antedate itself to its childhood.</p>
<p>The equipment designer and executor of works was headed by the architects Lima, River basin and Rooster that took like source from inspiration stories from Andersen, the Grimm brothers and the legend narrated by Tennyson and Mallory to plan and to direct their construction with influences of medieval styles, European and Islamic.</p>
<p>The building of the Infantile Municipal Bank located in front of the main seat, Seat San Martín, is an retort of the Ducal Palace of Venice; near another construction, the Palace of Culture rises there, inspired by the Taj Mahal de Agra, of India, in where the Museum has its seat the International of the Doll.</p>
<p>In the Chapel, under the invocation of the Virgin of Lourdes, with great plans of lateral galleries and towers with bell towers; the House of Government with windows of gothic style crowned by a ceiling of imaginative forms elevated to way of towers and viewpoints, close the Seat San Martín. Around the seat of Americas, located in the end opposite and communicated by a pedestrian street, flanked by commerce, is the Legislature inspired by the English Parliament, that lodges the enclosures of the Houses of Representatives and Senators of the Infantile Government of the Republic, conformed by students of the local schools.</p>
<p>A great space of games faces the building of the Palace of Justice its room of hearing, offices and in the subsoil a small jail. In addition it counts on a wireless study "Radius Republic", the first infantile radio of the country, with exit to the gallery that separates the seat with the surrounding space.</p>
<p>Outside this sector constructions like the Stage are located, the House of the Boy, the buildings of Navy, Army and Aeronautics.</p>
<p>The Children’s Republic, that as of 1979 happens of the provincial scope to the policeman, is unique in the world constituting an infantile place where the citizen formation, recreational, educative, cultural, social, scientific and sport the activities coexists.</p>

<p><b>Executive Summary</b></p>
<p>Since Jurassic era, IBM is serving people with its astonishing products such as PC’s, Servers, Workstations and Softwares etc. founded in 1911 by George Fairchild renamed to International Business Machine from Computing Tabulating Recording Company in 1924. IBM has gone beyond the year 2000 and is still progressing ahead of the cutthroat competition. Surviving in the industry for almost 92 years is not a quip where all others have failed IBM is still going ahead just to make a century in the field of IT and Computing. One will definitely question, what holds IBM? Because of which it has gone so far? Well this is what one can call a planned strategy. IBM has undergone serious strategic planning from day one of 1911 era when Charles R. Flint declared Computing Tabulating Recording Company merger, IBM never waited for the opportunity to knock at its door but in-turn IBM themselves knocked at the door of opportunity by accepting the merger. IBM in 1914 started targeting the institutional buyers such as Life Insurance Companies, Chemical Companies and Railways just insuring revenue of $4M and 700 stockholders backing up IBM from all the four sides, this we can call as the efficient use of their second strategy. Imagine this just in a span of three years IBM made wonders by just selling accounting machines which calculated arithmetic operations. From 1915 to 1917, IBM was in news only but in 1917, IBM was never idle so they decided to expand, they went into the Canadian market acquiring revenue of $8 M with Net Earnings of $1 M. IBM was under manufacturing of electronic machines and gadgets since the era of 1970’s But in the era of 1980’s IBM brought a revolution in the field of computing; IBM introduced their first personal computers which began to grow in homes, offices and schools. Moreover IBM gave the power of 16-KB (kilobytes) memory and DOS (an operating system invented by Microsoft) to a user; this strategy of IBM gave it a competitive edge to go further in the field of computing. IBM received four awards for physics, breakthroughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications this gave a boost to the company and goodwill in the market, which contributed in success of IBM in the field of personal computing.</p>
<p><b>IBM - Background and Assumptions</b></p>
<p>IBM was founded in 1911 by Charles R. Flint and was named as Computing Tabulating Recording Company. IBM when founded had only 1300 employees, now IBM has a backup of 319,876 employees with net earnings of $7.7 B. IBM offers a range of products in the field of IT industry, some of the astonishing examples are IBM e-servers, IBM Think Pad, IBM Desktop PC’s, IBM Workstations, Storage Devices such as Hard Disk Drives and etc. E-commerce solutions, Business Exchange, Business Intelligence, Content Distribution, Financial Management, Technical Support and Security and Privacy.</p>
<p>(Table Information Source: “Products and Services (n.d.)”, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/products/us/index2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ibm.com/products/us/index2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/products/us/index2.html</a> , Accessed Date [3rd April 2003]) Though IBM was the leader in manufacturing electronic gadgets and machines like punch cards and Automated Accounting Machines, IBM wanted to capture the filed of computing also so it entered the markets with state-of-art desktop PC’s and captured the market of computing. IBM in 1980’s era began targeting the home users, small offices and institutions for their desktop PC’s. Nonetheless IBM did captured the market successfully but it still wanted to do something very unique and astonishing so IBM introduced Token-Ring network system by which data was easily accessible and interchange within a network. This unique invention of IBM gave it a boost to capture the industry at meteor speed. Till 1990’s IBM went through a golden era period but after the introduction of client and server architecture IBM faced a revolution of back-to-back; customers backed off from IBM and went for other companies who provided the client/server architecture. IBM created a record of huge loss of $8 Billion in 1993 and then IBM came to conclusions that it should split into two different companies. Suddenly IBM appointed Mr. Louis V. Gerstner as its Chairman and CEO. This man proved to be the savior for IBM; he reduced the overhead costs, introduced the concept of product-line and shrinked the work force thus IBM was powered again to stand as a giant in the field of IT once again. IBM then did not go for splitting as it could have destroyed its unique and competitive advantage. Hence it shows how Gerstner saved IBM with his great strategic plans. (Concept Source: “Decade 1990(n.d.)”, <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html" class="external free" title="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html</a> , [Accessed Date: 3rd April 2003])</p>
<p><b>Assumptions towards the scenario of 1990 at IBM</b></p>
<p>As IBM was the leader in computer products till 1990’s it should have prepared itself for the upcoming technologies like client/server architecture as this strategy would have given at least a break-even point to IBM and not losses worth $8 Billions. Moreover IBM being a leader in IT field and products should have introduced some new concepts of networking which could have given them a boost again to rise like Intranet or Extension to Local Area Network with a reduction in the price of their products. By reducing the prices of their products IBM would have gone under cost-leadership strategy and the uniqueness of IBM products could have been an added advantage for the company. IBM could have been the leader again in the market since IBM was having a strong brand image and goodwill in the market.</p>
<p><b>Assumptions towards the Year 2000 and beyond</b></p>
<p>IBM is a leader in IT products and services providing the user with almost everything such as Technical Support, Business Solutions and Financial Management etc. IBM is going ahead and doing well in products and services but when it comes to technical support IBM still has to go further. Till now IBM is giving a technical support on phone and through a software installed on their PC’s. To gain a competitive edge IBM must include a technical support on their website with online chatting with various experts of Hardware, Software and other IT sectors, so that wherever the user is he/she should be ensured about safety and support from the leaders of IT. Moreover to capture a slow market like India IBM should compromise with cost; they should bring down the cost of their PC’s and other products, this strategy will help IBM to penetrate into the slow market very quickly and will help them to gain competitive edge over other companies. Mission Statement</p>
<p><b>Company’s Mission</b></p>
<p>“At IBM, we strive to lead in the creation, development and manufacture of the industry’s most advanced information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking systems, storage devices and microelectronics. We translate these advanced technologies into value for our customers through our professional solutions and services businesses worldwide”. (Statement Source: “Company Mission (2001)”, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2001/company_mission/cm_index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2001/company_mission/cm_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2001/company_mission/cm_index.html</a>, [Accessed Date 4th April 2003]) A good mission statement should discuss about the following points: - What is our Business? IBM is not into selling desktop PC’s and servers only but it also provides various services to its customers such as Financial Management, E-commerce solutions, Electronic Data Exchange and Business Exchange etc. That’s what gives IBM a unique edge or competitive edge to stay ahead of others.

<p><b>IBM Customers?</b></p>
<p>IBM at the time of 1911 era was targeting only organisations/institutions such as Life insurance companies, Railways and Governmental Organisations etc. After they introduced Desktop PC’s in 1980’s IBM started targeting Home users, Small Businesses and Medium Business users as they wanted to capture the IT market, this shows that IBM never missed an opportunity. From 1990’s era IBM has continuously targeting the aforementioned users. But as of now IBM has got the following segments of the users in its list: - • Home Users • Small Businesses • Institutions such as Schools and Social Work Centers • Medium Business • Multi National and Fortune 500 Companies such as Microsoft, Intel and Modi International etc. (Concept Source: “IBM Medium Business Center (n.d.)”, <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/mediumbusiness" class="external free" title="http://www-1.ibm.com/mediumbusiness" rel="nofollow">http://www-1.ibm.com/mediumbusiness</a> , [Accessed Date: 4th April 2003])</p>
<p><b>IBM's Value to its Customer?</b></p>
<p>Since 1911 IBM is inventing products according to the demand and keeping in mind the future demands of the users. The phase of 1990 was the only phase when IBM faced a back – to-back revolution from its customers. After 1993 under the supervision of Gerstner. Jr. IBM again started focusing on the future demands like Internet and Intranet solutions etc. Till now IBM design their products in such a way that they should give the user the power to use it in the future also. Moreover IBM has clearly written in its mission statement “We translate these advanced technologies into value for our customers through our professional solutions and services businesses worldwide”. IBM innovate many new products thus for a laymen its very difficult to understand terms like microelectronics and client/server architecture thus IBM hand over these technologies to a laymen in a simplified form with their experts and experienced systems.

<p><b>IBM Business Ahead?</b></p>
<p>Since from 1911 IBM is in the way of innovation and development of new products made for user’s convenience. Through all these milestones IBM has created a unique and an experienced R &amp; D department of its own for providing different types of solutions to a segment of users. IBM is still working on different types of networking architecture to power its users with the help of networking.</p>
<p><b>IBM - Future Objectives?</b></p>
<p>It’s been 92 years for IBM being a market leader in IT and Technology field. The goals and objectives of IBM still remains the same, they still want to be a market leader with the use of Microelectronics and advancement in the field of Networking. Though IBM is not diverting itself from Desktop PC’s or servers they are working on every aspect of the IT field to power the world so much with its technology and innovation.</p>
<p><b>IBM Study on Remote Environment: The P.E.S.T. Factors</b></p>
<p>IBM is into business since 1911, since from 1911 to the year 2003 a long period of 92 years. IBM got to have some of the remote environment in its list other than its strategy and plans. Some of them are discussed here under: - Political Factors IBM comes under fortune 500 companies it is strongly affected by political factors from the external environment. Rise in the taxation policy or interference from the legislation also effect IBM in various ways, such as, IBM when tried to implement 3G technology and its standards faced a political interference from the U.S. government. Since the government faced a problem of enforcement of this newly invented technology known as CDMAOne but when IBM tried the same thing in European markets it did not faced any type of political interference since there was no political barrier or enforcement problems regarding this technology from the government. Thus, it can be said that the political factors of the external stimuli’s not only affect IBM but also other companies as well. (Concept Source: “3G: 2G or not 2B (2001)”, Political Challenge, Ghani. R., <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g" class="external free" title="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g" rel="nofollow">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g</a>, [Accessed Date: 4th April 2003]) Economic Factors Since IBM is not into one business it offers services in various fields such as Business and Finance. Moreover IBM has got a branch or we can say a SBU (Strategic Business Unit) worldwide. The cost incurred by these SBU’s and R &amp; D department of each SBU is incurred by the these SBU’s only, since these SBU’s are capable of carrying out the cost of themselves, thus economic factors do not pressurize IBM so much. But there is one economic factor, which can affect IBM and put a pressure on the organisation and that factor is adapting towards the new technology and making the products according to the standards. Since this thing has to be done worldwide so the cost incurred will be relatively high. “3G: 2G or not 2B (2001)”, Political Challenge, Ghani. R., <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g" class="external free" title="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g" rel="nofollow">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-3g</a>, [Accessed Date: 4th April 2003]</p>
<p><b>Social Factors</b></p>
<p>Change in the technology or adapting towards the newly invented standards can affect IBM if they are not prepared. The example of the year 1990- 1993 is enough to highlight the huge losses of $8 Billion incurred by IBM, this example clearly shows how social factors such as introduction of client/server architecture and customers back-to-back revolution made IBM just like a sinking ship. So to avoid this hit of social factors IBM has to be fully prepared for the future demands of the users. (Concept Source: “Decade 1990(n.d.)”, <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html" class="external free" title="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html</a> , [Accessed Date: 3rd April 2003])</p>
<p><b>Technological Factors</b></p>
<p>IBM nowadays face technological challenges on each and every phase, newly invented technologies like Internet, 3G, Firewire or Wireless Standards can affect IBM in a great way. IBM is now having an R &amp; D for each and every different technology such as R &amp; D for Microelectronics, Wireless Standards, PC’s and Servers, Software and Hardware and Business Solutions etc. Thus it can be said that IBM is keeping itself fully prepared for any type of technological challenges but who knows what be the future ahead?</p>
<p><b>Industry Environment</b></p>
<p>Industry environment deals with Porter’s five-forces model that discusses about the following forces: - 1. Entry Barriers – Since from 1911 IBM is not only into IT and its products but also in various fields such as finance and business solutions and is still working on the said fields. Because of this reason IBM has created a good will in the market about itself with an added advantage of its brand name thus it makes it very difficult for any new company of similar type to enter into the market and capturing it. There is only one way by which competitors can capture the IT market that is by introducing some new architecture of networking or by adapting the cost leadership strategy or by inventing any new technology for which IBM is not prepared such as wireless internet or advancement in storage of data. Thus, a competitor can break into the market with the said factors and can gain competitive advantage over IBM.</p>
<p>2. Supplier Power – IBM has stepped into the worldwide market of IT products and services therefore it has created a huge range of suppliers and distributors all over the world. This strategy of IBM definitely helps them to gain a competitive advantage over others since the product is readily available in any city and in any country. 3. Buyer Power – The buyer power of IBM is relatively good enough they have targeted different sets of customers such as medium business users, large business users, home users and institutions. Because of its state-of-art products IBM is able to create a huge market for the said consumers and because of its good technical support IBM is able to create a demand of its products in the eyes of the consumers. 4. Substitutes – Competitors such as Dell and Compaq can compete with IBM as they manufacture same range of products such as workstations, Desktop PC’s and Servers etc. and they are coming really close to IBM. So IBM has to formulate yet another strategy to dominate the market with their products only. 5. Rivalry – There are two different types of rivalry forces that include Product differentiation and fierce type of cost, well IBM is concentrating on product differentiation through the use of Media, Public Relations, Organising events with Fortune 500 IT companies such as Microsoft as an example. Moreover on every newspaper there is got to be one advertisement of IBM by doing all this IBM is benchmarking their products in the eyes of people but to save its current market IBM has to get in cost leadership.</p>
<p><b>S.W.O.T. Analysis of IBM: A Major Step Towards Success</b></p>
<p>SWOT analysis in whole means Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. As IBM wants to be the market leader in continuity it has to analyse its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. IBM has grabbed every opportunity in its way, it also identified its strengths between the period of 1980-1990. As it was not able to recognize the threats that came in the period of 1993 which contributed towards a huge loss and due to this loss they were able to recognise their weaknesses. This is all historic now for IBM lets see what is there in the year 2000 and beyond for IBM by analysing the SWOT analysis.</p>
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<p>IBM is in the market for almost 92 years now, what made it remain in the industry for so long? Well the answer to this question deals with the strength of IBM because of which they have remained in the market for so long, lets see what are the strengths of IBM in the following page: - 1. The R &amp; D Department – IBM has a unique and a state-of-art R &amp; D departments worldwide which deals with the latest technology and works towards implementing new technology in their products. 2. Various Services – IBM is not only related with IT products and services inturn they are related to finance and e-business categories too which gives them the power to gain a competitive edge over other companies. 3. Worldwide Distribution – Wherever you are, you will not go far from a IBM center that’s the strategy IBM follows to ease its users with good technical support and buying preference. Thus, a consumer can feel secured while buying any of the IBM products as he/she is assured of getting the service for the product (if the product is under the warranty or guarantee period) anywhere in the world. 4. Good will and Brand Name - Since from 1911 IBM is renowned for its quality products and services. People trust IBM products and services then any other company’s products or services. They are assured of getting quality at a lesser price.

<p><b>Weaknesses</b></p>
<p>Why did IBM faced major losses in the year of 1990-1993, Well the answer is quite simple as IBM was not able to cope with the newly invented technology of client/server architecture it failed to convince its customers as a result they faced a huge crisis. If they could have understood the future demands of the user and could have worked accordingly then things would have been different for IBM but now IBM has totally changed it strategy to overcome its weaknesses. By saying that it means that IBM does not have any weaknesses now, lets see what weaknesses might affect IBM’s working: - 1. Not Following Cost-Leadership Theory – If we see in comparison to other companies we will find that IBM is selling their products at a very high price. IBM should bring down their marginal cost and cut the overhead expenses to sell their products at a cheaper rate, which will gain a competitive edge for IBM, as this will increase the purchasing power of the people. People will tend to buy more of IBM’s product, as they will get quality with price. 2. People’s Awareness – IBM should carry out events and seminars to educate people about the new technologies and how easily they can be implemented using IBM products. This strategy will give more knowledge to the users while using IBM products and he/she will be able to boost their businesses that will be indirectly a boost for IBM. Opportunities - As discussed in page 1 and page 2. IBM never missed an opportunity, instead of opportunity knocking at IBM’s door IBM themselves knocked at the door of opportunity. IBM still has the same kind of attitude, they still don’t miss any type of opportunity, and the following section discusses about IBM’s upcoming opportunities: - 1. In the field of Networking – IBM were the pioneers in token-ring network systems, which gave IBM a boost to rise in the era of 1980’s. IBM is still working on different network technologies such as wireless Internet and wireless Intranet. This strategy of working on new standards and technologies may give a boost to IBM. 2. Capturing the market of developing countries – Before any one does that IBM is doing it, It has entered into the markets of developing nations such as India and Pakistan. IBM is going for a total market capture for developing nations with its state – of- art products. Threats- IBM is more prone to the following threats coming up in the future: - 1. Mergers of Strong companies into one – Different companies merging into one can pose a threat to IBM such as the merger of Compaq and HP (Hewlett and Packard) can prove a serious threat to IBM as they have merged their corporate strategies also. 2. Cost – Different companies will be trying to convince the customers by bringing down their products prices, this can pose a serious threat towards IBM as people in developing nations such as India and Pakistan are more cost sensitive.</p>

<p><b>Competitive Advantages of IBM</b></p>
<p>When I brought an IBM PC for myself I asked myself why did I only chose IBM and not any other? That’s what people ask themselves after spending more than what they could have spent on any other brand. Why do we like to purchase an IBM PC instead of any other PC’s in the market leave the cost factor aside for few minutes? If somebody asks himself/herself what PC should we go for? It’s always IBM that comes in the minds of people that’s what one can call as a Competitive Edge. IBM has captured the market since from 92 years and will continue to do so in the future also because of it competitive edge. Let’s see the competitive advantages of IBM: - 1. Brand Name 2. Excellent Quality 3. Worldwide Technical Support 4. 3 years warranty on every IBM products 5. Data backup programs/softwares 6. Designed for the future use (Concept and Points Source: “IBM’s Enterprise Resource Planning (1999)”, <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/library/whitepapers/pdf/gf225108.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/library/whitepapers/pdf/gf225108.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/library/whitepapers/pdf/gf225108.pdf</a>, [Accessed Date: 5th April 2003]</p>
<p>Even in 1923 when IBM came up automatic punch cards machine there was a same craze as its there for IBM products and services. IBM has benchmarked its products and services long back in the era of 1911 only thus the user thinks that he/she is buying a product of a trusted brand name. Moreover IBM also provides worldwide customer technical support for its products and services no matter where you are, what are you doing? You are not far away from IBM’s technical support just giving a buzz on IBM’s toll free number or logging onto www.ibm.com/us will get you connected to IBM’s Technical Support. This strategy of IBM benchmarks it from others and thus provides a unique advantage over other companies.</p>

<p><b>Critical Success Factors: Does IBM have any?</b></p>
<p>Critical success factors are those points with which a company can dominate the market for long. As IBM into business for almost 92 years one can say that IBM is having these critical success factors, Indeed but what are they and in which area is IBM having them? Well let’s see what the critical success factors of IBM here under: - 1. Various areas of Business – People have general idea about IBM that it only works for the IT sector and not any thing else, Indeed IBM works for IT sector but it works for other business areas too such as Financial Management, Business Data Exchange, E-Commerce solutions, CFM relations and Marketing. So now it is very much clear that this type of strategy will definitely help IBM to overcome its competitors as IBM is proving itself “jack of all trades”. Thus, creating a good market and gaining competitive advantage over others is not a difficult task for IBM. 2. A good amount of manpower and capital – This factor really helps IBM to expand itself throughout the world. Wherever IBM wants it can open up a center of its own and start working from that branch. Why IBM has a SBU everywhere in the world? Well this is the reason that why IBM is having a SBU (Strategic Business Unit) worldwide because it has enough resources of manpower and capital to deploy anywhere in the world. 3. Domination in IT and PC market- IBM since from 1980 is dominating the PC market, they invented a technology called token-ring network system by which users were able to exchange data in an easy way. IBM because of its experienced and professional staff in IT sector is showing wonders all over the world. Invention of E-servers and most powerful Linux/Unix servers is giving a competitive edge to IBM. (Concept Source: “Exhibits Lists”, <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-1.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/index.html</a> , [Accessed Date: 5th April 2003])</p>
<p><b>Discussion of Strategy</b></p>
<p>Since from 1911 IBM is following different types of strategies to become a market leader and to make maximum number of clients. But as per now IBM should follow the following set of strategies in continuation to become the most preferred and dominating companies in the range of IT products. 1. Cost – Leadership – The first and foremost policy that IBM should follow in the developing nations should be cost-leadership. This strategy will help IBM to penetrate into the markets of developing nations such India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. If IBM follows the cost – leadership theory then it will be able wash off its competitors from the market such as Dell, Compaq and Zenith as these companies allows their products (PC) to be sold at a cheap price. 2. Advertising – IBM has been imprinted in the minds of the people since 1911 but think about those nations which are in the developing stage many people buying computer will not recognise the IBM PC’s. So to avoid this type of misconception IBM should advertise in various media such as television and business magazines. 3. Seminars and Conferences – IBM should hold more of seminars and conferences for the budding IT professional. They should be able to show the relation between their products and IT. In a developing nation such as India, the software professional are in huge numbers and require a perfect PC for themselves but often get confused IBM at this point should teach them what is unique point in their PC’s that makes it completely suitable for IT and its needs. 4. More of Freebies – IBM should give some freebies offer with their PC’s to attract the customers on the very first sight. This type of strategy will help IBM to grow in the market of upcoming nations such India and Pakistan. The user(s) will have one thing on his/her mind that he/she is getting a product of a renowned company with something really interesting that will help him/her business to grow. IBM should provide freebies such as Webcam, Headphones and Mic , Softwares (for Business class) and/or printers. This strategy will wash off IBM’s competitor from the market very easily as the user is getting beauty, brains and freebies in one single go.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>IBM is in the market for almost 92 years now. It has made people smile with the unique range that IBM invented. Though IBM is going smoothly in the developed nations but one will ask a question that is IBM going smoothly in the developing nations where people are cost sensitive? Well IBM has introduced its range of products in the markets of the developing nations such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But to be more precise IBM has not touched the nerves of the people living in these nations. Almost 80% of the people in these countries go for assembled PC’s, as they can’t afford PC’s worth Rs. 60000 or 70000 when they can get the same PC at half of the price. The only thing which the customer does is compromising with the brand name they are not getting the unique brand name of companies. So in such a market IBM has to follow a unique strategy so that it cans washout all its competitors and become the most preferred company in IT products. Moreover IBM should not stop its advertising in these upcoming nations as the people in these nations are fully aware of the local brand but when a renowned companies comes in the market they think that it’s a new company and they don’t trust them at all. So to avoid this type of situation IBM should continue advertising its products in the range of desktop pc’s and servers. Once IBM follows these assumed strategies they might bring gold in their organization.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Poloc is a family-centred club with its own ground in the picturesque Pollok Country Park estate on Glasgow's south-side.</p>
<p>Members come from all backgrounds and from across the ethnic and cultural spectrums with all ages taking an active part in club life. As well as competitive and social cricket for juniors and adults, there are all-weather tennis facilities, a unique golf section, spectator seating, dedicated junior pavilion and well-appointed clubhouse with spacious bar area, pool table, darts and catering facilities.</p>
<p>Competitively, the club's cricket sides play under the names "NVT Poloc" and "NVT Shawholm", NVT being the club's main sponsor - more about it and the club's other funders and supporters can be found on the club's website (www.poloc.com). NVT Poloc play in the Scottish National Cricket League Premier Division whilst NVT Shawholm play in the Western District Cricket Union First Division.</p>
<p><br />
The beginnings</p>
<p>Founded in 1878, Poloc Cricket Club spent its first season on the site of the old Pollokshaws Race Course and in 1880 moved to our unrivalled location at Shawholm where play has continued for the last 129 years! The editor of a local newspaper wrote in 1887; "their ground is a beautiful one hardly to be matched in Scotland for its surroundings".</p>
<p>A pavilion was acquired by the club from the now-defunct Pollokshields Athletic Club, also located on Pollok Estates, and the building was moved to Shawholm on rollers! In the same year, the main avenue from Pollokshaws Road to Pollok House was opened, running past the north side of the ground in what is now Pollok Park. This avenue still provides a beautiful tree-lined approach to Shawholm to this day with the River Cart to the left.</p>
<p>Our club's golf section was formed in 1889 and with bowls, putting and archery, Poloc became a sporting club possibly unique amongst cricket clubs in Scotland.</p>
<p><br />
Growth and development</p>
<p>Full tenancy of the six-acre site was granted to the club in 1888 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell who continued to be involved in Poloc's affairs until his death in 1956. He is remembered by older members as an outstanding and generous laird and landlord.</p>
<p>By 1890 Poloc sides had become strong enough to match their cricketing adversaries, in particular the club's nearest and fiercest local rivals, Clydesdale. The Titwood side play only a mile or so away from Shawholm and our rivalry continues to this day as both sides battle for supremacy in the Scottish National Cricket League. Home or away, "derby" matches remain highlights of any season's fixture card.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in 1908 the Pollokshaws Working Lads Club decided to form a football team from amongst their ranks. When their ambitious plans reached the ears of Sir John Stirling Maxwell he allotted that club an area of land on the estate, rent-free. The footballers, in turn, to show their appreciation, took the name of Pollok Juniors FC, and Sir John became their first Honorary President. The ground allocated became known as Haggs Park and was adjacent to Poloc Cricket Club; in fact, the different spellings of the two names "Pollok" and "Poloc" were adopted at this time, deliberately, to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Membership at Poloc reached a peak of 600 in the late 1940's, including a healthy waiting list. And, in 1955, Shawholm played host to the first televised cricket match in Scotland when Poloc entertained the club's other principal Glasgow rivals, West of Scotland, who play on the city's north side at Hamilton Crescent.</p>
<p>Membership has come down a bit since the heady days of the 1940's and 1950's but numbers remain healthy and new members are always welcome! Members need not be serious sportsmen or women with many gladly falling into the category of "social" members. With its idyllic and extremely safe setting as well as facilities and well appointed clubhouse, membership of Poloc remains a hugely enjoyable proposition.</p>
<p><br />
Historic moments</p>
<p>Shawholm played host to Poloc versus the MCC in June 1965. The ground was fully decked out with marquee and commissionaires.</p>
<p>The clubhouse and its gardens had never looked better! The game was a three-day match played between the 23rd and 25th.</p>
<p>Scotland's first televised cricket match took place at Shawholm on 7 May 1955 when West of Scotland were Poloc's visitors. Poloc batted first making 110 for 9 in brilliant sunshine. In reply, west made 120 for 6. Unfortunately Poloc's own historical record of the day notes that "the viewing was tedious"!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the cricket on view however the day was enjoyable with, again, a marquee being erected in front of the tennis courts for teas.</p>
<p>Bringing things right up to date, the ground was invited to host three internationals as part of the 2005 ECC European Championships. The matches (The Netherlands versus Italy, Jersey versus Germany and The Netherlands versus Denmark) saw white ball/black sightscreen cricket at Shawholm for the first time and yet again demonstrated club members' willingness and ability to host such matches.</p>
<p><br />
Junior cricket</p>
<p>Poloc runs junior cricket teams at five age-group levels: under 11, 13, 13b, 15 and 18 and compete in West Junior Cricket Union- as well as Cricket Scotland-organised competitions. Under 10 players also compete in "Kwik Cricket" competitions from time to time.</p>
<p><br />
The Community Coaching Initiative</p>
<p>Poloc Cricket Club has been providing cricket coaching in its local community under the auspices of the "Community Coaching Initiative" since 2002. Working with Glasgow Council a pilot scheme was run in two local schools and, since then, the Initiative has grown each year so that, in 2006, eight local schools took part. The core part of the coaching carried out in schools is weekly sessions carried out by the club's coaches at the schools.</p>
<p>The culmination of each year's primary schools coaching is a festival day at Shawholm that sees the schools competing against each other. In addition, the club, under the umbrella of the Initiative and in partnership with the WJCU, regularly hosts "Kwik Cricket" festivals.</p>
<p>In addition to the work in local schools, the club's Community Coaching Initiative also works with other community groups in providing sports coaching in and around the club's locality. Most often this work is part of a larger initiative being carried out in the community.</p>
<p>All the work of the Initiative is carried out by appropriately qualified coaching staff with the assistance of appropriately supervised coaching assistants. All coaches have been appropriately "Disclosure Scotland" checked and the Initiative's work is carried on as an integral part of the club's youth activities, recognised by Cricket Scotland's "TOPClub" accreditation</p>
<p>The Initiative was granted charitable status in early 2007 and is registered with the OSCR under number SC037774. The registered body itself is CCI Glasgow Limited, a private company limited by guarantee and registered in Scotland under number SC315322, whose registered address is Shawholm, Pollok Park, 2060 Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow G43 1AT.</p>
<p><br />
Golf</p>
<p>Uniquely, Poloc Cricket Club also plays host to the UK’s only R&amp;A-recognised six-hole golf course.</p>
<p>Founded in 1889, the Golf Section's centenary was marked by a letter of congratulations from the custodians of the game's rules based at the home of golf.</p>
<p>With the cricket bats, helmets and pads all safely locked away in attics and back bedrooms for at least a few months, attention for many turns to golf at Shawholm in the early autumn. Taking part in golf over the autumn and winter months - a round at "wee poloc" - is a unique challenge, with monthly medals with club competitions every fortnight throughout the season.</p>
<p>Some English County grounds have trees within their boundary ropes; at Shawholm the greens and tee boxes make unique features on the cricket ground in the summer months!</p>
<p><br />
Tennis</p>
<p>Poloc Cricket Club also boasts six tennis courts: three all-weather tennis courts and three clay courts, both adjacent to the clubhouse building.</p>

<p>Västerås Idrottsklubb fick sitt första fotbollslag 1913. Laget bildades av spelare som tidigare tillhört IF Svea. 1920 spelade VIK en match mot B93 från Köpenhamn i den första internationella match som spelats i Västerås. VIK förlorade med 1-2 men laget som VIK ställde upp ses som ett av de bästa man haft genom tiderna.<br />
1924/1925; VIK spelar i den allra första Allsvenskan. Laget hamnar dock näst sist och faller ned till tvåan.<br />
1970-talet; En mörk period i VIK:s historia. Efter att ha gått upp i trean åker laget ur direkt och raset börjar. VIK fortsätter att falla. Fyran, femman, sexan...<br />
Botten nåddes under säsongen 1976 då man hamnade i Div.7, efter en säsong med endast 2 vinster.<br />
1974; En ljusglimt i mörkret - VIK startar upp sin Fotbollsskola, där klubben vänder sig till pojkar i 8-10 årsåldern. Man väntar sig en uppslutning på runt 50 grabbar,<br />
108 stycken anmäler sig första året!<br />
A-laget skärpte sig efter den årslånga sejouren i sjuan och med samma hastighet som man fallit reser sig VIK och i början av åttiotalet spelar man åter i fyran.<br />
1980; Mångidrottsklubben Västerås IK delas upp i flera individuella klubbar med inriktning på respektive sport.<br />
1983; VIK börjar med flickfotboll. Första året tränar fem lag.<br />
1988; VIK:s första A-lag för damer spelar sin första serie. Man blir tvåa efter Munktorp och avancerar till div.4.<br />
1989; VIK:s damer avancerar till Div.3 tack vare en fjärdeplats i serien.<br />
1997; VIK:s herrar vinner div.4 och spelar säsongerna 1998/1999 i trean, en nivå som inte är helt obekant för klubben.<br />
1999; Året blir ett antiklimax år för klubben. Efter att 1998 kvalspelat och nästan nått Div.2 åker laget året ur div.3 igen.<br />
2000; Klubben bestämmer sig för att under Thomas Johanssons ledning göra en nystart. Första året slutar laget på en andra plats i "fyran", vilket innebär kvalspel till "trean" i Örebro. Efter en riktig rysare i sista kvalmatchen är avancemanget klart.<br />
2001 och 2002 spelas det div.3 fotboll på Apalby.<br />
Säsongen 2003 blir ett stort lyft för de "gul-svarta". Med ett gediget spel över hela säsongen och med Erik Karlsson i toppform spelar man hem seriesegern och spel i division 2 är ett faktum. Första året i en ny serie brukar vara svårt men laget lyckas till slut klara nytt kontrakt och klubben spelar fortfarande i division 2.<br />
Med början 2007 gör klubben en satsning på unga, egna spelare med målet att inom några år göra Skiljebo och VSK sällskap i Div.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cosmos-yachting.de" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmos-yachting.de" rel="nofollow">Cosmos Yacht Charters</a> easily lives up to the built-in proclamation of its nomenclature. The seaworthy firm offers yacht excursions worldwide in mono-hull sailboats, powered catamarans or motor yachts that lavishly accommodate as few as two or ten or more guests...</p>
<p>Cosmos Yachting was first established back in 1988, and since the day we first sailed we have been committed to offering our customers responsive, professional and straightforward service. in Greece, we have evolved into a market leader, with bases across the most important Greek islands as well as in Athens, and a fleet made up of Bavaria, Jeanneau and Bénéteau sailing yachts. Today we operate from many locations around the world, and can offer the charter and sale of both sailing and motor yachts, with or without crew, in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, South Pacific and Indian Ocean. In addition to selling yachts from Bavaria, the largest German shipyard, we can provide a comprehensive range of support services including finance, maintenance, chartering and resale, and are the largest player in the pre-owned yacht market in Greece. Aside from small, medium, and large vessels, there are motor yachts and sailing yachts.“Cosmos yachting doesn’t really offer ‘vacation or tour packages.’ We view individual yacht charters as customized vacations. Once the trip is plotted, we, along with the crew, work with a client to establish an itinerary based on the guests’ preferences.”</p>

<p>Description: Project Interchange is a program offered through the American Jewish Committee. The project takes various groups of individuals, be them student editors or U.S. congressmen, to Israel in the hopes of giving future and current policy makers/ leaders a fuller understanding of the country and related conflicts. According to the official site, projectinterchange.org, "A cornerstone of Project Interchange seminars is the presentation of differing viewpoints on the complexities and nuances of controversial issues in Israel and the Middle East such as the Israeli-Palestinian and Israel-Hezbollah conflicts." History: According to the official site, Project Interchange was founded in 1982 and has "brought over 4,500 prominent American and international figures to Israel on our week-long seminars which include meetings, site visits, and touring. Each seminar is tailored to address the interests of its delegation (e.g., immigrant absorption, education, counter-terrorism, politics, and environment), while introducing participants to Israel’s complexity and diversity." Campus Editors Program Overview: This December a group of campus editors went to Israel on one of the exchange programs. It was not the first group of editors to do so, but it was one of the most recent trips for such students. These students met with Jewsih Israelis, Arab Israelis and Palestinians. They spoke with professional journalists coping with the situation in the MidEast and the recent complication of the Security Barrier. They also spoke with student journalists there and met with members of the Israeli parliament. Thought the program is sponsored by a Jewish organization, the itinery does try to include all points of view and not just those of the Jewish Israelis. The student editor appreciated this fact very much.</p>

<p>I received the following e-mail, sent at 1:25 a.m. on 09/21/05 in response to a Scam Alert published in Ask TaxMama last February.</p>
<p>Please read Mr. Ansell's letter in its entirety, including the things in which his company takes pride.</p>
<p>Especially take note of the fact that he claims his company "also programmed the new official Nevada forms that have the barcode encoded."</p>
<p>I suppose I am confused.</p>
<p>If one of the big advantages of having a Nevada corporation is privacy, why is the State of Nevada selling lists of corporate officers and contact information to this company?</p>
<p>Is there something here that doesn't make sense?</p>
<p>Anyway, read the letter. (The only thing I've edited is his mobile phone number.)</p>
<p>Then, if you have time, please read my reply, at the bottom.</p>
<p><br />
THE LETTER Dear “TaxMama”,</p>
<p>My name is Doug Ansell and I am Director of Operations for Incorp Services, Inc. who you reference in your article “Scam Alert: Corporate Update Letters”.</p>
<p>You are doing a severe discredit to your readers by representing our company and our offer in this fashion. First you mention “a service you don’t need”. In the State of Nevada, you are required by law to have a “resident agent” (aka “registered agent”) for Nevada entities, therefore, this is a service you definitely need. You could of course use a friend residing in Nevada but our research of 900 companies showed that in these cases, annual renewal notices were not forwarded – or resulted in late penalties at least once (and sometimes more) in three years in a little over 87% of all cases surveyed. This can result in penalties and fees starting at $75 and going up to $800+ to reinstate a recently revoked entity (something that happens after being in default for over 12 months). Another consideration is vultures who look for entities using residential addresses and using complacent service processors win default judgments because the defendants never received the service of process regarding a bogus lawsuit – then win judgments that have to be reversed. This is a scam the elderly are particularly at risk of. This simply does not happen with our clients.</p>
<p>The reason our documents look “frighteningly real” is because they are! – Since November 2002, the State of Nevada like many other jurisdictions requires that all submittals be on official Nevada State forms. I am happy to inform you that our company also programmed the new official Nevada forms that have the barcode encoded. I can send you samples of the new forms if you like. You mention that we have something resembling the “California State Form” – note that we do not – nor have we ever sent offers to California state entities – so you have us confused with someone else. I would appreciate your clarifying this as well.</p>
<p>We do ask for $185 – the $125 (or whatever the fee is for that particular entity and capitalization up to $11,000+) plus the $60 to change the registered agent. Most of the people switching to us are coming from CT or CSC. Most people with CT and CSC are paying $175-$300 per entity plus the list filing fee (usually $125), so yes the savings is substantial – not “a little less” for most. We’ll also price match any other competitor’s offer. If someone does not like our service the first year – we NEVER see a dime from them and we’ve assumedly lost time and money on servicing them for the year we have them – so it is IMPERITIVE that we do a great job for our clients!</p>
<p>In Nevada, we also include mail forwarding – unlimited 1st class domestic mail forwarding. Most companies charge postage, an annual fee equal to or exceeding the cost of the agent service and a per piece processing fee – we charge nothing – nada. We also offer online entity tracking in multiple jurisdictions (something no other company has) and online document storage, retrieval and delivery. Some companies offer this, but charge over $1,000 a year for this service. Again, we offer this for free. Additionally, we offer free representation in a number of jurisdictions – so let’s say you are with CT and paying $290 per jurisdiction for one company registered in 50 states+DC (the most common configuration) that would be $14,790 a year. If you switch via our offer, 10 states are completely free – the others a maximum of $99, so your fees to us the first year would be a MAXIMUM of $3,960.</p>
<p>There are companies that put out shoddy productions offering similar offers, but then when the client receives a piece of mail, they call and say, “hey, we have this piece of mail for you, but you don’t have our mail forwarding service” – ding - $100 – oh and you need a postage deposit – ding – another $50, etc. We don’t have any hidden charges and that is why we stress this on our letter.</p>
<p>As for the “tiny print”, I wish we could make it smaller and extol the virtues of our service beyond what is listed on the single page. There is really no way to tell you all of the features we’re constantly developing for our clients that we have no intent to charge for beyond our annual regular charge. I appreciate that you point out that people do save money, that we do explain our offer, etc. And we certainly hope that someone would actually read something before sending a check – and signing a document under penalty of perjury. Of course, mistakes have happened, but 30 seconds of talking to these rare cases tells you all you need to know about why It does nothing for us if someone “accidentally” switches over – because it is a lot of work for us – and they would just switch back after the year anyway. We MUST attract and keep customers based on our superior offering.</p>
<p>You note the adjustment of the address. This serves a few functions. First, is privacy. Many Nevada entities are filed with privacy in mind. If you file your list with officers initials such as A. Jones, etc. it makes it very difficult to know which A. Jones in the US – or out of the country is the entity principal. This protects the identities of the officers to some degree. This is also important in light of security. There was a case where a disgruntled day trader who had lost his life savings decided to visit an officer of a corporation personally in Vancouver with a firearm. Thankfully, this episode ended without anyone being hurt, but what about next time? Another issue is that the Secretary of State database is sold to mailing houses, etc. to harvest names for junk mail. Our clients enjoy a huge reduction in the amount of junk mail they receive as most of it is 2nd and 3rd class. This saves our customers time and money – but for small business owners, time is the most valuable asset. You mention that people won’t get official mail, but our clients never miss a piece of mail because we forward everything. The State of Nevada sends all documents to the Resident Agent anyway (some states send direct to entities, Nevada does not). Also, we notice our clients of annual renewals every year even when the State fails to send a notice which we estimate to be 1 in 30 instances.</p>
<p>We never “overcharge” for the annual report – in fact, we request that the check be made to the Secretary of State – not us! There is no profit involved unless we make the client happy for at least a year – a substantial investment in a client prospect unless we are committed to making that client happy.</p>
<p>Also, you note that some small companies are not required to have annual meetings minutes – this is just not true! Please let your readers know. This is how the corporate veil is pierced! We don’t offer minutes in our letters – we assume that people have that already, but can perform this service if asked – unfortunately, this service is at an additional charge because we use specialists for this. Like you said, there is a lot more to annual meetings than a couple of dates and cookie cutter fields. Your documents need to stand up to scrutiny – difficult to do with a template.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about one more thing we’re especially proud of… StatusWatch! It is an automated service that watches your filing with the SOS and notifies you of changes such as someone attempting to “hijack” your company by filing a bogus list and getting in your bank account. Corporate identity fraud is rampant! – Also, you are noticed of non-compliance almost in real-time. Again, this is a service proprietary to Incorp.</p>
<p>Tell you what… I’m not blowing smoke. Our service is not, nor has it ever been “a scam”. We see deceptive scams such as the “minutes” services you mention all the time. We are not a disingenuous company and I would like to prove it to you. I invite you to try us in whatever capacity you like and report your experience to your readers. If we aren’t all I say, well so be it, but we are a great company with great people and I know we can really be a great help to your readers.</p>
<p>I hope you find my comments helpful and feel free to contact me at your leisure at (702)[deleted](my mobile). Also note that out of over 200 service companies in Nevada, we are the largest Nevada based provider – and only CT is bigger in Nevada (at least until 2008 – but hey, they did have a 100 year head start!)</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Doug Ansell</p>
<p>Incorp Services, Inc. 3155 East Patrick Lane · Suite 1 Las Vegas, NV 89120-3481 USA (702) 866-2500 or (800) 2-INCORP Voice (702) 866-2689 Fax</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Ansell,</p>
<p>Thank you for your very long letter.</p>
<p>However, you've mis-interpreted the article from the outset.</p>
<p>"a service you don't need" was not in reference to 'agent of service'. It was in reference to your company's services - and those who send solicitations like yours.</p>
<p>All Nevada corporations are, indeed, required to have an agent of service. And they do. All of my clients who received your forms already have an agent of service. They do not need to pay the extra $60 to have that changed to you.</p>
<p>Despite all your protestations to the contrary, your letters are completely misleading. Even your envelopes are designed to mislead and look official.</p>
<p>I am not interested in publishing your rebuttal until you change your advertising and cover letter to make it totally clear that by using these forms you are:</p>
<p>changing their agent of service changing the officers' addresses, thereby causing all their bulk mail to be sent to you, including all solicitations for credit card offers etc. that come to Nevada and other corporations. that they will incur extra fees and costs for mail forwarding, in addition those they already pay to their present mailing address service. And that they don't need to use your service - they are perfectly free to use the forms that come directly from the Secretary of State. While your services themselves may be valid or legitimate, your solicitations are not. And if the State of Nevada is using your services to design their forms for them, and they condone your deceptive solicitations, that might be worth pointing out to the journalist community to investigate. Why would any state government associate themselves with a company that behaves this way?</p>
<p>Of course you get lots of new customers. People mistakenly submit those forms to you, not understanding that they don't come from the Secretary of State's office.</p>
<p>And the fact that you might not make money off them in the first year? Well, since all their mail comes to you forevermore, you have a captive audience - they pay you for the rest of their corporate life, until someone notices what you've done and changes their agent of service. Great long-term investment.</p>
<p>When my clients and I get new solicitation with clear and proper disclosures in them - not buried in small print - I'll be happy to print your letter.</p>
<p>In fact, now that I think about it, I may just print it this week. You'll get what you requested - a public hearing. And I'll be interested to see what the public says about your explanation.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Eva Rosenberg, EA TaxMama.com</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>TaxMama Note:</p>
<p>Yes, I have no doubt Incorp Services Inc is a legitimate company. It's just their advertising methods that irritate me no end - and waste my time, every time a client gets that and asks me if they should be paying that bill.</p>
<p>Incidentally, do you know why it's worthwhile offering the service essentially free the first year?</p>
<p>It's not clear what they charge, from his letter, but assuming that $99 number is their annual fee for agent of service and all charges...</p>
<p>If they convert/subvert only 100 companies a year...</p>
<p>The next year they collect $9,900.</p>
<p>The following year, it is 200 companies (100 new and 100 from before), so they earn $19,800.</p>
<p>The third year 300 = $29,700 and so on.</p>
<p>In ten years, they are earning $99,000 per year for simply sending out one piece of paper (the annual renewal notice) to each customer.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if they convert 1000 companies a year. That's nearly a million dollars a year for sending out one piece of paper. Not a bad racket.</p>
<p>Too bad no one wants to incorporate in California!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-07_3654.html" title="Edit section: Simpson Compound Gear Set">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Simpson Compound Gear Set</span></h2>
<p>The simpson planetary gearset uses a compound planetary gearset with common sun gears. Note just because the sun gears are tied together does not mean they have to have the same number of teeth. The front carrier is physically tied to the rear ring gear as is the output. In neutral the simpson planetary gear set does not have a locked member i.e. there isn’t a reactionary member. Reverse is accomplished by clutching the sun assembly to the input and locking the rear carrier assembly to the case, i.e. making it the reactionary member. The gear ratio is – Nrr/Nsr where Nrr is the rear ring gear tooth number and Nsr is the rear sun gear tooth number. First gear is accomplished by making the forward ring gear the input member by clutching it to the input shaft. The common sun gears rotate backward. This causes the rear planetary carrier assembly to attempt to rotate backwards. However an overrunning clutch locks the carrier assembly making it a reactionary member. The gear ratio is rather complex: define X = (Nrr/Nsr) and Y = ( Nsf / Nsf) then the gear ratio is X(Y) + second gear ratio where Nsr and Nsf are the number of teeth on the forward and rear sun gears and Nrf and Nrr are the number of teeth on the forward and rear sun gears respectively.</p>
<p>Second gear is accomplished by locking the common sun gears to the case while the forward ring gear is still clutched to the input shaft. The gear ratio is (Nrf + Nsf)/ Nrf where Nrf is the number of teeth on the forward ring gear and Nsf is the number of teeth on the forward sun gear. The gear ratio is exactly the same as that of a simple planetary gear set. Notice that the rear carrier is spinning at over speed in the same direction. Third gear locks both the common sun gears and forward ring gear to the input shaft with clutches. When two members of a planetary gear set are locked together the output is locked in a 1 to 1 ratio.</p>
<p>Example with Nrr = 31 T, Nrf = 29T, Nsf = Nsr = 13T</p>
<p>Then rear carrier pinion gear (Ncr) has 9T, and forward carrier pinion gear (Ncf) has 8T. Ncr = (Nrr – Nsr) / 2 and Ncf = (Nrf – Nsf)/ 2</p>
<p>Note&#160;: Nrr – Nsr and Nrf – Nsf must be even</p>
<p>Reverse gear ratio = -Nrr/Nsr = -31/13 = -2.38</p>
<p>First gear ratio = X(Y) + second gear ratio = 31/29 + 1.419 = 2.49</p>
<p>Second gear ratio = (Nrf + Nsf) / Nrf = (13 + 31)/ 31 = 1.419</p>
<p>Third gear is 1 i.e. direct</p>
<p><br />
These gear ratios are derived from the following Planetary gear equation:</p>
<p>Ns(Ws) + Nr(Wr) = (Ns + Nr) Wc</p>
<p>Where Ns = number of teeth on the sun gear, Nr = number of the teeth on ring gear, Ws = speed of sun gear, Wr = speed of ring gear, and Wc = speed of carrier assembly.</p>

<p>A budding superstar at Pong on the Notre Dame campus, Daniel uses a new sophiscated type of game play to beat opponents in record time. Daniel won his first Pong tournament during his freshman orientation and has gone undefeated since. Daniel has been the subject of numerous press articles in the Observer and in other reputable newspapers in the South Bend area. Look for this premier Pong player to be the subject of an ESPN insider article in the near future.</p>

<p>Natalie Barbon is a great friend. At school she is fun to play with but sometimes shes a little tinytiny bit irritating. Thats okay . We tell her when she is and then she stops. Also katelyn and claire and gabby are great. She is loyal and fun and smart and a great co-host (she knows what i mean). So one day we were playing trivia and she asked "Name a word that isnt in the dictionary". WE thought and thought, but we didnt know. then she finally told us it was QWERTY. She told us to look at the keyboard. We said she cheated, so she said it was on wikipedia. I looked it up and it was true! So since shes likes wikipedia so much, i thought i would do this for her. Suprise! Hope you like it.</p>
