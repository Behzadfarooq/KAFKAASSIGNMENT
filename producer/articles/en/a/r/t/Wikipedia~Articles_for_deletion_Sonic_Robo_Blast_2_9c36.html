<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> SRB2 not only is one of the best, most bug-free and fun Sonic fan-games of them all, it's also a notable DOOM mod. The article is also updated often with good information by a large active community, so there are really no reasons for deletion. Also, do note that this game is still in production, has a fanbase which increases every day, and is a rather solid project, arguably more solid than the current status of the series it is based on, probably unlike most projects of the same kind. However, were another project to meet these circumstances, I'd see that keeping an article on it would be reasonable as well. However, I do not believe you may run across projects of this magnitude too often. -Neo Chaotikal

<li><b>Keep</b> SRB2 in itself is a massive 3D fangame. Few other fangames can boast the community and fan-base that SRB2 has. A good hunk of the community was forwarded here BY this article. The only problem with the article is lack of content, as to what the game has. On top of that, this game boasts the ability to be easily edited to make it an entirely different game. Might I recommend that you play the game before deciding it's just a random freeware fangame? -- Dark Warrior

Fangames are not inheritently non-notable since a lot more effort goes into their creation than other fan products, such as fan-fiction. In effect, they're fully-fledged (if unofficial) games themselves, and last I checked Wikipedia was perfectly open to that, given enough information about it (of which this article has plenty), or notability (do a <a href="../../../g/t/_/WP%7EGT_7ea5.html" title="WP:GT">Google test</a>; around 300,000 results, and 893 group results, which, for a fangame, is pretty good).

<li><s>"So, hey. If you give a crap about the Wikipedia entry (and you should, there's quite a lot of information on it)". Not really the best thing to say, as that implies that they can't keep their information elsewhere, and thus are using Wikipedia as a storage for that information; this would violate <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host.2C_blog.2C_webspace_provider_or_social_networking_site" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a free host, blog, webspace provider or social networking site</a>.</s> I don't care about this article, but I'm not comfortable with people just coming in here and dicating policy out of simple interest in the article's subject.

<li>We have our own Wiki for tutorials, specific information, and fancruft, so it's not like we use Wikipedia as a free host. I completely agree with Wikipedia's ideals and policies, and use the site as a reference on a regular basis. Honestly, I think the article on SRB2 kinda sucks, and needs to be reworked quite a bit, as it's accumulated a fair amount of useless garbage over time. I just don't think it should be outright deleted, as this is not a vanity article, and there is interest in the game beyond the overly vocal core fanbase. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 06:42, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, thanks for clarifying the info webhost thing. I've accordingly striked out my concerns. I wouldn't worry too much about the article with what we have now; only two people voted to delete.

<li><b>Keep</b>: We have articles about websites, webcomics, and other such internet things. Why not this? It's obviously popular enough and complex enough to be considered a major internet entity, and therefore likely deserves its own article.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Anything with over 300 thousend Google results is rather noteworthy compared to how many results the vast majority of Wikipedia articles get. If you don't believe me, go to Wikipedia's home page, click on "Random article," and google the article's title. --MarkGyver 22:48, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Regarding <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDarkArchon_0516.html" title="User:TheDarkArchon">TheDarkArchon</a>'s post, "Sonic Robo Blast 2" is often misspelled on websites as "Sonic Robo Blaster 2", "Sonic Robot Blast 2", and similar variations. It is also often referred to by its four-digit acronym, "SRB2". A better method might be to search "SRB2" OR "Sonic Robo Blast 2", which returns 84,900 results. As the co-creator and head of this game, I could honestly care less if this Wikipedia article stayed or not - the game does not need a wiki article to be notable or popular. This article was even created without our permission by a fan of the game - we did not post this ourselves. It's fine if it stays, but we really won't care if it's gone.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This game is one of the most in-depth modifications of the DOOM engine, the only massively multiplayer and 3D Sonic fangame, and (as far as MysticEsper is concerned) has press coverage. The article itself needs to be reworked since WP:ISNOT a web guide. But out of all the fangame articles at Wikipedia, this one deserves to stay. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>&lt;Sp</sup></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><sup>e</sup></font></a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup>ak|on|it!&gt;</sup></a> 04:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Presuming that fangames are non-notable at the outset is a <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacies_of_definition.html" title="Fallacies of definition">fallacy of definition</a>. Regardless, the article should stay; it's too big of a game. From a prorammer's point of view, I've looked at the source code and it looks interesting enough to warrant some mention.
