<li><b>Point</b>As you can see I did not start the listing sections, but rather am trying to add to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of multiplayer games for playstation 2 organized by number of players is not indecriminate. They have to fit into a category, which in this case is number of players. Nowhere else on the net does this list exist, and I would hope that wikipedia would realize its importance. Furthmore, why was this even suggested as being marked for deletion as according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" rel="nofollow">this</a>, no mention of this category type is mentioned. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen414_21d0.html" title="User:Ben414">Ben414</a> 14:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> With expansion, this article could be just as worthy as any other list. I also happen to think it <i>will</i> expand, given the involvement of gamers on Wikipedia. The list also serves a useful enough purpose, and it is for a notable entity. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 03:08, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">User:RidG</a> I appreciate the fact that you are trying to keep wikipedia pure, but don't let your own biases keep this unique, and desperately needed article from existing. Also information is always evolving and expanding, so trying to keep information a certain size is impossible. Wikipedia needs to grow, and if a missing article exists, it needs to be created.{{--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen414_21d0.html" title="User:Ben414">Ben414</a> 03:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)|Ben414}}</li>
<li>Ben - I don't know if I agree with your allegation of "bias," and I certainly don't agree with your statement that this is a "desperately needed article." We'll agree to disagree on this. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 03:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think this list is an indiscriminate list of info- it's a very specific list, one with a finite number of entries, each of which sharing an important quality (unlike "List of songs with the word 'song' in the title, or something like that, in which the shared quality is highly trivial). I think this list is quite useful- moreso than the vast majority of lists on WP. Obviously, the list has to be highly expanded (including placing the "expand" tag on the article), but it could easily become an excellent list. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but this is attempting to serve as a list for play on the <i>same</i> PS2, as opposed to online networking; in addition, instead of adding categories for 2-, 4-, 8-, x-player games, I like the idea of having them all in one place. Perhaps the article should be <b>moved</b> to a title that is more appropriate. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:31, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can't say 100% that this list <i>needs</i> to exist, but I think it <i>should</i>.

<li>Ok, needs is strong, but as I've said before, nowhere else does this exist.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - While a legitimate list, I can't see it having any practical value. Almost all video games have some sort of multiplayer mode, thus making this almost a list of all PS2 games, which would be redundant. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 14:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Move to List of Multiplayer PlayStation 2 games</b> or something along those lines.

<li><b>Delete</b> It would be more remarkable if you could populate it with a list of the games that didn't have an option for multiplay mode. No conceivable use. GassyGuy 03:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This list is more detailed than the article for the list of ps2 network games, and I doubt will ever get as long as the generic list of PS2 games which is not contested.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a list that may not apply to those who contest it, but those who do like having gaming get-togethers would find this list extremely useful. It is more useful in that the users know immediately that these games would be beneficial for them.</p>
<p>As stated again, and again, wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and it needs to grow, and be home to items that are organized in a useful way.</p>
<p>The alternative is aimlessly reading the descriptions of all ps2 games from wiki, which only states one player, or multiplayer. Multiplayer is as much a number as over is a direction; vague at best.</p>
<p>I will say this: If this specialized, wikipedia list is marked for deletion, then delete them all, if not, kill all the bias against it.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen414_21d0.html" title="User:Ben414">Ben414</a> 05:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What advertising?? This article is as much advertising, as the facts relating to any other game article on this site. All this does is tell people these games are more than solitary. The extent of this article's 'advertising' is it link to the selected game's article, and helps determine whether that type of game is desired or not. I don't know about anyone else, but that's a guideline I use to determine if I should get a game or not. This just organizes the games by number of players from 2 up.
