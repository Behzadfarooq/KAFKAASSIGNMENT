<p>Neologism, 0.5 sources. One obscure book uses the word "Cool" but isn't clear it ever calls it an "African philosophy".</p>
<p>Article faced AfD but was given reprieve to find more sources. Four months later is still lacking sources.</p>

<p>Leads in with weasely "Cool is considered by several notable professors", none of which are mentioned.</p>
<p>Creator acknowledges this is a POV fork*: "Because people whined and groused about the information regarding its African/African-American origins, I separated out the African/African-American subject matter from cool and began Cool (African philosophy)" (Deeceevoice)</p>

<dd>I would concur with <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">User:FrancisTyers</a>. I wasn't going to mention it, but since this particular thread has come this far, let me state that I, too, believe, this is a bad-faith AfD. It's no secret there is no love loss between JFAS and me -- to the point that I repeatedly have asked him not to post to my talk page. I believe the matter that precipitated this AfD is the issue of JFAS's incessant and appallingly tacky/vicious edit warring at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Dellums_4dba.html" title="Ronald Dellums">Ronald Dellums</a>. He can't stand the man -- a point he makes perfectly clear on his user page.
<ul>
<li>March 13, I was approached by an anonymous editor to stop by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Dellums_f504.html" title="Ron Dellums">Ron Dellums</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=43593450&amp;oldid=43573179" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=43593450&amp;oldid=43573179" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There was no mention in the anonymous post made of <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:Justforasecond</a>. I did so, made a few edits and then decided to post the matter of JFAS's (and others') constant edit warring on the Admin Notice Board<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44204234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44204234" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. (Other intervention did not succeed in deterring JFAS, so the article currently is in a locked status. JFAS subsequently was blocked April 5 for his continuing conduct.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Justforasecond&amp;diff=47132792&amp;oldid=47099908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Justforasecond&amp;diff=47132792&amp;oldid=47099908" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>)</li>
<li>A few days later, I made the following post at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Talk%7ERon_Dellums_f409.html" title="Talk:Ron Dellums">Talk:Ron Dellums</a> directed at JFAS, informing him I had edited the existing version of the section dealing with Dellums' family and that his attacks on Dellums "would not be tolerated."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ron_Dellums&amp;diff=47949975&amp;oldid=47942849" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ron_Dellums&amp;diff=47949975&amp;oldid=47942849" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Note the date and time of the post: Revision as of 13:14, 11 April 2006.</li>
<li>At 18:28 that same day, JFAS moved to archive the old Afd for <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29_fabf.html" title="Cool (African philosophy)">Cool (African philosophy)</a> (the second or third attempt to obliterate this article, the last having been closed at the end of December -- incessant and ongoing)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47990576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47990576" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and immediately thereafter, at 18:31, opened up this latest attempt to erase it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47991004" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47991004" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>

<ul>
<li>No comment on the motivations behind the nomination, but there is an actual issue here that needs attention from experienced editors: Is the notion of a whole article on cool as an African philosophy an example of giving undue weight to one (or maybe more) academic(s)? We can all agree there's overlap between this article and <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>. If this is a POV fork of the former, it needs to be merged back in. However, I still don't think the Afd is a good idea- the important issue here is far better off being discussed on the talk pages, as has already been done here and there. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:05, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: How many months should an article and its contributors be given to add sources? <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 19:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> as long as it takes. If there is unverifiable information in the article -- as with any other, then delete that information. Let the article remain in that state -- with a stub or other tag appropriate to its condition -- until someone has the time and interest to improve it. I mean isn't that the way Wikipedia is <i>supposed</i> to work? (Duh.) And that's what's happened to the piece so far; whole chunks have been obliterated.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But it hasn't stopped there. This article has been under constant attack. This is the third or fourth attempt to obliterate it, the last effort concluding as late as the end of December. Here, the article has been attacked for lacking information I previously had inserted in the article, but which was hacked out of it!&#160;:p And there were subheads delineating the widely accepted components of the aesthetic that were left blank (as is done in <i>lots</i> of articles on this website), inviting input and further development as a means of helping to form a general framework for the piece. They, too, were deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The so-called "weaselwords" of the opening paragraph are a rewrite -- one I did not do. One of the people complaining about the condition of the piece did that. I left it as a concession. And, yeah. I, too, think the wording sux.&#160;:p</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Returning to the question, the fact is <i>no</i> article on Wikipedia should depend upon the time and attention of a single editor for its development. Nor should it be obliterated simply because no single editor has worked tirelessly on it. People grouse about the page. If they spent a <i>fraction</i> of the time, energy and attention <i>constructively</i> editing the piece (not just hacking away at it) and <i>contributing</i> information that they've so far spent complaining about it or, <i>ad seriatim</i>, trying to get it deleted, hell, it'd be a freaking featured article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Has anyone thought to put it up for article improvement, as is, I believe, fairly common practice around here when the desire is to improve an article? Has it been suggested for the project concentrating on articles treating Africa? Gosh. What a concept. The answer to both questions is no. Because beyond the criticism (some of it justified; I have <i>not</i> had the time or the inclination to concentrate on it) of the article itself, the hostility of detractors (as is evidenced by those who continue to focus on attack Thompson's unassailed scholarship completely without foundation, while completely ignoring the writings of others) has been directed toward the editor and/or the very subject itself. One of the primary detractors below has had the unmitigated gall to assert, "But many people don't recognize the [A]frican aesthetic as existing." Yet he so far has failed to produce a <i>single</i>, <i>learned</i> individual (biased opinions born of ignorance or animus don't count) who would make such an absurd and possibly racist statement. There is no doubt that indigenous African peoples, as with all other members of humanity, have aesthetic standards and belief systems. Further, there is ample evidence, and considerable scholarhip that supports, that there is, <i>indeed</i> a collective cool aesthetic commonly held across traditional, indigenous African societies that has far-reaching implications with regard to how individuals comport themselves, how they interact, that governs/mediates both everyday/pedestrian and artistic expression. That aesthetic merits an article -- just as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_aesthetics.html" title="Japanese aesthetics">Japanese aesthetics</a> merits one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article has <i>not</i> been treated the way other articles on the website generally are treated. The far more interesting and legitimate question that begs a proper answer here is, "<i>Why?</i>"&#160;:p <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 22:49, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Why?</i> Because it is a POV fork filled with OR. No one denies there are aesthetics in Africa (continent-wide aesthetics are in question), but this article is about the supposed African "philosophy" known as "Cool". <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">Justforasecond</a> 17:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If people want to add more on this version of "cool" into the main article, they can certainly do so, as long as they cite sources.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP!!!</b> See my comments on the discussion page, as well as the results of a proper Google search. I've reconsidered my position. I've tried to post this several times, but have been unable to do so. (Another instance of a collateral damage block; it happens to me <i>constantly</i>.) The two subjects are substantially different and both need space to be developed. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a> should continue to deal with the pop culture manifestations of "cool" with a nod to its African/African-American roots. As I mentioned on the talk page of Cool: (African philosophy), there are all sorts of possibilities for further development of <s>this</s> that piece -- an examination of the evolution of "cool" and the anti-hero (the "bad nigger," Stagga Lee, Iceberg Slim, Clint Eastwood's nameless drifter, etc.). I suggest it be renamed "Cool (pop culture aesthetic)." I suggest the other article be renamed "Cool (African aesthetic)." In the readings I've done, primarily Thompson and the academicians who quote him refer to it as a "philosophy." All others seem to refer to the same (or very similar)concepts elucidated by Thompson as an "aesthetic," which, frankly, seems more appropriate. (I utilized Thompson's terminology in setting up the "philosophy" article as a means of differentiating it from cool in the pop culture context.) I reiterate that Wikipedia has far too few articles dealing with Africa and African culture. Cool in the African cultural context is sufficiently complex that it merits an article of its own. Google "African cool aesthetic" and see what you come up with. There's ample information on the subject in an African context and in the African diaspora to fill an article without mention of Fonzie and social stratification and many of the, IMO, rather shallow, pop-culture manifestations of the phenomenon. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 21:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While Thompson's work (which actually includes several monographs) is the source of the term "philosophy" in connection w/cool, there is ample scholarship among academicians, anthropologists, art historians, etc., who write of an African cool "aesthetic." When I separated out the article from it pop culture stuff, I chose Thompson's terminology to diffrentiate the two, "aesthetic" from "philosophy." Further reading tells me the article is best titled "Cool (African aesthetic)," because "philosophy" has other connotations that see incongruous with the phenomenon and, indeed, somewhat antithetical to traditional African ways of being in/regarding the world. Whatever the article is called, there is a need to examine the phenomenon in its original and purest context, grounded in the cultural, existential, spiritual and moral framework that gave birth to it. And even if one <i>completely disagrees</i> that African cool and pop culture cool are even <i>remotely</i> connected at all, the subject still would merit an article -- because of cool's far-reaching influence in African the plastic and performance arts, interpersonal relationships, notions of propriety, comportment and spiritual centeredness. It is a cultural ethos at the heart of the indigenous African psyche/identity. It remains clearly in evidence today in the Motherland and, certainly in the Caribbean and the Americas. And there is scholarship supporting that fact. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 15:35, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b></dd>
<dd>Sorry, but that's about the most absurd comment yet. I have no objection whatsoever to the Fonz being on the page. The character is a perfect example of pop-culture cool. After all, it'd be pretty silly to contend that "cool" has been assimilated into mainstream American culture and then object to images that support that fact. My point -- again -- is that, with this vote, many are, in effect, saying that an article on cool as a legitimate, indigenous cultural ethos that is an underlying value in African society with regard to personal comportment, interpersonal relations, functional art, music, dance, etc., has no inherent value. And that most certainly is not the case. Cool in the African context would merit an article had there been no trans-Atlantic slave trade and no consequent infusion into American popular culture. It is complex, with pervasive implications in virtually all forms of indigenous African cultural expression. There is ample information about cool in African culture that is clearly not POV; it is the result of scholarly inquiry and rigorous research. Some of those sources have been provided on the talk page. The contentious subject is, in fact, pop-culture cool -- which, does not render an examination of cool in traditional African societies or in the African diaspora POV or superfluous. Quite the contrary. Further, an examination of pop-culture cool in its various permutations and disparate meanings is not critical to an examination of African cool. Far from it. If anything, the parent article to one on pop-culture cool should be one treating the African cool aesthetic. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 13:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. While the article needs work, there is nothing here that qualifies for deletion. I also object to any attempt to "discount" the two speedy keeps because their objections are to the reasons this article was brought up for deletion. That is a valid reason for objecting.

<dd>Well, from the discussion, the mergers and deleters are saying many of the same things: As an insufficiently verifiable, POV fork article, it should not exist on it's own. But, sure, this isn't easy. I hope the discussion runs long enough for a rough consensus to form and whoever closes this actually <i>reads</i> it rather than looking at the long discussion and slapping a "no consensus" on it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the consensus is not that its a POV fork and I find your comment that it is "irresponsible of any admin to keep it," made after asking me to reconsider my vote, insulting. The article needs a lot of work but it is a valid article. In addition, Robert F. Thompson's article is extremely well known and has been reprinted in a number of places (for example, here <a href="http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo/reviews/may2005/rise_mosher.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo/reviews/may2005/rise_mosher.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013912733X/002-5564636-5931208?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013912733X/002-5564636-5931208?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). The problem with this article is that instead of actually seeking consensus a small number of editors ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE continually attack each other's assertions. As for more references to prove the validity of this subject, try these:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Healing Wisdom of Africa</i> by Malidoma Patrice Some, Tarcher, 1999, pages 191-92, where it says, "...people show admirable dexterity in appearing cool." The text refers to the African cultural concept of appearing perfectly in control even when adrift in confusion.</li>
<li><i>Cool Pose&#160;: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America</i> by Richard Majors, Janet Mancini Billson, Touchstone; 1993, page 57, where it states, "John Janzen dates the phenomenon of cool in Africa back to at least 2000-3000 B.c." The book also has a section on the "The Roots of Cool in African Culture," which can be read online at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0671865722/ref=sib_vae_pg_57/002-5564636-5931208?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=africa%20cool&amp;p=S023&amp;twc=6&amp;checkSum=yLQMfcFiIgmrRQuRBQokArqErXJtJj4a0ubK%2BNhoGyo%3D#reader-page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0671865722/ref=sib_vae_pg_57/002-5564636-5931208?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=africa%20cool&amp;p=S023&amp;twc=6&amp;checkSum=yLQMfcFiIgmrRQuRBQokArqErXJtJj4a0ubK%2BNhoGyo%3D#reader-page" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (log-in to Amazon.com required).</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I need to go on? This is a subject that is in the academic literature. Based on just a few minutes research I pulled up these two additional references and there are more out there.

<dd>That's just ridiculous. The article is <i>about</i> the cool aesthetic in the African context -- as is made clear by the article's title. There is no doubt that cool in the African context is a cultural ethos indigenous to Africa. You're making an argument that is clearly inappropriate to this article; it belongs in <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 21:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then rename the article <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_aesthetic%29_f096.html" title="Cool (African aesthetic)">Cool (African aesthetic)</a> since it sounds like the word philosophy is what everyone is hung up on. If, as <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> admits, this is a recognized "existant theory" then there is no reason to delete the article. Instead, rename it. That seems like a good way to achieve consensus. I also repeat my statement that EVERYONE who has been arguing about this article for the last few months seems to be way too caught up in it. Perhaps arbitration is needed. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 21:52, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even should there be something justicable here, this matter would, I think, be seen by the ArbComm as altogether inappropriate for arbitration; surely mediation or RfC apropos of the preferred title would, should the article be kept, be better. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, Alabamaboy, the appropriate title would be Cool (African aesthetic theory). The title <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_aesthetic%29_f096.html" title="Cool (African aesthetic)">Cool (African aesthetic)</a> implies that those scholars are correct; when, of course, noone can be <i>verifiably correct</i> about a subjective aesthetic.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:15, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool (African aesthetic theory) would be fine with me. And yes, mediation would probably be better than arbitration (I should have said that to start with). What amazes me, though, are the endless round and round arguments so many people have been having about the minutia of this article, both on this discussion and the article's talk page. Almost reminds me of items on the list of <a href="../../../l/a/m/Wikipedia%7ELamest_edit_wars_ever_e4b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Lamest edit wars ever">lamest edit wars ever</a>. Notice I said almost.

<dd>Absolutely not! Cool is not a "theory"; it is a clearly identifiable aesthetic in African societies/cultures. How and why is such a subject in an African context somehow not as real, not as substantial as similar phenomena in a European/neo-European (white) context? This is clearly an intolerable, utterly nonsensical double standard that will not be tolerated. Unless and until all articles treating <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetic_relativism.html" title="Aesthetic relativism">aesthetic relativism</a> and similar subjects have "theory" tacked onto them (e.g., "Aesthetic relativism (theory)," even articles treating other non-concrete matters such as "Physics (theory)," "Psychology (theory)," "Prayer (theory)," "Religion (theory)"), then <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_aesthetic%29_f096.html" title="Cool (African aesthetic)">Cool (African aesthetic)</a> is perfectly and imminently appropriate/valid. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 07:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is faulty logic. Athiests know prayer exists; they know religion exists. Anti-psychologists recognize the existence of psychology. But many people don't recognize the african aesthetic as existing. The people from that college put it perfectly: "seminal ideas have to start somewhere."

<dd>False. Cite <i>one informed person</i> who says there is no such African aesthetic. And "many"? Who are the "many"? I've provided a number of sources referring to a generalized African aesthetic that exists across nations, across tribal groupings. How 'bout you find <i>half</i> that number? In fact, what people on the face of the earth do <i>not</i> have an aesthetic sense/aesthetic standards? Are you telling me that African societies are somehow exempt from the rest of humanity in this regard?

<dd>You haven't responded to my challenge. "But many [emphasis added] people don't recognize the african aesthetic as existing." Find a knowledgeable, informed source who denies the existence of such an aesthetic -- and on what ground(s). And then find me <i>half</i> as many who take that ridiculous position as the number of sources who maintain that African peoples, like the rest of humanity are capable of, and, indeed, do, have aesthetic sensibilities, and that many elements are held in common among certain societies.

Here is what she wrote, in part: <i>I skimmed the debate at the Wikipedia website, following the link you provided. Since I'm just embarking on my own research into the concept, I can't offer the kind of definitive sourcing you need.</i></code> The bottom line is, that neither Deeceevoice, nor Jacqueline Goldsby who is researching the concept, are able to offer any other sources than Thompson. This article was already renamed 4 times in an attempt to find a title that fits DCV'S original research. That's not how an encyclopedia works. I concur with Zoe: An article on Thompson's book would be acceptable, but this is a POV fork article on a philosophy which isn't verifiable. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 13:16, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find it exceedingly telling what CoYep <i>doesn't</i> report of my e-mail exchange with Professor Goldsby. She writes:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><b>I'm struck that the contributors to the debate are so hostile toward Robert Farris Thompson's discussion of "coolness" in Flash of the Spirit. That book is recognized by scholars as *the* definitive treatment of African-derived art forms and practices across the diaspora. Thompson's credentials are impeccable, as is his scholarship. It's specious for your opponents to dismiss the idea of "cool"'s Africanist origins simply because only one (English-language) text addresses it. That's often the case in scholarship. After all, seminal ideas have to start somewhere.</b></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>And while Goldsby refers to "that book," Thompson has written <i>several</i> celebrated and acclaimed monographs addressing African aesthetics and the aesthetics of African cool on the African continent and in the African diaspora, as well.</dd>
<dd>CoYep's contention is absurd on its face. I've offered <i>several</i> such sources on the discussion page. Many of the sources which CoYepu attempted to debunk, discount or flat-out mischaracterize still stand, as any quick perusal of the discussion page readily will reveal. Further -- again -- Thompson's works on African art and African cultural aesthetics are seminal in the field, accepted and respected -- as they have been for more than 40 years. And the contention that the article is a "POV" fork is specious and an obvious red herring. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 13:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. It is apparently <i>you</i> who fail to grasp the scope and breadth of Thompson's scholarship. I don't know how many times one must state the facts.

I myself been acquaintaed with his work and reputation as a well-known authority in the field since 1974. Wikipedians seem to be just about the <i>only</i> people who <i>claim</i> to know anything about the subject who don't seem to know anything about the man.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Actually, IMO, no. The article addresses only the aspects of African-Amerian culture that are expressions of the African aesthetic of cool. There are other clear expressions of this aesthetic in the African diaspora, as well -- in Caribbean and Brazilian cultures, specifically, where the imprint of Africa remains more pronounced -- which the article has yet to treat. But there are, indeed, manifestations that have become part of the pop-culture cool aesthetic, such as male machismo (which, though grounded in African cool, is not part of it). It is a product of the African-American experience and a survival response to slavery, oppression, etc. These "mutated" or descendant forms of cool more properly belong in an article treating African-American culture -- or, to the extent to which such expressions have been assimilated across ethnicities into mainstream American/pop culture (in the case of cool machismo, in bad-boy/anti-hero personas and archetypes) even better, into an article on "Cool (pop-culture aesthetic)" -- the "Cool (aesthetic)" article renamed. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:08, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Acknowledged. I still don't think the article is distinctive enough from Cool (aesthetic) or other pop culture/African American articles. It's well written, though, and it's worth keeping the copytext. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 12:30, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's actually because the text introducing/delineating the elements of African cool was deleted, along with subheads where the information had yet to be written. The basic framework of the article was gutted months ago. There isn't sufficient information remaining in the article to help people understand that point. But the sources I've provided above do allude to those elements -- if you're interested in checking them out. And much of it is really distinct from and more meaningful than the pop culture phenomena/expressions of cool. A merge of the two articles is basically saying the underlying cultural aesthetics of much of black Africa do not merit a separate article -- when that certainly is not the case. The concepts and values involved and their myriad forms of expression throughout portions of Africa and the African diaspora are certainly complex enough to need that kind of space and separation to be detailed and explained.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:46, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
