<p>I don't see why <b>everyone</b> is reacting so badly to this article. "Women's Logic" is a term, it is a noun just like "encyclopedia" or "the internet". If you google the term, beyond some joke pages made to ridicule women, you will find serious discussions on how women and men in general approach situations differently. There are entire businesses which sell products catered to help men understand "Women's Logic" so that Men can become more successful with Women; Women's Logic is a thing which evidently most men don't understand. <a href="http://www.alovelinksplus.com/advice/the_dating_wizard/understanding_womens_logic.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.alovelinksplus.com/advice/the_dating_wizard/understanding_womens_logic.htm" rel="nofollow">The Dating Wizard: Understanding Women's Logic</a>. I wasn't trying to be rude or sexist, I started this article to try and bridge the gap between the male understanding of the world and the female's understanding of the world. Evidently, since most people refer the world as a man's world, there is a large disparity between the sexes. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_Differences_1fda.html" title="Gender Differences">Gender Differences</a> primarily focuses on physcial differences this article could focus on mental differences between the sexes. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelendin_c15f.html" title="User:Celendin">Celendin</a> 10:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an implication that irrational behaviour is a function of faulty logic. It's not. Women know perfectly well when they are being illogical, just the same as men. Why a man or woman might <i>choose</i> to behave illogically, and why that behaviour might be successful, is something completely different. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 10:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that is not really a reason to delete the article. The implication of "faulty logic" is a POV shared by many men, but it isn't really a reason why we shouldn't describe "Women's Logic."
<ul>
<li>Try this, then. Wikipedia isn't a blog, a bulletin board or a soapbox. (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) This rambling entry doesn't belong in a factual encyclopedia. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By creating an article solely about women you’ll assuming that being a man is natural and that women are an oddity. A nearly %50-%50 split in birth rates doesn't support this. Your also assuming that male psychology is easy to see and trivial.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You uncritically accept Ancient Greek views of women. The ‘Women's Logic applied to Dating doesn't fit with hard research into hunter gatherers. You also say most women would support Mede killing her children but offer no support.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The article isn't even about <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>, it's about motivations and behaviour. There are plenty of articles covering gender-based differences. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 11:17, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There may be several pages where bits and pieces of this material might be merged to: no doubt references for most of these beliefs are out there. But <i>this</i> article seems a blunderbuss shot of pop-culture clichés about the difference between the sexes, assembled under a silly title. That would seem to make it original research. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, there is a bit of worthwhile content here, once it is described as a POV and not simply asserted as a fact, but it belongs in other articles. One might as well write an article about "Men's Logic". --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 15:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The phrase "help men understand 'Women's Logic' so that Men can become more successful with Women" is offensively sexist. If you don't understand why, you won't understand why I'm voting <b>Delete with prejudice</b>. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:57, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In fairness, I think Celendin was arguing that this organizations which purport to describe "women's logic" are examples of a phenomenon which exists and therefore merits an article, not that thie article should itself help men become more successful with women. On the other hand, the article was not written with that sort of distance from the subject in mind. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 19:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The title and subject of this article are inherently biased. You can’t talk about women’s logic with out comparing them to men. I'd say merge with Sexual differentiation if there was anything accurate worth merging. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeano1_3dfb.html" title="User:Seano1">Seano1</a> 01:14, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not changing my delete vote, but I think the pendulum has come a bit too far here. Certainly this article is biased and absurd, but the phenomenon it is attempting to describe -- that many men today regard women as having a unique and irrational style of reasoning -- is a real one, and does deserve to be mentioned somewhere. This idea is the reason for the success of garbage like <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_Are_from_Mars%2C_Women_Are_from_Venus_6a1a.html" title="Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus">Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</a></i>. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 19:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
