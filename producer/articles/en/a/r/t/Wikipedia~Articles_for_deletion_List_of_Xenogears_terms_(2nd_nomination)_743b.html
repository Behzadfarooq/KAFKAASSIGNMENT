<li><b>Keep</b> much more useful as one article/list than spread out over dozens of articles. As for the "list of definitions" reasoning, we have many of those: see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">List of glossaries</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Category%7EGlossaries_5e13.html" title="Category:Glossaries">Category:Glossaries</a> for a start. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:22, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I've seen those. We shouldn't have them. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:29, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia isn't a list of definitions, but in some cases, a list of definitions can be useful to Wikipedia. It is far better to have a list of terms that can be linked to than having to define each term in every single article on the subject repeatedly. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 23:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Regardless of how useful or not this might be, it appears to be verified and, important to me, already survived an afd nomination previously. Unless something significant has changed since then, I don't like the idea of renominating articles that already have been discussed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Transwiki</b> I'm a fence sitter on the need for inclusion of "Glossary" articles in Wikipedia. I personally think they would be better in Wikibooks, Wiktionary, and the like. But some of them are ok. Wikipedia, in general, is supposed to be about writing "Beautiful prose" Making a glossary is the weasel way out of it. It's also just a long re-statement of plot terms. (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>) And to top it off, I don't see a single in-line citation in the entire thing. Helpful? Yes, maybe to some. But helpful isn't a reason for inclusion in the wikipedia. This would be a great addition Wikibooks or a Xenosaga wikia. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 01:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is a list of definitions, many which are nonessential to understanding the basic plot. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 03:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep. If the article it is linked to is about a real topic--it is--then placing the glossary here simply extends the article without overrunning the size limitations. I do not see why this is a problem. I think that calling it names like "a weasel way out" is simply foisting a denigrating lexicon onto the attempt at coherence for the article--not an argument so much as failure to have an argument and resorting to abuse. I do not mean that to be insulting, I am just saying it is the old ad hominem trap that we all fall into from time to time. The article itself is about a very complicated text and the glossary serves the purpose of supporting it well.</li>

<p>Let's try this again and see if people can resist the temptation to vandalise my contribution by placing it where it was never intended to go. And let's see if the the person or persons who have decided they own Wikipedia can keep their incoherent blathering to themselves.</p>

<p>This is just an observation--I am still going through this stuff and some of it is mind-numbingly off the wall--but to some extent this entire section comprises a real treasure--at least it will be in a generation or two. It chronicles many aspects of pop cutlure. Albeit not very well in some cases but if we had this sort of collection of articles on say, 13th century England, it would be highly valued. I am just saying, before completely deleting all of any article, ask yourself what would it signify to a reader who will not be born for another 20 years. So, careful with the broad strokes. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 02:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Still, this is a deviation from the standard AFD formatting and has already caused comments to be added to this subheading. It also gives undue visual weight to your opinions on the subject.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

Hardly any of these terms are of value to non-players (in which case the main article should cover them anyway), and even those that are can be better understood from the manual/guide/review/game/llama/etc. Let's make it very simple: if these terms are extremely notable give them their own articles; if not, mention them in the main article; if not notable enough even for that, <i>get them off the <s>plane</s> wiki</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 02:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, they aren't permitted, since glossaries are lists of definitions, which is something specifically excluded by [{WP:NOT]].
