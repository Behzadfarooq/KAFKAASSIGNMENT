<p>Chen Guangdong (陈光诚) has been named one of Time Magazine's 100 most Influential People in their May 8, 2006 Special Edition. Born in 1971 in the rural Chinese province of Shandong, he became blind at the age of one after falling ill with a high fever. Prior to attending the Linyi Primary School for the Blind and then the Qingdao School for the Blind, he was home-schooled. Since he was unable to obtain a college degree at the time, he audited law classes and taught himself to be a lawyer. Since 1996, he has provided legal advice and has run many human rights organizations, such as the “Rights Defense Project for the Disabled."</p>
<p>He is most notable for his investigation into the use of violence to uphold China's family-planning policies by local government officials. His investigation, which began in April 2005 in Linyi City in his home province of Shandong, uncovered numerous violations of human rights. Since March of that year, raids on homes with two children had been performed by local officials. In these families, the officials demanded at least one of the parents be sterilized. Pregnant women were forced to have abortions, even up to 8 months into their pregnancy. Families who fled had their relatives arrested and abused. Reports of as many as 13,000 underwent coerced sterilizations or abortions and as many as 50,000 were detained, interrogated, and fined during the course of the campaign. In response to these infringements on citizen's rights, Chen filed lawsuits for the villagers in the Yinan County People's Court. After collecting testimonies and preparing the cases with the help of activists and lawyers from outside of Linyi, the lawsuits were scheduled to be heard in court during October 2005, but the court date has been postponed indefinitely. His work also lead to an official response from the National Population and Family Planning Committee, who said that state law and policy had been broken in Linyi and the local officials face criminal charges. This statement was made on September 19, 2005, and though some officials have been dismissed from their posts, only one official has been detained for investigation.</p>
<p>On September 6, 2005, Chen was taken from a friend's home in Beijing by public-securtiy agents from Shandong. He was brought back to Linyi and placed under house arrest the following day. Both he and his wife, Yuan Weijing, were prevented from leaving thier home. All communication to the outside world was removed, and visitors have been prohibited, some by the use of violence, from meeting with Chen. During his detention, no official order for residential survelliance was issued by the Chinese government, leaving the legality of his holding in question. Reports also say he has also been subjected to numerous beating by guards, sometimes with the encouragement of local government officials.</p>
<p>Time reports that in March 2006, police arrived and removed Chen from his home. His whereabouts remain unknown at this time.</p>

<p>This is an idiomatic expression in English, the gist of which is that one (particularly one in the position of a neophyte) should not presume to offer advice to an expert.</p>
<p>In most circumstances, the neophyte means no offense by this, but it can seem disrespectful of the time spent by the expert learning his field.</p>

<p>The University of Sheffield is a well respected UK university in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, South Yorkshire in Northern England. It appears in the Russel Group of top UK Universities.</p>
<p>The Origins of the Medical School go back to 1828, when the Sheffield School of Medicine was founded. It merged with Firth College (1879), forerunner of the University, and Sheffield Technical School (1884) to form University College Sheffield in 1897. The University of Sheffield was granted a Royal Charter in May 1905.</p>
<p>Today, the School of Medicine is based on the site of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Hallamshire_Hospital_e69d.html" title="Royal Hallamshire Hospital">Royal Hallamshire Hospital</a> and teaches over 1000 undergraduate students. The school offers a 5 year course (UCAS Code: A106) or 6 year course with a premedical year (A104) leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB ChB). The school also offers the chance for students to intercalate for one year leading to the additional degree of Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSci(Hons)).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The course is divided into 4 Phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1 covers the core medical sciences and follows a systems based approach. There is emphasis on Integrated Learning Activities with plenty of clinical contact. Phase 1 lasts for 2 years. At the end of each year students sit EMQ written papers and also sit OSCE-style exams in anatomy and basic clinical skills.</p>
<p>Phase 2 teaches Basic Clinical Competence. Students are placed in a central hospital (<a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Hallamshire_Hospital_e69d.html" title="Royal Hallamshire Hospital">Royal Hallamshire Hospital</a> or the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_General_Hospital_52d6.html" title="Northern General Hospital">Northern General Hospital</a>) for 7 weeks and a District General for 7 weeks. During this time they will be attached to medical and surgical teaching teams and taught how to take histories and examine patients. Phase 2 lasts for 6 months and is assessed with an OSCE.</p>
<p>Phase 3 teaches Clinical Competence and Medical Specialties. During the first year (Phase 3a), students undertake placements in Womens Health, Mental Health, Child Health, General Practice and Public Health and Neurology. During the second year (Phase 3b), Students are again attached to GP practices, in addition to rotating through medical specialties such as Dermatology, A&amp;E, Anaesthetics, Orthopaedics, Urology, Palliative Care, Oncology, Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>
<p>At the end of Phase 3a, Students sit an OSCE examination and a EMQ written exam. Phase 3b students sit MEQ and EMQ written papers.</p>
<p>Phase 4 is the final component of the course and teaches Advanced Clinical Competence. There are 2 placements, both lasting 7 weeks. One placement is undertaken in a Sheffield Hospital, the other in a District General (Barnsley District General Hospital, Rotherham General Hospital, Bassetlaw Hospital, Chesterfield Royal Hospital, <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_Royal_Infirmary_e8cc.html" title="Hull Royal Infirmary">Hull Royal Infirmary</a>, Diana Princess of Wales Hospital, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>). At the end of Phase 4, students take the final OSCE examination and a clinical written paper.</p>

<p>The St. Louis Cardinals’ right-handed ace pitcher Chris Carpenter is a native of Exeter, New Hampshire. He graduated from Trinity High School in 1993, where he earned Athlete-of-the-Year honors when he was a senior. Carpenter also captured the state championship in baseball in 1992.</p>
<p>Chris began his professional career in May 1997 with the Toronto Blue Jays, earning a spot in the starting rotation by July of that summer. He played well for two years, winning 49 games before becoming plagued with injuries, including a bone spur in his elbow, nerve damage in his right biceps and tendonitis in his shoulder. He would rehab over the next few years, bouncing back only slightly between injuries.</p>
<p>By December of 2002, Carpenter signed a one year, one million dollar contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. He missed most of the 2002 and 2003 seasons after having two shoulder operations; then rebounded in 2004 only to be sidelined with an injury in the post season. He was the Cardinals’ best pitcher during the regular season, with a record of 15-5 and a 3.46 ERA, but didn’t recover in time to pitch in the 2004 World Series against the Red Sox.</p>
<p>Chris is known for his 92-93 mile per hour fastball, a sweeping curve ball, a cutter and a changeup. His curve ball makes hitters freeze in their tracks. Carpenter was the starting pitcher for the Cardinals' Opening Day in April of 2005.</p>
<p>Carpenter currently resides in Bedford with his wife Alyson, and a son, Sam.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-06_70b6.html" title="Edit section: Shovelhead">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shovelhead</span></h2>
<p>The term "Shovelhead" refers to the engine type used in Harley Davidson Big Twin motorcycles between 1966 and 1984 (though some motorcycles were made in 1985 with engines lying around from the previous year to satisfy existing contracts). Looking down at the rocker box from the top, the box resembles the head of a shovel. By extension, the term Shovelhead is also used to refer to a motorcycle built with such an engine.</p>
<p>There are actually two types of Shovelhead engines - the first being the flat-side or "slap-side" model from 1966 through to 1969, in which the crankcases were the same as the previous engine type including a generator, like the Panhead, and from 1970 through 1984 redesigned crankcases were used having a nose-cone and an alternator with a rectifier.</p>
<p>Until the early half of 1978, the Shovelhead was a 74 cubic inch (1200 cc) engine. During the latter half of 1978 the size of the engine was upped to 80 cubic inches (1340 cc) to compensate for horsepower lost due to restrictions imposed on the engine mandated by EPA requirements.</p>
<p>Like all other Harley Davidson engines, the Shovelheads use pushrods to raise the rocker arms and open the valves. The oiling system pushes oil up and into the rear rocker box via an oil line, after which the oil crosses over into the front cylinder via another oil line joining the rear and front rocker boxes. Given that this means it takes a while for oil to get to the front cylinder, a useful modification is to replace these lines with a T-shaped line running oil into both rocker boxes at the same time, blocking off the rear input line with a plug or bolt.</p>
<p>The pistons inside the Shovelhead engine are not flat but instead wedge shaped. In the later Evolution engine, a flat piston with a redesigned head was used. This was a less efficient design than the later flat piston - to compensate, common modifications included "porting" the heads, namely removing material with a die grinder to achieve a more efficient combustion chamber, and "dual plugging" - namely drilling and tapping another spark plug into each cylinder head, and firing two spark plugs at the same time for a more efficient and cleaner burn.</p>
<p>Cosmetically, common modifications included "splitting" the heads - namely using a mill or other tool to cut the rocker boxes in half down the middle (requiring changes to the oiling system) and using rocker box nuts from or modelled after the Knucklehead engine to augment the look of the rocker box.</p>
<p>The Sportster engines from the same period have rocker boxes which roughly resemble the Shovelhead ones - yet the proper nomenclature for these is "Ironhead". There are material and design differences between the two, making the distinction necessary.</p>
<p>The Shovelhead has a distinctive sound and look and is prized amongst some collectors. It represented a leap in quality and reliability from the Panhead engine, yet is more user friendly (for example, you don't have to remove the heads in order to adjust the pushrods) than the later Evolution engine (though this newer engine incorporated significant improvements such as oiling through the pushrods, a more efficient head, etc.) making it a nice compromise between later and more efficient engines and earlier, simpler designs.</p>
<p>Companies such as Accu-rate Engineering and S&amp;S Cycle make reproductions of the Shovelhead engine, and the design is common in "Bike build-off" programs on television when the designer wants a retro look to the machine.</p>
<p>Shovelheads in film include the motorcycle stolen by the Marlboro Man in "Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man" and the motorcycle ridden by Christian Slater in "Heathers".</p>

<p>The initiation of the child to solid food is known as Annaprasan. Food is first offered to God. Then the paternal grandmother mixes rice and milk in a silver bowl and feeds the child. Then a book, gold chain, pen and a knife are placed on a small wooden table. The child is then left free 15 yards away from the table. As the child moves towards the table, he or she is believed to become associated with whichever of the four articles that he or she touches.</p>
<p>The qualities attributed to the four articles are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pen - Academician, Writer, Scholar</li>

<p>The initiation of a child into the formal learning process is usually done between the 3rd and the 5th year of the child. A priest is asked to preside over the ceremonies. The child participates in the Saraswati pooja as the priest recites the mantras. The child is then made to write the first two alphabets and is guided by the father in doing this. Children of the same age group, and the child's friends are invited for lunch on this occasion. Sometimes the teacher of the school where the child would be educated is also invited and gifts are given. The children are gifted with slates and chalk, and shloka and poetry books</p>

<li>Dandi - Wooden stick.</li>
<li>Thread for Yagyopaveet, which should be dyed yellow.</li>
<li>New clothes to be worn by the persons performing the ritual.</li>
<li>The Veda, which signifies knowledge. If the Veda is not available, any other holy book should be wrapped up in a cloth and should be kept on a raised pedestal.</li>

<p>Upanayanam or the sacred thread ceremony is performed for the male child at the age of seven years (if this is not possible then in any odd year). This is when the boy is initiated into the <i>Gayatri Mantra</i>. The upnayanam ceremony in modern practice is performed just before marriage. Traditionally it was a long ceremony with elaborate rituals:</p>
<p>It is one of the most important rituals in a Hindu's life. Shikha or choti and sutra or janeu, are two of the most important symbols on a Hindu male in particular. <i>Shikha</i> is symbol of faith, and <i>Yagyopaveet</i> is a symbol of the righteous path. This event signified the entry of the male into <i>Brahmacharya,</i> the commencement of his life as a true student at the ashram of the guru. It thus signifies an entry into a state of disciplined existence.</p>

<p>Identifying the Special Clothing Needs of Severely Wounded Service Men and Women: A growing need for adaptive clothing developed in the post 9/11/01 world, as American military men and women serve in a variety of dangerous situations and locations, most notably in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each week, an average of twenty new patients arrives in the United States or Germany for extensive medical treatment for bullet and shrapnel wounds, burns, head and limb injuries and amputations, while tens of thousands are still in the recovery process. These medical conditions require large fixators, prosthetics, and casts that are too bulky to fit under ordinary clothing or underwear. Sew Much Comfort is the only organization providing adaptive clothing in large volumes to meet these special needs.</p>
<p>The Sew Much Comfort Project to Provide Adaptive Clothing: Since the Sew Much Comfort organization began in December 2004, our mission has been to provide as many of the wounded as possible with adaptive wardrobes that accommodate medical devises, hospital environments, and life situations faced during and after their recuperation process. Within it’s first year, more than 9000 items of adaptive clothing have been donated, and hundreds more are created and distributed each month to more than a dozen military hospitals and field installations in the United States, Germany, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait.</p>
<p>Sew Much Comfort has 500 volunteers operating in communities across the United States, and volunteers operating in Landstuhl, Germany. We recruit new volunteers each month from around the country, thanks in part to national media coverage (NBC Nightly News on April 14, 2006: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12303651/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12303651/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12303651/</a>, NBC video), on-line civilian and military-affiliated articles about our mission and our volunteers, and visitors to our own website, sewmuchcomfort.org. Volunteers participate in a range of activities that support our mission and improve the lives of wounded troops: clothing design and creation, business, personnel, and website management, hospital visitation, fundraising, and community outreach.</p>

<p>sourced from a website needs editing to not enfrindge copyright but this provides a starting point:</p>
<p>The Roth test - from Roth v. U.S. 354 US 476 (1957) defined obscenity as material calculated to debauch the minds and morals of those in whose hands it might fall. The impact upon the average person must be determined. The test is the effect of a whole work (not one picture or passage) on the average person applying contemporary community standards (not national standards) to determine if the work is without redeeming social importance or patently offensive. If an idea has "redeeming social importance," however, it is protected, and this would include unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, and even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of public opinion. Obscenity does not rise to the level of redeeming social importance because it "deals with sex in a manner appealing to the prurient interest" (Justice Brennan, writing for the majority). Sex and obscenity are not synonymous, however. Prurient interest, at least according to Webster's New International Dictionary (1949) is defined as "material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts...an itching, longing, uneasiness with desire or longing, having morbid or lascivious longings, of desire, curiosity, or propensity, lewd...a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion." The Roth test was the standard for 16 years, but it underwent some modification and refinement. In other words, anything that has the slightest redeeming social importance is protected by the First Amendment, and thereby not obscene. Turned around, in a criminal prosecution, the jury would be instructed to acquit the defendant absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged material was utterly without redeeming social importance. Accordingly, while rejecting First Amendment protection for obscenity, Roth erected a remarkable barrier to prosecution, at least considering the era and the state of the law a year before then.<br />
Finally, in the majority opinion, Justice William Brennan - who 16 years later in Miller v. California would recognize his mistake - rejected the argument that this definition was too imprecise to comply with the Due Process Clause. Indeed, Justice Brennan's struggle with obscenity is a story in itself.<br /></p>
<p>Was Roth a victory or a defeat for erotica? Certainly there is a good argument to be made that stripping obscene speech from First Amendment protection was a defeat. But consider the time and the circumstances. The Court - under fire from many quarters because it had shocked the South three years earlier by ordering integration in all public facilities, including schools - took a bold step in these cases in rejecting Hicklin. Where only adults were involved, a jury must resolve vague issues of community standards and must acquit upon a reasonable doubt as to whether the materials were utterly without redeeming social importance. Roth established a barrier to prosecution. But before Roth, the marketing could have been stopped cold.</p>

<p>5/4/2004</p>
<p>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia is an Anxiety Disorder (DSM Axis 1). It may be diagnosed for individuals that suffer from reoccurring Panic Attacks associated with Agoraphobia.</p>
<p>Individuals that are diagnosed with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia have a persistent concern\fear of the consequences of having a panic attack (such as, not having the appropriate medial attention to help them or fear of being humiliated in public while suffering a panic attack) and must have experienced a panic attack before. This disorder is associated with multiple physiological factors but should not be confused with any other mental disorders (social phobia, posttraumatic disorder, etc).</p>
<p><br />
According to Behave.net the Diagnostic criteria for Pain Disorder with Agoraphobia are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Both (1) and (2): (1) recurrent unexpected Panic Attacks (2) at least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one (or more) of the following: (a) persistent concern about having additional attacks (b) worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going crazy") (c) a significant change in behavior related to the attacks B. The presence of Agoraphobia. C. The Panic Attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). D. The Panic Attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, such as Social Phobia (e.g., occurring on exposure to feared social situations), Specific Phobia (e.g., on exposure to a specific phobic situation), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (e.g., on exposure to dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (e.g., in response to stimuli associated with a severe stressor), or Separation Anxiety Disorder (e.g., in response to being away from home or close relatives).</p>

<p>&lt;Chika Sylva-Olejeme born 22 October 1968 is President of the International Peace Institute he an international speaker and motivator.</p>
<p>Sylva-Olejeme came into prominence by his idea to build a world of peace and progress though informal Diplomacy, he is also well known for his idea of attempting to achieving peace in the mind of men by applying the concept of God as a formula for peace. He has traveled extensively around the world trying to “evangelize power structures of the World”</p>
<p>Sylva-Olejeme is an extraordinary theist , according to him the concept of God is the imagination that “God” is creator of the Universe and that man is God’s representative on earth; he tends to be more concerned with what the concept stands to provide for humanity than the myth of it.</p>
<p>Sylva-Olejeme claims that there can be a harmony between theist and atheist and a harmony between science and the concept of God</p>
<p><br />
extract of speech of Chika Sylva-Olejeme to the Diplomatic community in Britain 15th May 2006</p>
<p><br />
We are concerned about the beliefs of all human beings and we are happy if their beliefs promote peace and progress.</p>
<p><br />
It is our desire that all the nations of the world share in this view of respecting beliefs. In this new world Nations are judged not by their economic or military strength but by the wellbeing of their people and the protection afforded to the growing minds and bodies of their children.</p>
<p>For us the greatest philosophy of all is the concept that God is formless, that He made human beings formless, that He gave them form and gave them authority over form (reference from Genesis chapter 1).</p>
<p>The concept identifies with the millions of world people who believe in God in the bible as well as the millions who does not believe in God because of their consideration that God is formless or non-existent, we also have a lot of questions answered by seeing human beings as having authority over form, i.e. over everything that is and exists.</p>

<p>Illegal Immigration Will only Get You a Slap on the Wrist</p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Sherman N. Miller</p>
<p><br />
As I watched the big demonstrations of illegal immigrants, with many people waving foreign flags, I shudder to think that today’s illegal aliens may make a quantum leap over today’s outcaste US citizens in America’s Economic Mainstream.</p>
<p>If I break into someone’s home and become a squatter, do you think the police will give me a mere slap on the wrist or will I find myself facing a felony conviction? Today the felony conviction is as potent as yesteryear’s segregation laws at denying full citizenship rights to many black Americans living in inner cities. The felony conviction may preclude one from getting many good jobs, as in the banking industry, and one may lose her or his voting rights. I label many native black Americans who possess a felony conviction on their record as domestic aliens for they may have a permanent glass ceiling placed upon their upward mobility.</p>
<p>My dander rose while reading a report on comments of the leadership of the US House of Representatives and US Senate in the April 12, 2006 Wall Street Journal. WSJ reported, “Frist and Hastert said a day after immigrant protests they won’t seek felony prosecutions of illegal aliens, but didn’t rule out lesser penalties.” This statement suggests that these US Congressional leaders don’t have an appreciation for the forces driving the massive illegal immigration problems and are doomed to exacerbate the current crisis by pussyfooting on addressing the issue.</p>
<p>In reading an EH.Net Encyclopedia article, Immigration to the United States, by Raymond L. Cohn of Illinois State University, I found it very difficult to believe our congressional leadership is ready to ignore the long-term impact of an expedient immigration decision today. Cohn writes, “. . . a larger volume of young workers in a country reduced job prospects at home and further encouraged immigration. A greater degree of industrialization and urbanization in the home country typically increased immigration because traditional ties with the land were broken during this period, making laborers in the country more mobile. Finally, the presence of a larger volume of previous immigrants from that country or region encouraged more immigration because potential immigrants now had friends or relatives to stay with who could smooth their transition to living and working in the United States.”</p>
<p>In pondering Cohn’s comments, I conclude that our Congressional leadership is on a misguided path where they will exacerbate our current illegal immigration problem. My disdain grew more intense as I read what occurred in 1986 to purportedly fix the illegal immigration crisis. Cohn wrote, “Though features of the 1965 law [Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965] have been modified since it was enacted, this law still serves as the basis for U.S. immigration policy today. The most important modifications occurred in 1986 when employer sanctions were adopted for those hiring illegal workers. On the other hand, the same law also gave temporary resident status to individuals who had lived illegally in the United States since before 1982.” The symbolic message here suggests that if illegal immigrants keep a low profile long enough they will get US citizenship. Thus the1986 illegal amnesty only created today’s pool of relatives and friends to help new illegal aliens who wish to exploit a similar illegal immigration scenario.</p>
<p>It seems quite clear that the US Congressional leadership has one of two choices to make. They must make illegal immigration a felony offense for both the illegal alien and his or her employer to take away any competitive advantage these illegal immigrants will have on native born American citizens. On the other hand, if the US Congress is afraid to make illegal immigration a felony offense, they can pass a law that expunges the records of native born citizens after five years of completing their prison and legal system tenure assuming they have no new infractions – of course this action may not apply for all crimes.</p>
<p>What seems very troubling is the argument that illegal immigrants do jobs Americans don’t want. These comments suggest that a Third World mentality has gained quasi-legitimacy in the American Economic Mainstream and today’s illegal immigrants are comparable to the cheap labor chattel of yesterday’s black slaves. The issue is one of paying adequate wages for native American labor versus exploiting underemployment of illegal immigrants as a modern day version of servitude.</p>
<p>Some people might see my call for a crackdown on illegal immigration as draconian, but to offer roughly 11 million illegal aliens US citizen rights means they may merely move past native-born citizens on the socioeconomic ladder. This scenario is just plain un-American. We have a legal immigration route and it should be followed by everyone.</p>
<p>I asked Euro American Dr. Allan Alexander of Wilmington, DE, for his take on the immigration debate. “I frequently see the immigrants who come here, forced to take low-wage jobs, to work themselves hard to survive, treated shabbily. We have refugees from Liberia, Somalia, Nigeria, Haiti, Afghanistan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Burma, etc., and they all get the same demeaning treatment.</p>
<p>“I was reminded of this as I listened to the debate over immigration. Most of us are descended from immigrants who came here under questionable circumstances. Previously the country made exceptions to allow our ancestors in and to enable them to become citizens. Now many fear immigrants will take away our jobs, bring crime into our communities, overwhelm our welfare systems … They shouldn’t receive amnesty – they should be thrown out!” Alexander highlights the fears of many US Citizens. Hence, if the US Congress ignores the passion of the US Citizens surrounding illegal immigration, then the November 2006 US Congressional Election may see some heads roll. What is needed is an exodus of illegal aliens back to their home nations. The American economy will adjust to this new paradigm once employers understand that they must pay adequate wages to use domestic labor to produce their products.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-06_70b6.html" title="Edit section: Evolution (engine)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evolution (engine)</span></h2>
<p>The Evolution engine, commonly known as a "Blockhead" or "Evo", was developed by Harley Davidson in 1984 as a successor to the Shovelhead. Having bought itself back from AMF, the company decided to revamp its engine and create a newer, better powerplant. By extension, in common parlance an "Evo" is a motorcycle equipped with such an engine. It was used from 1984 until 1999. It was offered in an 80ci (1340cc) configuration.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the Evo has a single camshaft and uses pushrods to raise and lower the valves in its rocker boxes. However, the changes to the engine were more than simply the cosmetic changes to the rocker boxes (a flat, square design). The valve train was lightened considerably by using a tappet and pushrod setup that fed oil to the cylinders via the pushrods themselves, unlike previous engines in which external oil lines were used. The pistons within the cylinders were flat, and the heads had a larger and different shape which made for a more efficient burn.</p>
<p>In addition, the exhaust flanges (the sections of the engine to which the exhaust pipes were bolted) had a stronger, more efficient setup than the single bolt setup on the Shovelhead engine, a source of much frustration for motorcyclists prior to the change.</p>
<p>Evos were more reliable in general than previous engine designs, and less work was required to set up and maintain them. This is not true in all cases - there are examples in which Evolutions require more work to achieve the same result, for example pushrods cannot be adjusted without removing the rocker boxes. However, the bikes were increasingly becoming more user friendly and as a result some in the old guard that happened to like the tinkering and constant maintenance turned their backs on the Evo. T-shirts are available with slogans ranging from profane (e.g. F*CK EVO) to the clever (Hear no Evo, See no Evo, Speak no Evo).</p>
<p>Now that the newest engine, the Twin Cam 88 (Twinkie, Fathead) is in its seventh year and counting, the Evo engines are starting to be considered almost retro, and "old school" bikes built with these powerplants get less guffawing than in previous years.</p>
<p>The Evo can be customized with aftermarket rockerboxes to somewhat resemble a Knucklehead or Panhead, or finned or otherwise jazzed up rockerboxes which dress up the rather flat and uninspiring top end. The aftermarket that sprung up in the Shovelhead years has led to many options and aftermarket modifications to this engine in terms of performance, engine size and power, and enhancements.</p>
<p>Harley Davidson is at present (2006) selling off its remaining stock of these at bargain basement prices, leading to a small building boom with these engines.</p>

<p>Bill Gibson is a huge part of Long Beach sports history. Although his haircut is somewhat outdated he still is a volleyball legend. He is most famous for his line "Are you serious Scags". Most recently his team is noted for coming to a tournament hung over. His team of 2004 was a group of underachievers and they were knocked out of the playoffs. This year his team can rock so damn hard they break their spleens wit it. Oh and they are also "In there"</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-06_70b6.html" title="Edit section: Dead Stars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dead Stars</span></h2>
<p>"Dead Stars" is the name of the table-top RPG universe created by DaemonEye Publishing for use with the "Universal Decay" alternate-d20 rules set. The rules provide the familiarity of the d20 system, but alter it to reflect both realism and technological flexibility. Both of these are vital components to the sci-fi/horror setting that "Dead Stars" seeks to convey.</p>
<p>"Dead Stars" takes place in the dawn of humanity's remergence from barbarity, following the near-total destruction of the Gaean Empire. The "Dead Stars" universe is populated not only by humans, but also features a host of other races that have manged to contact humanity following the Core Systems Explosion. Arrayed against the continued development of human civilization are the soul-less consumptive Necrol, the lost legions of the now command-less Gaean Military, parasitical plant-based living weapons, pre-Invasion era weapons that have gone out of control, and even humanity itself!</p>
<p>The most impressive feature of the game is by far the technology system. The rules for firearms, for isntance, occupy only about a dozen or so pages yet allow for the creation of over 15,000 different types of hand-held death - and that is only ONE of the many types of technologies detailed in the game. Each of the different technologies is very suer-firendly however, with the chapters for them containing both the creation rules as well as ready-to-use examples.</p>
<p>Less impressive, but still notable, are the changes to the character advancement and combat systems from those in typical <a href="../../../d/2/0/D20_system.html" title="D20 system">d20 system</a> products. Character advancement takes into account the relative power of characters with lots of high-quality gear, even in mixed groups with characters of all types and power levels, by use of the "Gear Level" concept. The combat system uses the now-common standby of having armor prevent damage rather than attacks, but with some VERY telling changes: armor degrades at it takes punishment, Hit Points are mainly static and not very high, physical exhaustion (aka the "couch potato factor") is tracked sepperately from Hit Points, the better your attack roll is the more damage you deal, and rather than have "critical hits" the system uses "special damage" to indicate debilitating conditions that can result from a particularly well-made wound. Of course, these are only SOME of the changes to the d20 system this game uses.</p>
<p>A nice aspect of the game is the new psionics system, which is both simple and powerful. It uses only three categories of psionic powers (fetching, psychokinesis, and telepathy), each of which is gianed with an entry feat. Each such feat has a sepperate skill that determines accuracy and reliability, as well as an ability score that determines strength. Further feats can be taken to expand or magnify certain applications of a category's powers.</p>
<p>A final note should be taken that DaemonEye Publishing does not plan to stop at "Dead Stars". It is their intention to use the "Universal Decay" system to power many different settings, including the super-power/intrigue setting "Cape &amp; Hammer". There are also plans in the works for a "Dead Stars"-based animated TV show, but nothing deffinitive has been set.</p>

<p>Danget chody is a type of slang originally created by the ownage crew. Although there is no official founder, Nick Marozick (AKA N-MRO) is labeled as the first individual to let out a "danget chody." Over the years the term has been dilated and now has multiple meanings. Dangit jodi, Dangit Joe-G, and Dyiiiaaangiiiit chody, are just a few of the alternate forms that have deriven from the original phrase. By 2006 the term has been used worldwide, especially in the bay area, and amongst rebel teens. Not only is this term used amongst rebel teens, but many who work at Wall Street have adopted the term to signify falling stock or ineffectual trades. Danget chody has also made headlines in Times Sqaure and has become the catalyst for several company's products. For instance McDonalds has added a new item on their menu called the McChody and Michelin has developed a new high performance tire that they have called the All Terrain Danget Joe-G. As you can see the phrase that was thought to be created by the one they call N-Mro has been taking giant leaps in America.</p>

<p>~~Chody Chaminetee is the first known person to recieve a Danget Chody. After N-Mro labled him as a Danget Chody, the world would never be the same. The housing market soon crashed and local companies filed for bankruptcy. Bay Area music exlpoded with songs such as "Lets Get Danget Chody," "Tell Me When To Danget Chody," and "The Danget Chody Dance." Local teens began to emit Danget Chodys at unexpected times.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterson is the first known teacher to ever recieve a Danget Chody. A well know student at Leigh High School, Tony effin Gross told her to suck a Danget Chody after she told Tony that he was to stupid to be in her class. The Ownage Crew has copywritted the phrase Danget Chody, and anyone who wishes to use it for promotional purposes must contact Father Kane AKA:Wolverine.~~</p>

<p>This is Mista FOB, not Mista FAB, FOB. I will just add that...do not kill the danget chody. It was only generated for extreme cases when needed. If you would like to be referred on how to kill something, ask father kane or just simply kill yourself. (RIP "I get my grown driggs on", etc). Futhermore, use the danget chody sparingly and save it for desperate measures. If you would enjoy to be gay, just excrete it whenever possible and add it to your arsenal of how to be retarted. Also, if you use the word, use it right. Proper examples of the face you shall be expressing the danget chody are as follows:</p>

<p>Antonio C Rowley Antonio Camilio Rowley scored a hat-trick on his league debut on the opening day of the 1954-55 season. He didn't score in the next two following games and then got injured. Rowley's career at Liverpool was bizarre. He didn't play much during the season due to injuries and bad form, but always managed to win a place in the starting 11 at the end of the season and score more than his fair share of goals. He scored 8 goals in 13 matches in his opening season, 6 goals in 7 matches the next, followed by 7 in 14 matches in 1956-57.</p>
<p>Rowley finally put a run together of 19 consecutive games in his final season, scoring 8 goals in 6 successive matches, but then injuries prevailed again and he was sold to 3rd division Tranmere when two months were left of the season. He continued to score goals for Tranmere, 47 goals in 100 league matches, which is still below his LFC average.</p>
<p>never heard of the lad before. I have established he played for Wellington Town Birmingham City Stourbridge Liverpool &amp; Tranmere. He scored 16 league goals between August and December 1957. There is no record of him being at Liverpool after January 1958. Such a prolific goalscorer, what happened to his career after such a glowing start to the season. I have established he acheived one cap for WALES.</p>
<p>Will add anything I can find, when I find it. Perhaps if everyone makes an effort, we can produce a file of "Forgotten Heroes".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-06_70b6.html" title="Edit section: BMW Active Seat - Harza Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BMW Active Seat - Harza Technology</span></h2>
<p>The continuous passive motion technology widely known as the Active Seat as sold on BMW automobile seats was invented by noted engineer Richard D. Harza - former Chairman of the Harza Engineering Company, now know as Montgomery Watson Harza and MWH Global. Mr. Harza invented the Active Seat technology to reduce the pain and stiffness experienced of sitting for extended periods of time in order to provide relief for his daughter who lived with Cycstic Fibrosis and often found it difficult to stand up and walk about.</p>
<p>Mr. Harza viewed the human body as a load bearing structure designed for movement under pressure, much like the dams and other large structures designed and built by his engineering firm. The body is designed to bear upright body weight on the feet when standing and walking, and on the posterior when sitting.</p>
<p>While better lumbar support and chair design may help imrove posture, the spine still bears the downward force of the weight of the upper torso. The lower back pain and stiffnes commonly associated with sitting is the result of the compression of the vertabral discs and stresses on the supporting tissues of the lower mid-section of the back and the surface tissues and circulatory system throuth the posterior. Without the lumbar movement imparted by walking to rock the pelvis from side to side, there is no movement in the lower mid-section of the back, no flow of synovial fluids and nourishment to the intervertibral discs, reduced blood flow to the supporting tissues of the back, and constricted blood flow through the posterior and upper thighs to the legs.</p>
<p>Walking provides the naturally repeating motion pattern for which the body was designed and on which the body depends for proper maintenance and exercise. The Harza invention recognizes the importance of this walking motion, unlike other seating comfort devices on the market. The vibrating pads provide stimulation to the surface of the body and provide no substantive structural benefit to address the weight of the upper body upon the back and posterior. A moving lumbar support was attempted, but certianly we were not designed to have a device repeatedly press in and out directly upon or about the delicate vertabrae of lumbar back, thus imposing an unnatural forward and back movement, one that does not occur when walking.</p>
<p>Mr. Harza conceived of an invention which would provide naturally many of the benefits of walking, without the need to leave one's seat. Robert Kallman joined Mr. Harza to develop his invention and together they commercialized the technology.</p>
<p>The invention was refined into a simple device in which a pair of bladders or compartments, placed side by side directly beneath the Ischium bone of the pelvis, inflate alternately raise and lower one side of the hips then the other in a slow, smooth, relaxing and almost imperceptable motion. The motion of the hips flexes the lumbar spine from side to side in the similar pattern as when walking, and thus the technology provides many of the benefits of walking without distracting the user or interfering with one's ability to drive or perform other tasks. Furthermore, the alternating application and relief of pressure beneath the buttocks improves circulation and thus improves posterior tolerance to sustained sitting.</p>
<p>Known by various tradenames, the technology is under license to BMW and sold on the 5 Series and 7 Series cars worldwide as Active Seat. The Active Seat was honored by Popular Science magazine as one of the 100 Best Inventions of the Year in 1998.</p>
<p>The technology is known as the Aerovit for private and commercial aviation seating applications. In addition to lower back and posterior comfort, the Aerovit provides improved circulation through the posterior, upper thights and legs and may therefore reduce the risk of DVT for long-haul flight passengers and crew.</p>

<p>Christopher Oliver (1961-) was an influential Australian photographer in the late 1980s and a key figure in London publishing throughout the 1990s. He was born in Whitehaven, England, a bleak town on the coastal fringes of the Lakes District. His father was a General Practitioner who left private practice to become an Air Force medic; his mother was a physiotherapist. Chris Oliver was deeply affected by a disrupted, turbulent home life which made him distrustful of men and unwilling or unable to settle down for much of his life. The Oliver family moved more than 20 times during his childhood before emigrating to Hobart, Tasmania in 1977, when Christopher was 15. By the time he matriculated, at 16, he had already had articles and photographs published in local newspapers (Hobart Mercury, Tasmanian Times), at 17 his photograph of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser being assaulted at a rally was syndicated throughout the world, he had founded a successful small newspaper, Printed Matter, and had been one of the founders of Tasmania's Island literary magazine. After a brief spell at university and an even briefer one at art college in Tasmania, Chris Oliver moved to Melbourne where he completed a hospitality management course and an Honours degree in history and politics, whilst all the time working as a freelance journalist for ABC Radio National arts programmes. The spectacular success of his first solo photographic book, The Long Hot Summer (Angus and Robertson, 1986) meant he no longer needed to find paid work to put himself through university. His degree over, he worked full-time as co-author (with Dr Chris McConville) of a History of Creswick and a number of conservation studies. He was then given one of only three Commonwealth Scholarships awarded worldwide to study for a PhD in South Asia. He chose to study Tamil and Sinhalese militant groups at the University of Peradeniya, but abandoned his studies after his supervisor was assassinated, apparently by Sinhalese militants. At this point he decided to shift from academia to the world of academic publishing. He spent his first two years in publishing as a territory manager for Cambridge University Press in Australia, then after nine months spent travelling throughout Asia he wound up in London, working as Longman Group UK's sales manager for Southeast England, including London. He excelled in this role, creating a massive increase in company sales (up 28% over the period he worked for them). A falling out with his boss at Longman led Chris to approach Yale University Press where he was appointed Sales Manager for all territories other than the U.S. and Canada, and as a Director of Yale Representation Ltd. He left Yale in 1998 after becoming frustrated by the press's unresponsiveness to the market and its unwillingness to become a truly global publisher. At the same time, his marriage broke up and he left London for Melbourne where, after a brief period as state manager for Canon Photo Video, he established two successful bookshops of his own. In 2006 he relocated to Sydney and opened a bookshop in Potts Point, one of the most densely populated and wealthiest postal districts in Australia.</p>

<p>A rashguard is a wetsuit made of lycra material. It is worn by surfers. Unlike a neopren suit, it does not cover the whole body, but just the torso. There are short sleeve versions as well as long sleeve versions. As the name says, they primarily used to protect surfers from getting a rash while paddling out on their waxed surfboards. Besides, it also has the function to keep surfers warm. As the rashguard is very close on the skin, the water gathers between the rashguard and the skin. This water is beeing held warm by the body heat. Therefore the surfer feels still warm also while paddling out wet on the surfboard.</p>

<p>Real Life Comics has been around since their first comic puplished November 15, 1999. Its based on Greg Deans personal observasions in his real life, and spiked up with stories of time travel, ports to other dimensions, and AI. Greg Dean succeeds in making his comic funny, and interesting at the same time. His comic has a timeline parallel to his own life, like when he moves from house to house some of his comics is about moving, and the same with jobs. Greg Dean really likes electronics and computergames, therefor many of the punchlines is about this. He also likes Pepsi Cola, World Of Warcraft and Cool mythology swords.</p>

<p>Well known for his amazing ability at the crag, it’s hard to believe the club president fell off a diff less than a year before his appointment. This keen exponent of the art of pikey fighting makes his home only on pieces of rock less than 4m high. He can often be found sleeping after the tiring walk from the car park. Having almost caught hypothermia in his car boot Bob exacted revenge by putting the car in a tree. Not to be trusted to find the way to the crag we can all trust our president to show us a good time.</p>

<p>Special Investigations Agency is a non profit investigative and intervention organization dedicated to provide the general public with a resource to fight corruption, scams, and abuse. The founder is Kevin LaChapelle.</p>
<p>Kevin LaChapelle, began his career as a Police Officer in 1989 for the City of El Cajon, California.</p>
<p>Just prior to LaChapelle being hired, then Police Chief Jack Smith had been hired to restructure the El Cajon Police Department (ECPD) by then Mayor Joan Shoemaker and the City Council. He was tasked with introducing and implementation of the Problem/Community Oriented Policing concept throughout the department. Chief Smith received major resistance from the police command he had inherited upon his arrival in 1988. Smith eventually left the department in 1994 after facing serious resistance and realizing that the change were not occurring. Chief Smith accepted an Under-Sheriff position with the San Diego Sheriff's Department under Sheriff William Kolender. During Chief Smith’s tenure with the El Cajon Police Department, he and LaChapelle forged a close working relationship to cultivate and develop the police department’s relationship with the community.</p>
<p>LaChapelle was highly decorated receiving numerous awards for community leadership. Additionally, he sat on numerous boards, commissions, and routinely accepted invitations for public speaking engagements. He was a leader in the community, motivating and inspiring many to get involved in volunteerism to make their community a better place. For details click here.</p>
<p>Mr. LaChapelle was consistently chastised for striving to implement Mentorship programs which he strongly believed would be effective in re-directing at risk gang youth. The programs were in fact extremely effective. Many of the gang youth that he personally mentored are now adults with incredible success stories. For details click here.</p>
<p>LaChapelle was criticized by many for his questioning of improprieties throughout his career. One example of this would be an incident that occurred in 1994 in which he arrested a documented gang member for assault with a deadly weapon. He was stunned when he received an official rejection notice from the District Attorney's Office stating that the case would not be prosecuted. The reason stated for this DA reject was: "Victim is a dirt bag, no humans involved!" LaChapelle questioned the appropriateness of this, especially when the Hispanic victim had no criminal record. One of the D.A.'s made a reference to the fact that most Hispanics are gang members. This was an outrageous and racist assertion. Several weeks later, the suspect committed a major crime of violence and was involved in a standoff with police. Of course this would not have happened if the case had been issued in the first place.</p>
<p>In 1992, LaChapelle received information regarding forced sexual acts upon two young teenage girls. LaChapelle was stunned to learn that the suspects in the case were a fellow Police Officer, and the son of his immediate supervising Lieutenant. LaChapelle conducted the initial interview of the victim, and turned over the victim and his initial findings to neighboring La Mesa Police Department who had jurisdiction over the location in which the crime occurred. The officer and Lieutenant's son eventually both pled guilty in the case and were sentenced. The Sheriff's Department said they were unable to provide protection in the County Jail due to the nature of the crime, so they were given house arrest. During this case, LaChapelle was subjected to severe pressure for violating the "police code of silence". A seven page document was submitted to the District Attorney's Office by one police sergeant, trying to discount the rape case by discrediting LaChapelle. This sergeant was a close friend of the police officer suspect. The District Attorney's Office immediately discredited the letter and continued prosecuting the case. For details click here.</p>
<p>This would begin a long rough journey for LaChapelle. His Lieutenant continued to be his immediate supervisor. She did everything possible to make things uncomfortable for LaChapelle. The Lieutenant told others she would get back at LaChapelle for doing this to her son. She would later use LaChapelle's involvement with local Churches of various faiths to cloud the issues and discredit him by asserting that it was interfering with his job as a Police Officer. The police administration and police union leadership who opposed Chief Smith’s plan to restructure the police department continually sought to undermine the programs in which LaChapelle was commissioned by the Chief to undertake. LaChapelle held a strong power base within the community, which offered some protection from the initial retaliation against him from his Lieutenant and several of her close colleagues.</p>
<p>In 1994, LaChapelle was elected to the Grossmont Union High School District (GUHSD) Governing Board of Education with the highest votes out of ten candidates. For details, click here. He was asked to run for the position by members of the public who had alleged financial corruption among the districts top officials. For details, click here. He additionally had uncovered misappropriation of funds at one of the schools federally funded programs. For details, click here. During his election campaign, the opposition did everything possible to destroy his credibility to thwart a successful election. LaChapelle succeeded in his bid for election.</p>
<p>After being seated in his newly elected position, the Lieutenant and her colleagues began making assertions that it was a conflict of interest for LaChapelle to remain a Police Officer and seated as an Elected Public Official simultaneously. The Police Department advised LaChapelle that due to the fact that he was assigned to gangs at the local schools, that he should be transferred to a different position in which he would not have a “perceived conflict of interest” at the schools in which he was now a Governing Board Member. The lieutenant also held close relationships with the top officials from the school district.</p>
<p>Because of Chief Smith’s resigning from the department, LaChapelle no longer was protected against the increasing retaliatory measures being deployed against him. He eventually was reassigned to an undercover vice assignment. This was despite the Police Departments knowledge that LaChapelle had serious allergies to cigarette smoke, and had personal convictions which went against his "hanging out" in strip clubs and bars in which his new assignment required of him. LaChapelle continued for six months in this assignment until his sinitus was too severe from the allergies to cigarette smoke, and they reassigned him back to patrol.</p>
<p>In mid 1995, LaChapelle was told by his Lieutenant that he would be required to work Thursday evenings in which his lieutenant clearly knew was his scheduled board of education meetings. LaChapelle was in the process of attempting to uncover serious allegations made against the school district for financial improprieties. Because LaChapelle knew of the importance of the financial condition of the school district, he chose to resign from the police department, and remain an elected member of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>LaChapelle filed a lawsuit against the City of El Cajon Police Department for the retaliation. The City of El Cajon won a summary judgment from a judge who refused to even hear any of the hundreds of documents submitted to the court as evidence. LaChapelle sought to appeal the case to a higher court; however he was threatened by the city with thousands of dollars in attorney fees in which they would seek from him. LaChapelle agreed to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>After two years on the Board of Education, and his pursuit of uncovering the alleged corruption, he was viciously attacked and maligned daily in local newspapers. The teachers union was closely aligned with the Superintendent, JoAnn Smith and Fred Martinez, the Director of Business Services in which LaChapelle was investigating. The administration and union leadership did everything possible to prevent LaChapelle from accessing the necessary documents he needed to uncover the truth. At one point they even censured him and orchestrated a meeting with hundreds in attendance to dissuade LaChapelle from continuing his investigation. Fortunately scores of community members attended the orchestrated meeting as well to support LaChapelle in his efforts. For video footage of the meeting, click here.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Superintendent JoAnn Smith resigned her position and Fred Martinez, the Director of Business Services fled without a trace. The FBI became involved and even at one point placed a body wire on LaChapelle and recorded fellow Board Member Michael Harrelson trying to coerce LaChapelle into backing off from his pursuit of an investigative audit of district funds. Harrelson requested LaChapelle to put a stop to his inquiries into the alleged corruption, and in return told LaChapelle he would stop the retaliation from the police department in exchange for LaChapelle working to stop the investigations. Harrelson further stated that he had a close friend on the El Cajon City Council Todd Keegan who would help him. For details, click here.</p>
<p>An investigative audit was conducted of the finances of the Grossmont Union High School District by Deloitte &amp; Touche. Immediately following this audit, one of the auditors contacted LaChapelle, advising him that a number of serious discrepancies were found during the audit, and that he believe there was evidence of criminal activity. He wanted to meet with LaChapelle and District Legal Counsel to discuss his findings. For details, click here.</p>
<p>LaChapelle received death threats; he had credible sources within the Police Department advise him that the Police Administration had been holding strategy sessions. The sole topic discussed was how to "get rid of LaChapelle". They also were doing everything they could to "find dirt" on him; to no avail. For details, click here.</p>
<p>As a result of LaChapelle's tenacity on the school board, the entire school district administration was eventually replaced, and accountability was instilled back into the school district. LaChapelle did not seek re-election after his term expired in 1998. LaChapelle received letters from top adminstrative staff commending him for his efforts. For details, click here.</p>
<p>All of the facts in this case are verifiable through depositions taken during the lawsuit filed against the El Cajon Police Department. Included within the evidence that a Federal judge would not allow admitted into evidence was a sworn deposition from LaChapelle’s former Police Chief Jack G. Smith. Within that deposition, the Police Chief said he feared for the safety of LaChapelle. He recalled meetings conducted by other high ranking officers, in which, they would strategize on how to neutralize LaChapelle. The Police Chief resigned months before LaChapelle resigned from the force.</p>
<p>In 2001, LaChapelle applied for a position as a Special Agent for the California Department of Justice. After passing his polygraph examination, he was called in for a secondary background interview. During this interview, one of the investigators advised LaChapelle that he had spoken with LaChapelle’s former Lieutenant with whom he was close friends with. He began interrogating LaChapelle demanding to know if LaChapelle was tape recording their conversation. He then advised LaChapelle that he knew of the actions he had taken while working as an El Cajon Police Offier. Needless to say, LaChapelle was no longer considered for that position.</p>
<p>Several other Officers have alleged corruption within the El Cajon Police Department even as recent as 2004. Click on the picture at the bottom of this page to view recent news footage. One Officer, Robert Cartwright, who brought forth major allegations of corruption was retaliated upon severely. He and his wife were subjected to a false anonymous tip alleging they were involved in money laundering in which the FBI conducted a raid of their home. Later the FBI acknowledged the information had been provided solely by top level officials at the El Cajon Police Department, and that the information later was confirmed to be baseless. That Officer has pending litigation against the City of El Cajon for this incident.</p>
<p>The lieutenant is now a Captain. She along with her husband and a few other colleagues continue to hold a tight grip on the El Cajon Police Department. Anyone that questions their activities is silenced, discredited and destroyed. The nepotism within the department is alarming. Very few individuals dare question this powerful clique.</p>
<p>Now with focus and clarity, LaChapelle is committed to his non-profit organization founded in 1999. LaChapelle currently is committed to Mentoring current and future Police Officers, equipping them to resist the temptations that go along with the job, and instilling in them the cardinal virtues which enable them to stand up for what is right, no matter what the cost!</p>

The programs were in fact extremely effective. Many of the gang youth that he personally mentored are now adults with incredible success stories. For details click here.</p>
<p>LaChapelle was criticized by many for his questioning of improprieties throughout his career. One example of this would be an incident that occurred in 1994 in which he arrested a documented gang member for assault with a deadly weapon. He was stunned when he received an official rejection notice from the District Attorney's Office stating that the case would not be prosecuted. The reason stated for this DA reject was: "Victim is a dirt bag, no humans involved!" LaChapelle questioned the appropriateness of this, especially when the Hispanic victim had no criminal record. One of the D.A.'s made a reference to the fact that most Hispanics are gang members. This was an outrageous and racist assertion. Several weeks later, the suspect committed a major crime of violence and was involved in a standoff with police. Of course this would not have happened if the case had been issued in the first place.</p>
<p>In 1992, LaChapelle received information regarding forced sexual acts upon two young teenage girls. LaChapelle was stunned to learn that the suspects in the case were a fellow Police Officer, and the son of his immediate supervising Lieutenant. LaChapelle conducted the initial interview of the victim, and turned over the victim and his initial findings to neighboring La Mesa Police Department who had jurisdiction over the location in which the crime occurred. The officer and Lieutenant's son eventually both pled guilty in the case and were sentenced. The Sheriff's Department said they were unable to provide protection in the County Jail due to the nature of the crime, so they were given house arrest. During this case, LaChapelle was subjected to severe pressure for violating the "police code of silence". A seven page document was submitted to the District Attorney's Office by one police sergeant, trying to discount the rape case by discrediting LaChapelle. This sergeant was a close friend of the police officer suspect. The District Attorney's Office immediately discredited the letter and continued prosecuting the case. For details click here.</p>
<p>This would begin a long rough journey for LaChapelle. His Lieutenant continued to be his immediate supervisor. She did everything possible to make things uncomfortable for LaChapelle. The Lieutenant told others she would get back at LaChapelle for doing this to her son. She would later use LaChapelle's involvement with local Churches of various faiths to cloud the issues and discredit him by asserting that it was interfering with his job as a Police Officer. The police administration and police union leadership who opposed Chief Smith’s plan to restructure the police department continually sought to undermine the programs in which LaChapelle was commissioned by the Chief to undertake. LaChapelle held a strong power base within the community, which offered some protection from the initial retaliation against him from his Lieutenant and several of her close colleagues.</p>
<p>In 1994, LaChapelle was elected to the Grossmont Union High School District (GUHSD) Governing Board of Education with the highest votes out of ten candidates. For details, click here. He was asked to run for the position by members of the public who had alleged financial corruption among the districts top officials. For details, click here. He additionally had uncovered misappropriation of funds at one of the schools federally funded programs. For details, click here. During his election campaign, the opposition did everything possible to destroy his credibility to thwart a successful election. LaChapelle succeeded in his bid for election.</p>
<p>After being seated in his newly elected position, the Lieutenant and her colleagues began making assertions that it was a conflict of interest for LaChapelle to remain a Police Officer and seated as an Elected Public Official simultaneously. The Police Department advised LaChapelle that due to the fact that he was assigned to gangs at the local schools, that he should be transferred to a different position in which he would not have a “perceived conflict of interest” at the schools in which he was now a Governing Board Member. The lieutenant also held close relationships with the top officials from the school district.</p>
<p>Because of Chief Smith’s resigning from the department, LaChapelle no longer was protected against the increasing retaliatory measures being deployed against him. He eventually was reassigned to an undercover vice assignment. This was despite the Police Departments knowledge that LaChapelle had serious allergies to cigarette smoke, and had personal convictions which went against his "hanging out" in strip clubs and bars in which his new assignment required of him. LaChapelle continued for six months in this assignment until his sinitus was too severe from the allergies to cigarette smoke, and they reassigned him back to patrol.</p>
<p>In mid 1995, LaChapelle was told by his Lieutenant that he would be required to work Thursday evenings in which his lieutenant clearly knew was his scheduled board of education meetings. LaChapelle was in the process of attempting to uncover serious allegations made against the school district for financial improprieties. Because LaChapelle knew of the importance of the financial condition of the school district, he chose to resign from the police department, and remain an elected member of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>LaChapelle filed a lawsuit against the City of El Cajon Police Department for the retaliation. The City of El Cajon won a summary judgment from a judge who refused to even hear any of the hundreds of documents submitted to the court as evidence. LaChapelle sought to appeal the case to a higher court; however he was threatened by the city with thousands of dollars in attorney fees in which they would seek from him. LaChapelle agreed to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>After two years on the Board of Education, and his pursuit of uncovering the alleged corruption, he was viciously attacked and maligned daily in local newspapers. The teachers union was closely aligned with the Superintendent, JoAnn Smith and Fred Martinez, the Director of Business Services in which LaChapelle was investigating. The administration and union leadership did everything possible to prevent LaChapelle from accessing the necessary documents he needed to uncover the truth. At one point they even censured him and orchestrated a meeting with hundreds in attendance to dissuade LaChapelle from continuing his investigation. Fortunately scores of community members attended the orchestrated meeting as well to support LaChapelle in his efforts. For video footage of the meeting, click here.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Superintendent JoAnn Smith resigned her position and Fred Martinez, the Director of Business Services fled without a trace. The FBI became involved and even at one point placed a body wire on LaChapelle and recorded fellow Board Member Michael Harrelson trying to coerce LaChapelle into backing off from his pursuit of an investigative audit of district funds. Harrelson requested LaChapelle to put a stop to his inquiries into the alleged corruption, and in return told LaChapelle he would stop the retaliation from the police department in exchange for LaChapelle working to stop the investigations. Harrelson further stated that he had a close friend on the El Cajon City Council Todd Keegan who would help him. For details, click here.</p>
<p>An investigative audit was conducted of the finances of the Grossmont Union High School District by Deloitte &amp; Touche. Immediately following this audit, one of the auditors contacted LaChapelle, advising him that a number of serious discrepancies were found during the audit, and that he believe there was evidence of criminal activity. He wanted to meet with LaChapelle and District Legal Counsel to discuss his findings. For details, click here.</p>
<p>LaChapelle received death threats; he had credible sources within the Police Department advise him that the Police Administration had been holding strategy sessions. The sole topic discussed was how to "get rid of LaChapelle". They also were doing everything they could to "find dirt" on him; to no avail. For details, click here.</p>
<p>As a result of LaChapelle's tenacity on the school board, the entire school district administration was eventually replaced, and accountability was instilled back into the school district. LaChapelle did not seek re-election after his term expired in 1998. LaChapelle received letters from top adminstrative staff commending him for his efforts. For details, click here.</p>
<p>All of the facts in this case are verifiable through depositions taken during the lawsuit filed against the El Cajon Police Department. Included within the evidence that a Federal judge would not allow admitted into evidence was a sworn deposition from LaChapelle’s former Police Chief Jack G. Smith. Within that deposition, the Police Chief said he feared for the safety of LaChapelle. He recalled meetings conducted by other high ranking officers, in which, they would strategize on how to neutralize LaChapelle. The Police Chief resigned months before LaChapelle resigned from the force.</p>
<p>In 2001, LaChapelle applied for a position as a Special Agent for the California Department of Justice. After passing his polygraph examination, he was called in for a secondary background interview. During this interview, one of the investigators advised LaChapelle that he had spoken with LaChapelle’s former Lieutenant with whom he was close friends with. He began interrogating LaChapelle demanding to know if LaChapelle was tape recording their conversation. He then advised LaChapelle that he knew of the actions he had taken while working as an El Cajon Police Offier. Needless to say, LaChapelle was no longer considered for that position.</p>
<p>Several other Officers have alleged corruption within the El Cajon Police Department even as recent as 2004. Click on the picture at the bottom of this page to view recent news footage. One Officer, Robert Cartwright, who brought forth major allegations of corruption was retaliated upon severely. He and his wife were subjected to a false anonymous tip alleging they were involved in money laundering in which the FBI conducted a raid of their home. Later the FBI acknowledged the information had been provided solely by top level officials at the El Cajon Police Department, and that the information later was confirmed to be baseless. That Officer has pending litigation against the City of El Cajon for this incident.</p>
<p>The lieutenant is now a Captain. She along with her husband and a few other colleagues continue to hold a tight grip on the El Cajon Police Department. Anyone that questions their activities is silenced, discredited and destroyed. The nepotism within the department is alarming. Very few individuals dare question this powerful clique.</p>
<p>Now with focus and clarity, LaChapelle is committed to his non-profit organization founded in 1999. LaChapelle currently is committed to Mentoring current and future Police Officers, equipping them to resist the temptations that go along with the job, and instilling in them the cardinal virtues which enable them to stand up for what is right, no matter what the cost!</p>

<p>Special Investigations Agency is a non profit investigative and intervention organization dedicated to provide the general public with a resource to fight corruption, scams, and abuse. The founder is Kevin LaChapelle.</p>
<p>Kevin LaChapelle, began his career as a Police Officer in 1989 for the City of El Cajon, California.</p>
<p>Just prior to LaChapelle being hired, then Police Chief Jack Smith had been hired to restructure the El Cajon Police Department (ECPD) by then Mayor Joan Shoemaker and the City Council. He was tasked with introducing and implementation of the Problem/Community Oriented Policing concept throughout the department. Chief Smith received major resistance from the police command he had inherited upon his arrival in 1988. Smith eventually left the department in 1994 after facing serious resistance and realizing that the change were not occurring. Chief Smith accepted an Under-Sheriff position with the San Diego Sheriff's Department under Sheriff William Kolender. During Chief Smith’s tenure with the El Cajon Police Department, he and LaChapelle forged a close working relationship to cultivate and develop the police department’s relationship with the community.</p>
<p>LaChapelle was highly decorated receiving numerous awards for community leadership. Additionally, he sat on numerous boards, commissions, and routinely accepted invitations for public speaking engagements. He was a leader in the community, motivating and inspiring many to get involved in volunteerism to make their community a better place. For details click here.</p>
<p>Mr. LaChapelle was consistently chastised for striving to implement Mentorship programs which he strongly believed would be effective in re-directing at risk gang youth.

<p>Zagori, Vikos Gorge, Voidomatis.....a unique place protected from the outside world by high mountains. Marvelous traditional stone built settlements, in harmony with nature, bridges, fountains, wells, monasteries, virgin beech and oak forests, rare plants and herbs..... And Primoula, the endemic flower of Zagori, which blooms in the winter in the snow.....</p>
<p>Here in Central Zagori, at the traditional village "Ano Pedina", Primoula quest-house has recently opened at a restored 1870's mansion aiming at a high quality accommodation</p>
<p>Primoula is in the center of the village "Ano Pedina" which is 35 Km far from Ioannina and almost 7 Km far from Vikos Gorge.</p>
<p>Primoula has a total of 7 rooms (5 with double bed and 2 with 3 beds) of which 4 are on the main building and 3 are independent with access to the yard. Primoula can host the maximum of 16 persons.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Fireplace TV Digital phone service Room service (07.30 - 24.00) Independent heating Special bath e.tc.</p>
<p>The old stonework, which has been revealed and preserved, along with the wooden floors, the colorful ceilings as well as the carefully set antique furniture and lights give the warmth of a bygone age.</p>
<p>The stone yards, which have been formed in many levels, full of primoules, petounia and pansedes, offer a special view in the whole settlement, but also coffee, drink or sweet in an atmosphere with soft music and candles.</p>
<p>The village is an old, traditional settlement (since 1361) with many remarkable buildings of the 18th and 19th century. It is situated on a relatively short distance (35 Km) from Ioannina, almost on the new country road which connects West with Central Zagori, and ensures easy access to western places (Papigo 22 km, Aristi 12 km), as well as in the most remote villages in the east (Tsepelovo 25 km, Negades 15 km).</p>
<p>It is one of the beautiful traditional villages of Zagori, with important sights in the village, (Labriadios School, Monastery of Evagelistria (1793), Monastery of Ag. Paraskevi (1750), Temple of Ag. Dimitrios (1793) etc), as well as in the wider area (Monodendri - Vikogs gorge 6 km, Kipoi Bridges 9 km).</p>

<p>Heather Gillespie President of the international league of shemales, Heather Gillespie is so convincing that 'her' dna has lost the Y chromosome. Gillespie famously endangered the life of Trent Michigan when she accused him of perversion of the course of juices in front of an agitated crowd, who came within centimetres of lynching Michigan. In the ensuing chaos, Heather escaped the predicament and remains at large to this day. Michigan retains his unusual and amusing scars and a desire for vengeance</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Robert Errol Service Robert Errol Service, the famous historian, understood that a life of time was not truly a life at all – indeed, what life is living in the past? Instead, Service attempted a number of different lifestyles, including a life of crime, a life of grime, and a life of slime. None of these were to his liking and as such he began to play football in Brest, Belarus. Here, he heard of Ropeburn's dark and mysterious past, where his historical eye returned, and he has dedicated his life to delving deep into this crevice of time</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Centrino Shame Centrino sought to prove himself to his overbearing mother and father through the grand old game of distance-spitting. Centrino brought glory and distinction to the Shame family name, as well as the pro distance spitting circuit until one fateful day when a young, speedy Lee Artichoke outspat him, due to his amazing run up. Although Shame protested this as unfair, and that Artichoke was displaying running speed rather than spitting prowess, the judges ruled in favour of Artichoke. Shame was exiled by his parents, and joined VCP on a whim after hearing rumours from a shadowy stranger in the tavern</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Archduke Remmington A nasty and conceited student at Sir Remmington's Technical High School For Knights (Sir Remmington was his great great granduncle), Archduke believed himself to be above the laws of Cadrick. He consistently took secret passages out of the castle to the local town, Habbisham Grove, where he would return with a series of increasingly malformed creatures, thereby ruining the school's strict "no pet policy". After his seventeenth breaking of this policy, Archduke was banned for life from attending the institute; thus his Knighting career went up in proverbial flames; Archduke has since sworn his revenge on his former headmaster</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adolf Hitler A Genocidal despot brought back to life by the ghost of Pratchett Jaywalker, Hitler seeks to destroy the Jewish race. His first target: Rosensteinstien. Before the killing however, Hitler must dazzle him with footballing skills</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leonard Hatred A putrid man who is the metaphorical shit on the bottom of the metaphorical shoe; he hates everyone and everything. But what he hates most is the World Parliament. He blames them for his own general rubbishness – but places the largest proportion of blame squarely on the shoulders of its representatives, namely Guybrush Vatica, who represents his constituency of Europe. His anger at this democratic deficit has led to him having several attempts to boycott the elections, without success. However, he has now joined a pressure group to get his voice heard – the "We R Teh H8red Group for severely disgruntled beings" and hopes through enforcing these views on the football pitch, he can finally bring justice to his miserable existence</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Garth Faber Little is known of rebel PM and self-styled "King of Westminster" Garth Faber prior to his assumption of power in the so called "corduroy elections" of the late sixties. His background was thought to be in petro chemicals although more recent research has pointed more towards the liberal arts in general and Ruthenian poetry in particular. Either way he was considered by many, most notably himself, as a "bit of a catch…intellectually speaking"</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Faber's time in office is characterised by his now infamous New Years Honours list which saw the rising of Michael Aslan to knighthood. Faber never justified this appointment, preferring to adopt a line of faux sophistry – "sapere aude!"</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now in is 90's and allegedly "loving life", "the King" is often to be seen at Bankside Power Station – now the Tate Modern – indulging in his love for 1980's German neo-suprematism, or sipping a reflective cappuccino in the Poetry Place, a small coffee bar in London's Covent Garden. He has lived for some twenty years now with his longterm partner, the celebrated hero of the Gulf War – Lieutenant-Colonel Georgie "Banjo" Gordon. They have a dog</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Zombie Beckenbauer The first ever zombie, Beckenbauer was the primary cause of the nuking of Racoon City. He survived, however, due to a clever manoeuvre whereby he took a large turnip and several small boulders and created an anti-WMD base deep in the dank recesses of Memory Lane. During his plight, he stumbled across Jacob Nuff Beef, who tried to wizard him away. However, being a failed wizard, Beef succeeded only in gifting Beckenbauer with unprecedented skills at football in the zombie world. He lead Germany's undead side to victory in the 1998 World Cup, and helped them reach the finals in 2002. He now hopes to bring similar success to VCP</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gregori Franbutin An ex conjuror, Franbutin hails from deepest Grozny grad, the mythical Russian jungle where temperatures soar as high as a million degrees C and the snakes are reputedly as big as your arm. After an incident involving a giant metal suit and a blind man with huge eyes, Franbutin became a conjuror to the Tsarina. After having boned her, he was met with suspicion by the Tsar. After being poisoned, thrown in a river and shot a total of 2564 times by a young group of Russian nobles, Franbutin was quite seriously injured. Through methods unknown, Zombie Beckenbauer restored him to full health and he pledged ALLEGIANCE</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Petey McHammerCrotch Reputed to have a crotch the size of a sea-lion, it was said that Petey would often run amok in his local burger joint, often taking part in actions such as rape and pillage. However, these rumours were unfounded, propagated by a vicious rumour-mill run by none other than Tarradiddle himself. Upon learning of these fabrications, Petey vowed to put the record straight by joining VCP, supposedly the team for runaways and circus freaks (though this is probably a vicious rumour too) and doing footballing battle with none other than his enemy Tarradiddle</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Terence Arnold Strap-on Terence suffered from massive setbacks in his battle with the bottle in 1989, when the aforementioned bottle landed a stinging right hook to his face, landing him on his arse. Plagued by self doubt and the bubonic plague, Strap-on decided it was time to seize the day with all thumbs. Dynamic and free flowing, Strap on possesses liquid like qualities. He will use any measure to get his man and measure him; a tailor by trade, with all the tenacity of a particularly tenacious terrier. A Breed famed for their tenacity. Following an incident involving prosthetic penises, lubrication and a small, amusing statuette of a duck, Strap-on earned his surname and an enduring hatred for none other than Jacob Nuff Beef</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Terracotta Fallopian "The Foot Soldier" Brass An infamous member of the AMH Squad, he mutinied against Mustafah when he wasn't allowed to have his own theme tune. This strange member once used iPod headphone wires to garrotte his political opponents and was dismissed from the squad for constant use of n00b talk. He hopes, therefore, to exact his revenge on the leader of his old team.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Pee-Wee Purcell Pee-Wee hails from the ancient tribe of Zul'Jin, a rag tag bunch of layabouts and dossers who do nothing but lounge around in hammocks and eat any crunchy white travellers who happen to pass by. Pee-Wee grew tired of this lifestyle when he discovered a celine dion CD, and vowed revenge on "herod the impaler" who was subliminally credited in dion's album art. After taking LSD and listening to Celine Dion's album backwards 7 times, Purcell became obsessed with the idea that Dion was sending little devils to torment him. The only way to calm these visions was to play football as if possessed; VCP gave him that opportunity. He hates Ladle Johansonson due to a dispute over chewing gum in public places.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Baron Von Seewheyed A sub-aquatic fish-man, Baron rallied loyal Mer-warriors to storm Poseidon's Winter Palace. He was, however, stopped by the Women's Death Battalion and a Bicycle Unit led by Leyton Quartz, who thus saved the life of the water god. Baron was cast into the Never Ending Pit, which – to his annoyance – persisted in never ending. He survived on a diet of moral fibre, and eventually managed to hook a toenail into a nook or cranny (we are unsure at this time) in the rock surface, and hence climbed to triumph. He thus hunted Leyton Quartz, and joined the counter-revolutionary socialist football organisation VCP</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clemence el Shasbaar Life is cheap on the mean streets of Morocco, and nobody knows this better than Clemence el Shasbaar. After being accosted by a gang of Jehovas witnesses, Clemence awoke lying in a bathtub full of ice in a seedy hotel. Upon further examination, both his kidneys had been cut out and sold on the black market. El Shasbaar was understandably quite miffed, and while in the ambulance on the way to the police station began thinking of ways in which to earn money for new kidneys. Professional football seemed ideal for El Shasbaar, so he signed up for VCP. The last thing he remembers before blacking out in that dark, Morocco back alley was the chortling face of Dutton Forshaw. Clemence has been granted the opportunity to earn money for his missing organs and to show up his rival. He is happy once again. However his synthetic kidney may give out at any moment, and frequently needs cleaning. For shame, Forshaw</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tripod O'Grimey The nutzest breh around, this ghetto yute is also a devout photographer. He was both the match day photographer and half time rapper for VCP. This led to his eventual accession to squad player, where he uses his skills for a new reason entirely. He was also the inventor of the number '1' which came after the 2000 Number act of parliament by a vote of 342 to 267</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Germinate O'Conundrum Famously irked on national TV by Ignatius fury, O'Conundrum has since spiralled into a self destructive spree of handbrake-turning. Spurning his former life of badger-baiting and phone-tapping, Germinate has truly begun to flower on the football pitch. His prodigious talent stems from his lack of certain areas of the brain. This also makes him a fantastic public speaker, but frustratingly prevents him from saying the letter 't' in the words 'football', 'tunbridge' and 'documentary'. Germinate lays the blame neatly at the feet of Fury. He would trade his amazing skills in oration and football, as well as his right arm to be able to say 'documentary' again without ridicule.</p>

<p>Leather McKenzie After falling from a moving cow, McKenzie's face was torn into three pieces, which were scattered to the three corners of the world. After a lengthy quest, Mckenzie gave up and had a new face sewn together from leather. After hearing rumours that Zefiah stole the legendary 'imperial leather' he decided to form a football team of great power</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Fukinishi Porridgefellow Once upon a time, the inscrutable Chinaman Fukinishi Porridgefellow was just a simple man leading a simple life; until, one fateful day, whilst strolling through a country burrow, he slipped on some leaked bisto; this caused him to fall into a box of porridge, where he almost drowned. After being rescued by a strange leathery faced man, he learned that it was due to Bobby Dazzler he'd had this near death experience, and swore his vengeance</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jeff America Served under general mcbrackett in the 89th battalion of American Soldier-marines in the legendary field of nang-po in Vietnam – known to the troops as the "Field of conflict". America was captured and tortured by Alimony himself, escaping ten years after the war by gnawing through the small duffel bag which contained him during his confinement. America swore revenge on Alimony, who has since repented, and sought redemption by joining MHP. Alimony's soul can only be saved if he faces this demon from his past</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Samuel El'Jackson The legendary Mexican actor, who famously was the first man on the moon, Samuel El'Jackson took the part of Shaft in the recently re-released Latin edition. This destroyed Wolf J's childhood hopes, dreams and ambitions in one fell swoop; however, Flywheel became a widely successful footballer, on whom El'Jackson lost his entire fortune betting. Thus El'Jackson wants his revenge</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Edwin Cauldron Bates Famously snubbed the Russians in his "fair play" speech to the UN, Cauldron-Bates moved from welding to politics with relative ease. His distaste towards the Russians angered Ingrid Rock so greatly that he went on a 3-day orgy of destruction. This left Rock somewhat out of pocket, so he roped EC Bates into football (with red tape) in the hopes of relieving his foe of cash. When not being widely respected, EC Bates devotes his time to being critically acclaimed</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Herald Potent Herald Potent; the massively enigmatic figurehead of Potent Enterprise believed himself to have seen an angel. It transpired, however, that it was no such heavenly body, but a cyborg from the future (Neo-Tunisia, to be precise). As such, he has given his life away to the devil in order to recapture this cyborg, and thus earn himself eternal glory</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Awae Ona Sikwan Rumour has it, the cause of Awae's potent and dangerous sick-one stems from Euro-Disney. When he and a number of friends went on a jaunt to the theme park, Awae reputedly ingested five hot dogs, and rode space mountain a total of five times. This ultimate sick one shook Euro-Disney to its very foundations, and the park is now under repair. Shame really…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flint Wayward Flint Wayward, the shadowy alter-ego of Edmund Zonetrot's Vegas days, was brought to life by a combination of peppermint and hamster droppings. This ultimately disastrous concoction has lead to Wayward's personality resembling that of his fictional self – a train robbing, gun toting, horse abusing wank</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jermaine Battlebeard A relative of the infamously enigmatic Gillius Thunderhead, rumour has it that he reputedly possessed the shadowy Golden Axe. This he used to delve deep into the world of dreams, where he plucked from a rose-bush a 'Gash Bomb', carried it into the real world and proceeded to dominate the global battlefield. His armies were fearless with this wonderful new weapon</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Earl Grimace Former proprietor of a clam chowder joint in the Bronx, Grimace was born with a sweet tooth for suffering. Thankfully it was removed by his dentist at the age of 11, but during that time he garnered many enemies with his violent ways. One of whom, Horrace Thunder, was repeatedly and ruthlessly bogwashed. The antics of Grimace were immortalised in the Celine Dion number, 'My heart will go on'</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Ragged Merchant Some call him the second most mysterious man to ever have graced the planet. His wide understanding of weaponry has led to him offering travelling strangers a hand in distorting the local monsterlife, bringing him in close contact with Norman Tarradiddle. The Ragged Merchant of course, has also had a major finger in the work of creating "Kelsie", the hybrid giraffe-cum-octopus looking machine, which hoped to rival the "Mystery Machine" for mystery-factor – this has brought him into conflict with Pratchett Jaywalker</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Orious Pettlemenge Whilst yodelling in the hump-back mountains of Winchester, Orious stumbled upon an ant farm owned by Trent Michigan. After years of looking after these ants as orphans, Pettlemenge was convinced by the evil thoughts of Draughty McNoBends to strap them to a large catapult and hence heave them to fate. Orious has now joined VCP in order to enforce a retaliation of psychic bombardment at the true perpetrator of this evil crime through destroying Trent Michigan</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tom Clancy Disgruntled ex-SAS officer turned shit author, Clancy's string of videogames enjoyed success largely at the expense of the Ahmed Mustafah Mayhem hit squad, who were brutalised by Clancy's team due to their inability to save. Clancy's rise to fame has earned him many enemies, but none with the tenacity and ruthlessness of Ahmed and his middle eastern cohorts</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sir Michael Aslan Keen swordsman and former secretary general of the Norwich communist party, Sir Michael was knighted as part of the now infamous new years honours list of rebel PM Garth Faber.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At 7'7", larger than life character Sir Michael is a vocal opponent of what he refers to as 'the government', advocating an alternative and, so he claims, radical programme of corporativism, intergovernmentalism, pluralism and spurious essentialism, underpinned by a firm advocacy to artificial intelligence in the young. Politics is, for Sir Michael, "somewhere between the bottle and the bedpan".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having recently returned from an extensive lecture tour of what he grudgingly refers to as "the UK", he promoted his firm belief in a new economic policy that would link the pound, in perpetuity, to the rouble.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sir Michael is 84 and lives with his fifth wife Jody and their eight children in a secure compound just outside Yeovil</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jaunty Angle A hexagonal bungle of angles and lines, Jaunty represents the world naivety to the wonders of Maths. His own face, perpendicular to the semi-circular body that he enjoys, was scarred in a smelting accident at the age of&#160;?. Petr Mandlehandle famously quipped that this was such a waste of maths. Jackal Longshanks, never one to enjoy mathematical conundrums, dared to disagree with this quotation; Jaunty Angle, therefore, has made it his quest to bring justice to this heinous thought crime.</p>

<p>Marina Cove is one of the most well-established upper-middle class residential community located in the New Territories district of Sai Kung, Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The community was originally developed by Henderson Land Development Company, a renowned property developer, owned by Lee Shiauw Kee, a prominent Hong Kong tycoon.

<p>Such uniqueness makes it one of the most sought after neighbourhood by professionals and expatriates in Hong Kong. The community also benefits from its proximity to Kowloon and Hong Kong island, which is just 20 minutes away and it is well connected by public/minibuses which take residents to Choi Hung MTR station in just mins.</p>
<p>During the peak of the Hong Kong economy a townhouse at this community was on average valued at HK$16 million (approx. US$2 million). The financial crisis that swept Asia in 1998 significantly depressed the overall property values and value has fallen by more than half during the peak of SARS in 2003. Since early 2004, property value has recovered significantly, yet it is still somewhat shy from the heights of 1997.</p>

<p>Bite Fight is a online game between Vampires and Werewolves. You choose a character from either group and you try and better yourself by gaining level (rank) and money. You can upgraid your hideout, or go to the city where you can buy items or weapons at the city or improve your skills to fight your enemies. You can also look for a job at the graveyard to earn some gold!</p>
<p>The main object is to hunt, if you are a vampire you have the choice to hunt werewolves or humans. If you are a werewolf you have the choice to hunt vampires or humans, you only get 2 hours of hunting every day and you cannot do anything untill the hunting time you have chosen is up.</p>

<p>Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) are techniques which can be used to determine temperatures at which changes of phase or state (e.g. glass to supercooled liquid, around the glass transition temperature, Tg) occur in a material. These techniques are particularly important to researchers in materials science and other chemical sciences, as key characteristic temperatures can be accurately obtained, such as Tg, the onset of crystallisation (Tx), the liquidus (Tl, the lowest temperature at normal pressure at which the system is entirely in the liquid state) and the solidus (Ts, the highest temperature at normal pressure at which the system is entirely in the solid state). For example, using this information the Tx–Tg gap can be calculated for inorganic glasses, which is a rough estimate of glass stability on reheating, and an important consideration for applications such as optical fibre drawing, as this is the temperature region of greatest stability against crystallisation. For fibre drawing, a low enough viscosity (around 10^4.5 Pa.s) must be exhibited in this temperature region. Therefore, this gap should be maximised so the fibre drawing viscosity occurs as far below Tx as possible, as even a small degree of crystallinity in the glass will result in optical absorption and scattering losses over long optical pathlengths. However, for a glass to have a fibredrawing viscosity as far below Tx as possible, and a large Tx-Tg gap, would usually require a shallow viscosity-temperature relationship, i.e. a non-fragile glass-forming liquid [1,2].</p>
<p>The temperature difference (dT=Ts-TR) between the sample (Ts) and the reference (TR) is measured using a differential thermocouple, where one junction is in contact with the bottom of the sample crucible and the other is in contact with the bottom of the reference crucible. When the sample undergoes a transformation it either absorbs (endothermic) or gives out (exothermic) heat. The DTA detects if the sample is cooler or hotter than the reference and displays an exotherm or an endotherm on the trace of dT versus time (or temperature if the heating rate is constant, as is the case in this study). For example, when the temperature of the sample and reference increases with time, the reference temperature increases linearly (TR), however the sample temperature (Ts) can undergoe a melting transition at Tm. As melting phenomena are endothermic, the sample takes in heat from the surroundings and the temperature plateaus for some time until melting is complete. The temperature of the sample then equilibrates with the surroundings and increases with a similar gradient to the reference as before. The difference (dT) between curves TR and Ts are recorded and forms the DTA trace [3].</p>

<p>Mellifluous is a four-piece alternative rock/grunge band from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire. They began in 2004 where they were a five piece but sacked their bassist in late 2005, the line up today goes as follows, Andrew Ferguson (vocals/lead guitar/rhythm guitar/bass guitar), Craig White (lead guitar/rhythm guitar/bass guitar), Iain Green (lead guitar/rhythm guitar/bass guitar), Steven Nelson (drums).</p>
<p>By 2006 each member are at the tender age of 16 but already have released a demo, an E.P, and a live album. Their meteoric rise through, mainly word of mouth has been astounding, basically fresh to the Glasgow music scene (they struggled to obtain bookings because of their age), they are making waves and are having glorious reviews from promoters and local journalists. Having sold close to a thousand copies of all their material and through the wonder of technology currently have their music available to millions of people across the world. 2006 has been a breakthrough year for the Dumbartonians but 2007 is being tipped as the year Mellfiluous rise throguh the ranks.</p>

<p>Deerskin Gloves vs. Cowhide Gloves April 20th, 2006 by Paul Deerskin is one of the most difficult leathers to work with, both in it’s tanning process, and in the making of leather goods. This, and limited availability, prevents it from being a leather that can be stamped out and sewn into products by the millions using inexperienced labor and many common mass production methods. When done properly however, it produces one o the strongest, softest, most durable, and comfortable gloves you can wear.</p>
<p>A properly cut deerskin glove has stretch width-wise and very little stretch lengthwise. This means a snug fitting glove that will expand with your hand when you make a fist or grip something, but the fingers won’t stretch or become floppy.</p>
<p>The physical structure of deerskin leather is different than other types of skins. It’s elongated interwoven fibers give it an extremely high shear strength and abrasion resistance. The spaces between the fibers make the leather soft and comfortable over a wider range of temperatures than others. In other words: cooler in the warm weather and warmer in the cold weather.</p>
<p>The combination of a naturally superior leather, tanner, cut, and sewn by experienced crafts people using age old processes, results in a product that truly “fits like a glove”.</p>
<p>Unlike man-made materials that appear flawless, any skin has surface scratches and scars, etc., and contain subtle variations in color and texture resulting in natural markings which add to the uniqueness of each item. These variations in no way affect the durability or performance of the glove. Normal use will enhance the character of this leather.</p>

<p>A hamlet in central Allegany County, NY, where Campen Creek meets the Genesee River. It is the site of Villa Belvidere, a stone-and-brick estate built in 1810 for Western New York land baron Phillip Church. Local lore holds that Church, a New Yorker who was related to Alexander Hamilton by marriage, decided to move upstate after a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr. Such stories usually include a tale about Church having purchased the pistols that were used in Burr's 1804 duel with Hamilton. Today, Belvidere is located near the intersection of State Route 17 and Interstate 86, north of the Village of Belmont, the county seat. According to county histories, the Belvidere site was first settled in 1803 by John T. Hyde, who came from Andover, in southwestern Allegany County.</p>

<p>There are a lot of remix albums out since Jay-Z dropped the "BLACK ALBUM" acapella on vinyl and it seems like it is the perfect fad for any up and coming producer to have Jay-Z on one of their beats; even if its unofficial. But 9th Wonder's Black is Back remix album stands out as one of the best because of his original production work. 9th Wonder has been getting critical acclaim for his work since his production on "Threats" yet he does two more remixes for the same record on "Black is Back!" This guy should be "Rookie of the Year" as a new producer. This remix album explains that he is truly a genius behind the boards. 9th Wonder did not miss with this remix album as every track that he did on it is production wise above par. The stand out cuts on the album that makes this one to obtain are "99 Problems", "Dirt off ya Shoulders", "Justify my Thug", and "Allure(one of the hottest beats for a underground head to appreciate)! 9TH even goes back to the style of production done on the "Black Album's 'Threats" with Lucifer and Threats 2 with De'Angelo's "Devils Pie" and Mary J Blidge's "Only One You Need" samples. With all these remix albums available this is among the best out for Jay-Z's the Black Album!</p>

<p>Since his birth in Greece Tomaas Proitsis was surrounded by music. Born in Goumenissa and grown up in the area of Thessaloniki, he became already in small age conscious that music and art can move people. Traditional Greek music, in addition, gypsy music, with the clarinet as the central instrument, were his first influences that shaped him in recent years much. Tomaas mother, a passionate Singer, his cousin 'Grigoris Bagiokas' a national known Bouzuki and Lyra player, and his brother 'Jorgos Proitsis' Guitarist and Composer, continue with him the musical tradition within the large family. Tomaas and his brother Jorgo moved to Germany when they were 7 years old. Since that day Tomaas Proitsis has constantly developed his musical culture , with the result that he now is a very recognized musician. Proitsis had a couple of profound teachers on his way, but as the most important influence he calls 'Bruce Johnson' from New York. With him he studied American Jazz on the bass. Jazz is the teacher, Funk is the preacher (James Blood Ulmer) ... PEACE!</p>

<p>According to <i>The World Of Kong</i> book, distributed by the <a href="../../../w/e/t/Weta_Workshop_5a55.html" title="Weta Workshop">Weta Workshop</a>, the Lowlands of <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_Island_8e78.html" title="Skull Island">Skull Island</a> were on the eastern side of the mountainous spine that intersected the landmass, in which a network of rivers and waterways weaved through a wide land of country, swathed in low shrub and patchy grasslands. It is said many of the most captivating and domineering animals dwell there, some of which are listed below.</p>
<p><i>Brontosaurus baxteri</i> (Baxter's thunder lizard): A sauropod dinosaur, growing up to 80-120 feet in length. It is almost certainly the largest animal on the island.</p>
<p><i>Ligocritus innocens</i> (Hoe crest): A dinosaur of hadrosaur ancestry, and the most numerous herbivorous animals on Skull Island. These grew up to 26-34 feet long, and were a primary source of prey for all predators in the lowlands.</p>
<p><i>Ferrucutus cerastes</i> (Horned iron-hide): A <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceratopsian.html" title="Ceratopsian">ceratopsian</a> dinosaur. <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrucutus.html" title="Ferrucutus">Ferrucutus</a> could grow up to 24-34 feet long, and is, without a doubt, one of the most impressive animals in the lowlands, if not throughout <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_Island_8e78.html" title="Skull Island">Skull Island</a>.</p>
<p><i>Calcarisaurus ieiuniosus</i> (Hungry spur lizard): A dinosaur of ankylosaur appearances, growing up to 5-7 feet in length.</p>

<p>The Prairie League was a proffesional baseball league that operated from 1995-1997. Like many of the independent leagues that showed up between 1993 and 2003, it operated for a few years and then vanished. According to indyleaguesgraveyard.com, the league had 16 teams operate during those three years. As with most of the upstart independent leagues, the ballparks it used were not adequate for the professional level. Many were nothing more than large high school fields. For more information on the league, visit indyleaguesgraveyard.com.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-06_70b6.html" title="Edit section: Bulldog Wrench">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bulldog Wrench</span></h2>
<p>A Bulldog Wrench, broadly speaking, is a wrench that is designed to hold onto an object such as a bolt or pipe with great tenacity. One popular wrench to bear the Bulldog moniker was manufactured by the J. H. Williams Tool Company. It was made in several sizes from about 6 inches long to over two feet. The smallest size appears to be stamped steel while the larger sizes were high quality drop forgings, like other Williams tools. The Bulldog wrench is no longer made by the J. H. Williams Company, but similar tools often re-appear on the market as a “new miracle” any-size wrench. J. H. Williams is now a division of the famous Snap-On tool corporation. In particular, the Williams Bulldog wrench was a form of alligator wrench. This class of tool has a V-shaped opening with one side of the V toothed or serrated and the other side smooth. The difference in friction between the sides caused any object gripped to tend to force itself more tightly between the jaws. This occurs when the pull is applied from the side with the serrated jaw toward the side with the smooth jaw. As soon as force is applied in the opposite direction, the tool slips, and a ratcheting effect is created. Bulldog wrenches and alligator wrenches in general have declined in popularity because they invariably leave severe tooth marks on the object to which they are applied. Williams Bulldog wrenches are somewhat popular with antique tool collectors, as are other forms of alligator wrench. They can still be useful emergency tools doing the work of a box full of normal wrenches and pipe wrenches, if the damage they cause can be accepted.</p>

<p>F.l.o.p.s technology allows an nVidia 5950 Series (or higher) to run HDR and AA/AF at much higher processing speeds by converting the graphics code into math code, which the GPU's can process at much higher rates. Think of having a Pentium 3 500mhz doing nothing but math, and add in the DDR2 ram and the fact that it does math 4x faster than a regular CPU.</p>
<p>F.l.o.p.s technology is currently only supported on Amd Athlon XP 2600+ (or Barton Core Semprons). It is also featured on Athlon 64's and Opteron's (only on the workstation cards).</p>

<p>Tomaas Proitsis | Greek - Born Bassist</p>
<p>Since his birth in Greece Tomaas Proitsis was surrounded by music. Born in Goumenissa and grown up in the area of Thessaloniki, he became already in small age conscious that music and art can move people. Traditional Greek music, in addition, gypsy music, with the clarinet as the central instrument, were his first influences that shaped him in recent years much. Tomaas mother, a passionate Singer, his cousin 'Grigoris Bagiokas' a national known Bouzuki and Lyra player, and his brother 'Jorgos Proitsis' Guitarist and Composer, continue with him the musical tradition within the large family. Tomaas and his brother Jorgo moved to Germany when they were 7 years old. Since that day Tomaas Proitsis has constantly developed his musical culture , with the result that he now is a very recognized musician. Proitsis had a couple of profound teachers on his way, but as the most important influence he calls 'Bruce Johnson' from New York. With him he studied American Jazz on the bass. Jazz is the teacher, Funk is the preacher (James Blood Ulmer) ... PEACE!</p>
