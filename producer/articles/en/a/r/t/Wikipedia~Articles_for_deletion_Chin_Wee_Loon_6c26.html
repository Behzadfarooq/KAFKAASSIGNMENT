<p>This article has been speedy 4 times, so I'll bring it here to get more eyes on it. The claim of notability is that he placed 4th in a competition for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Malays_National_Organisation_7fe0.html" title="United Malays National Organisation">United Malays National Organisation</a>. He says that is notable because the top 3 were Malaysian and he's Chinese apparently. No clue what this competition was or anything related to it, but it's not verifiable and it doesn't seem very notable. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wikipedia is supposed to report the truth and nothing but the truth. If you guys insist on deleting the truth of the article, then by all means do it, but remember that it is not an easy achievement for a Chinese to qualify for the top 10 in an UMNO-organized competition, moreover he is the only Chinese who participated out of more than 250 Malays. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelvincwl_ae4b.html" title="User:Melvincwl">Melvincwl</a> 17:27, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>First of all, welcome to Wikipedia. Second, Wikipedia is not supposed to "report" anything at all. This is an encyclopedia, not a news desk. Third, according to the article, 8 out of the top 10 were Malays; Chin Wee Loon wasn't the only foreigner to win. In fact, that means 20% of the winners were not Malays. Doesn't seem like that big a deal to me. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 17:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>1 finalist is Indian, 1 finalist is Chinese. This is a "Dividing the cake" illusion to cover the fact that <a href="../../../u/m/n/UMNO_00ba.html" title="UMNO">UMNO</a> is hugely in favor of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malays.html" title="Malays">Malays</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonytypoon_ec73.html" title="User:Tonytypoon">Tonytypoon</a> 17:38, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm even more convinced now that this is a vanity article - <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonytypoon_ec73.html" title="User:Tonytypoon">Tonytypoon</a> has added images of someone called Melvin standing in front of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_City_Hall_33d6.html" title="Belfast City Hall">Belfast City Hall</a> and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_in_Ireland_a31b.html" title="Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland">Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland</a> to these two articles (which, of course, have been reverted). I don't know whether "Melvin" (seen here: Image:P1010171.JPG and Chin Wee Loon (seen here: Image:AABnWL.jpg) are the same person, but if so, this looks like a case of sock puppetry, as well as vanity. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 17:54, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dear Kafziel, firstly, thank you for your welcome. Secondly, what I mean by reporting is presenting an article which is true. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, and as such the public has every right to view certain information pertaining to certain people of interest. And by the way, it comes with a reference with a video clip on an official website which can be accessed anytime. You cannot put in a mathematical way that 20% of the winners were not Malays. Did you know that out of 250 Malays who joined the competition, there is only one Chinese who was in the competition and yet, he made it into the top 10. It is certainly not an easy task for a Chinese to get in what more to win 4th placing. I hope you will get my point. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelvincwl_ae4b.html" title="User:Melvincwl">Melvincwl</a> 18:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear all, I just want to put it this way that if Wikipedia does not present a true article which comes with adequate references, I do not think it is a credible encyclopedia after all. And somebody mentioned that this is a conspiracy theory. What an immature way of discrediting an article. There is no conspiracy theory at all. It is not even an article of opinion nor speculation. Who wants to waste time in making a mockery or puppetry out of somebody who is credible?</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as above.

<li>Dear Bwithh, even you'd agree that given <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketuanan_Melayu_a5b0.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a>, it is indeed a significant achievement for a non-Malay. Isn't this a crucial point for a free and open encyclopedia such as Wikipedia to allow Chin Wee Loon as a clear-cut example of how hard work and determination can make you successful anywhere you are as long as you have an objective in life. And can somebody please take down the 'this article is for deletion' and 'this article needs a clean-up'. I have already shorten the profile and include in only important things as required by a stub's criteria (which is a short article). Thank you.

<li>Dear Metros232, while I appreciate that you had your name published in newspapers, this is indeed an extraordinary achievement for Chin Wee Loon. It is at least not typical vanity profiles such as <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xia_Xue_4cdf.html" title="Xia Xue">Xia Xue</a>. I just do not get it why Wikipedia allows profiles such as <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xia_Xue_4cdf.html" title="Xia Xue">Xia Xue</a> when it is clearly vanity.

<li>Dear Kafziel, this discussion will not be done unless those scrutinizing this article understands the significance of the article. I believe there is even bias on those who are determining whether an article should be deleted or not deleted. The profile page is now edited to be as concise and precise as possible. While I acknowledge that Wikipedia is not teaching people about hard work and stuff like that, what that has been presented in the article is very true and comes with references. Thank you and I hope this article will be permanent in Wikipedia. Of course, if anybody feels there is any correction or error, the article is open to editing any time. Thank you very much.

<dd>It's not up to you to decide whether or not it's a conflict of interest. Obviously you wouldn't think it was.

<li>Please do not delete this article. It has more than enough notable explainations and references substantiating it. Why nobody ever bothered to view the video under references? I did not see any comments on this. It is not like writing an article blindly. Besides, how sure are you that other contributors never have a COI with the subject? As Wikipedia is a free and open software, anybody can edit it without even informing the admin about any COI. For one thing, I can be editing about someone else's profile and tell that person later that I was the one editing it. Or alternatively, that someone can be told in advance that I am going to edit his profile and he agrees to it. What have the admin got to say about this issue?

<p>- * How can you claimed that this article is not notable enough when even a citizen from Hong Kong sees its significance. There must be something important in this article, that is why he highlighted and posted it in Wikipedia. By the way, I did not in whatever way instruct him to write about me. This is purely his effort in bringing up the page. If the admin thinks this article is not fit to be in the software, so be it. I hope the admin will weigh the pros and cons before deleting this article. But this discussion has changed my perception about how Wikipedia is being handled by its patrollers. I can sense that some of the patrollers are indeed immature and not thoughtful and analytical enough in criticising an article. If you were in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> or have experienced the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian.html" title="Malaysian">Malaysian</a> way of life, I can certainly guarantee you that you will know what is going on. And please do not just turn a blind eye on it just because one is not notable enough. He or she may not be notable to you but to some of the population in a country, it matters very much. This is my last post and I hope everybody will be liberal enough to see some of the points that I have raised. Thank you all.</p>

<li>Second the above motion to speedy, but I've been so involved in this that I'm not going to do it myself. Anyone else? <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 23:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm all for speedying this. I was seconds away from doing it when I first nominated it, but then I noticed all the speedys in the past and figured it's time to actually show the user there is a consensus to delete this. I think there's an overwhelming consensus here for delete and would support a speedy delete (obviously I won't carry it out myself as the nominator). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 23:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(Edit conflict...) P.S. The nominator's reason for bringing this here instead of speedying again was to get some extra input - I think this has been achieved now! <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a>

<li>Who finally "speedy" this please give me a sound reason in <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonytypoon_3c51.html" title="User talk:Tonytypoon">User_talk:Tonytypoon</a> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonytypoon_ec73.html" title="User:Tonytypoon">Tonytypoon</a> 23:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have reverted the Speedy Tagging (second time). The speedy tagging by an anon IP was out of process. The reason given - that 4 people in afd had asked for Speedy Delete and therefore the afd is a waste of time - is not sufficient. If a majority of people&#160;!voted in this afd discussion for Delete/Speedy Delete, and there is no significant opposition, than an admin may decided to invoke <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. Repeated tagging of the article as speedy delete by an anonymous IP who dismisses this afd discussion as a "waste of time" is improper <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'd just reinstated the speedy tag before seeing Bwithh's comment above, but I do feel that it should indeed be speedied. With regard to the "waste of time" comment, I don't think that Metros232's nomination in order to get more opinions was a waste of time - I think it was a very sensible move. However, in view of the opinions above, I do fear that keeping the AfD going <b>would</b> be a waste of time. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 23:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, that's what <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is supposed to be used for - CSD tagging is a separate process. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My understanding: Once an AfD has started it is <b>improper</b> to re-instate the speedy delete tag. If there are "speedy delete" votes, here, then only an admin can decide to end the discussion early and delete it. I voted to speedy delete it, so did others, that's enough. Generally when I speedy-tag something, an admin deletes the article within minutes. Notice how no admin pays attention to a speedy tag on an article that's involved in AfD. Leave it off, people. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 03:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Winning 4th place in this competition is not notable. If the 4th place winner was a Malay, you would agree that he is not notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If Chin Wee Loon were notable, there would be independent news sources provided explaining how he is notable. So far, no such sources have been provided at all. The only supporters of this article appear to be the subject and his classmate. How did the classmate find out about the subject coming in 4th place in the UMNO competition? Was it published in the newspapers in Hong Kong (where the classmate is from) or Ireland (where the classmate is a student now), or did the subject tell the classmate about it? This article appears to have significant problems with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Please note that the existence or non-existence of this article is not going to have much effect on ethnic relations in Malaysia, but if the proponents of this article are trying to convince us that the subject was relegated to 4th place in the competition (instead of winning) because of Malay nationalism and discrimination against Chinese, they will have to explain why the subject bothered to enter a contest sponsored by a Malay nationalist political party in the first place and why they gave him 4th place out of 250, placing him ahead of hundreds of Malays. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 15:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This doesn't change the status of the issue, but an official video of the competition is not an independent source.

<li><b>Delete</b>.First of all, I am Malaysian and I agree with the race barrier that do exist in a minor way in Malaysia, but then again, which country don't? Anyway, in accordance to wiki guide, winning the fourth place have no significance what so ever in my opinion. Second of all, knowing Chin Wee Loon a.k.a. melvincwl a.k.a. cwl personally, this article is strongly more of a vanity page than that of a notability article. He likes doing stuff like that with the mentality that it would give him a strong boost of sorts in the local political scene. That is a well known fact among peers. I steongly think this page should be deleted. Sorry Tony, it is the sad fact. I can verify Tonypoon is a seperate entity from Melvin but I should also point out that every defending point for the prevention of deletion of this article are all written by Melvin himself. Why would somebody defend his own autobiography? If there's significancy in the statements, many others would procceed to verify this and prevent it from deleting. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugenekoh306_a6fd.html" title="User:Eugenekoh306">Eugenekoh306</a></li>
<li><b>DELETE</b> - I'm Malaysian Chinese; I've never heard of this guy (not that that matters), he doesn't represent me or my race, and I'm telling him to knock it off with the using of Wikipedia as a vanity page to promote his political/personal aims. Do you realize at 34 kbs and growing, this debate is at least x20 bigger than the article we're discussing? If Chin Wee Loon or his proxies are actually defending this article from deletion, its quite plainly a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Delete it for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-notability</a>, 4th place is clearly not notable. To suggest notability by claiming that he was shafted by the competition, (implied racism here and in the article) is disingenous and dishonest. Was there an outcry that he was cheated out of 1st, 2nd or 3rd place? Did he return his 4th place award in protest? The answer is no. This is a self-serving vanity page. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 21:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
