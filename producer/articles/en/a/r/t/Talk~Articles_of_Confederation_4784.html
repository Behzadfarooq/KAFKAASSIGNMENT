<dd>Great Britain maintained a series of forts on American land along the Canadian border (the Northwest Posts), in violation of the peace terms, with the intent of creating general disturbance and rallying the Indians against American settlers. The Americans did finally succeed in getting the Posts removed, but IIRC this was not accomplished until the <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Treaty_8a49.html" title="Jay Treaty">Jay Treaty</a> of <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a>. Military campaigns against the tribes of the northern Ohio basin occurred as early as Washington's presidency. The moral basis of land seizure aside, it would have been difficult to keep order in this region with the army in a state of near-collapse. The Spanish likewise held outposts along the Mississippi River, but IIRC these posed less of a concrete threat. (If I had my old textbook notes available, I would be able to offer a considerably better-informed response to all of your queries.) -<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> 08:00, 18 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does this mean a revision of the articles of confederation, or was this revision the Constitution?

<dd>The Philadelphia Convention of 1787 certainly had no authority to produce an alternative document to the Articles. I do not know whether the Congress eventually sided with the Federalists or the Antifederalists. (This is purely speculation, but the fact that the Convention acted outside its authority with impunity may be yet another sign of the weakness of the central government at this time.) -<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> 08:00, 18 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 'plan' was actually a report of the Annapolis Convention (1786]. Congress slightly shifted the requested date and wrote a letter to the states endorsing the call for a meeting. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 08:13, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just my two cents: the "plan" endorsed by the Congress was a major revision of the Articles, to be ratified as such. What emerged was a wholly new Constitution which (technically illegally) superseded the Articles. Since all 13 states did eventually ratify, and if you make the case that the new constitution was a <i>de facto</i> amendment to the Articles, then it turned out legal. But the constitution was to take effect after the ratification of nine states, which means it changed the rules of amendment before it could legally take force under the old rules. Not that any of this matters in the slightest; its just fun. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeLord_mbw_f0bc.html" title="User:TimeLord mbw">TimeLord mbw</a> 06:10, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Was this issue (i.e., the improper adoption of a new "Constitution" without either repealing the Articles of Confederation or using its legal amendment process to change it) ever considered by the Supreme Court??</dd>
</dl>
<p>That would involve the Supreme Court making a determination of its own legitimacy, and if it found itself illegitimate, it would be unable to rightly determine its legitimacy. You can see the problem. Galen M 22:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The version of this page from Jan 14 to Jan 18 was wrong. I added material to the section on thee people who signed the articles that was inaccurate. I found it on the Web and it sounded good, so I paraphrased it and inserted it here. Further research showed me it was just plain wrong. I've emailed the site, and if they fix it, I won't name them. But I haven't yet gotten a reply. In the meantime a adjusted our description to match history. My sincere apology to anyone who was bothered by the changes.

<dd>I finally got around to fully sorting out the confusion about the signatures by spending some days reading the Journals of the Congress.

<p>I don't want to get into a 'wiki war' here (or whatever the term may be), but I'm not going to accept the interpretation that the Constitution created a single nation. The word nation appears NOWHERE in the Constitution in reference to the United States.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that when the Constitution was written, the terms "state" and "nation" were nearly coterminous. There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution that expresses or implies that a nation was being created. The term union is accurate, nation is not. That's why it reads "to form a more perfect union," not "to form a nation."</p>
<p>I'm compromising by not explicitly mentioning the fact that the states were originally, and LEGALLY are still today, INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGN nations. I'm compromising by just removing the offending passages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll disagree with this. First of all, your argument that the absence of the word 'nation' in the Preamble means that the Constitution was not intended to establish one has no weight. First of all, the original meaning of the word 'nation', and AFAIK the one current at the end of the 18th century, was a culturally cohesive group of <i>people</i>, not a political unit. Second, it seems reasonable to me that the authors of the document would hesitate to peg down in a single word the sort of "more perfect Union" they were creating, leaving that interpretation instead to the reader. I could go on about this, but I don't want to further belabor this peripheral point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your point itself, the states are not entirely independent, and hardly sovereign. Article VI says clearly that the Constitution itself, as well as all federal laws, are "the supreme Law of the Land", thus undermining the sovereignty of the states that existed under the Articles. Long before the creeping expansion of the powers of the federal government during the 20th century, a series of decisions of the Marshall Court put a stop to any insistence on state sovereignty. <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">--Smack</a> 00:01, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yet it remains that the a statement such as "The United States of America is opposed to..." is grammatically incorrect from the standpoint of the constitutional text itself. The proper construction is "The United States... are...". From which we may infer that neither a nation nor a state was created by the Constitution, but an agreement to act in concert--in union--was. The difference with the Confederation was that the people conferred supremacy on the union. --24.180.28.156 20:53, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the Articles were in name &amp; resolution, perpetual, were they not in effect until all 13 states adopted the new Constitution? So for a while perhaps both documents were in effect.

<p>You are saying that the old Congress sat until 9 states ratified the new one, and then no longer sat, am I right?

<dd>The Consitution did <i>not</i> take effect immediately after 9 states ratified it, it merely took 9 states to have it take effect. It did not take effect officially until March 4, 1789. As for the old Congress and the Articles, I am no legal expert but since the Constitution is the "supreme law of the land" and any other law that does not conform with it is void did that not automatically nullify the Articles on March 4, 1789 and therefore the old Congress disbanded then?--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 18:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some discussion about how government under the Articles failed would improve this article. This is actually what I was looking for when I searched for the page-- what were the inadequacies of the Articles that were corrected by the Constitution? For study about the Constitution, understanding how the historical events that demonstrated how the Articles proved ineffective is pretty fundamental.</p>

<p>I've been doing some extensive research on the Articles of Confederation and the events leading up to the ratification of the US Constitution, and this page does not approach the issue of the Articles in an unbiased or objective point of view. There needs to be editing so that the pros and cons are presented in a neutral manner, rather than simply the cons so as to explain why they failed.</p>
<p>The explanations contained in the article are true, and were the popular criticisms during the time period of the Articles, but they are not listed as criticisms or areas in need of improvement; just presented as fact.</p>
<p>There are many events and political explanations to explain why the Constitution was ratified after the Articles, few of which are mentioned within the page.</p>

<p>The USA became a real nation in 1775, not 1781. It had all the attributes of a real nation, such as the power to make war and sign treaties in the name of the USA. The 13 states all supported this nation. It was not necessary to have a written constitution to be a real nation-- Britain, France and other major powers did NOT have a written constitution. The article now makes clear the difference between de facto and de jure status, citing in this case a British treatise, Francis D. Cogliano, <i>Revolutionary America, 1763-1815: A Political History.</i> London: 2000. Historian Winton Solberg adds in 1775, "It immediately became the recognized revolutionary government, with its main task to conduct the war and lead the colonies ultimately to independence." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Editors who want to make changes need to have sources that support their changes. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I´m afraid the scholarship of Rjensen is suspect, or a form of <i>original research</i> by selecting <i>non-cannonical</i> research conclusions by others. The Declaration of Independence focuses on the power of independent and sovereign states to wage war, etc. <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-0289.00206?cookieSet=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-0289.00206?cookieSet=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Any standard review shows that confederation/constitution are the sources of political nationhood (nation-state): "Following the European colonization of the Americas, the United States became the world's first modern democracy after its break with Great Britain, with a Declaration of Independence in 1776. The original political structure was a confederation in 1777, ratified in 1781 as the Articles of Confederation. After long debate, this was supplanted by the Constitution of a more centralized federal government in 1789." <a href="http://www.politicalinformation.net/encyclopedia/United_States.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.politicalinformation.net/encyclopedia/United_States.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Hasta Nakshatra 06:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
