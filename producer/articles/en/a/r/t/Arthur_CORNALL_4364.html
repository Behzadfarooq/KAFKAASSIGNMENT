<p>ARTHUR CORNALL</p>
<p>Arthur was born in Preston, Lancashire on 29th April 1910. His mother was called Lucy, and his father, Robert Cornall was an Area Sales Representative for Carrs of Carlisle, a well-known manufacturer of biscuits.</p>
<p>The Cornall family moved to Stockport in 1914. Arthur attended Heaton Moor Methodist Church, where he met, and eventually married Greeba Varley on 21st May 1938. He was involved in several church activities such as concert parties; he wrote, and performed in, plays. At the age of seventeen Arthur began his career at the Midland Bank in Stockport.</p>
<p>Arthur and Greeba moved to a rented property at 10 Nessina Grove, Wistaston, Crewe when Arthur was transferred to the Midland Bank, Market Street, Crewe.</p>
<p>They had been married for three years when their only child, Jill, was born at the Kingslyn Nursing Home, in Church Lane, Wistaston in July 1941. Arthur was granted a fortnight’s compassionate leave to be at home for the birth of his daughter. Arthur played rugby for a TocH team, but was advised to give it up when he got married. He was an Air Raid Warden.</p>
<p>Arthur was ‘called up’ to the Royal Navy in 1941 and received initial signals training at Ayr in Scotland, and later trained on HMS Ganges.</p>
<p>Jill was two years old when her father died; she described him as tall (six feet) and slim. Arthur Cornall was killed on Friday 27th August 1943, aged 33 years. He was Telegraphist on board HMS Egret.</p>
<p>HMS Egret was in the first support group of ships, which was joined by ‘Grenville’ and ‘Athabaskan’, with orders to sweep an area of the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Finisterre for German U-boats which were using the Spanish coastline for protection. Shortly after noon on 27th August 1943, eighteen German aircraft attacked the ships using a new type of glider bomb (also known as Hs 293 bombs). These weapons had a wingspan of eleven feet and were carried under wings of German heavy bombers such as Do217 or He177. These glider bombs had small jet engines which started up when released and the parent aircraft was able to guide them by radio control towards their targets. The speed of these glider bombs was 300 to 400 knots and the explosive heads weighed 1,100 lbs. The Egret and Athabaskan were hit; the HMS Egret blew up and sank.</p>
<p>Arthur Cornall’s name is recorded on Panel 77, Column 1 on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial, on which is written, “In honour of the Navy and to the abiding memory of those ranks and ratings of this port who laid down their lives in the defence of the Empire and have no other grave than the sea.”</p>
<p>Arthur’s widow remarried in 1975, became Mrs Greeba Thompson and moved to Smalley in Derbyshire. She died in 1997. Her headstone in St Marys Church Cemetery, Wistaston includes the words “Arthur Cornall - killed in active service 1943, aged 33 years”.</p>
