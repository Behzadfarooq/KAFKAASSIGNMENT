Recreation of content previously at <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_%28currency%29.html" title="Phoenix (currency)">Phoenix (currency)</a>, which was deleted as advertising and replaced with a redirect to something unrelated. Subject matter is a non-notable private "currency" which hopes to replace the US Dollar following the dollar's collapse (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball). Until said event takes place, the currency in question is non-notable, being something that only a very small special interest group is even aware of (<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECruft_0d94.html" title="WP:Cruft">WP:Cruft</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is a Stub and wikipedia supports stub entries so that they may be expanded at a later time. We fully intend to expand this page to incude much data about what metal backed currencies are in general. We are now working on getting this done and we ask that you allow us enough space to improve the listing to be informative in a general way rather than just a stub as it stands now. The thoughts put forth above are not valid points. The Phoenix does not intend to replace the US Dollar and has never stated such a thing. That is a bold faced lie with the intent to harm the reputation of a solid private silver currency with thousands of clients. Also, noting that the currency is small is no reason not to allow a page for such a service. If the page is spam then I concede, but there is nothing wrong with having a page for a currency that is issued by private parties and wikipedia should support free market money. I also note that searching google pulls many results. You said google news which has no bearing on the merit of a business. Google does not determine a companies future and also is not a basis for judging a business or idea. It should be able to stand on facts and not search results. I suggest keeping the entry but expand it to include more data about what a private silver backed currency actually is and make it more informative. I would be happy to do that and will add to this article shortly.Fredhandlive 16:03, 5 May 2006 (GMT)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think it would be a good precedent to decide whether something should be included in Wikipedia based upon whether it has a high Google news position! That is a really disturbing idea to me--that one group could on wikipedia could decide that another group's interests aren't important enough because they don't make the news! This is a stub, and isn't particularly helpful yet, but it's not advertising anything, and as the poster above pointed out, stubs are supported by wikipedia. Also, the argument against this entry sounds a lot more like editorializing than the stub itself. I think perhaps this person has a vested interest? Also, there doesn't seem to be anything in the article about replacing US currency. Has that been removed already--because I tend to agree that the critique is a bit over the top. Anyway, just looks like a stub to me--why not see if those interested in it can expand it into something useful, then revisit this issue? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.35.13.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.35.13.130_edbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.35.13.130">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Were this a local currency, I would not be at all opposed to keeping it. Unfortunately, it is a non-notable private currency which has not yet attracted enough attention to merit mention in an encyclopedia, hence my listing of it for deletion. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 02:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance" "If people are free in any meaningful sense of the word, that means they are at liberty to foul up their lives as much as make something grand of them. That's the gamble we all take. That's the risk of liberty." Who are these people to dictate deletion, that the community i feel at liberty with are crafty nonsense, non-notable currency. If it is a non-notable then i am a non-notable entity who uses this currency for my own personal dealings with other community members. i noticed they give to children's charities, i do not see other non-notable companies doing the same. They have every right at having a mark on history in my opinion, every entity in this life makes up a whole for history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.9.16.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.9.16.77_b70c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.9.16.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>
