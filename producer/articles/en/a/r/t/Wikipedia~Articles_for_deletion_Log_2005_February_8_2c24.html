<li><b>Keep</b> agree that not <i>all</i> student newspapers are notable, but come on... this isn't Podunk Township Middle School we're talking about here.

<ul>
<li>That the university is notable does not automatically make its student unions, buildings, newspapers, academic staff, catering services, or groundskeepers notable. The worthiness of the newspaper has to be considered on its own merits. The circulation figure is one such datum. But I'm not quite persuaded by it. The (equally) free local newspaper that comes unsolicited through through my door every Thursday, and that I throw directly into the recycling bin, boasts an uncombined readership of 42000, nearly three times that of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cambridge_Student_f5ba.html" title="The Cambridge Student">The Cambridge Student</a>, and it too sports interviews with prominent political figures, campaigns on public issues, coverage of national news, features, and reviews. I'm not persuaded that <i>it</i> is notable on those grounds, so I'm not persuaded that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cambridge_Student_f5ba.html" title="The Cambridge Student">The Cambridge Student</a> is notable on solely the same grounds, especially given the pretty much identical distribution and funding mechanisms. Persuade me either that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cambridge_Student_f5ba.html" title="The Cambridge Student">The Cambridge Student</a> is somehow different to my local free newspaper, or that my local free newspaper is notable. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 06:18, 2005 Feb 8 (UTC)

<li>This paper will almost certainly contain contributions from numberous students who go on to become national figures in many fields. It is likely to be a leading training ground for distinguished colummnists and editors. But your local paper should also have an article. I can't understand why some people want to prevent Wikipedia from becoming a comprehensive guide to the world. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 18:51, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Student newspapers aren't inherently notable, but the main student newspaper at Cambridge University probably is, and indeed it has a Wikipedia article: <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Varsity (newspaper)">Varsity (newspaper)</a>. However, this isn't that paper. This article is about the free weekly put out by the Student Union at Cambridge for the last five years or so. I wonder if the people voting Keep even bothered to read the article. Notability not established. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:25, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Both the Varsity and TCS are free, and are both "main newspapers" in Cam although Varsity does have a longer history and is more notable, I believe the TCS is still notable enough for inclusion Fuzz 14:50, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Student newspapers do derive some of their notability from the notability of the university they're associated with, by virtue of the fact that the papers derive some of their capability to cover a wide range of things and their circulation from that association. <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Varsity (newspaper)">Varsity (newspaper)</a> is probably more deserving of an article in general, but that doesn't mean that this one is not. If the 15,000 circ. figure cited in this article is correct, that makes it a pretty good-sized student newspaper. (I worked many years for my college newspaper, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_at_Austin_7a6d.html" title="University of Texas at Austin">UT</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Texan_ab98.html" title="The Daily Texan">The Daily Texan</a>, the largest student newspaper in the US with a daily circ. of approximately 30,000.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 16:35, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> --- Hey, admins of Wikipedia?! Are you online? Listen to me really carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your user (Eclipse-vvrg) is trying to enhance Wikipedia project, to spread the word to the whole planet, that there on the Earth is one non-profit organization called <i>V.V.R.G.</i>. Like they said ... " V.V.R.G. ... devoted in education and aiming the youth to the genuine social, cultural and intelectual values and principles". They are good example for their environment. Someone will see their info at Wikipedia, and maybe this will stoke this viewers/readers to found similiar organization, to activate their young friends, to start some projects for the good of their community. Maybe <i>V.V.R.G.</i> and this new organization will have some together projects from which the whole and the only benefit will see our mother Earth, our global network, your local community Mr. Admin, your children Mr. Carrp (or Mr. Crap, I'm sorry but can't see too clear your name without my glasses),... Or, maybe Wikipedia is oriented to promote bad things, to encourage wars in the future? It must be that I missed that when I became a member of this community.</p>
<p>Try to read between the lines Mr. Admin. Aren't this "DELETE bunch" just a friends of Mr.Carrp? Or,.. maybe Mr. Carrp is an admin itself? God save Wikipedia if this is true! There are lot of intriguers all around. They just want to put their hands in every dish. Get your hands of <i>V.V.R.G.</i>! They are not English people, they are Macedonians, but however they want to spread their ideas to the world. They spread their ideas in English, the language that is not their native one. This is not a plus for them, to their contribution to Wikipedia?! They are not all so English-perfect like Mr. Carrp, but 99% they are. Let me see few sentences from some of this "DELETE buch" to write in Macedonian (the sentences can be no perfect, I will take them as correct). <i>V.V.R.G.</i> want their ideas/projects to be understandable for the bigger part of the earth's citizens, so are you have some problem with that?!</p>
<p>And what about Google? I think this is another project than Google Mr. Whatever! Are you an employee in Google Ltd? Aren't you promoting online search engine of a PROFIT ORGANIZATION here?! Is Wikipedia prohibiting new terms to be presented, other that Mr. Whatever, Mr. Howee Bee, Miss Broke E. knows&#160;?! Greenpeace was BIG/notable organization from the first moments (seconds is better term) of it founding?! Hah! V.V.R.G. is not notable?! So?! From when Google DOT <b>COM</b> is relevant factor to present some new term to Wikipedia?! Say "power to the big companies, smash the new non-profit organizations". That's your silent words "DELETE bunch"! I can smell that, and my respiration tract is clear as summer sky in Vratnica, Macedonia, believe me.</p>
<p>People, take the information (if you want it) and go further. This article about <i>V.V.R.G.</i> is just a plus for Wikipedia, not a minus. However, if my words wasn't enough to convince you to keep the article - then simply delete it. And don't put this kind of "voting pages" in future. Simply push the button (DELETE of course, not the one from the Chemical Brother's song "Galvanize"&#160;:) ). For sure You got the power (not that of "Snap", but however you got it). Another&#160;:) .</p>
<p>I'll monitor this page to see what will be the conclusion of the Wikipedia Crew. Just for info (nothing more, I swear): if <i>V.V.R.G.</i> 's page will be deleted, Wikipedia's links at few of my web sites will be not there anymore. I don't want to support someone who don't want to present earth's "things" to the human kind (V.V.R.G. don't ask to link back, they just point to their own web site to inform the world about their news/realized/and new projects in future - A NON-PROFIT WEB SITE, A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION; I don't ask to link me back neither, I am your user and I am enhancing O-U-R project ... Wikipedia).</p>
<p><i><b>V.V.R.G. (Vratnica Virtual Reality Group)</b></i> will continue to exist whether it is on Wikipedia (DOT ORG?,.. Hmm?) or not.</p>

I'm sure it's a wonderful organization, but it does lack notability. When a user believes that an article's subject is non-notable, they may choose to post a Vote for Deletion. This gives other members of the Wikipedia community a chance to express their opinions on whether the article should be included or removed from the encyclopedia. If it turns out that the subject is notable, the article is kept. It's a very common process and as you can see from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>, there are many other articles nominated for deletion. From the voting thus far, other users seem to agree that VVRG is not yet notable enough for inclusion. I wish you happy editing, although I do suggest you try to observe the guideline of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> --- Yes, Mr. Carrp you just noticed that there are newbies at Wikipedia, so give them support. They'll return to all of us with some new articles/stories for the things we don't even know they exited. And by the way I am not making any personal attack at Wikipedia users, that's my style of writing. No offense word was used in my "Support the V.V.R.G." article. They are all in function of my support to V.V.R.G. (to present better my viewpoint for this "case"). There is present "playing with the words thing", but that doesn't mean that I am attacking someone. Have a nice day/night! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeJay_8246.html" title="User:DeeJay">DeeJay</a> 20:00, 14 Feb 2005 CET</li>

<dd>I fully support the newbies of Wikipedia, after all, everyone here was once a newbie (except perhaps <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a>). This support does not extend to letting newbies add any page they wish. This is an encyclopedia and there's standards that an article must meet. When a user believes an article doesn't meet these standards, procedures such as this VfD come into play.</dd>
<dd>As for the "no personal attacks" comment, I was referring to when you wrote "...Mr. Carrp (or Mr. Crap...". Now, I wasn't very offended, but some people would have been. Insults don't help you to "present better my viewpoint for this 'case'". I do hope you enjoy editing here at Wikipedia and wish you the best. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 19:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> --- I am not an expert in English language, but in colloquial way (language) 'Crap' means 'whatever thing/things, anyone,...' (besides the bad meanings, that for sure I was not alluding to). In my sentence Mr. Crap means Mr. Whatever, like you can see in the rest of the comment.

The use of direct source texts of the "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">great books</a>" is a fairly interesting educational philosophy. Notice that this is not just a recommended reading list, these are (supposedly) <i>the</i> books used as the textbooks. I don't think there are many colleges other than St. Johns that do this, so it is a notable curriculum, not just any old typical liberal arts curriculum. It might be worthwhile to try to coordinate and refactor the articles on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Classics_6fb7.html" title="Harvard Classics">Harvard Classics</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World_93ac.html" title="Great Books of the Western World">Great Books of the Western World</a>, the two St. John's College articles, the St. John's book list, and, I dunno, maybe <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringfellow_Barr_352b.html" title="Stringfellow Barr">Stringfellow Barr</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortimer_Adler_468f.html" title="Mortimer Adler">Mortimer Snerd</a> (sorry, couldn't resist), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_W._Eliot_4a05.html" title="Charles W.

I've always wondered how the teaching at St. John's is actually done; I'll bet the professors have developed elaborate methods of subtle cheating to insure that students don't end up believing that combustion is caused by phlogiston and that light waves are caused by vibrations in the aether. Maybe the Great Books are the only <b>official</b> texts but the students smuggle in current textbooks and hide them inside copies of Playboy so they won't get caught? Maybe the upperclassmen trade lists of the books you <i>really</i> need to read in order to ace the tests? Just wondering...

<li><b>Keep</b>. For once, it is a coherent list that illustrates the notable and unusual curriculum of a college. I'd comment, by the way, that at a lot of the more demanding colleges the humanities undergraduates will read a substantial percentage of these books in their entirety and even more of them in part. Plus, they will read a great deal more besides. Depending on how much depth they go into, if this is the entire 4 year reading list, it seems a bit light. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:54, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there have been far less notable, trivial lists that have been kept on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - a book list is totally useless and does not convey anything. If this curriculum is important or unique than it should be written and expalined in the article.

<li>So, what would you think about "merge into <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_College%2C_Annapolis_9061.html" title="St. John's College, Annapolis">St. John's College, Annapolis</a> and delete?" The article(s) on St. John's do "explain the curriculum." BTW, I've done a bit of Googling on "perennialism" in various combinations, and so far St. John's is frequently mentioned as an example of a college using that philosophy, and I have yet to see a mention of <i>any</i> other college using such a philosophy or curriculum, so St. John's curriculum is notable as one of the few actual examples of such a curriculum in actual use. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:45, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: If there's agreement (which there currently isn't), I'm prepared to do the kind of merge-and-delete that merges histories, keeping things GFDL-kosher.

<li><b>Comment: Copyvio?</b> The article was contributed in almost its present form by User:Desert Pyrate on 28 October. Three edits to this article are his only contributions. The article is essentially the same text as <a href="http://www.sjcsf.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1302" class="external text" title="http://www.sjcsf.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1302" rel="nofollow">this list from the St. John's website</a>. Since then, there have been <i>scores</i> of edits by several editors, but virtually all of the edits consist of linking or fixing links in the names of the works and their authors. Since I want to keep the list, I'd like to think that there isn't a copyvio, but I dunno. An anthology of public domain work certainly can have a compilation copyright, but is its table of contents copyrightable? Is this just a list of names like a telephone directory, or does the creative act of selecting them make it copyrightable? Could St. John's sue me successfully if I were to start my own college and use their booklist as the curriculum? I'm probably losing the argument to keep this information anyway so it probably doesn't matter, but... whom to ask? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:32, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable in any possible way. What this boils down to is a list of books that in the opinion of this college are the most important in western literature.

<li>No, it's not inherently POV to report that "X said Q" or that "Group Y believes J" or "Institution Z holds core principles K," and such statements are encyclopedic <b>if</b> X, Y, or Z are important and notable. The issue is really whether St. Johns and/or its curriculum is a) notable, and b) notable enough to be worth including this level of specific detail. I think they are, since this is all part of the Great Books movement, and <i>which</i> books are considered "great" is important in understanding the movement. The article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Classics_6fb7.html" title="Harvard Classics">Harvard Classics</a> lists the actual contents of the volumes, and that makes it a better article than it would be without the list. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_perennialism.html" title="Educational perennialism">Educational perennialism</a> are significant, and St. John's is notable as a <i>reasonably</i> well-known, successful, well-regarded institution that actually puts these ideas into practice. I don't think the detailed curriculum of any old "good small liberal-arts school" like <a href="../../../h/a/v/Haverford_College_1d5b.html" title="Haverford College">Haverford College</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a> would be notable, and I don't think St. John's would be notable if there were a hundred schools that followed the same curriculum—but there aren't. (I've recently learned of two more: <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_College_f0db.html" title="Thomas Aquinas College">Thomas Aquinas College</a>, <a href="http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/" class="external free" title="http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/</a>, in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Paula%2C_California_d16a.html" title="Santa Paula, California">Santa Paula, California</a>, and <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutenberg_College_dd34.html" title="Gutenberg College">Gutenberg College</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene%2C_Oregon_1214.html" title="Eugene, Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, which are respectively Catholic and Protestant Christian schools with a Great Books curriculum). By the way, I think it's clear from my flippant remarks above that I am not personally thrilled by the Great Books idea; it's not <b>my</b> POV. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:27, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That name sounds familiar. Didn't we delete some high school vanity article by or about someone with a name like that a while back?

<li><b>Delete</b> while Radium5 does seem to exist, it's very obscure, with some 250 Google hits, most of which are "minor" things like URL matches, and only 1 Google Groups hit. If it truly had the sort of multibillion-dollar growth as described in the article, it would be a Fortune 500 company by now, which it obviously isn't. It's either deliberate fraud or a joke (the joke theory being supported by the final two paragraphs). If Mr. Melwing (or whoever wrote the article) happens to read this, I would like to suggest to them that it isn't generally a good idea to publically claim to have 40+ billion dollars when you really don't, as groups like the IRS and the CIA tend to take notice of such things.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Keep information, definitely. Does not much matter whether it is a separate article or merged somewhere, but I think there is enough content here now to warrant keeping. I don't agree that this is a precedent for a family of Cruft in Art articles, because bridges are <i>widely</i> regarded as having an aesthetic dimension.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Bridges can be aesthetic, like many designed objects, and partly because of this, they have been the subject of art works. So what? There might be something interesting to say about what makes a subject fit for a picture or a poem and why bridges fit those criteria. But that wouldn't be this article, since it is just a dumb raw list of poems, songs, paintings, etc that have some connection to bridges, in some cases a very slight connection. For example, it includes "Bridge TV", a cable channel that tries to bridge between opposing factions in the Middle East. If it is not deleted, at least it should be retitled to something like List of art works about bridges, and cleaned up. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:54, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the one hand, it <i>is</i> important to raise awareness of the fact that not everyone who looks like a skinhead is a violent neo-Nazi, a point that is raised at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinhead.html" title="Skinhead">Skinhead</a>. There is indeed a subculture of gay men who from their outward appearance are indistinguishable from Nazi skinheads, but they do not practice or condone violence and hatred (except perhaps, like members of <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinheads_Against_Racial_Prejudice_e1fa.html" title="Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice">SHARP</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Racist_Action_13f0.html" title="Anti-Racist Action">ARA</a>, against Nazi/racist skins). They just like the tough-boy look and the attitude.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This subject matter seems notable enough, but I don't know enough about Quebec (ie, I don't live there) to be able to verify if this term is in common use by the Québécois. If someone can tell me that this finds common use, I will change my vote to <i>Keep and cleanup</i> to remove some of the POV.

<li>The term has no official standing whatsoever and has never been officially used (or even commonly used) even by the previous sovereignist governments.

Go to the home page, go to "Accueil" → "Portrait du Québec" → "Politique" → "Institutions politiques", the term is nowhere to be found: it's simply "Le Québec". Same with the tourism portal <a href="http://www.bonjourquebec.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bonjourquebec.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bonjourquebec.com/</a> .

<li>"Jihad" and "Taliban" are commonly used in English; these <i>are</i> the English terms. In fact, they are now English words. Similarly, "Parti Quebecois" and "Bloc Quebecois" are the only English terms for these political parties; they have no other English names. These names are very commonly used in English-language media in Canada and Quebec, as Google shows. However, "État québécois" is not used at all in English, even in Canada or Quebec (as Google shows). This is not a loanword in English; it is simply never used in English, even among political scientists and other specialists. Occasionally you find use of "Quebec State" or "State of Quebec", but nearly always only as literal translations of those French documents that use them; native English documents or articles originally written in English essentially never use them. The term also has no official standing; the Quebec government website <a href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/" class="external free" title="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gouv.qc.ca/</a> does not use it, even in pages that describe Quebec political institutions in French (such as <a href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_120/.cmd/adj/.c/6_3_1F8/.ce/7_3_3TG/.p/5_3_2O0/.d/0/_th/J_3_CI/_s.7_0_A/7_0_120/_rp.7_3_3TG/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_120/.cmd/adj/.c/6_3_1F8/.ce/7_3_3TG/.p/5_3_2O0/.d/0/_th/J_3_CI/_s.7_0_A/7_0_120/_rp.7_3_3TG/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and subpages). And finally, simply read the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/a/%C3%89tat_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois.html" title="État québécois">État québécois</a> article... what information does it actually contain? Other than POV advocacy, it merely informs us that some (not all) francophones in Quebec would prefer to use this term... why could this information not be incorporated into a sentence or two in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_sovereignty_movement.html" title="Quebec sovereignty movement">Quebec sovereignty movement</a>? Why puff this up into an entire article? And by the way, it seems a much more common way to get around the P-word ("province") is simply to refer to "Quebec" (or "le Québec" in French), plain and simple. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 00:25, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

In French, it's common to use the word "état" where English would use "federal government", for instance "les relations entre l'État et les citoyens" would be idiomatic French for what in English would probably be phrased as "relations between the federal government and its citizens". In other words, "l'état québécois" in most contexts would properly be translated as "the Quebec government" and would not have the meaning of "Republic of Quebec" or "State of Quebec". -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:33, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, and just for the record, Samaritan's <b>25,000</b> hits for the term on Google say everything that needs to be said about its currency in Quebec. You've disputed the significance of the 800 government hits, but you haven't even touched the vastly more telling number. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:17, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I have touched on the fact that most of these cases are used in contexts where the usual English translation would be expressed idiomatically as "government of Quebec" rather than "State of Quebec". In other words, it's simply a way of referring to the government, judiciary, civil service and state apparatus as an overall institution, slightly more non-partisan than "gouvernement" since the latter could also be used to refer to a particular governing party in power, or just to the executive/legislative branch. In other words, most of these hits are <i>not</i> about the topic of the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/a/%C3%89tat_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois.html" title="État québécois">État québécois</a> article. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:47, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The other problem which <i>you</i> have not touched on is that all these hits are in French. Unlike <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_Quebecois_ca07.html" title="Parti Quebecois">Parti Quebecois</a>, the term "état québécois" is simply never used in English, as shown by Google (even by political science specialists, and even in English language media in Quebec where use of untranslated French terms is not unusual). So if kept, the article would properly be moved to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_State_a80c.html" title="Quebec State">Quebec State</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:47, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

(Also note that User:JillAndJack has inserted POV tags on several articles having to do with Quebec nationalism in the last day or so. He (She?

The existence of this term and information on its origins are quite relevant—it's what the government calls itself. I note that one of the early links in the Québec government Googling above is an open letter from the Premier of Québec (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charest_9dec.html" title="Jean Charest">Jean Charest</a>, also a federalist), and he seems to use <i>l'État québécois</i> as equivalent to the English phrase 'government of Québec'.

Since Google searches of the Québec government site seem popular, I should note that the term <i>Province du Québec</i> garners only 39 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Province+du+Qu%C3%A9bec%22+site%3Agouv.qc.ca&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Province+du+Qu%C3%A9bec%22+site%3Agouv.qc.ca&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, The expression <i>La province de Québec</i> has indeed fallen out of fashion some 45 years ago. In all Quebec official documents, Quebec is <i>Le Québec</i>, the province is <i>L'État québécois</i> (and yes, a province <i>is</i> indeed a state attached to some other) and the government is the <i>Governement du Québec</i>. This can be easily verified online at www.gouv.qc.ca. Nevertheless, this article has no use and I suggested its deletion to its author a while ago because I felft this was bad exemple of "everythingism". In other words, there is not enough matter to cover here and I don't think the use of a term that is only used in French anyways deserves a full article inside Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 13:44, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I wrote this article originally because I heard Mr Bennett on his concert tour of Universities in England this last summer and was blown away. The concert I went to was packed and the audience reaction was really, really amazing (8 curtain calls!). He had only announced the concert with a week notice as this is the way he seems to operate. After interviewing him I realized how incredible it was for him to write down those Horowitz transcriptions from the recording. Ruth Laredo and John Bell Young have called him a world-class pianist and the Chicago Tribune said "Sean Bennett commands the piano." --Evolving2 22:18, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>, I've made some corrections to his article - according to his website [www.seanbennett.net] he shouldn't be a student anymore, added some of the press reviews I found for him, and updated based on his CV that he has taught extensively at Cambridge University in both psychology and music. I took out the bit about "important" psychological findings as I don't know that they warrant this label, as I couldn't find much discussion about him as a psychologist (although a google search did turn up many hits). --Urbanguy1 23:27, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite its length and detail, this biography comes down to: he was a child prodigy as a pianist, won youth competitions (including a "secret" one), and gave concerts; it is claimed he is the youngest person to perform the notoriously difficult Rach 3; he went to Harvard College, and graduated with high honors (note, not highest honors, which wouldn't be notable either); he won a fellowship for a year at Cambridge, and now he is a graduate student at Harvard, where he has won an award for teaching based on student feedback forms; as a graduate student, he did some research, just like all graduate students; he's released a lot of his piano performances on mp3.com. However, being a child prodigy on the piano is not especially notable; going to Harvard and graduating with high honors isn't either; winning a fellowship is more of a distinction, but is still not notable; and releasing your piano performances through mp3.com isn't notable. This guy obviously has extraordinary potential, and deserves the honors that he has received so far. However, youth and student honors don't add up to notability. I'd give odds that he'll be notable enough for the Wikipedia one day. But he isn't now. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:47, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Rewritten</b>. I rewrote to highlight better why Bennett is notable. This included more clearly noting his Download records, and the unique contributions he has made to piano performance and the science of music, and making the entry less "ad like." I removed the psychological theory aspect as I agree at this point that this is not at the same level of notability as the music contributions. I still think that one of the most downloaded classical artists on the Internet with this kind of story deserves an entry in the encyclopedia of the Internet. He's changing the landscape of how classical music is heard. I reiterate: *<b>Strong Keep</b>! --Evolving2 19:14, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are still claims in the "rewritten" article that I know are inflated, such as the teaching stuff, and that leads me to doubt all the other claims of notability. For example, the author (and are you Sean, or Sean's friend? It might be time to come clean on that...) claims that he has taught at the University of Cambridge, although he is not listed in any recent list of the members of the university faculties or lecture-lists. <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2003-04/special/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2003-04/special/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> The award for teaching at Harvard (which would be called doing a teaching assistantship at any other U.S. university) which was supposedly notable appears to have been won by the teaching assistants of a mere 453 other classes <a href="http://bokcenter.fas.harvard.edu/progs/cue/CUEspring04n.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bokcenter.fas.harvard.edu/progs/cue/CUEspring04n.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<li>Grouse: you should be more careful of your accusations before you make them. This is not the first time you have made incorrect accusations. Mr. Bennett was a lecturer of Keyboard at Cambridge for the Music Faculty in 2003-2004, and from 2002-2004 was Supervisor in the same department for the following subject areas: IA Analysis and Set work, IB Analysis and Repertoire, IB Advanced Keyboard, II Performance (essay and piano coaching), Dissertation (IB and II, piano literature/composers/performers, performance practice, psychology/neurobiology of music, popular music 1955-present, history of American music 19th century-present). Also listed as available supervisor for Music and Science. He taught for three summers at Cambridge through the Oxbridge Academics Program as the Psychology Professor (2002-2004). Contact the administrators for the department of music at Cambridge if you'd like further verification of his teaching experience or qualifications (available at mus.cam.ac.uk). Additionally, the article does not claim anything about his teaching award at Harvard that was not true: Mr. Bennett was a "Senior Teaching Fellow" at Harvard during the said period, and was a Non-Resident Tutor of Psychology at Pforzheimer House (all in his CV), and won the Bok Award for the said period. He was not a teaching assistant, as he was not a graduate student. The rewritten article does not highlight this award as one of the most notable of Mr. Bennett's achievements, merely provides it as ancillary information to give a more complete picture of the individual (but to further drive the point, using your logic, is a Grammy winner non-notable because hundreds of others have won Grammys before?). As said before, I am a fan of Mr. Bennett and have followed him and his career since hearing him in concert last summer and believe that he is notable. I'm sorry you don't believe so, but kindly request that you check more carefully before making further comments that falsly undermine the article I've spent a lot of energy writing. Perhaps the highlight of Mr. Bennett in the Chronicle of Higher Education as "one of the future world leaders" will establish his notability for you: <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~gradgrnt/v13n3/futureleaders.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiana.edu/~gradgrnt/v13n3/futureleaders.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> -Evolving2 04:25, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see how I have made any incorrect claims. Mr. Bennett is still not on the published lecture-list or list of faculty for Cambridge at that time, which he would be if he were notable. Being a supervisor in this context, meaning a graduate teaching assistant, is not notable. Calling someone who teaches high school students in a summer program a "Professor" is just plain silly. You are welcome to describe how the role of a "Senior Teaching Fellow" differs from a teaching assistant, but it is definitely not a member of the faculty (which would not automatically be notable). If someone won a Grammy Award but it were only for a local area, and there were about 900 other awards given annually in that local area, then yes, I would think it non-notable. And if they <i>then</i> tried to compare that to winning a national Grammy, then I would think it inflation of their accomplishments. As usual the Chronicle article does not even say what you claim it does. And if you are not someone who is close to Sean, have <i>you</i> verified the information he has provided on his CV? How? --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 13:12, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Cambridge routinely hires its Keyboard Lecturers late in the annual cycle because the number depends on the number of undergraduates who chose to enroll in the Music Tripos. That is why M. Ennis (Faculty Board Chair) is listed, and the others are not (but again, this doesn't mean they weren't there, teaching, under the title). Anyone who knows or understands Cambridge realizes that the bureaucracy there precludes them from making timely updates, particularly in University documents. Professors as well as advanced graduate students are referred to as "Supervisors" at Cambridge so again you have erred (and they are also paid in accordance with the approximate per-hour pay schedule of listed Lecturers). Mr. Bennett was given the title Senior Teaching Fellow at Harvard because of his experience as an instructor at Cambridge, and its not exactly as if his award teaching was non-notable: most would agree that Harvard is one of the top universities in the world so where are teaching accolades more meaningful? He nor I picked the title "Professor" for his involvement with the Oxbridge program. Excuse me for my slight error: if I move the quote two words forward, then indeed the Chronicle Article does indeed refer to Mr Bennnett as a "Future World Leader" (see title).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry you continue to be loosy-goosy with your pot-shots against Mr Bennett, but your insistent attempts to nit-pick at ancillary points (and to continue to do so incorrectly, not to mention your grills regarding my comments in this forum, which are not fundamentally at issue) are weakening your fundamental argument against Mr. Bennett: that you claim he is not notable. If anything, you are merely exposing that Mr. Bennett is a lot more notable than I originally portrayed in the article or its rewrite. I'm not sure what level of verification you want from me short of seizing copies of Mr. Bennett's bank deposit slips and diary entries. As far as I'm concerned, his recordings, freely available on the web, are reason enough to make Mr. Bennett a pianist of note and worthy of his entry in wikipedia. Everything else about him just adds to his collective notability, and I've been careful to include things that I am sure are true. --Evolving2 17:51, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As a graduate student at the University of Cambridge, I am well qualified to know what a supervisor is. Indeed I have a supervisor who is a senior researcher, and I have friends who are first-year graduate students who are supervisors. It is a word that means nothing without context, and as I said, in this context he was a graduate teaching assistant. Even when pressed you have not indicated that there is any difference between the duties of a Senior Teaching Fellow and a teaching assistant, and I am still waiting for evidence to the contrary. Claiming that <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> called Sean a "future world leader" because the title of the article refers to other organizations are trying to pick future world leaders, is as spurious as your claims that <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> said he "commands the piano" in what turned out to be a photo caption. It is the context that is what is missing from these claims, and that is what I am providing.</li>
<li>If you are a graduate student at Cambridge (and I'm assuming that this latest reply was an unsigned one from grouse), wouldn't that give you jealousy as a motive for trying to discredit Mr. Bennett, who recently was a graduate student at Cambridge also? And why did you not know the difference between a supervisor and a graduate teaching assistant in the first instance (or again, as I've mentioned many times, are you not being accurate?)? And why, when Mr Bennett was a Lecturer of Keyboard (which are hired in their own right, not through the normal supervisory process), do you continue to discredit him as a "graduate teaching assistant"? Furthermore, you never asked about the *duties* of a Senior Teaching Fellow at Harvard: in fact, as far as I understand, they have more of a say in the manner in which the course is conducted and grades are assigned in a course than a regular teaching fellow or teaching assistant (and are additionally compensated to reflect this increased duty). I'm sorry, but the comments regarding Mr Bennett from the Chicago Tribune and Chronicle are accurate, and any reasonable person would agree that I have portrayed these accurately. The Chronicle article was about picking future world leaders, and Mr. Bennett was profiled, along with a handful of others who I'd also claim were profiled as "future world leaders." The Chicago Tribune did say that Mr Bennett "commands the piano" in the context of an even more glowing article/review. What is your real problem here? Is it that you are uncomfortable with your present accomplishments as a graduate student at Cambridge and the fact that they may not be wikipedia worthy? Is it that you might be threatened by the fact that I too am a graduate student at Cambridge who now knows of Mr Bennett and supports his work and that somehow offends you? If this is a personal beef with me or Mr. Bennett, as I'm beginning to think it might be, I suggest you take it off this forum. You are wasting my time and that of the others who have taken the time to chime into this debate about Mr. Bennett. Your attempts to anger me just continue to allow me to expose the depth of Mr. Bennett and thus, his notability for inclusion in wikipedia. --Evolving2 03:24, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a tough one. Looks like patent nonsense, and was proposed for speedy delete, but is it possible that this thing really exists and the "smuckerata" (reference to Smucker's Grape Jelly) is merely due to a scientist with a sense of humor? No google hits, but that's not surprising for an obscure species. Someone is going to have to dig deep and research this. Note there were edits to <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jellyfish.html" title="Jellyfish">Jellyfish</a> linking to here, which I reverted... the first edit seemed legit though.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm going to take a chance and speedy delete this. I just don't believe it. I don't think "vinae" is good Latin for anything, sounds too much like the word for "wine" in Romance languages, I don't think "smuckerata" is the proper Latinate form (binomens are often not real Latin but they're supposed to have proper Latin endings that follow Latin rules of grammar). I'm no maven on systematic Latin but I think a genus name would be a singular noun and I don't think singular nouns end in -ae. I think it's odd that I can't get any Google hits on "vinae cnidaria" or "vinae ctenophora" or "vinae coelenterata." "Most deadly jellyfish in the world" is so notable that you'd think I'd have vaguely heard of it and you'd certainly think the scientific name for it would Google.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The jellyfish usually cited as the most deadly are the sea wasps or Cubomedusae, found on the Australian Great Barrier Reef, and if again there were a "vinae" species again you'd think "vinae cubomedusae" would Google.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the description sounds wrong. I've never heard of a (true) jellyfish without tentacles. There <i>are</i> jellyfish without tentacles that <i>do</i> look rather like grapes, but they are the comb jellies or Ctenophora, also called sea gooseberries, which do <i>not</i> have nematocysts and are not venomous. I know someone who ate one to prove it. He said it basically tasted like seawater-flavored Jello. Oh, and I don't think the surface membrane of a jellyfish is ever called "epidermis."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, systematists do make jokes, a worm <i>Golfingia</i> (found by its discoverer while golfing) being one of the knee-slappers; another named a bunch of species <i>all</i> after his wife Caroline by using anagrams (Cerolina, etc.) But I've never heard of a brand name being used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the chances that someone who can't spell "prey" or "leisure" knows about some really obscure species that is obscure <i>despite</i> being world-class deadly seems unlikely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So out it goes. If someone finds a proper reference I'll apologize humbly.

<dd>The Vinae Smuckerata, also known as the Grape Jellyfish, due to its small size and purple color, is one of the most deadly jellyfish in the world. While it has no tentacles, its epidermis is covered in powerful nematocysts. On contact these kill and adhere to it's pray, allowing the jelly to digest it at its lesure.</dd>

<li>Abstain, but note that the title of this article and what it concerns itself with are incongruent. "Jumping the shark" (sorry for the spoiler) refers to the point when a show's ratings show it has passed its prime; the article concerns itself with casting changes. Not the same. The title, though not the body of the article, also raises POV concerns. If this discrepancy can be rectified, worthy of an article. We have dumber lists. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:58, 2005 Feb 9 (UTC)</li>

For example, of course the Monty Python one was a no-brainer; since John Cleese has been highly praised for his work in the troupe, the show would have had to jump the shark if he ever left; and he did, so it did.

<li>This is funny; the title has changed, but clearly not the content to match. "Sanford and Son, when the show started using Grady too much." How is that a casting change? Aaron Sorkin quitting the West Wing? There was a brief discussion on the <a href="../../../j/u/m/Talk%7EJumping_the_shark_a898.html" title="Talk:Jumping the shark">Talk:Jumping the shark</a> page about the removal of the list that used to be part of the article. It was generally seen as a good move, as the list had ogtten ridiculously long and subjective. Mentioning a few of the best examples in the body of the article would be best (not as a list that people will feel the need to add to <i>ad nauseum</i>). This article, as it now stands, <i>might</i> be made encyclopedic, but presently is not. Most shows have had some sort of casting change at some point, and a mere list is pretty useless.

<dd>Adams Grammar School isn't a high school because it's not in the USA. It is a secondary grammar and sixth form though, which I would suggest is equivilent to a so-called "high school". And if you would look into the British education system a little more, you'd understand that there are in fact only 165 grammar schools remaining and even fewer debating societies - this one being founded in 1912! <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpaajones_4ea2.html" title="User:Dpaajones">David</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly, this is not a vanity because the people who created and have done much of the work on the page were not involved with the production of the film. Secondly, the film *is* notable because it is an example of the lengths to which some fans will go to show their enthusiam; it's a feature-length film based on Star Wars, done enitrely at cost and without any hope of direct financial compensation for their efforts. It is an example of the dedication some show to the Star Wars universe, as well as an excellent example of fan-produced fiction. — DoctorObvious 00:03, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> For the reasons listed above by Doc, this film is neither vanity nor non-notable. Further evidence of its non-vanity nature can be found by looking at the history for the page. But as to notability, I am curious about Asbestos' use of the number of Goolge hits as an item of evidence. When did Google hits become the Wikipedia measure of notability? How many are needed to become notable? Why is it OK for Wikipedia to have articles related to obscure subjects which may generate many hits but not ones which may generate few hits? Is Wikipedia owned in whole or part by Google? Would hits on Yahoo or some other search engine be acceptable? — <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerJ_1e7c.html" title="User:GunnerJ">GunnerJ</a> 00:15, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This standard would limit discussions of a large number of works of fan-fiction to the theoretical rather than concrete. Further, there is a big difference between "notable," meaning of note or interest, and "well-known."

<li>Can you please state your operating definition of "notability?" I don't think the word means what you think it does. Also, why isn't fan fiction "encyclopedic?" As a cultural phenomenom, it certainly seems to have a place of note in an encyclopedia.

<li>Taking your points in order, the answers are "more than 257", "if lots of individual people search for and/or link to them, they aren't obscure", "Wikipedia is not owned by Google", "Possibly; show us". As for your current argument, if the film was eighty-nine hours long and had taken one hundred people nine years of their free time to create then - even if it were an undiscovered masterpiece - it would nonetheless not be notable if it had not yet attracted significant attention in the wider world, or if was not in some other way highly influential and/or persistent. Frinstance, I believe that Kenneth Higney's obscure 1976 proto-punk/skronk lp 'Attic Demonstration' is a fantastic record which should have been huge, but it still doesn't deserve a place on Wikipedia because that's just my opinion. Wikipedia's notability standard does not lean heavily on folk memory.

<li>The question isn't about its independent status, the question is about its notability. Those are all serious productions and have generated a lot of media hype.

<li>The first definition of the word "notable" (as an adjetive) on dictionary.com is "Worthy of note or notice; remarkable." None of the definitions say anything about news wires carrying blurbs, or google hits. I'm having a hard time thinking of many fan-produced films of the same length and representing the same level of resource investment as TKAJ.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This does have a rather large bearing on the star wars fan community especially at Fanfilms.com and the forums attached to it. It pains me to say this but, the idea that people poured a huge amount of their spare time into one of the best examples of a fanfilm ever made, only to be trashed by people who are probably too shortsighted to see past their own nose and definatley didn't watch the movie and care only about technicalities is disgusting. If these people were in charge during world war two, this post would be written in German right now. It's a little harsh I know, but seriously folks, there is a large community that has interest in this out there. if the creators put up a whole bunch of money to put this in theaters would you stop complaining? Jeez, quit the nitpicking. Besides, isn't their an articleabout fanfilms on here too? Why aren't you complaining about that? According to SOME PEOPLE, their is no fanfilm community!!! And if there was , its a couple of guys with cameras and way too much time on their hands!

<li>DarthLowBudget, Wikipedia is not a vehicle for getting publicity and becoming notable. If the film you are describing is as important as you say, then it will become notable without any help from the Wikipedia. When it does, it will be a fit subject for an encyclopedia. Until then, it isn't. When people here say that it isn't notable, they aren't saying that the film is bad, or that it will never be notable. They are saying it isn't famous or notable enough now for an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:45, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is a Wikipedia entry for fan films already. This film, while significant in being one of the few to break into the "feature length" timeframe, has nothing about it -- no news coverage, no notable impact on the greater filmmaking or Star Wars communities -- that makes it worthy of its own standalone entry distinct from the entry discussing fan films in general. EDIT: Well, I THOUGHT there was a wiki entry for fan films, but I can't seem to find the bloody thing. If there isn't one, perhaps it would be appropriate to create one. DorkmanScott

<li><b>Keep</b> I saw this film almost a year ago, and have since gained alot of respect for the type of work it is. I didn't even know about the world of fanfilms until I saw this, and once I started looking into the other things that were out there, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. By and large, the other films out there seek only to create an excuse to experiment with sub-par visual effects and duel with lightsabers. This one is in a category of about 3% of those works that makes a genuine effort (and in many cases succeeds, but as DorkmannScott pointed out, does also fail) in establishing a unique, dramatic, and narratively driven piece that in my opinion, makes it exceptional. For those accusing this piece of having not been known, or seen, you're very mistaken. It's a staple amongst what I've discovered in the FanFilm world in the last year, and the fact that the Wikipedia crowd was unaware of its existence, I feel, is proof to the fact that such a film should be listed as an anchor to the FanFilm sub-category. People can argue if its "note-worthy" all they want. The fact is that if an effort like this, one well recognized in its own right, doesn't have a place in a sub-category on Wikipedia, then how the heck does the Star Wars "fat kid" deserve a listing for playing with a golf-ball retriever followed by his parents subsequently sueing the other pre-pubescents parents for posting the clip on the web? Gimme a break. If someone can successfully argue that that kid is more encyclpedic material than what I consider to be among the best in the Star Wars fanfilm category, please do. Perhaps then I'll vote a delete.--63.211.54.170 01:24, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The Star Wars kid received news coverage in various web and print media, a section on Yahoo!, numerous websites mirroring the site, a petition to put him in Episode III, a site dedicated to raising funds to pay him back for the laughs at his expense -- in a word, massive and global recognition. To Know a Jedi is known by a small handful of people on a few obscure internet forums. This is not the place to gain something recognition, this is a place to document something that is already widely recognized as a pop culture phenomenon. The "Star Wars Kid," for better or worse, is one. "To Know a Jedi," I'm sorry, is not.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've just watched the fan-film and after seeing it, I'd say it definately deserves a wiki-page.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have restored the article to the stub version before the anonymous editors started adding to it. It should be noted that the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori_Rasputin_66ee.html" title="Grigori Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a> mentions Richard Dewdney as a possible assassin and that information was there prior to the creation of this article. However, I cannot find any collaborating information on the web regarding this information. Most items I found credit <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Yusupov_c436.html" title="Felix Yusupov">Felix Yusupov</a> &amp; <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Purishkevich_143a.html" title="Vladimir Purishkevich">Vladimir Purishkevich</a> with the shooting. Unless someone comes up with a source, it should be deleted as unverifiable. But if deleted, the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori_Rasputin_66ee.html" title="Grigori Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a> article needs to have the info removed also. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 13:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The name to google for is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Oswald+Rayner%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Oswald+Rayner%22" rel="nofollow">Oswald Rayner</a>. The nonsense was added to <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori_Rasputin_66ee.html" title="Grigori Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grigori_Rasputin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35664952" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grigori_Rasputin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35664952" rel="nofollow">18 January 2006</a> by the above "robert brown", or someone else at Cirencester College, using the simple expedient of swapping the names for those of (presumably) his schoolfriends. Of course, it's important to be wary of assuming that one Wikipedia article validates another. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 15:31, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good work Flapdragon. I was starting to doubt my speedy vote and was all over the place searching for Dewdney. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 15:49, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks. I've patched up the Rasputin article, though I fancy it could still use some checking by a specialist. A joke's a joke (though not in this case a funny one), but this kind of childish prank wastes people's time, misleads the innocent, and seriously damages the credibility of Wikipedia. Time for (yet) another block for <a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.57.77.html" title="User talk:212.219.57.77">212.219.57.77</a> I think, and perhaps also a complaint to the college. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 16:08, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
