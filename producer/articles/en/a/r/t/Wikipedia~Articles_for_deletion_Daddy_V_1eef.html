<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>.

To that end, I did not delete Talk:Daddy V or Image:Daddyvpic2.jpg.

<p>I'm afraid that I can't verify much of the assertions in this entry. "Daddy V" or "Daddy Vick" doesn't have any of his work listed on allmusic, Google doesn't have anything really pertinent on his name, the name of his company "GFL Records" clocks up 17 Google hits, nine of which are unique – altogether this looks like the band vanity that we see too often. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:17, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I cleaned the article up, but didn't really see any notability (his website, which might have helped, is down). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 18:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are just like some kind of triumvirate or deletion-coalition of some sort. I hope you enjoy it. You should have visited the site <b>before</b> it went down. I don't know how you want to upkeep articles pending on the internet, because nothing is eternal there (in other words everything is temporary). I have done some link corrections myself on other pages because their link was obsolete, but didn't tag them for deletion. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 00:09, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>P.S.&#160;: I had to do a lot of web browsing til finding that page. <i>Google</i> only came up with www.daddyv.com, that was already obsolete (only the main page remained), then I changed to <i>Hotbot</i>, and it found on the 50th hit the www.ogdaddyv.com flash page, which was up to date with background streaming audio and so on...But never mind that. Need help? I would really join your Delet-o-mat ltd.
<ul>
<li>Note that both www.ogdaddyv.com and www.daddyv.com are down. How someone would dare even attempt to demand that we should have visited a down website <i>before</i> it went down is nothing short of ridiculous. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Verifiably performed with Snoop Dogg on Welcome to da Chuuch Vol 2 and 4, verifiably performed on at least one Eastsidaz album. Allmusic is not our guide. We aim to be much better than that. If I can hear the guy sing on a CD produced and presented by Snoop Dogg, I should be able to read about him on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>WP:MUSIC does not dictate what gets kept and what gets deleted. Wikipedia does. To attempt to pass off an article about this rap performer who has worked with people at the top of the profession as some kind of band vanity is a travesty. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:12, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>His companies don't show up in a web search, there is no proof for the assertion that he plays in the same league as Dr Dre and King Tee - the most that can be said is that he issued a bunch of mixes of Snoop Dogg's work. How much Snoop Dogg was involved is unknown - the article doesn't say, and I was unable to find any sources. We don't know how influential he was, I guess not very much, if he was someone would have noticed his work and reviewed it somewhere. Maybe <i>you</i> can bring up the article to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standard. If you want it kept you should. (Did I mention that I used to work with a member of the National Academy of Sciences and sometimes rode in the elevator with a Nobel Prize winner? I guess that qualifies me for an entry here.) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:24, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And my father was a Military Attorney General and I know someone who knows someone who has once seen a Nobel Prize winner's neighbour on the other side of the street. Are we in elementary school or what? And are you talking about Daddy V with these guys? It doesn't prove your level of intelligence (oh yes, sorry, It does - lowers it) <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 01:37, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WP:MUSIC does <i>indeed</i> dictate what gets kept or deleted. That's what it's <i>there</i> for. We've already determined that being on the same CD as a notable performer doesn't qualify you for notability yourself, if no other such notability is established (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Quan_723b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quan">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quan</a>)--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm pleased to confirm that FuriousFreddy is incorrect. WP:MUSIC absolutely does not determine what is kept and what is not kept on Wikipedia. It's merely an attempt to consolidate the consensus. Where there is disagreement (and there is clearly disagreement here) then it isn't much of a guide. Which is why we need AfD. Daddy V is on record on some CDs that are widely circulated; he isn't your local butcher, he's an artist whose work is circulated in every country of the world. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So new pages aren't welcome at <i>Wikipedia</i> because it may be out of some people's field of interest. I really saw much simpler pages without any reference with just a <i>stub</i> sticked on them. Is it a serious problem of that kind? <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 01:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I think the claims in the article should be verifiable with a bit of research. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 03:22, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The unverified bits are now on the article talk page. Maybe you have better luck than myself in tracking down information on the guy. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 16:25, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm fairly pissed now, JY. Instead of saying "verifiable with a bit of research", why don't you actually <i>do</i> your share of verifying? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 21:53, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm saying. If the research was already <i>done</i>, and proved fruitless, then how can we verify it. Wikipedia doesn't need an article on each and every underground hustler in existence, and I'm ususally the first one to try to have marginally known hip-hop acts kept. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not so concerned about that (you are the one fighting on the behalf of stubby articles). You attack EVERYONE who says keep it. But that doesn't change nothing. It's one vote for <i>Keep</i> and that's it. You will win anyway with your friends voted you for admin. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 21:46, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would behoove you to read the rules we have hear, particulalry <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. If someone has a good reason for keeping, I don't argue it. But if they don't, I do. Simple as that. And what kind of accusations...? "my friends I voted for admin?" Surely you jest. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 00:31, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
