Benjamin R. DeCosta assumed the leadership of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as aviation general manager for the City of Atlanta - Department of Aviation in June 1998. He has placed airport customer service and security at the top of his list of priorities. Mr. DeCosta and his staff are committed to ensuring that passengers enjoy visiting Hartsfield-Jackson and have developed a fitting mission statement, which is “to be the world’s best airport by exceeding customer expectations.” In fact, airport passengers participating in a worldwide survey conducted by the International Air Transport Association ranked Hartsfield-Jackson number one in overall passenger satisfaction for large hub airports in 2003.</p>
<p>Mr. DeCosta and his staff are more than two years in to a 10-year, $5.4 billion expansion program, called the Hartsfield-Jackson Jackson Development Program – “Focus On the Future.” Some of the major components of the H-JDP include a new fifth runway and a new international terminal. Hartsfield-Jackson-Jackson retained its title as the busiest passenger airport in the world serving over 76 million passengers in 2002.</p>
<p>Under Mr. DeCosta’s leadership, Atlanta’s airport has received numerous awards and national recognition in various areas including airfield safety. In fact, in July 2003, the Airport received an award from the Air Transport Research Society for being first in productivity and efficiency among 90 leading airports worldwide.</p>
<p>Prior to taking the position of aviation general manager at Hartsfield-Jackson-Jackson, Mr. DeCosta worked for the Port Authority of New York and served as the general manager of Newark International Airport.</p>
<p>A native New Yorker, Ben DeCosta received his bachelor of arts degree in physics at Queens College before earning his Juris Doctor from New York Law School in 1975. In 1984, he participated in a program for senior executives in state and local government at the Kennedy School of Public Administration at Harvard University.</p>

<p><b>History of the Society</b></p>
<p>The Oxford University Catholic Society (also known as CathSoc) was founded at the request of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> Chaplains to the University in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Term_9c10.html" title="Trinity Term">Trinity Term</a> of 1990, it was founded to "combat the extreme conservatism of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newman_Society_d6a9.html" title="Newman Society">Newman Society</a>" its constitution being ratified by the Committee and Chaplains in <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Term_4af5.html" title="Hilary Term">Hilary Term</a> of 1991. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newman_Society_d6a9.html" title="Newman Society">Newman Society</a> was primarily a speaker society which worked to provide intellectual stimulation to the Catholic population of the University. The CathSoc organises social events designed to aid social interaction, and provide a safe environment for entertainment within the Chaplaincy. On April 28th 1993 the Society gained the permission of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-Chancellor_a8cb.html" title="Vice-Chancellor">Vice-Chancellor</a> to be known as the Oxford University Catholic Society, amendments were made to the constitution in light of the Society's approved status in 1995 and it was deposited with the Proctors.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Activities of the Society</b></p>
<p>The Society, as is mentioned above, primarily organises social events; however, under the leadership of President von Wulffen there was a concerted effort to increase the charitible actions of the society, and thus there was a campaign to raise £5000 within two terms. The campaign is ongoing. At present the Society's biggest event of the year is the President's Dinner at which the current committee celebrate a year of serving Oxford's Catholic community. All previous President's, as well as all current members, of the Society are invited to attend. There are usually a series of after dinner speeches one of which is made by an outside speaker, this year the speaker was Rt. Rev. Christopher Jamieson OSB, <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbott.html" title="Abbott">Abbott</a> of Worth, last year the Society welcomed the Rt. Hon. the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes_18ee.html" title="Lord Patten of Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/_/CH_1ee0.html" title="CH">CH</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor.html" title="Chancellor">Chancellor</a> of the University. The Society is also known within the University for hosting Ceilidhs and Jazz Nights at which there is much dancing and frivolity.</p>

My apologies for the sketchy information I present. This is from an old Ripley's Believe It Or Not magazine from the 1970's--the berbalang (which has been taken up by various Role Playing Games or RPGs without credits) was a creature in Southeast Asia that masqueraded as a human being. For whatever reason, it desired to convert humans into berbalangs by feeding them some sort of special food. The berbalang food was disguised and could be revealed by the application of lemon juice, whereupon it would revert to its more obvious form. I remember that somehow berbalangs could be repulsed by pearls, or perhaps dissolved pearls would also reveal their food for what it was. The "professor" who wrote the article was an outspoken opponent of the berbalangs, but apparently fell prey to them and disappeared without a trace. I would greatly appreciate anyone who remembers this to help with this article.</p>

<p>Highsted Grammar School is a secondary school for girls only. Yes, that's all girls. Meaning no guys. None. Natta. Zip. This results in the majority of pupils from other schools calling Highsted pupils Lesbians. Which, ofcourse, couldn't be further away from the truth.</p>
<p>The average day of a Highsted pupil consists of 8 lessons. Though whether or not they learn anything is debatable.</p>
<p>A lunch break consisting of:</p>
<p>a) Eating in their form room. b) Being kicked out for the above, and so continue to eat in somebody else's form room. c) Get caught, and so turn to destroying the form room, etc, etc.</p>
<p>All rounded off with a nice meeting outside Borden concludes the day nicely.</p>
<p>Highsted Pupils aim for NO LESS THAN EXCELLENCE.</p>
<p>So please, do remember: roll down those skirts, tuck your shirt in, take that make-up off and remove that fake burberry scarf.</p>
<p>(Highsted also remains to have pupils in the top brightest 25% of the country. Though, this is Britain, it's not that hard a task to be considered 'bright'.)</p>

<p>People Inc. first organized the idea for the Museum of disABILITY History in 1998 after James Boles, Ed.D President and CEO of People Inc. discovered there was no museum or single education resource to send students to learn about the history of people with disabilities. In 2003, the Museum received its Provisional Charter by the New York State Department of Education Board of Regents and continues to be a project of People Inc.</p>

<p>The Museum’s exhibits, collections, archives and educational programs create awareness and a platform for dialogue and discovery.

<p>Aaron Robbins was born in 1983 in Rota Spain. He managed a 4.0 while attending Smoky Hill High School. Then received a scholarship to play football at the University of Wyoming. In 2003 he recieved honorable mention all Mountain West Conference as a Tight End. In 2004 he moved to Devensive End where he captured the starting role as a mainstay on the defensive line.Robbins entered the spring of 2004 coming off a very effective 2003 season as the Cowboys' starting tight end/h-back on offense, but he wanted to play defense. After expressing that desire to the Cowboy coaching staff, he was granted his wish and moved to the "Buck" (defensive end) position in `04 spring drills. He went on to start all 12 games in 2004. Robbins was always known for his aggressive style of play and punishing blocking skills when playing offense, he brought that same attitude to the defensive side of the ball, and immediately made the Cowboy front four more athletic. He ranked No. 8 on the Wyoming squad in tackles in `04 -- No. 2 among Cowboy defensive linemen -- with 44 total tackles. He also had 2.5 sacks and 8.5 tackles for losses. He used his athletic ability to break up six opponent passes at the line of scrimmage, and intercepted one pass against Ole Miss that led to a Cowboy field goal in UW's 37-32 home win. One of his biggest plays of the season came in Wyoming's victory over UCLA in the Las Vegas Bowl. After UW took a 24-21 lead with 57 seconds remaining in the game, the Bruins got the ball back with one last chance to try and win the game. After making one first down at the UCLA 37-yard line, UCLA's quarterback dropped back on first down to pass, but Robbins broke through to sack him for a loss of nine yards back at the UCLA 28. Two incompletions and one short three-yard pass completion later and the Pokes had secured the victory. Robbins should be a first day pick going into the 2006 draft.</p>

<p>The Crab Bowl is an American college football game series played between the University of Maryland Terrapins and the United States Navy Midshipmen. Although not part of the more popular college bowl series, it has generated quite an intense rivalry between the two colleges. The games, dating back to the early 1900s, have been punctuated by malicious hits, stolen mascots, and on-campus vandalism.</p>
<p>The series is not played frequently. The last game between the two teams was in 2005. Maryland defeated Navy 23-20 at M &amp; T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.</p>

<p>The Celebrity Journey was built in St. Nazaire, France. It entered service in May 1st, 2000. It was formerly known as the R6 ship from Renaissance Cruises. Once Renaissance Cruises filed bankruptcy (mostly due to loss of revenue immediately after 9/11), the ship was then acquired by Pullmantur Cruises. Because Pullmantur Cruises was acquired by Royal Caribbean International in 2006, the ship essentially belonged to Royal Caribbean. Royal Caribbean also operates Celebrity Cruises, which they have decided to swap the Journey with Celebrity's Zenith. In essence, Zenith will go to Pullmantur and Journey will go to Celebrity. The Journey will begin its first sailing with Celebrity Cruises on 4/28/07.</p>
