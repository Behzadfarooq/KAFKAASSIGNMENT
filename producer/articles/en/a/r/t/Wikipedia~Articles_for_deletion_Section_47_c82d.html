<li>The article was created by a member of the site, not the site owner. Also, currently parts of the text are copied from the site, but that is because it needs something to begin with whilst it is expanded. I personally was looking at expanding on what a Somma class is and I know others are looking at putting up things relevant to the site but which are not on the site. Part of the trouble is that the site has been running long enough that it has become encyclopaedic of itself, however that cannot be considered here because this is a seperate central encyclopaedia, not an individual site. I would expect the article to be given the decency of opportunity to be finished before being nominated for deletion. After all, it would be in the spirit of freedom of speech, and as we all know, the desire for freedom resides in every human heart.</li>

<li>Exactly. It outlines storys in the Star Trek world, albeit non offical ones. I belive that if Bravo Fleet, which has had their article up for quite some time, is allowed, then Section 47 should be permitted as well. Precident has been established that this is permitted.

<li>This is not really a fan website, it is a sim. There is a wikipedia entry for Bravo Fleet which is a sim site similar to Section 47. If Bravo Fleet is to be allowed a Wikipedia page, then I believe that Section 47 should be allowed one too. Part of the article is copied from the site, however it is relevant and as this article is a work in progress, I don't believe that this will remain true for the whole article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 00:54, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

After it's gone, if the Section 47 is the name of the Starfleet Black Ops group on the Deep Space 9 TV show, then it might deserve a real article or a redirect to a mention.

<li><b>Keep</b> Both the site founder and current owner have been alerted to the accusation of copyright infringement so they can verify that this is not copyright infringement. If and when they deny the accusations, the delete votes based on copyright violation will not be valid. As for being a sim, then it is a notable simulation in being one of the few trivia sims around and with a concise history and current structure. People looking up <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simming_Organization_3483.html" title="Simming Organization">Simming Organization</a> probably want to see what sorts of site are around and how they are run. Section 47 already appears there alongside Bravo Fleet and so is just as valid for inclusion within Wikipedia and arguably more so because of the unique nature of promotion within the sim based on trivia.user:Sir Brutus</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Keep</s> Abstain</b> I agree that the article needs to be rewritten, but it should not be deleted. Section 47 <i>is</i> a notable Star Trek sim site, even if it doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. It was the second site to combine trivia and simming in one, and with the first site to do that having closed down some time ago, it is now the longest running site with this concept. Many sites have been created since featuring the same concept. (So maybe Section 47 does meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria after all.) Furthermore, Section 47 is not just a website, it is an organization, with an extended management system. I think there are many articles on Wikipedia about much smaller and less organized organizations. Finally, as the original creator (founder) of Section 47, I have no problem with parts of the text from the Section 47 website being used on Wikipedia. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 20:42, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think we have different ideas of what 'notable' constitutes in this case. I cannot cite any references to claim Section 47 meets the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria, because it probably doesn't meet them. However, I believe Section 47 is a notable organization within the Star Trek RPG community, for reasons mentioned in my original "Keep" post. I also believe that's sufficient to warrant a (properly written) Wikipedia article; to me, the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are too strict. Wikipedia is a repository of knowledge.

<li>In this case, instinct. I didn't have time to do proper research on WP policies on this sort of site.

<li><b>Comment</b> Most of the people opposed to this article, cite the fact that the Section 47 website doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria as an important reason. However, Section 47 is not primarily a Star Trek-related website (and certainly not a fansite, Agnte), it is an international organization that brings people together to share their love for writing fiction in the Star Trek universe. Yes, it does use a website to reach that goal, but the website is only a means, not the goal itself. If Section 47 conducted all its business without a website, would the article be allowed? I think that's the question that should be answered. Don't judge Section 47 against the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria, because they don't apply. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 15:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> there are quite a few book clubs listed on wikipedia. several hundred. perhaps you should delete all of those as well? I don't think so. as for the notability criteria, well, those don't mention simming organizations. At all. message boards, yes. Fan fic? no.

<li>There is something known as being reasonable. the only critera right now is wether or not it's notable. Well, It is for the people that read the article, isn't that what counts?

<li>Of course notability is very subjective. However, I agree with Kalsermar and Agnte that Section 47 probably isn't notable enough by any criteria used on Wikipedia. Just have a look at the pages in <i>Category:Wikipedia notability criteria</i>. We may not all agree with those criteria, but many Wikipedians do, so it's a bit unfair to suggest Kalsermar and Agnte are being unreasonable. Does that mean the Section 47 article should be deleted? No, I still don't think so. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> contains arguments for and against deleting non-notable articles.

<li>I feel sad about this because I always used to think of Wikipedia as a place to put information. I didn't realise the arguments for removing information were regarded by the admin as being stronger than those for keeping it. Maybe if the admin had a love for Star Trek then we would be kept along with all the book clubs which were probably checked by admins who have a love of reading. As it is, we appear to be less notable than entirely fictional obscure literary characters simply because we're not in paperback. user:Sir Brutus

Some have said the people in favour of deletion don't know Section 47 well enough to make a good judgment. In turn, I think most people in favour of keeping don't know Wikipedia well enough to make judgment, and that probably includes myself. I've only been active here for a few weeks, and I'm still learning the rules. I've changed my vote above to <i>abstain</i>; I'm still in favour of keeping, but I'm too biased and I don't think I've been on Wikipedia long enough for my vote to count. By the way, Kalsermar was right about some comments being dismissive and defiant, and I'm sorry to see that coming from the community that I set up. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 07:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>To Kalsermar: I'd like to just point out that your member count is inaccurate. The ranks list does not display all members since the site opened in the year 2000. Only recent trivia only members are kept on the inactive ranks page. {Section 47 Member}</li>

<p>As a member of the site, I don't believe that it is a fansite, but more of an ongoing story. We don't just talk about how much we love the show, we create NON-CANNON stories, and missions, that are enjoyable to read, and enjoyable to participate in. We are one of the largest sites of this form of Star Trek Sim, so that I think that having give or take 200 members is fairly significant. I am not under the impression that it is in any way a copyright violation, but I am not a lawyer. Keep this article. BlAsTeR89 06:58, 24 December 2005 (UTC)Rye</p>

<p>I agree with the commenter above "BlAsTeR89" The member count is inaccurate. There are actually 167 active members, so more then a few dozen, in actuality. (Research done by looking through Section 47 proboards. Linkszwo 5:08, 25 December 2005</p>
