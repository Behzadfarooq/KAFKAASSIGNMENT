<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure what the criterion were for the first two deletions, were they both speedy? I don't think this should be a candidate for speedy deletion... it's not pure vanity... he does have books out, which doesn't mean notability... but it does mean it's not blatant "I'm a 10 year old from Alabama" vanity. I'd think about keeping this, and if it was speedily deleted the first two times then I'm not sure that should be used as a justification for this deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 02:59, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I would like to know that as well -- and I would like the users voting here to base it on that, not because of past (speedy?) deletes.

This is a strange case...I've yet to see the original VfD that led this to be labeled as reposted content. I'm beginning to think that this was originally speedied, and people are just jumping on the "reposted" bandwagon without examining the article. I agree it was originally a vanity page (the version now appearing at <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdip_Yuksel_c494.html" title="User:Edip Yuksel">User:Edip Yuksel</a>), but the current version (yes, apparently someone reposted it yet again...bad users) seems perfectly encyclopedic to me. I will concede it needs a lot of NPOVing, but Brandon attests to the individual's notability. As I have on VfU, I recommend undeletion.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. It probably needs a re-name too, since there are plenty of English-based creoles besides Carribean ones. I don't know to what degree these creoles are intercomprehensible with English (and thus to what degree they are either dialects or separate languages), but mentioning them on the List of dialects probably wouldn't cause any problems. ‚Äî <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">–õ–∏–≤–∞–π</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">‚ò∫</a> 06:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is repeatedly used to disseminate secret ritual information of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity and this is a clear violation of the national fraternity's policies towards the protections of such information. If this continues the abuse will be reported to the national fraternity</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep?</b> I'm not sure what to make of this. The article is fine and certainly belongs here, but the complaint seems to be about an edit war going on between two anons as to whether the organization's "secret word" should be posted. No need to list it here, as anyone can see it in the edit history. Having once pledged a fraternity myself, I appreciate the importance of secret words and such to these organizations.

<li>Hey now, <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, I'm not particularly quick on the draw to delete articles - I put fair labor into researching this, and found nothing but similarly-worded collections of impossible claims.

Google shows 239 English language pages for "Bai dal" -Wikipedia, (many of which are still not actually in English) and I tried quite a few of them. There are about 40 actual pages, and a lot of smoke and mirrors. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 17:42, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)

<li>BD2412 I know you researched this topic, and I thank you for doing so.

<li>If you mean that he posted something else 2 minutes before his vote, that doesn't mean he couldn't have done research previously. In any case, there's certainly no minimum research time required before one votes, and calling it out like this veers uncomfortably close to a personal attack. I think an apology to Radiant is in order. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:52, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Lest I appear to be making a personal attack, let me explain: is there <i>any other category of article</i> where it is an automatic keep? Towns are evaluated one by one. Scientific theories, computer projects, wars and battles -- all are evaluated case by case -- but "Lincoln School is in Nebraska" is supposed to be an automatic keep? I understand that some people get petulant after an article they wrote goes on VfD, but active disruption like "keep all school-named articles, no matter what's in them" is, to me, breaking the project. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:40, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's a stretch to say that wars are evaluated case by case.

<dd>That's awful, alright. I can only hope that's an aberration where the "I hate VfD so I vote keep on everything" folks combined with some people who didn't read the article. Case by case is the only thing called for in the guidelines. Case by case for <i>anything,</i> and article by article, not topic by topic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:01, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Depends on the context. Lots of things are nominated based on notability. If I think all schools, or all places are notable, then a case by case study is only going to produce keep votes for all such articles. It's a false assumption to say that the "keep everything" folks aren't looking case by case. In many cases, all they have to check is that the article is about a school, and they can vote their keep. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 20:18, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete: "2-4-6-8/ Who do we appreciate?/ KOKS! KOKS! KOKS!" There are numerous problems, here. The first is that it is an acronym, when there is no article for the expansion.

<li>why delete? many other acronyms are present in wikipedia and other encyclopedia. The KOKS are also well known around the uk for their racing abilitys and have had many articles publibished about there members and racing exploits in uk publications - web and press. they also race internationally and i believe it to be a viable interest entry. also regarding unverifiablility, google KOKS racing and find out, alternatively i'd be happy to provide publication infomation to anyone to see. (UTC)</li>
<li>There's no need to delete this page. Wikipedia contains many acronyms. It is a notable entry, not around the world but certainly within the Karting community. Other larger sports teams are here, currently the KOKS Racing is in its formative years but is growing. (unsigned comment by 62.249.197.159)</li>

<p>I created this page in the hopes that it would be useful as a kind of watchlist for pseudoscientific theories, and as a collection of curious crackpottery in the style of <a href="http://crank.net/" class="external free" title="http://crank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://crank.net/</a> . I guess I was forgetting that I was creating the page on a wiki, instead it became a magnet for the kinds of people who support these theories. They would claim that the page is inherently POV, and I'm ashamed to admit that they were probably right. The other thing they have done constantly in the two years since this page was created, is add various mainstream theories to the page, in an effort push the POV that these mainstream theories are just as legitimate as whatever minority theory they support. These efforts have been largely successful, since most Wikipedians are not prepared to argue such a subjective point on such a regular basis. I have copied the page to my user space (<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_List_of_crackpot_theories_f35c.html" title="User:Tim Starling/List of crackpot theories">User:Tim Starling/List of crackpot theories</a>) and modified it to a mainstream POV, for the benefit of Wikipedians who wish to use it for monitoring crackpots.

<li>In that case, it may be a better idea to split the article up into sub-articles, or sub-headings, separating "alternative", "pseudoscientific", "disputed", and "speculative" theories. Otherwise, you're giving as much credit to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> as you are to <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>, when the latter is an actual scientific theory. The simpler solution seems to be to go with the original intention of the author and stick to "theories" that don't have the potential to become part of mainstream science. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">‚Ñ¢</font></a> 15:22, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, some of these theories are fluid, and in any case there may be quite a lot of overlap. I don't have a problem treating astrology as "an actual scientific theory" because if it couldn't be formulated in a scientific manner we couldn't put it on the list. Typically astrology is falsified by examining birth data and testing correlations between independently produced lists of character traits and astrological readings produced independently by individual astrologers from the same data. There are interpretations of astrology which cannot be falsified in this way (for instance, astrological consultation as a kind of counselling), but those are not scientific. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:31, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Almost every scientific theory is disputed by someone. You can't list them all and still be able to make a serious claim to NPOV. Nor is it useful to mix up respectable mainstream proposals such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> with pseudoscience such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, that just causes offence.

<li>While I agree that "almost every scientific theory is disputed by someone", there are good criteria for determining if a hypothesis is fringe science, is falsified, or of indeterminate status (String theory is close to being a legitimate theory, but currently lacks demonstrable predictive power) etc. If you missed out string theory then it would be POV, and we shouldn't be worried about causing offence (to whom?)

<li>Two notes: "Scientific theory" and "theory" are two different terms, with different meanings (summarized by another user below).

<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'm afraid that "Starblind" does not understand what the term "theory" means. A scientific theory is just as factual as a law. And whether the author likes it or not, I think this page is useful and treats of an important topic - not of what is right, but what people consider right even when it is highly delusional. Deleting this page would be blinding ourselves to the facts just as much as they are blinded to the facts. Franc28 18:51, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>, its a fascinating list. I can see that its a dispute magnet, and would need active patrolling. But then, so are many/most articles on religion and politics, and WP has many articles on religion and politics; dispute does not mean 'not a valid article'. Many religion/politics articles have NPOV stickers slapped on them.

<li>Ahh, I see the problem. Tim's original list had <i>only</i> crackpot theories on the list. But then someone started adding non-crackpot, highly-speculative-but-academically-acceptable theories to the list. And thus it becomes a complete mess.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry, Tim, but I will never vote to delete articles on the sole ground that they're hard to maintain, either because they run the risk of POV or because people with dubious ideas start attacking it.

The article itself is fine.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Self-confessed crackpot-stuff is by definition not-encyclopedic and just draw flies to the ointment. Equally, per comments above: every theory has its disputations and thus every single one of them would need to be collected here. The scientific, the sociological, the economicsical (esp. these ones!), the political <i>ad nauseam</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> These theories exist, and some of them exist famously. I consider this to be an excellent compilation of contemporary and traditional non-mainstream thought. Supporting these ideas does not follow from listing them. I have always felt that the best way to out a kook was to expose his ideas. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">‚òØ</font></a> 00:12, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b>. If the title was more to the point it wouldn't be such a problem. I don't think "draws flies" is a great reason to delete something (might as well delete a lot of other topics if that is it). If it was renamed so that it was clear that this is a list of things which are not accepted by the <i>mainstream scientific community</i> as legitimate, I think it'd be a lot easier to deflect people. IN ANY EVENT, I don't think it is has drawn more POV pushers than most controversial articles do. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:27, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - IMHO the only reasons to delete soenmthing like this would be if it were proved to be seriously POV, was being used as a cruft-generator, or if it was irrevocably edit-warred. As a list it is surely admirable. --<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 08:22, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. I would suggest that point 5: <i>Adhered to by a limited group</i> be dropped as a criteria for incusion in the list. This is too vague and will lead to disputes. Only crackpot theories should be iuncluded. To decide whether or not you are dealing with a crackpot theory is simple. just check out peer reviewed scientific journals (with the exception of the Journal of Creation Science, of course).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. When I saw it going by on Recent Changes I fully expected it to be deletable junk; but it's not: it's an excellent list, NPOV, and a fascinating read.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't usually participate in VfD debates, but since Tim mentioned my comments when this list received its present title, I felt that I should. Thanks for mentioning it, and I still agree with what I said then. The consensus at the time was with the intent of finding a term with a broad acceptibility. It had to satisfy the scepticism of mainstream science without descending into the pejorative. It also had to make a home for a wide range of subjects with varying degrees of acceptability, and recognize the fact that the adversaries for any two given subject will vary. If this list is to be abandoned then we will need a better compromise that does all this and more. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> June 28, 2005 09:16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The list is actually useful to me and I would hate to lose it. It is bound to be somewhat POV, given the nature of disputed theories, but it retains its broad interest. It may benefit from a narrower mission, however. Perhaps separating the theory groups would lower the level of wingnuttery.<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillbrand_2ff5.html" title="User:Hillbrand">S.N. Hillbrand</a> 30 June 2005 13:19 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the range is too huge, criteria too broad, and the scope for abuse too big (on either side of the issues) to be useful. What would be useful is an article on how to evaluate the merit of theories. <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> is blatantly POV. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> June 30, 2005 23:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note: Leifern is claiming that the term "pseudoscience" is inherently POV, not that the article is POV. See the article's talk page. While I agree with him, Wikipedia is no place for original research. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">‚Ñ¢</font></a> 30 June 2005 23:28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>. This is very useful as a place to catalog disputed theories. Even if not presented as fact, such theories need to be presented as ideas for the encyclopedia to be complete. The name is as un-POV as it can get, and although the potential for abuse is high the alternative (of trying to ignore such theories) sweeps a body of human knowledge -- the study of alternative theories in their own right -- under the rug.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> but revise. This is a useful list. Part of the trouble is that this has come to include all kinds of things. For example, <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">luminiferous aether</a> and the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state.html" title="Steady state">steady state</a> theories were widely accepted for quite some time, but now are discredited. Others are new and under active consideration (such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>) or are subject to ongoing debate (such as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>). Perhaps a notation such as:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>* <b><a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">Luminiferous aether</a> (discredited)</b> ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>could be used. Other designations could include
<ul>
<li>"disputed" (for previously accepted theories that are now "on the ropes"),</li>
<li>"alternative" (for newer theories that may be accepted in the future),</li>
<li>"fringe" (for theories with staying power that have only a limited following), and</li>
<li>"unaccepted" (for theories like <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> that have a popular following but are not accepted by the scientific community. Hopefully this will give that entry some needed NPOV.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>["Crackpot" should never be used: Not only is it an insult, but if something is really crackpot (in that it lacks a following) it should not even appear in Wikipedia.]</dd>
<dd>Do realize that in times past, both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_drift.html" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> would have been included here. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 1 July 2005 20:33 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no solid criteria as to what qualifies as "alternative, speculative and disputed theories". Virtually everything has been disputed at some time or another. I fail to see why creationism is included when it is disputed by evolutionists, yet evolution is not included when it is disputed by creationists. (I'm an evolutionist, by the way). <a href="../../../d/s/h/User%7EDsh34_9700.html" title="User:Dsh34">Dsh34</a> 2 July 2005 23:44 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a shame the alternative theory folks are so determined to prove their idea is right that they risk losing a resource that may actually increase their following (and perhaps attract someone who may eventually prove their ideas correct to the larger scientific community), as well as widens the viewpoint of researchers who don't necessarily believe them, possibly leading to advances on other fronts. This is a great resource for rainy day reading, as well as sparking interest in other areas, such as the history category of Wikipedia. Hopefully, the announcement that there has been trouble will assist with keeping an eye on this page, although I'd suggest mentioning these problems to the larger Wikipedia community, for further help regarding this situation. As far as the "theory acceptance is always changing" argument, we need to keep in mind that Wikipedia is always changing as well, and as such, should continue to reflect those changes as they are made. The important part is the theory's status at the present time.-- Scott_R 13:53, Jul 3, 2005 (EST)</li>

<p>From author- newbie, as you can see-... I'd be more than happy to remove the link to the "further information", if that's what's got everyone upset. You should be aware, though, that I make no money from my involvement in MicroLan. I just find it a lot of fun. A lot of people DO make money from it, though, and it has been a serious technology since at least 2000. If Wikipedia wants to have no entry, so be it. In the past 48 hours, I've seen MicroLan products controlling the cash register in a major food retail chain and being used as at "watch-the-watchman" device in a shopping mall.... Hope I haven't further offended anyone by any clumsyness in this post!</p>
<p>--- When I searched on "1-Wire" I got no hits.... yes, I did search before presuming to post. I've used computers since 1968, so if Wikipedia's search engine misunderstands my search request, I'll be there are other people who are not seeing things that are no use to them if they don't see them. The 1-Wire page, subsequently found via link above, CERTAINLY has ad links to commercial sites benefiting from sale of the devices... not that I mind... but I wonder why the "delete it" brigade didn't attack those links?</p>
<p>--- If anyone wants to re-write the note to make the style more acceptable, I thought that was what wikis are all about? I hope you'll leave the INFORMNATION in place, as that was the point of putting the article in place.</p>
<p>--- The 1-Wire article is all well and good, and I'd be delighted if someone links my page to that, but if you were new to the technology, would you want to start with the 1-Wire dissertation, or the intro I've written?</p>
<p>--- I thought the article told people about 1-Wire and MicroLan... told them what it is. I presume they would only arrive at the page if they were trying to find out what they are.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tom, there is already an article called <a href="../../../1/-/w/1-Wire_aeca.html" title="1-Wire">1-Wire</a> that discusses this technology. I am, too, an engineer and a hobbist, and I can understand the relevance of such technology. You can go and insert all the information you want in <a href="../../../1/-/w/1-Wire_aeca.html" title="1-Wire">1-Wire</a>. Please take a look at the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Wikipedia:Tutorial</a> if you are a new user, to get used to the wiki collaboration. This article (1-Wire) also needs a lot of content addition and copy-editing, so, there is lot of room for improvement. You can help that improvement, you know. I thought the VfD for your article inadequate, as deletions only apply to articles that don't belong to an encyclopaedia. Every article that deals with some encyclopaedic theme can be recovered. There is no such <i>delete and restart</i>, you just edit, erase everything and start over. But now, as there is already an article dealing with the technology, a redirect from one another <i>is</i> the best option, as two articles dealing with the same thing aren't good for wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/-/w/1-Wire_aeca.html" title="1-Wire">1-Wire</a> isn't in VfD, you can insert all the content you want, change it as you want, and get the technology known.

<p>First I am not the author of the page in question I do however have a strong interest in the matter at hand.</p>
<p>What would it take for you to not think this is original research? A physical reviwe D-15 article specifically about the effects of the brownian motion of distant unseen objects on hypothetical measureing equipment? That is all the article refer's to, brownian motion of experimental equipment due to random gravitational waves. The article itself is almost compleatly classical in it's physics. If anything this article should be moved to a page dealing with Classical <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">Chaos theoryinstead</a> of quantum gravity.</p>

<dd>It would take a paper talking about the specific points in the article, which you grossly understate by labelling them "Brownian motion". The author specifically claims that they derive an "uncertainty principle", and that the idea of chaotic gravitational waves "reconciles the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics". Brownian motion does neither (you can still measure where the object is, measuring its position or momentum doesn't perturb its position or momentum substantially, and Brownian motion has no relation to unifying gravitation and quantum mechanics). For that matter, the Brownian motion arxiv paper doesn't mention or rely on _chaos_, either, so I'm having trouble seeing why you want to file it there.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 15:00, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Change my vote to <b>Delete</b>. Here is why... Well it would be nice if the author of the actual paper would visit his article and support it. I cannot provide that. let us assume for a second that this is all above board and this person is a physicist of some standing. Say a university professor. I took a course in Statistical physics and chaos from such a person last semsester. If the author is much like the professor I took this that course from ( which is why I provided textbooks as backup for the article) then all of this seems so obvious to him that he could not imagine anyone having serious questions on the matter. That must be why the person who wrote this will not defend their work. They may not realize that it would be in question. As for any jerk accusing me of using the "sockpuppet" technique compare my editing style say in the <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loop_quantum_gravity.html" title="Loop quantum gravity">Loop quantum gravity</a> article. A week or so I rewrote it to get rid of the flamewar that the article itself had turned into. People seem to like it. Does this new article which usees NO Wiki code or Latex look likesomething I would do?</dd>

<p>Perhaps I was not explaining enough last time. I was in HK IMO team and I saw Macau IMO team (can't remember if it was 2001 or 2002) leaving before prizing ceremony because they had to get back and prepare for the coming IOI. And I also knew that some IMO trainees in HK were in IOI training as well because of the similarity between maths and programming. This is not anything surprising for one to take part in both IMO and IOI for a city with small population like Macau and Hong Kong. And I think I should repeat myself again: the level of maths olympiad is far away from maths research, and it can't truly assess one's maths ability because maths olympiad is to solve explicitly stated problems while research is to probe into undiscovered theorems and theories. The latter often needs years of hard work, while the former only takes some hours of thinking. Therefore don't compare it with sports and don't think one will be a maths stars because of performing well in maths olympiad. I speak from my experience in maths olympiad training and in maths undergrad studies. So I ask for a <b>delete</b> of this article. Small potato 17:06, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I'm sick of these elitist wikipedians trying to decide what is worthy to be educated of. It doesn't matter how notable something is. There's an entry to the X-Factor comic book, for goodness' sake. This movement will mean ten times as much as that piddly little long-canceled publication series and will have an important effect on the state of Michigan and thus it is something and has something of value to it and should be available to educate others with. "Notability" is an excuse. This is worthy to be learned of.

<li><b>Keep</b> I work for the Michigan House and Representative Jack Hoogendyk has introduced a bill to make Michigan the official language of Michigan, he has mentioned this on his campaign website ( <a href="http://www.jackformichigan.com/newsstory061505.html" class="external free" title="http://www.jackformichigan.com/newsstory061505.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jackformichigan.com/newsstory061505.html</a> ). The fully media push is coming later this month. Jack Hoogendyk was inspired to introduce the bill after meeting with Bill Kelly and his Michigan Coalition for Mandatory English. It seems that Ms. Ectar wishes to have everything related to this person deleted, and I assume she must have some personal reason for hating Bill Kelly, so I won't try to stop her. But if her concern is factual accuracy, you have no choice but to keep. Also, Bill is quoted <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/1406088/posts" class="external free" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/1406088/posts" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/1406088/posts</a> and <a href="http://www.cumuli.com/ezines/1432_article.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cumuli.com/ezines/1432_article.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cumuli.com/ezines/1432_article.html</a> (unsigned vote by 24.11.80.136, only edits here and on the Bill Kelly vfd)

<li><b>Keep.</b> Obviously. How can somebody seriously base a vfd on an Amazon sales rank? By the same logic, almost every writer before 1900 or in a specialised field (like for example Indology) would be non-notable. This is an author and editor of several important books in the specific field.

<li>What a mess! This article comprises two entirely separate Edwin Bryants. The first is, indeed, a copyright violation (The museum's web site is not GFDL licenced.), and there is no prior non-infringing version of the article. By strict application of our <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">copyright problems procedure</a>, the entire article must go (there being no non-infringing version to roll back to), and the author of the second part of the article, on the second Edwin Bryant, should have been required to rewrite it from scratch in the rewrite article, which <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotsofissues_1740.html" title="User:Lotsofissues">User:Lotsofissues</a> should then have nominated for deletion (since xe wants it deleted).

<li><b>Comment</b>--Everyone saying "merge with Elmer Fudd"--it's not an Elmer Fudd cartoon, he's a supporting character. If anything, you would <i>merge</i> with <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugs_Bunny_5903.html" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a>. But is this short not notable enough for its own article?

<li><b>Keep and dont merge</b> There are more than a dozen other Warner Brothers cartoon shorts that also have their own Wikipedia articles, most of which aren't even as historically significant as this one, and on top of that this article is the best researched and written one about a WB short that I've seen. I wish someone would give the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_Amuck_fcc2.html" title="Duck Amuck">Duck Amuck</a> article this kind of rewrite. One idea I could support is expanding this further into an article about all three short films in the "Hunting Trilogy," as opposed to just this one, but that isn't absolutely necessary. I am actually hoping to see articles (or additional information) about the other two at some point though, if not here then on their own pages, especially <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck%2C_Rabbit%2C_Duck%21_54d7.html" title="Duck, Rabbit, Duck!">Duck, Rabbit, Duck!</a> since it's my favorite of three.--<a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZequist_d5a8.html" title="User:Zequist">Zequist</a> 4 July 2005 02:48 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am renominating this for deletion after it survived last month. This appears to be a vanity entry. "Tom Chiu" paired with SPSS scores 22 Google hits, some of which are mirrors of Wikipedia content. This page mentions his title and describes a fairly typical employee role. Vanity suspected here.

<li>Normally I'd be concerned about a month-long gap between nominations, but with five votes total and two unexplained keep votes (one of them being very weak) I think this is an appropriate re-nomination. <b>Delete</b>, does not assert notability, though I am curious why Markaci and JuntungWu voted to keep. Chiu appears to have presented research <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=502549" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=502549" rel="nofollow">at an ACM data mining conference</a> and other conferences, but <i>"tom chiu" "data mining"</i> yields only 11 unique hits, and there's nothing that I've found that indicates that research is Chiu's main activity or that he's been active enough to warrant an article. Looks like he's got a technical job and has had some work published in professional journals or presented at conferences. Under that criterion, most of my co-workers (and me) qualify for articles, too. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>–∏<small>D</small>—è<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 18:35, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do not vote for delete or retain, I merely wish to say that this is *not* self-promotion, as I have nothing to do with the article. The original was written at the Esperanto Wikipedia by some Esperantists upset at my essay hosted at my website about leaving the Esperanto movement. Someone at the Esperanto Wikipedia must have figure that if something exists in the E-o Wikipedia, it should be translated everywhere else, even if it will be of no interest to anyone not a speaker of that made-up language. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">Crculver</a> 04:02, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the subject is relevant because the Finnish system has unique features like large scale public support.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A strange article which does not really fit into Wikipedia. Lots of hype words but not much substance to it. While it may be true that "during last century Finland transformed from a poor and agrarian nation to a prosperous industrialized country", etc, this kind of information should be included in articles like <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Finland_16c9.html" title="Economy of Finland">Economy of Finland</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Finland_55b6.html" title="History of Finland">History of Finland</a>.

This is more evidence that this page is the work of one author and is of little or no use to the Wikicommunity.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Extreme vanity‚Äînothing more than vigorous self-promotion. A lot more is claimed in this article than is proven by the meager references provided. Some of it probably can't be verified at all, the verifiable parts would take hours of work to document appropriately and even if that was done, the result would still not be worth it because the subject isn't notable. To answer a question: It's easy to say that the subject is non-notable precisely <i>because</i> of the list of professional credits. Nothing in the article indicates that this individual is more interesting than the average professional writer. The excruciating, mind-numbing detail drives that home with force. If no single accomplishment is notable, having a hundred non-notable accomplishments doesn't add up to encyclopedic notability. The sea of redlinks in the article is alarming. Remove this article before he starts to create articles for all that other non-notable junk. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 21:29, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, it's simply "Daryl F. Mallett has no encyclopedically notable accomplishments". No crime there, since I along with most of the rest of the world are in the same boat. The difference is that most of us aren't as vain. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 22:25, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's real, a very minor professional in the SF/fantasy field. For what little it's worth, I actually recognized the name. However, somebody ought to take a blowtorch to that list of credits and related self-promotion; I've never seen anybody take public credit as the "editor" of so much stuff they copyedited/proofread before. Borgo Press was a real and substantial publishing operation, even though most of its output was mindnumbingly bibliographical and sold mostly to libraries, and his status there is apparently legitimate. I wouldn't take the time to write him up myself, and only Daryl would shed any tears if this article was reduced to less than a dozen lines. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:43, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
