<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. I discarded around half a dozen votes prior to vote counting, because the editors looked somewhat sockish or merely new. There were seven valid votes for keep, twelve for delete, two other valid votes. There being no consensus, the article is kept. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:40, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Considering the prevalence of sockpuppets on articles Gabrielsimon has been fighting over lately, I will have to call upon the official <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">Wikipedia:Sockpuppets</a> policy and point out that this person doesn't come close to the 100 edits one needs to verify oneself as an actual real person and would note that the edits he/she does have are extremely suspicious, jumping into articles closely related to ones Gabrielsimon worked on but that aren't otherwise related. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:29, August 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - As described by <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> on the discussion page, "I can see there being a good article on religion and mental illness, but as this page stands, it's POV, unencyclopedic in the style it's written, and it has no sources. My suggestion is that it be deleted, and the creator (or someone else) puts it on a user subpage and works on it there, until it's ready to face the public, as it were." Also, singling out schizotypy as a specific disorder to mention in the title is really quite odd as it's just one minor classification out of a whole range that would be important for a comparison between religion and psychology in general or mental disorders more specifically. If the article stayed around waiting for cleanup it would just get redirectede to a real article on the topic under a better name, and this title is so specific it's really unnecessary as a redirect as nobody would think to go looking for it instead of, say, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_psychology.html" title="Religion and psychology">Religion and psychology</a> or Religion and mental disorders or whatnot.

<li><b>Delete</b> <b>"Comment"</b> It seems unreasonable to expect a diagnosis of schizotypy in any but the most modern case histories. For instance, how would you say <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith_3f60.html" title="Joseph Smith">Joseph Smith</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed.html" title="Mohammed">Mohammed</a> etc etc, (in short anybody who has had some kind of faith based epiphany) were suffering from a schizoid disorder? It would be pure speculation in all of these cases because they can never be clinically examined and diagnosed. We can in hindsight say "oh that person diplayed some or all of the symptoms" but with mental illness there are a wide variety of causation, such as chemical imbalance and physical anomalies. For historical figures as outlined in this article it would be impossible to say definitively what the causation of the visions or voices that may or may not have compelled them to action. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 22:12, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While there is no doubt in my mind that there is a link between <i>some</i> people's religious experiences and mental illness (in general), the article in question is potentially offensive speculation about important religious figures with no evidence presented.
