<li><b>Strong keep</b> if the guideline were followed in the manner suggested half the disambig pages on wikipedia would have to be deleted. Given the controversy at the original <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> page over listing other uses of the word (see <a href="../../../a/p/a/Talk%7EApartheid_4806.html" title="Talk:Apartheid">Talk:Apartheid</a>) having a seperate disambiguation page is the only solution to adequately deal with non-South African uses of the term apartheid. The problem with abakharev's examples is that "the" is not the operative word in his examples, apartheid is the operative word in the articles listed on <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a> Homey 06:08, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

If there exist an article on Apartheid (book) or Apartheid (painting) etc. then the disambig should be created.

<li><b>Abstain</b> for the moment - it's a tricky one. For one, the main Apartheid article is the main article on the topic, and it is the topic that most would want to know about when looking up apartheid.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator. We have a disambiguation page, for example, for "Georgia" becuase you might be talking about the Russian state, the US State, or the US University.

<li><b>Keep</b>; clearly disambiguation guidelines and actual practice seem to have diverged, and probably should be reassessed, but bringing up individual articles piecemeal on AfD is not the way to go about that.

<li><b>Delete.</b> As the nom notes, this is not really a disambiguation page, but rather an aggregation of uses of "apartheid", which as such is non-encyclopedic. Deletion will resolve the edit wars on whether or not to include articles of the type "Foo apartheid", which deal with usages of the term "apartheid" as applied to the situation in other countries. Whether or not these articles are encyclopedic is not at issue here, but at any rate there is no chance of confusion between these articles and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, and thus no dab page is needed.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, no, it is not "pretty much the definition of a disambiguation page".

<li><b>Delete</b>, as I mentioned on the talk page, there is no real ambiguity - phrases like "Basque Apartheid", "Israeli Apartheid" or "Global Apartheid" the word "Apartheid" unambiguously refers to the South African regime. The word "Apartheid" is simply a derogative here - imagine the disambiguation page for "Stupidiy", starting with "Bush's stupidity", and ending with my uncle. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 13:23, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>I disagree</b>. Since the abolition of apartheid in South Africa, the word is frequently used figuratively. But don't take my word for it: the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> says: "<i>applied also to any similar movement elsewhere</i>" -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> but that's the whole point - using the word figuratively doesn't mean that you have an article about every figurative use of the word. Everyone knows that apartheid means South Africa. Just because someone uses it as an analogy or metaphor to describe a current situation doesn't mean that you make an article about it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:01, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Everyone knows that apartheid means South Africa.</i> -- Err, no. In fact. the OED disagrees with this assertion. They say it means South Africa, <b>or policies similar to South Africa</b> (i.e. laws that differentiate by race, skin colour or ethnicity). -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>That's exactly my point. <i>"The word "Apartheid" may be applied to any [in the opinion of the speaker] similar movement elsewhere"</i>, just as the word "stupidity" may be applied to anyone the speaker considers to think bad or wrong. In both cases, the word is used as a derogative. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 15:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's nothing subjective about "laws that differentiate by race, skin colour or ethnicity". Apartheid does not mean racism/bigotry. It's the <b>codification</b> of ethnic difference as law. One is highly subjective, the other isn't. That's why no-one refers to Harlem as apartheid, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_Return_fc3e.html" title="Law of Return">Law of Return</a>, for example, is, since it applies only to those of the Jewish faith. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>I am not sure what you mean by this. Law of return does not differentiate citizens of Israel based on race. It does differentiate people who are <i>not</i> citizens of Israel, but most of the Western countries do that - a Russian who can show German ancestry, is allowed to "return" to Germany at a stroke of a pen. In Norway, I know of at least one Russian family who were allowed to "return" to Norway because they had a Norwegian grand mother. But this of course has little to do with the debate at hand. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 13:29, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Instead of an apartheid dab it may be more worthwhile to create an Apartheid (metaphor) page that talks about how the term is used as a metaphor -- that the SA system was iconic and thus the term entered into the lexicon on its own, which seems to be the case. This Apartheid (metaphor) article can, besides noting its use as a metaphor, point to a few of the areas in which it is widely used and thus link to those articles if they exist. The main <a href="../../../a/p/a/Aparthied.html" title="Aparthied">Aparthied</a> article should still link directly to the SA Apartheid article but at the top should be a <b>see</b> macro to the Aparthied metaphor page. To me this would be a decent compromise that continues to build up wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 01:20, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The effect, if not the intention, of this page is to imply that the items listed on the page are in parallel. That is a POV. I like MCB's suggestion that perhaps a general article on apartheid would be appropriate. Anyone can create that article next week if they want; I don't think we have to do it for them. The articles that this page currently points to probably should not be on Wikipedia. Only one country in history has ever considered it inoffensive to be labelled as apartheid. Any article whose title is "____ apartheid" is pretty much by definition a POV page that should be merged with a broader article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Apartheid was a specific system in place during a specific time period (1948-1990). Any other uses of the word, such as Gender Apartheid or Economic Apartheid are perjorative metaphors and are thus not equal to the word's primary meaning. At most, other uses of the word apartheid should be in an article named something like 'Apartheid (Metaphor)' [as per the above], linked to by a small comment at the top of the main Apartheid article. — <i><a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi"><font color="darkblue">Imp</font></a><a href="../../../i/m/p/User_talk%7EImpi_3839.html" title="User talk:Impi"><font color="green">i</font></a></i> 16:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Which is an excellent reason why the disambig article is necessary 1) to allow references to "modern" uses of the term apartheid to go somewhere other than the main apartheid article 2) thus allowing the article to actually be called <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> rather than the cumbersome <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a>Homey 21:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That doesn't make any sense. Your reason number 2 cannot be justified based on what Zaian says, because he is asking, nay <i>pleading</i>, for the exact opposite. (For other people not following all this, Zaian says that whatever else happens, <i>please</i> don't rename the current History fo South Africa in the apartheid era to Apartheid; Homey says that if we have this disambiguation page, we can rename History etc. etc. to just Apartheid. So those are two opposite ideas.) On your reason number 1, these "other apartheid" articles were all created by you (except for apartheid wall, I believe), so claiming that the disambiguation page you created is necessary so there can be a distinction drawn among the other articles you created is a little like the teenager who murders his parents and asks the judge for mercy because he is an orphan.

People should see an article on South African apartheid when they enter apartheid into the search field. DABs can and should be objective and useful, and there is nothing immediately useful (and debatably something POV) about listing every segregatory social system that happens to have been classified as apartheid by its original author. There are systems that have not been classified as such (such as that upon which apartheid was supposedly based in part, the American system or systems), and this makes the article ineffectual at disambiguation, even if disambiguation were necessary in the first place. If someone wants to research "apartheid" in Israel, they can do a <i>search</i> for apartheid on wiki, and perhaps a section of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> can note that the term is sometimes used to describe social systems outside of the South African issue.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Holocaust" does not in itself refer to the death of Jews in WWII, but "great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life, especially by fire" (first definition listed from most sources). That it has become almost synonymous in recent times with that event has nothing to do with the word itself, which predates the twentieth century. This is a major distinction. "Holocaust" has ancient Greek etymology, while "apartheid" is from Dutch, indicating its specific South African origins. Note that the first definition of "apartheid" listed uniformly refers to the South African event. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 04:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

Just as the OED states in the definition of apartheid "Name given in South Africa to the segregation of the inhabitants of European descent from the non-European...applied also to any similar movement elsewhere; also, to other forms of racial separation (social, educational, etc.). Also fig. and attrib" so at least <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a> would be a valid literal use of the word while the others (except maybe <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_apartheid.html" title="Global apartheid">global apartheid</a>) would be figurative. --Coroebus 08:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I am intensely uncomfortable about reading between the lines to establish that something is metaphorical. At what point are we just engaging in our own speculation? Re: ghetto I don't understand what you're saying (the definition is "1. The quarter in a city, chiefly in Italy, to which the Jews were restricted" - the first ghetto was in Venice (hence the OED: "[Of uncertain etym., perh. f. It. getto foundry, as the first ghetto founded in Venice in 1516 was on the site of a foundry.]") but the word came to be generalised to any Jewish enclave, and then to a densely populated slum area (this latter use is designated figurative). So by your reasoning the <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a> article must be stripped of any reference to non-Jewish ghettos as these are simply metaphorical uses? --Coroebus 13:51, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Britannica, is far less ambigous - apartheid is defined as: <i>"(Afrikaans: “apartness”), policy that governed relations between South Africa's white minority and nonwhite majority and sanctioned racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against nonwhites."</i><a href="http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9007978?query=apartheid&amp;ct=eb" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9007978?query=apartheid&amp;ct=eb" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>Gender apartheid is a synonym for gender segregation, yes. But that just proves that the M-W second definition of <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/apartheid" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/apartheid" rel="nofollow">apartheid</a> is a valid usage. You will notice that your preferred OED definition 2 for <a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50094276?query_type=word&amp;queryword=ghetto&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=fEHa-T7Q8Hl-4197&amp;hilite=50094276" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50094276?query_type=word&amp;queryword=ghetto&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=fEHa-T7Q8Hl-4197&amp;hilite=50094276" rel="nofollow">ghetto</a> is labelled as being figurative. I think you are trying to have your cake and eat it here. You reject the use of apartheid for anything other than the SA Apartheid, because anything else is metaphorical in your eyes, and thus invalid, even when there is pretty good evidence that the word has come to mean something like 'separation' or 'discrimination' (interestingly the OED details it as going back as far as 1955). But for another word, ghetto, you reject the literal meaning and insist that the figurative (that means the same thing as metaphorical by the way) usage is the correct and 'most used' one. What I have tried to show, and I think you have rather nicely demonstrated, is that some objections to the use of 'apartheid' here are not driven by linguistic concerns, but rather something else, perhaps political --Coroebus 14:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I should be more clear. I reject that the word Apartheid is used for anything else then SA regime, other then for political purposes (very much like for example fascism). "Ghetto" is generally used about racially segregated neighbourhoods. A ghetto is easier to define (bunch of "ethnical" people living together -&gt; ghetto), and its use is not limited to those with some particular political agenda. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 15:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Note that your Britannica definition of apartheid is from the encyclopaedia entry on apartheid, so is not the definition of the word. OED defines it as "Name given in South Africa to the segregation...applied also to any similar movement elsewhere; also, to other forms of racial separation (social, educational, etc.)", M-W says "2. SEPARATION, SEGREGATION", <a href="http://www.answers.com/apartheid&amp;r=67" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/apartheid&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">American Heritage</a> says "2. A policy or practice of separating or segregating groups. 3. The condition of being separated from others; segregation.", as far as I can see you're working from an idiosyncratic <i>personal</i> definition of apartheid. --Coroebus 15:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think I may have been misleading when I brought etymology into the discussion, though the fact that "holocaust" was simply an already common word used <i>to describe</i> "the Holocaust" that happened to "stick" in popular language is not entirely negligible. What's really important is that every single one of these articles can be distinguished from existing, generally better and more NPOV articles only by the presence of the word "apartheid", which in itself indicates flagrant POV. I don't agree or disagree with this POV, <i>but it is pov</i>. If I made an article called "Iraqi holocaust", I would be framing all information on that page in the POV of something that is not historically established as holocaust, and I would damn well hope someone would delete it. <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_apartheid.html" title="Sexual apartheid">Sexual apartheid</a> is <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_discrimination.html" title="Sex discrimination">sex discrimination</a>, save that the name of the article itself throws NPOV to the wind by using a metaphorical reference to a historically-recognized despicable act to color the inferrences that will be drawn from the article. It's the Wiki equivalent of flashing pictures of Stalin in a smear ad. This has nothing to do with feelings about apartheid, sexual discrimination, the Israel/Palestine conflict or what kind of cheese the moon is made of. It's about impartiality, which these articles go out of their way to dismiss. I really can't believe this has sparked so much debate, as these things seem very plain to me. Coroebus, I am additionally saddened that you continue to frame opposition to this article as politically motivated when there have been many clear cases for its removal on an NPOV basis alone, whether or not you agree with the argument. I take this moment to assure you that this is not an pro-Semitic conspiracy, a misogynist conspiracy, or an (insert favorite conspiracy) conspiracy. We're editing Wikipedia, not waging ideological war. I voted strong delete because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 15:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You will note that I have already voted delete on this article, and redirect for many of the other articles! My objection is to what appear to be attempts to delete articles based on bogus linguistic assertions. You don't see me going around deleting the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page because fascism can only apply to Italian nationalists either. If the usage is notable we talk about it, we don't reject it out of hand as POV because we don't like the implication --Coroebus 15:18, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, now you are just insulting my intelligence&#160;:(</dd>
<dd>My main point is that when somebody calls something "X Apartheid", s/he is trying to suggest a similarity between the unfortunate X and the Apartheid regime in South Africa. Of course, even if you disagree, I am glad we reached the same conclusion. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 15:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The same. Apologies for my haste, since we seem to be in (confusing) agreement. I think the etymology argument is valid, just not <i>as</i> valid as the POV problem, and much harder to argue with precision. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 15:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And of course that is exactly what is happening in the etymology of ghetto. Therefore, just because a word has a partially figurative nature does not make it somehow an invalid word. In a similarly Venetian theme, how about <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">Arsenal</a>? --Coroebus 15:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I worry this is going to turn into a semantic waste of talk space, as much as I'd love to continue! I'll say really quickly that I think it takes time for those words to translate into generic use rather than metaphorical use, and that time has not passed for "apartheid". <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 15:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> The articles linked to do seem to follow the UN definition of the <i><a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html#Apartheid_in_international_law" title="Apartheid">Crime of Apartheid</a></i>. POV is an issue, but removing this page for that reason is a POV in itself. POV should be dealt with on the page itself not on pages that link to it. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 15:44, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That's just not true. Read the article--none of these have to do with race. Thus they are metaphorical. At the very, very best they should be redirects. Denying a biased (or superfluous <i>and</i> biased article, in this case) title (e.g. Gender Holocaust to describe a mass-murder of women, a despicable event but not "gender holocaust") is not acceptable. Believing we should be rid of such articles has nothing to do with POV and everything to do with the integrity of WP. If someone provides ample proof that all of these terms <i>have been used in prominent, peer-reviewed discussion</i>, then I say a redirect is warranted. Only if someone can provide proof that all these terms have been used <i>and</i> are distinct from their counterparts (e.g. "sexual apartheid" v. "sexual discrimination"), then they deserve their own articles. Only then. Removing POV is not "POV in itself" unless you propose it because the ideas in the POV offend you, which we have established we are not (or I hope this has been established, anyway). The maintenance of neutrality is NPOV... by definition. POV (and NPOV) is more than "an issue", it's a policy. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 15:57, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> They're political science articles, so yes. I don't think the references should have to include professional advocacy/use of the terminology, but I think that scientific mention of their use should be a minimum requirement. Otherwise I fail to see how the terms could be considered valid and encyclopedic. If they are not used in a citable way, they do not exist (that's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> at work). There are a million articles on these topics in political science journals, not to mention those of other disciplines, and if one cannot find even one such example of their use, then I fail to see how the terms may be defended. And I was not trying to open the Israel/Palestine racial can of worms, I accidentally neglected that exception.<a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 16:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC) (some edits were made for clarity after next post--sorry for the confusion)</li>

<dd>I'll probably betray my background in objecting to political science being referred to as a science, I don't think subjects like politics should rely on academic discourse to the same extent as (proper) scientific articles - in particular the academic and practical worlds of politics overlap and inter-relate, I think it would be very unwise to declare all non-academic political discourse out of bounds as a source, and also politics (as with other semi-sciences and humanities) as an academic discipline does not rely on the academic paper to the same extent as science - certainly almost the entirety of our political output on wikipedia would go up in flames. A very quick google scholar search (for what it's worth) reveals all these terms used somewhere --Coroebus 16:19, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Political science is intangible, in that it's not about making polymers and identifying starlings by their coloration or somesuch, but whatever your own definition of science there are guidelines on WP about what is and is not acceptable. These titles are analysis, that is, "original research" by the WP definition. Even pop poli-sci publications are peer reviewed, so this is not as major a limitation as you make it out to be. In fact, it's a very reasonable one. If google scholar brings these terms up in real journals, let's pop the results in as sources (after a glance to make sure it's relevant) and give these redirects, as I said. If there is some distinction in their use, let the author cite them. If proper citations were used, this entire debate would be null. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 16:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not agree that these titles can realistically be defined as analysis, you may not consider them notable phrases or ideas, but I think you're going to have to stretch your definition of original research rather far. Otherwise <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_anti-semitism.html" title="Arab anti-semitism">Arab anti-semitism</a> become original research too. I strongly disagree with you on peer reviewed requirements for political articles, but perhaps you should consider trying it at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Advice_specific_to_subject_area" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Advice_specific_to_subject_area</a>? But by your insistence on academic study of a concept, movement or whatever, Wikipedia would very rapidly have to stop, lacking many contributors with access to academic journals, and limited entirely to that which political scientists have deigned to write about, things like the Lib Dem <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orange_Book_-_Reclaiming_Liberalism_faad.html" title="The Orange Book - Reclaiming Liberalism">orange book</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Labour_d0a0.html" title="New Labour">New_Labour</a> or the <a href="../../../e/u/s/Euston_manifesto.html" title="Euston manifesto">Euston_manifesto</a> covered many years after the event, and limited to a handful of sources if any. Wikipedia would be cutting itself off from mainstream political discourse. --Coroebus 16:55, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If one has access to neither academic or semi-academic (being that most such citable debate is carried on by those who are professionals in the matter) resources or even <i>texts</i>, I do not understand it to be wise to make substantive edits on any potentially POV subject. I and many others have made the mistake of doing so in one way or another without providing citations, and the material has been (rightly) reverted, when the article gets the attention of experienced editors. I think this is no exception. If the concept of Israeli apartheid "exists" (by WP standards), it will have been discussed professionally. This is my interpretation, and I think it is a common one. Sourcing potentially POV statements is not a hindrance to good editing--it is part of the definition of good editing. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_anti-semitism.html" title="Arab anti-semitism">Arab anti-semitism</a> are concepts that have been noted by major sources (probably a million times over, by now), and as such they definitely "exist" by encyclopedic standards. It is more important that WP have these standards than that every indefinite, casual or novel concept is legitimized by its place here. Those would be more like <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> standards--acceptable in their own right, perhaps. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 18:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The word "apartheid" is often used in a metaphorical sense to denote any kind of segregation or separation (normally in a negative sense). In the same way words like terror, fascism, tyranny, nazism, and so on (including derivatives) are often used metaphorically. An encyclopaedia doesn't have separate articles for all different kinds of separation. Particular forms of separation should be discussed in the articles that deal with the corresponding subject (where that particular form of separation occurs). This ought to be obvious.--<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 12:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
