<li><b>Please take a closer look</b> Let us not make the mistake of judging a book by its cover. <i>This is not a gambling site</i> It is surprising that we are talking about deleting the reference to the only available online version of the most popular card game in Kerala, India. There are a few million Keralaties in the world and they will not be too happy with this attitude of Wikipedia Editorial Staff, Is there no single person who edits Wikipedia from Kerala India to bring reason to the table! --<a href="../../../j/9/a/User%7EJ9A10_447b.html" title="User:J9A10">Kerala Online</a> 11:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The card game itself is an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article; an advert for a site that runs an online version of it isn't. (Even less so when it currently only seems to be "available to a select set of Beta Testers" - from the pages that weren't broken or locked, I was unable to determine whether the site was gambling-orientated or not; the poker chips in the logo suggested it was.) At most this should just be a link at the end of a neutral article about the history and rules of Fifty-Six. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 10:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The current version of the article is an improvement, but I don't see any information here that wouldn't be better placed in the existing article for the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-eight_%28card_game%29.html" title="Twenty-eight (card game)">Twenty-eight</a> card game and its variants. Am I correct in assuming from Google results that when you say "J9A10 is a group of a trick-taking games" you mean "a number of games that J9A10.com has chosen to host" rather than anything of wider significance? The term "J9A10" does not appear to be used outside of your site. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 19:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>J9A10 is not just a game it is also the name for the class of games defined by the unique hierarchy J,9,A,10. All games including 28, 29, 56 and others which use the J9A10 hierarchy have multiple references on the internet and <a href="http://www.pagat.com/jass/56.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pagat.com/jass/56.html" rel="nofollow">Pagat</a>. Ironically enough this class of games(J9A10) is neither discussed not referenced anywhere on the internet. The site is devoted to the class and is not on just a particular game. Should there not be a page for the Class of games J9A10 on Wikipedia? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.250.232.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.250.232.151_07dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.250.232.151">contribs</a>) 22:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Also you mentioned that the game is not open to public. Though the site says at this time it is open to Beta Testers only. But it is in fact open to the public, if you try registering it will let you open a new beta testing account and play the game. The game is free like Wikipedia and has no levels or usage restriction. Guess the reason there is a beta testing restriction is just to ensure there is no flood of user traffic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.250.232.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.250.232.151_07dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.250.232.151">contribs</a>) 23:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
