<dd><b>Comment</b> Sometimes pubs achieve notability in their own right. I'm not sure this one has. In the last 5 years I only found one mention in Lexis/Nexis European sources, a recent (4 Mar 06) article on the rennovation of Pilgrm Street. FWIW, the explanation of the name <i>Monkey Bar</i> given in the Newcastle Evening Chronicle is different than the one given by the author here. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:05, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Headdesk</b>. Lookit, AfDs are traditionally kicked off by someone <i>nominating</i> it, explaining <i>why</i> he's nominated it, why the article needs to do, etc. References to deletion policy, page history, What links here, and, of course, Google are common, all making up the rich tapestry that is an argument for the deletion of one of our precious articles. This is a Good Thing; if nothing else, it means that if an article's deleted then someone can look at AfD and understand why (none of this idiotic "nn d" crap). Pointing out that the nominator automatically votes delete is not merely nonsense, but evidence of a terrifying misunderstanding of what *fD is about here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Retort</b> the nominator makes a perfectly valid point, I assumed you were giving him a hard time about process. He states, "Non notable." Thats all the reason, if the pub actually is NN, that he should need to give. I think that, while my understanding of AfD may be flawed, your understanding of WP:Notability is equally so. Just because he didn't google the bloody thing, or dig around LexisNexis (as two of the voters have done), it doesn't make his deletion listing any less valid. I still refrain from voting as I have no opinion on this article.
<ul>
<li>I disagree. Out of simple respect for the editors who have worked hard in good faith on the material in question, a nom needs to do more than type two letters. Even you modify your statement by saying: "<i>if the pub actually is</i>"...How do we know anything about what the pub "actually is" or the reasons why it does not deserve a place here if the nom is too intellectually lazy to address the question? If that's the best noms can do, they should do something else with their time. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:58, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm on record as saying "fuck process". The nominator damn well <i>should</i> do a good job of explaining why he thinks an article must be deleted; if he cannot be bothered, then he should not be listing articles for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 10:56, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Monkey Bar (Market Lane) is one of the few pubs in Newcastle that hasnt been modernised, had its name changed etc... it has more history than I, personally, know of and can be expanded by others... for example Thatcher131 has another historical version of how the pub got its nickname... it seems slightly ironic that it is mentioned in the argument for deletion... whatever...

<li><b>Note</b> - yes I (Icehardkiller) wrote the article being discussed. Is the above Note implying that I am not entitled to argue for the article's permanent inclusion? Apologies if I am grasping the wrong end of the stick... and, yes again, all of my Edits are to do with The Monkey Bar article - but whats wrong with that? Finally in response to the original complaint, all the pubs in England are not listed in Wikipedia - but some are, see 'Category:Public houses in the United Kingdom' - if Swatjester's argument was applied to every entry, Wikipedia would be, for the large part, empty.

</ul>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find that what's really important or relevant for an entry isn't what we vaguely define as inspiration, fact or even what it is we do/want to say, recall, regret, or rebel against. No, what's important is the way we say it. Art is all about craftsmanship. Others can interpret craftsmanship as style if they wish. Style and importance is what unites memory or recollection, ideology, sentiment, nostalgia, presentiment, to the way we express all that. It's not what we say but how we say it that matters and how that affects those that read and understand our art. In the end, who are we to judge what anyone else finds relevant unless we have been in their shoes!

<li><b>Keep</b> (or at least I assume thats what the dude who used the talkpage was voting due to his comment) I agree with the previous view. Who are we to say what's worthy and what's not. If the pub means a lot to enough people, keep it here. Those who say "just a pub" don't know what they're talking about.

<li><b>Delete</b> in lieu of the last set of votes, and due to the fact that, however interesting they may be, historical places are not inherently notable. If we had an article for every building not "having had its name changed," which appears to this pubs saving grace according to keep votes, then we'd have tons of articles about every trivial building in most every major eurpean city and a few American ones. It only yields 11 results when searching for "The Monkey Bar Market Lane" and when searching Monkey Bar newcastle, the first page is entirely composed of the pub's page, a few pub-centric travel guides, and the wikipedia page. This bar is not notable, thus I reiterate, <b>Delete</b> per nom. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragoonmac_a999.html" title="User:Dragoonmac">Dragoonmac</a> - <sup><small><a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDragoonmac_c0f3.html" title="User talk:Dragoonmac">If there was a problem</a> <b>yo</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dragoonmac_72de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dragoonmac">I'll solve it</a></small></sup> 23:22, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
