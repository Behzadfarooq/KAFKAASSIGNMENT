<li><strike>This PLASMA SUPERWEAPON would probably make part of a great sci-fi novel on Wikibooks.</strike> After reviewing what links to it more extensively, my opinion is that it should be merged; I do not see this article expanding like other "weapon"/"ship" articles on the same topic. <b>Merge; delete this article</b>. <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygar_df57.html" title="User:Tygar">Tygar</a> 07:49, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but only if the article begins with information about the geographical location, not just the camps (it is a lake in Sequoia National Forest, Fresno County, California, and an adjacent unincorporated area; not sure why Rambot didn't pick it up and create an automatic article; can also be redirected to Hume, California which is sufficiently notable to create).

<li><b>Keep</b> re-write (nice work on the new intro and POV-ectomy, Antandrus, BTW).

Oh, there's an Aussie 'Hume Lake' as well (only found with <i>"Hume Lake" -california -christian -ministries -sequoia</i>) that also could force a disamb page, but the MoS says to only disambig when necessary, and the only article linking here, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_S._Eastwood_6787.html" title="John S. Eastwood">John S. Eastwood</a>, is, indeed, looking for the CA 'Hume Lake', so it's probably not necessary yet. And, I would argue that, if anything, Hume, California should, at least for the time being, redir to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hume_Lake_9064.html" title="Hume Lake">Hume Lake</a>, as it appears that the 25 (at most--census data for ZIP 93628 covers a pretty big area) year-around households there are probably all to serve the lake's camps. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 12:40, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p>Having nominated the article for deletion, I found that it had previously been speedily deleted on two occasions. However, the content now is very different, and I feel needs further debate. In fact, it is rather a well-written article, and far more than a stub. However, I don't feel that a single magazine article merits its own article, unless it has in some way been very influential, which this doesn't seem to have been. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 18:10, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I created the article based on an empty link directly from the Hunter Thompson page and what I thought was a need for it. Though not a particularly significant article it is indicative of Thompson's style. I also think that the relative importance of the article depends on where you're coming from. For Killy fans it probably means nothing, for Thompson followers the information is useful in locating the source and content of the original Scanlan's article, as well as giving some insights and context into Thompson's well-known sports addiction. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogan_5_aba6.html" title="User:Logan 5">Logan 5</a> 19:24, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The piece was written for Playboy, which turned it down; it was published by a fellow maverick, San Franciscan Warren Hinckle. Thompson later said that his realization that he could "get away with" such an outrageous writing style convinced him to stop trying to write "like the New York Times. It was like falling down an elevator shaft and landing in a pool full of mermaids."</li>

<li>This re-nomination is sooner than I prefer, but if one actually reads the list, it is clear that it is NOT informative, as many line-items are not widely held, which means they are original research and/or unverifiable. Austrians "Annoy people by singing everywhere they go..."? Puh-leaze, I am in the US and I'm not aware of anyone who supports that view. Suggesting the list should be moved to 'US stereotypes' assigns the US even more of a small-mindedness than it deserves. Dutch "speak English better than British or Americans"? Sez whoo? Icelanders "...love to fight when intoxicated"? since when is that not true of a good percentage of any nationality? Native Americans "often live on reservations"--well duh, but is it by choice? WASP Americans "favor Gin &amp; Tonics over other drinks, call them G&amp;Ts"--my ancestors are all from the British Isles, except for one German and one Flemish, but give me vodka&amp;7-up any day. And many have entries like "women have large breasts", "alcoholics", "smoke too much"--like any of these are really limited to certain nationalities/ethnicities, and to whatever extent it may be true isn't accurately represented in this list. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:38, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even after removing the many things on the list that are <b>not</b> stereotypes, if any of this information was accurate, useful or interesting, we would have seen at least some of it added to each ethnicy/nationality entry. While such a list may seem to have potential at first, I think the case against it is made more clear when one considers the prospect of having this information listed on each ethnicy/nationality entry.

<li>An article under this title could be very useful and scholarly; it could discuss the history of each stereotype, who holds or held it, and even what incidents it derives from. This article, by contrast, reads like a bunch of random surfers put it together... um, well, yes.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sure we can all agree this article is crap the way it is now. It's more important than usual to carefully verify <i>everything</i> so we make sure nobody's slipping in POV and original research, which is pretty easy to do with a list like this. It's a daunting task, but it's been done before. List of celebrities with links to the US Republican Party, a VfD survivor with somewhat similar POV and verifiability pitfalls, now has a source for every entry. While that article's not exactly feature quality, it's a good example of how articles headed for the VfD scrapheap can be saved. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">/sɪzlæk</font></a><a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak"><font color="green">˺/</font></a> 02:14, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>That list has one very important feature that this list lacks - items deserving of their own entries. Having said that, that list is still pretty poor. Have you looked at the references? One reference on some obscure blog or one mention of a donation is all it seems to take to label an actor as linked to the Republican party. That's a pretty useless list, to be used as nothing more than a rumormill. Respective articles on snopes.com would probably be more informative.

<p>Yes it isn't a notable one, neither is Pai Lum or Chi Ling Pai Gung Fu which it is descended from. Squidwina thought it was a school and was wrong on that account. What else could Squidwina be wrong about? - <i>Unsigned comment provided by</i> 66.82.9.75.</p>
<p>I too have studied Martial Arts, since 1979. If you don't know who Daniel Pai, Manuel Agrella, Denis Decker, or Bruce Juchnik are then you probably don't know what T'ien Lung Tao is either. An advertisement would require contact information as how to join. What is provided is information about the system with no references as to where to get instruction in said system. So far you are not proving your point very well and showing to be more of the usual, our system is better than yours attitude. The fact is that no system is better than another. What can be better about a system is the scientific Theories it employs as a basis for its modality. Better questions result in better answers.

<dd>Dear 66.82.9.75, my "sweeping statement" was admitting that I didn't know if the style was notable and I provided a context for that statement as well as saying that the article itself doesn't meet my standards for an encyclopaedia. I didn't say that I thought the style itself was good or not. I also said that I thought the article wasn't up to standards, and voted to delete it not just on the actual construction of the article (which can be fixed easily enough) but also informed by the context that I have indeed never heard of the style in all my years of training, judging tournaments and travelling to China. It is a new style invented by a Westerner and doesn't meet my standards for notability because of its newness, not its technical basis. I also considered your uncalled-for comments about <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquidwina_7da9.html" title="User:Squidwina">Squidwina</a>. I hope for your sake that such a tone isn't indicative of the philosophy of the art you espouse. That is my explanation, as you requested, and I have been shown no reason to change my vote as yet.

<p>Dear “Fire Star”...</p>
<p>"it is a new style invented by a Westerner and doesn't meet my standards" sums up your argument and makes this appear as a personal issue, hence the seeming defensiveness. As I understand it, Wikipedia as a concept is supposed to be a living source of information. In this way, Wikipedia seems to embody a source of collective knowledge rather than a realm of personal myopic ramblings. Cataloging only what you feel is important leaves others to do without new and possibly desirable information, which seems to be contradictory to the concept of an open body of knowledge. As we are new here, it would be more constructive to assist us in sharing our information appropriately. We seek to share the history behind T'ien Lung Tao. We are not interested in ego conflicts.</p>
<p>We will continue to make revisions and if you wish to assist us that would be more helpful than what has been offered thus far.</p>
<p>Please note that we have added links to those persons and systems that have connections to T'ien Lung Tao. Many have been extremely influential throughout the Martial Arts world in the last 50 years ragardless whether or not you have personally heard of them. Our goal is to present only factual information in an unbiased way. If what we post does not come through that way please make exact reference to the issue so that we may clarify or remedy it accordingly. I am studying the Wikietiquette as you can see by my new signing. I have read up on Wikilove and haven’t seen much of it yet.AnDruidh 21:54, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have been a student of the martial arts for more than twenty years and have been a referee and judge on the open tournament circuit for a large part of that time. During my years of training, I was taught by virtually all of my instructors that an open mind was one of my greatest tools as well as one of my strongest weapons. Nothing should be taken at its face value nor should it be dismissed out of hand. Unfortunately, I have seldom seen this lesson put into practice by many of my colleagues. With this in mind, I undertook a little research into the art of T’ien Lung Tao.</p>
<p>I had the distinct honour and privilege of meeting Grand Master Dennis Decker several years ago and trained with him on a couple of occasions shortly before his untimely death. Master Decker was a great innovator and leader on the cutting edge of martial arts education in North America if not the entire world. I had never met with anyone in the martial arts more noteworthy and remarkable…until now.</p>
<p>I met with Mr. Bober (his students call him Professor) and several of the instructors of T’ien Lung Tao, and have found that the system is indeed noteworthy and remarkable. The standard of education in their martial arts is beyond anything I have previously experienced and the quality of instruction is exceptional.</p>
<p>I also reviewed a number of entries (not exclusively martial arts) in the Wikipedia site as well as other sites of a similar nature. I find that the outline of T’ien Lung Tao is not very different from many other similar articles that have been accepted for some time.</p>
<p>Granted, T’ien Lung Tao has, until recently, been rather unknown, unremarked and little noticed. I am reminded of another small organization of printers and bicycle makers who were unknown, unremarkable, and of little note until one cold, windy day in 1903 at a little-known place called Kitty Hawk.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. - Greetings:</li>
</ul>
<p>As this site is open to anyone, thus the danger of having “anyone” posting. This can be either positive or negative. To observe these statements, knowing full well that there was no serious form of research done is a shame and a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>We have already seen statements made that were proven false. One individual has already made mention that in all of his years of training and judging he has never heard of it! We do not know the validity and quality of those years, yet it seems ironic that we are to believe his argument based on that he has not heard of it.</p>
<p>An extensive amount of martial artists have never even heard of a system known as Hanko-ryu. This system was created in Okinawa, and its founder would become one of the most famous Okinawan karate instructors of all time. Several movies were made based on his character.</p>
<p>This system is hardly even known today. Hanko-ryu (Half-Hard style) was created by Chojun Miyagi. Of course several years after creating hanko-ryu, he re-modeled it into what is now known as Goju-ryu. Most Goju-ryu stylists do not even know this.</p>
<p>In China, there are literally hundreds of martial arts systems, and the earlier commentary on never having heard of the style presupposes that the individual has extensively researched all of them.</p>
<p>I think there should not be a major focus on the history of the system but the information presented, which is hardly even discussed in martial arts circles. Having been in the martial arts for a couple of DECADES, having traveled across North America, I can name many systems that you may not have heard about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, disagreeing with the post just because the system was founded in the US strongly suggests a serious ethnic misconception of movement and motion. I am sorry but Orientals do not own human anatomy and physics.</p>
<p>I suggest you keep this post, and perhaps even learn from it by actually researching some of the material mentioned in it. - jadescorpion</p>

<li>I will not go into a notability arguement at this time, but that does not address the other two issues I have raised. Keeping is fine if that is what you want, but callnig this a paragon of school articles is a bit extreme. Just because it is more than two lines and therefore superior to 99% of the school articles we have does not make it a shining example, which implies that a longer POV section and some unmaintainable statistics constitute an outstanding article on a school. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:32, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Based upon the trends I have been following on VfD, one could concretely assert that Wikipedia is only a "real" encyclopaedia when it is a matter of convenience to be one. The entire matter of "notability" is one hundred percent subjective. As it has been so vibrantly illustrated right here in this discussion, many contributors to Wikipedia strongly DO believe schools to be inherently noteworthy and "encyclopedic". To answer your original question, which was incorrectly punctuated, yes, schools in the "middle of nowhere" <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0773490507" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0773490507" rel="nofollow">are included in print-encyclopaedias</a> without any mention of Slashdot. Does this really surprise you? Either we can agree to disagree and move on, or continue to repeat ourselves in this exercise of futility. Which do you choose?

An influx of new users, especially on VfD, does not necessarily mean they are <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>. However, anonymous and new users should be aware that we've had significant problems with sockpuppets in the past, so simple statements of opinion are likely to be ignored. Hard facts which add to the discussion, on the other hand, would be much more useful. Has this school had any notable alumni, for example? Or media coverage (besides local descriptions of athletic events)? —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 08:00, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b>: I don't know why people would create sockpuppets, but I agree, don't bite them. As for notable alumni, I am compiling a list currently. This Saturday, there may also be media coverage if Robert Frost Middle School wins the regional science bowl (there was media coverage when the local high school won their science bowl last weekend.)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: Frost did win the Virginia/Maryland Regional Science Bowl and there will be an article in the Rockville Gazette newspaper. Coverage of a science bowl does not seem to fall under the category of "local descriptions of athletic events." The article will appear this Wednesday and, if they put the article online (which they do not do with all their articles), I will post a link. Besides, the vote is 35 keep to 25 delete. Even subtracting some keeps (because of the sockpuppets), it seems like keep won by a landslide. Although there aren't any notable alumni I have found as of now, there might be years from now considering there seem to be exceptionally gifted students (that won the science bowl for two states.) By the way, what's "vote stacking"?

Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group.

Moreover: When I pushed for improvement to establish notability early on in this article's history, what I <i>wasn't</i> pushing for was this exercise in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a>. The school is "fifth in the county" in one respect, and "one of the only schools in the county" in another. What does it mean to be "one of the only schools"? And what are the standard deviations that accompany the various means (without which many of the raw statisics are pretty useless)? The prodding has just resulted in padding, I'm afraid.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is one of the sucesses of mathematics that large quanties of information can be summarised in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>. The use of this in this article is well thought out and certainly encylopedic. A researcher looking at this page would be very happy with what he saw and horrified that all but "one line in a table" were to be deleted for the reasoning afformentioned.</li>

<dd>What makes this school <i>stand out from the crowd</i> is evident on the page. A school does not need Nobel Prize Winners in its alumi to unique, this article is evidence that in-depth research into a school will uncover unique information. The above article simplifies articles' validity down to a one-dimensional scale, which is very tempting to do when considering VfD, of <i>notablility of facts contained in article</i>. On this scale, almost all schools will be deleted as they'd fall into the middle ground. However in reality the total is greater than the sum of the parts and a collaboration of these facts and figures in a coherent article builds up a real and encyclopedic picture of what the school is like.</dd>
<dd>As a summation, if you picked up one of the 1157 pupils in this school and placed them in one of the other 37 middle schools in Montgomery County do you think they'd consider the differences non-notable?--<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 00:29, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
