<p>Accordinging to policy this link is enough on its own to keep them in. <a href="http://www.skratchmagazine.com/cd-reviews/CDreviewsJUL05.php" class="external text" title="http://www.skratchmagazine.com/cd-reviews/CDreviewsJUL05.php" rel="nofollow">AKCBD album review</a> - also, search them in msm or alta vista - you'll get different results. Plus, they are the definitive band of the Southern California Electroclash scene. The style was originally made big in NY and they are the biggest and most active SoCal dance/punk band. The East Coast style focuses more on hipster issues while AKCBD is setting a precedent by focusing on darker topics. The west coast version incorporates more guitar and live drums and is not solely synth and drum machine driven. The policy specifically says its just a guideline and the band has been featured in a major music publication, has toured 3x and is representative of a certain style and place. It almost feels like Keepsleeping has a personal vendetta aginst the band. Leave it in</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> for everyone who's upset about the allegation that it's a hoax, I agree with you, Google isn't the world. In fact, the Google test is currently one of the least accurate information-finding methods I can think of.

<li><b>Comment</b> I searched for this term in Encyclopedia Britannica, Expanded Academic Index (online database, indexing thousands of periodicals <a href="http://www.galegroup.com/tlist/sb5019.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.galegroup.com/tlist/sb5019.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), and a newspaper index which indexes over 100 newspapers and did not find one reference to this word in a full keyword search dating back to the mid-80's. It's entirely possible that it's so super-specialized that it's only mentioned in professional literature outside of these more general databases, but then I wonder why it isn't mentioned in <a href="http://iobis.org/" class="external text" title="http://iobis.org/" rel="nofollow">OBIS</a> (the Ocean Biogeographic Information System) since according to the commenters, it's not a newly discovered lifeform.

<li><b>Delete</b>, my search at the library has turned up no sources, let alone any suggesting importance.

<li>No, that would still not be relevant to the basic question of notability. Speculation on whether or not the topic would become notable in the future doesn't answer the question of whether the webcomic has at some point before now met the standards for notability. That said, I'm going to tentatively say <b>weak delete</b> on the basis of lack of any evidence for notability (I haven't found any either), and ask the contributors to the article<a href="http://www.lazarusworld.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1557" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lazarusworld.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1557" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> if they can provide any non-trivial sources.

<li>Repeating an invalid argument does not make it any more true.

<li>Thank you for sharing. Sometimes editors think it's a good idea to keep an article because, for example, it is tied to an event just around the corner which may lead to verifiable info from reputable sources. Whether or not you, in your self-appointed role as validator of AFD discussions, believe that to be an idea worth expresing, that type of "wait and see" idea probably isn't worth exploring here with "This article about a no longer published webcomic [which] meets almost no standards." In other words, that the webcomic is no longer published is worth noting as it is unlikely that a defunct webcomic is going to gain new verifiable coverage in the multiple non-trivial reputable sources which will allow us to cover this topic from a neutral point of view without delving into original research, or any of our other standards which this article currently doesn't meet. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a></li>

<li><b>comment</b> I did not mean to make it sound like I hold a bias.

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> The author didn't make the entry to my knowledge, it was made several years after he had quit. In it's day it was a popular comic, noted as 'groundbreaking' by Mac Hall as commented in a previous deletion-discussion, referenced often in many other notiable strips... I don't know if that meets the standards or not for notiability since I'm not sure if other webcomics count (I think they should, there wasn't much else around at the time to judge notiability) but it's not just some author tooting their own horn. 22:53, 14 February 2007</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article has already been nominated for deletion once, and the end result of that attempt was <b>keep</b>. Given that the comic was determined to be notable shortly after the article was written, I think any argument that it is not notable should have more substance than "I did a search at the library and didn't find anything". A Google search of "bad boys of computer science" yields about 600 hits. Even a cursory examination of the results provides additional research leads, namely the web-comics Avalon and Sexy Losers. You may have to actually <b>ask</b> a member of the web-comics community to determine whether this comic was notable, if you are not a part of that community. Do the research to attempt to improve the article. If, despite your <b>best efforts</b>, you cannot find evidence of notability, document your search efforts on the talk page, then start the AFD process. Do not leap to that stage from the perspective that all webcomics suck, this article sucks even more than most webcomic articles, and Wikipedia should purge it as unworthy to be read. Deletion should not be the first option for someone who does not care to provide the effort to improve the article in any way; it should be the option of last resort for a topic that cannot meet standards, even when improved as much as humanly possible. 216.165.132.250 15:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Past performance doesn't guarantee future success. Look at the GNAA. It went through 18 AFD's before it was deleted. The reason I nominated this was because all the sources I found were other Webcomics, which I believe doesn't qualify as a good enough source for another webcomic. The only webcomic's that I believe that should be shown here are the ones that have published books are have had newspaper articles written about it (like Megatokyo). I don't believe all webcomics suck, but if it their are no reliable sources outside of webcomics, then I believe this has to go. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 17:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that, as of 2007, print-based sources are better determinants of notability than either web-based sources or first-hand personal interviews. The major reason why Wikipedia is so successful is that there are no "gatekeepers" for information: anyone can add or edit the content. If you require that notability be documented in a restricted medium, you are just moving the gatekeeper around to the back door. Also, I don't think BBoCS is comparable to GNAA in regard to the AfD process. Perhaps you could find a more fair comparison than the article for a trolling organization that has a racial slur in its title. In my opinion, the best sources for determining the notability of a web-comic are the people that are involved in that community, and comic authors are de facto leaders. They network amongst one another as much as print comic authors. Do you recall Blondie and Dagwood's anniversary, wherein most of the comics in your local newspaper paid tribute to the long-running print comic <b>by drawing crossover comics</b>? 216.165.132.250 21:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Their are gate keepers on information. That is the reason why their is Speedy Deletion and AFD. And no one used the crossover to cite information in Wikipedia. Plus, that was covered in various newspaper articles, namely "multiple non-trivial sources". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 21:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then the bone of contention here is whether other web-comics constitute a non-trivial source in regard to other web-comics. In my opinion, they are non-trivial. The people that read web-comics know which ones they like, and the authors, being drawn from the same pool of people, tend to like the same things. So in lieu of polling hundreds of readers (as may be seen from an archive from some sort of web-comics meta site, like Keen or BigPanda), a handful of webcomics authors may constitute a representative sample. Additionally, if you are too quick to label a newspaper as a non-trivial source, you may not be keeping your subscriptions current, as the presence of paid reporters and editors does not seem to be sufficient to keep pointless tripe and blatant political bias out of my local newspapers. There is good reason why print newspaper circulation is declining in the U.S., and that is because the "gatekeeper" model is no better at providing quality information than the free-for-all of blogs, boards, and wikis. The only advantage the media establishment currently holds over the internet mob is freer access to "newsmaker" people. They can get interviews with presidents and CEOs. But this is not an obstacle here. Many web-comics authors publish their e-mail addresses. If you want to prove non-notability (and in my opinion that burden of proof is on you, as this is an appeal to an earlier determination of notability), then ask some of these people if "Bad Boys of Computer Science" was notable way back in 2002. If you don't know who to ask, then perhaps you shouldn't be making judgements of notability at all. 216.165.132.250 22:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, the issue of whether the Blondie anniversary crossovers were used as references in Wikipedia is not relevant. If there were no other information available on Blondie whatsoever, the crossover comics alone would have been sufficient to establish its notability. I consider print-comics authors to have great credibility in regard to the importance of other print-comics. The same principle holds for web-comics. In contrast, there is no intrinsic measure of credibility in a fluff newspaper article whose author has never heard of a web-comic until his editor told him to write an article about them for the Sunday edition. But that reporter will still actually do enough research on the topic to fill a certain number of column-inches before flapping his jaw about it. 216.165.132.250 22:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This subject lacks sufficient independent sources to produce an article complying with NOT an indiscriminate collection of information, and NOT a publisher of original thought. Con reports are teenage-blog-level unreliable, and the other material is trivial in the extreme. Tim McCloud is quite right about biases though. My bias against including material which can't be supported by reliable sources is very strong indeed, and Wikipedia's policies and guidelines are similarly biased against made up stuff.

<li><b>Comment</b> (added because the article said that it was a candidate for deletion), which would be a shame, since the article is rich with history and humor, and very well written. I suppose I don't care where it goes, as long as it is not deleted completely. My first vote would be to leave it as is, and reference it from the main MIT article.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Normally, I'd support merge with MIT, but as mentioned MIT is too long already. One thing here is that a lot of the MIT incoming student types might be the kind of person who might consult wikipedia to get an idea of what the various dorms are like before picking one. Actually, a general article on MIT dorms with a section for each would be OK, without inflating the MIT article size, but until them, keep. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 03:22, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep or Move</b> Dorms are an important part of university life, espicially those with distinctive character. However, inclusion of such information in university main articles causes those articles to become bloated and takes away from information about the academic side of the university. As such, there is adequate reason for articles on dorms to exist.</li>

<dd>And that's what I get for assuming a vanity page would spell the ex-pastor's name correctly. However, at 36 hits, I stand by my previous vote.

<dd>I was the submitter of these three articles (Cityside, Mark Pearson, Stations of the Cross) - my intent was not promotion as such but the recognition of a person, group and phenomenon which have been influential in NZ and internationally in the alt.worship and emerging church movements, well out of proportion to the group's numbers. If the criterion is that they are already widely recognised elsewhere than Wikipedia, I accept that as a reason for deletion, with regret. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeRM_5cdf.html" title="User:MikeRM">MikeRM</a> 19:38, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Weak <b>delete</b>. Definitely looks like most of it is made up, but I'm not sure if the subject matter itself quite as non-notable as one might think; if nothing else, there's a persistent urban legend going around about gang executions by curbstomping, and it <i>has</i> been seen in fiction besides <i>American History X</i>, and since it's a pretty specific, graphic and nasty thing to do, it's a lot more notable than "punch" by default...

<li>Interesting. I have little doubt that the term is indeed used in this manner to describe the type of violent attack and ensuing injury described in the article (although the bits like "Curbing is a relatively modern method of 'messing people up' that is regularly used by gangs worldwide to kill their victims" are nonsense). However, it is a slang term; if accepted at all on a wikiproject, it should be in Wiktionary. As to the consequences of this type of beating, it would be best to describe them in medical articles, for example maxillofacial fractures/maxillofacial trauma, LeFort fractures, mandibular fracture, palatal fracture, orbital apex injury, etc. (As you can see from the red-links, Wikipedia has a long way to go.) <b>Del</b> unless adequate references are available that would satisfy Wiktionary, in which case pare down to an accurate one sentence definition and <b>transwiki</b>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>07:44, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</i>

<li>Both Wikipedia and Wiktionary require adequate references to reputable sources for material written in their respective mainspaces. I am less familiar with the precise requirements of Wiktionary, but am fairly sure that anecdotal references to usage among friends will not satisfy them.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the creator of this site, a vote by me would be considered fancruft, so I'm not voting. However, I'd like to present some information about Diary-X that is relevant to this vote. Diary-X has a total of 117,467 users, of which approximately 7,269 are active. Only 35% of them are listed in the members directory (which is opt-in only). Diary-X has been online since August 2000, and has recieved mention (although not in an article focused on Diary-X) in Newsweek and Time magazines. The forums have approximately 4,818 members, although technically all Diary-X members are allowed to contribute to the forums. Our Alexa ranking is 29,249, and Google results are misleading because Google has only recently lifted an internal ban on the diary-x.com domain. This of course all boils down to not meeting the requirements for website notability, but only just barely.

<li>Embee is probably the most well-known and established hip-hop producer in Sweden. This is partly due to his membership of Loop-Troop, where he is the sole writer of their music, and partly through his recent venture as a solo artist and the release of the album Tellings From Solitaria which received the Swedish Grammy for 2004 in the category Best Hip-Hop/Soul. Loop-troop's new album Fort Europa went recently straight in at no. 5 on the Album Chart and the band is currently touring Europe.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Any reference to any website here on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> could be considered <i>advertising</i>, so it's quite a lame reason. So the question would remain whether this website warrants an entry in an encyclopedia. Since Freeones is one of the largest and also longest-living site of its kind, featuring original content and normally biographical data on its featured <i>actresses</i>, <i>centerfolds</i>, <i>musicians</i>, <i>porn stars</i>, <i>sportswomen</i>, <i>supermodels</i> and <i>TV hosts</i> (these are the categories by which one can sort the entries), which can (and will) be used as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">sources</a> to enter/verify information on Wikipedia. For both reason I strongly support keeping this entry.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally I should point out that judging someone's work by <i>unrelated contributions</i> is a bit useless if the registered (!) user has only started contributing. The fellow has made his first contribution on November 2nd, which was just about 5 hours before his article was marked for deletion (which is not the point here - my reasoning for keeping was argued above) and his contribution history was used as an argument against the article - thus being <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> (including the fact that the list at the beginning of this discussion was claimed by <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">User:Texture</a> to be the <i>creating user's edits for the day</i> which is just the half-truth; as I already mentioned, it's his first contribution to Wikipedia ever, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CWonroy_47df.html" title="Special:Contributions/CWonroy">Special:Contributions/CWonroy</a>). <a href="../../../j/m/2E/User%7EJM.Beaubourg_9f30.html" title="User:JM.Beaubourg">JM.Beaubourg</a> 00:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In judging whether a website and immediate links to it in other articles are spam and not real what do we have to use as a guide? Every day that passes where this user makes <b>no other contributions</b> furthers a simple belief that this was a spam attack. New users do not solely add one website to many articles and <b>perform no other edits</b>. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 16:43, 4 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It took me 2 days and three hours to make further contributions after adding the first article, and the following edits were pretty much related to my first contributions. All I'm saying is, that this is not considered a valid argument. And if this were a spam attack, then it took the folks at Freeones an astounding four years (well I don't know the exact date when Wikipedia was set up), as Freeones was started in 1998. I feel like Wikipedia can also be used describe the functions of internet business, of which sex-related website make an important part (I mean: who owns what, what practices do they use - so it can also be used as a critical guide). <a href="../../../j/m/2E/User%7EJM.Beaubourg_9f30.html" title="User:JM.Beaubourg">JM.Beaubourg</a> 00:51, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Let me begin by saying that I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH FREEONES or their webmasters or anything; If I was, I think I probably would have been versed enough to make a more detailed entry. Second, I can see why my contributions have raised suspicions since they are the only contributions I made in that time frame and they did all relate. I guess that's fair game for debate (although unintended). But <a href="../../../j/m/2E/User%7EJM.Beaubourg_9f30.html" title="User:JM.Beaubourg">JM.Beaubourg</a> raised a good point and it leads me to ask, would it have been better if I would have interspersed my contributions with other random contributions to make the more diversified? I don't think that's a requirement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, if you look at the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Lopez_ceb9.html" title="Sky Lopez">Sky Lopez</a> revision history, you will find that in addition to adding the Freeones link, I fixed a caption error at the top of the article. When <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Texturε</font></a> reverted my edit back to the previous version, the caption error remained. Another user, <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrim_2417.html" title="User:Brim">Brim</a> has since fixed the caption error.</dd>
<dd>If you look at the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Klein_24c1.html" title="Crystal Klein">Crystal Klein</a> article's revision history as well, you find another mistake by <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Texturε</font></a>. Without comparing the article's history with my edit, he reverted back to the original article. The Freeones link was already there, and what I did was (1) Add a link to the new Freeones Article and (2) add <i><b>Warning</b>: Contains links to explicit material.</i> to the link. It did not exist when I edited the article, and therefore it did not exist when <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Texturε</font></a> reverted it back.</dd>
<dd>The same can be seen in the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalene_Kurtis_985d.html" title="Dalene Kurtis">Dalene Kurtis</a> article history where the Freeones link already existed and I just added a link to the Freeones article.</dd>
<dd>This is all just to show that we can all make mistakes and is not an attack on anybody. It also shows that even if insignificant, I did actually make other contributions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, I strongly feel that this entry, in and of itself, is <b>okay as encyclopedic material</b>. As for the links I created on the other articles, delete them if you have to as that is where the real debate lies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On a side note, consider that the website for <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibson_Research_Corporation_064a.html" title="Gibson Research Corporation">Gibson Research Corporation</a> is listed on Wikipedia and it's Alexa rating is currently 17867 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=grc.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=grc.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Then that raises the question, is the Alexa website ranking the determiner for encyclopedic material?; of course not. But, considering how many websites are ranked by Alexa, 561 has to be somewhat significant. <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howstuffworks.html" title="Howstuffworks">Howstuffworks</a> is ranked 1086 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=howstuffworks.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=howstuffworks.com" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> which surprised me. And lastly, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WebMD_e39f.html" title="WebMD">WebMD</a> is 622 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=webmd.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=webmd.com" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</dd>

<p>I am sorry for the trouble I have caused, and I hope the issue resolves itself. Thanks for sharing your opinions on the matter. –CWonroy.</p>

<p>The claims made in the article are frankly unbelievable about a 19 year old, and I get no hits on Google for "George Rivera" with "Trips Records" or "Trips Gear". "George Rivera" with "Albuquerque" in the search gets a lot of hits, but it isn't clear that any of them relate to the subject of the article.

<li>If Boepple has recorded for a number of labels, where can I buy his CDs online? Where did Hans Boepple receive his PhD and where is the list of published papers? If Boepple has made important contributions to the field, there should be a list of published papers, if his contributions were original and worth putting into writing. The logic to save this page is ludicrous: "He lives in a unique city and he plays a unique set of songs." This is a vanity page and does not deserve to be in an encyclopedia. If Boepple is a noted classical performer, where is his concert or touring schedule? An occassional concert doesn't qualify as a concert pianist. Hundreds of piano competitions are held every year with hundreds of winners. Boepple is not notable. The fact that SCUMATT would call him a renowned classical pianist and hyperlink pianist to the Wikipedia pianist page does a disservice and is self-promotion. More troubling is the title of "Master Pianist" on Wikipedia. Assuming no one steps up to the plate to point to his CDs, his playing doesn't rise to the level of playing as other pianists that are on Wikipedia pianist page. The fact that there are links to his faculty web page indicate this is vanity. We99 17:23, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

The newly registered users arguing for the retention of the article should presumably be in a position to provide details of Boepple's other recordings hinted at in his online bios, but that they seem uninterested in doing so is making me lean towards changing my vote to a delete (I'll wait a couple of days before doing so, though). The PhD issue is however completely irrelevant for a music professor - I don't think <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_Boulanger_bdcb.html" title="Nadia Boulanger">Nadia Boulanger</a> had a doctorate - so please don't waste time on that either way unless the argument is that he has made some scholarly contributions to musicology. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:27, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>First of all, the point of the comparison was not to compare the importance of one with the other, but to point out that a <i>professor of music</i>, i.e. somebody who teaches music on a practical level at a conservatory or musical academy or similar institution (which is apparently what Boepple does), does not normally need to have a Ph.D., as opposed to somebody who teaches, say, music history. In this case, the music school just happens to be part of a university, which is what may confuse you. Secondly, <b>stop revising your original comments! To substantially change a comment to which somebody else has already replied confuses the issue and makes the discussion impossible to follow.</b> If you want to reply to a comment made by somebody else, don't change your original comment, but put your new comment, indented, below the comment you want to reply to, and sign it with a datestamp. Please go back now and restore your comment to what it originally looked like when I replied to it, and add your newer comments further down in the discussion. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 18:38, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For reasons already stated above, whether this Boepple has a doctorate is not the issue. It is completely irrelevant. Neither is the issue whether he is the equal of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rubinstein_5bfd.html" title="Arthur Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a> as a pianist or of <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_Boulanger_bdcb.html" title="Nadia Boulanger">Nadia Boulanger</a> as an instructor. The issue is just <i>whether he is notable enough</i> for to fulfill the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, which lets in a lot of obscure death metal bands only notable in their own subculture. So far I haven't seen any sensible discussion of that either from you or from the other recently created users commenting below. And BTW, I have already stated that I will change my vote to delete unless Boepple's defenders present more evidence of his recordings. You don't need to convince me on that point, but stop obsessing over the issue of his doctorate. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 22:50, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>I have repaired the links to the interviews, which I thought would be beneficial additions to provide personal insight concerning Boepple that print encyclopedias don't have the opportunity to demonstrate. As far as recordings, the two that seem to be listed most often are the Kjos Music recordings shown above and the complete Bagatelles by Beethoven for the Orion Master Recordings series. See <a href="http://www.csmusic.org/html/boepple.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmusic.org/html/boepple.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. I haven't been able to track down any pre-web era recordings that he may have made. It is true that Boepple has settled into teaching and has not currently toured as a performer within the last decade or so. To me, his past performances and competitions, recordings, and demand as a teacher should be enough to warrant an article. Particularly, the inclusion on the Steinway list suggests that he is a highly respected classical musician. Once again, no one is trying to compare him with the great pianists of the past. Also: do see my new comments below. As they suggest, I am not at all opposed to changing the wording of the article such that it does not include terms like "renowned" or "master pianist" if a consensus is reached that these words, by definition, should only be used for household names. To me, they are usual enough in the classical music lexicon to be used with any well respected performer.<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7ESCUMATT_90a5.html" title="User:SCUMATT">SCUMATT</a> 4:35, 5 November 2005 (PST) (I'm not sure if there is a way to edit the page so that this comes up automatically.

<li>I know in my heart that this article is worth keeping on the basis that Hans Boepple has won one international piano competition in the last millenium when back when piano competitions were geniunely competitive because the idea had not caught on as much as it has today. These days I counted 100 competitions at <a href="http://www.piano-net.com/links.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.piano-net.com/links.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.piano-net.com/links.htm</a> so people take it for granted. Just because any international piano competition may seem meaningless today, it meant a lot than he won one a long time ago when there were fewer piano competitions and you could keep track of the names more easily. I am mostly impressed that all these notable symphony venues openly rented their facilities to him because every musician needs to play at important places and ask others for help promoting the concert with articles. We need to keep this article solely on the basis of the Steinway International list and the unique list of cities that he has played in. Getting real experience as a musician is far better than squandering time and cash on a Ph.D. in music or one of those DMA degrees. It would be completely unfair to compare him to to Jonathan Berger because he is a chairman of a rival university that grants its own doctorates in music and attended a univesrity that granted those degrees a long time ago. We only need to be listening to opinions that are neutral not from rival music scholars or rival musicians. We should definitely not compare him with chairwoman Ingrid Monsoon because she is an African jazz and she receives sponsorship monies from her sock puppet committee that was more interested in African jazz diversity instead sticking to the piano classics. Only undiplomatic doctorate divas who know nothing about how a university degree factory works would dare ask about his Ph.D. No music chair would ever ask about that of another because the chairman of the department can always print a diploma using university's special paper on it and ask his professional peers to sign it as a professional courtesy. There is nothing vain about being the chair of department and setting policy. Policy is not vain. It is one of the responsibilities and privileges of a department chairman to sign diplomas and make policy. I think music chairs also participate in admissions decisions too. I see every reason to keep this article. He is of a unique age and lives in a unique city and plays a unique set of songs. Those are the reasons to keep this article.

<li>As I entered the article into Wikipedia, I won't offer a vote in the matter; I will, however, offer some insights. First, in response to We99, noted classical performers don't always get PhD's and usually do not publish papers. Their artistic achievements generally speak for themselves. Secondly, I think that Boepple is sufficiently notable in classical circles, in which he is a widely recognized teacher and adjudicator as well as performer. Classical artists, unless we're talking about the very top handful, tend to receive media attention in specialized outlets that are not as widely read by people whose interests are not in classical music. Boepple is not the Michael Jordan of pianists; however, he has made important contributions to his field and is quite well regarded throughout the US. To extend the basketball metaphor, we welcome articles about proven stars in the NBA even if they are not Jordan or Bryant. Should we not extend the same welcome to pianists? <a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7ESCUMATT_90a5.html" title="User:SCUMATT">SCUMATT</a> 05:28, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My apologies <a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">User_talk:NSLE</a>, I mustn't have been signed in under my username when I edited my suggestion. Secondly, there were complaints about the wording... "master pianist" I believe. If the article is not deleted, please feel free to change the words. Often pianists are described in such a way when they have had as much education and performance experience as Mr. Boepple, even if they don't compare to whichever piano "greats" that you choose to cite. Thirdly, I am not interested in creating a vanity article concerning Mr. Boepple. As a student at SCU and someone realatively new to Wikipedia, I have simply tried to provide the information with which I am exposed at the present and that I think is helpful and acceptable by Wikipedia; I believe that I have been fair in this regard. Obviously, there is some disagreement and ambiguity in terms of the place of biography especially among musicians. Fourthly, there was some insinuation that Mr. Boepple was in some way interested in comparing himself with the said "paino greats" which is untrue. He has no knowledge of or association with this article, nor am I one of his students or a major or minor in his department. I am simply someone who has been told of his excellence, heard him play, and know that students from across the US come to Santa Clara to study with him and have turned down major scholarships to USC, Oberlin, and other noted conservatories to do so. My research about him suggested that he was enough of a noted classical pianist to warant a small article on Wikipedia. Obviously others disagree. I appreciate and understand criticism of articles I write and certainly understand if an article I write is deleted through this process; however, please do not jump to conclusions as to my reasoning for authoring this or any other article. <a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7ESCUMATT_90a5.html" title="User:SCUMATT">SCUMATT</a> 4:35, 5 November 2005 (PST) (I'm not sure if there is a way to edit the page so that this comes up automatically.

<li>A living healthy person like Boepple that hasn't toured in the last decade means he isn't a notable performer. If his recordings are notable, where are the reviews of those recordings? If these recordings were worthwhile, they would have been reviewed. I'm sorry, but an advertisement for Hans Boepple on Wikipedia just doesn't belong. Nadia Boulanger had people like Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein as her students. Has Boepple produced anyone close to an Aaron Copland? We99 02:17, 6 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, "a living healthy person like Boepple that hasn't toured in the last decade" may simply indicate that his attention has turned to teaching. Secondly, if Nadia Boulanger and Aaron Copland are the standards that Wikipedia is going to use to indicate which articles deserve to be on Wikipedia, then there are many articles in need of deleting. The decision of whether or not to include Boepple will depend entirely on this issue: whether this online encyclopedia tends to inclusivity or exclusivity. I don't think that I have the answer to that question. Do see the "classical music" section of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_1bae.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a> <a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7ESCUMATT_90a5.html" title="User:SCUMATT">SCUMATT</a> 2:30, 6 November 2005 (UTC). <i>(Note: Scumatt, were you asking about inserting your signature?

<li>If his attention has turned to teaching, what is the evidence to show he is a teacher worth putting into Wikipedia? What are the names of his greatest students?

<li><s><b>Provisional Delete</b></s>. <b>Delete</b>. I'm sorry, but I've been watching the development of this debate, expecting the keep voters to come up with better arguments, and I don't see it happening. The "unique age, unique city and unique set of songs" argument, or that "the chairman of the department can always print a diploma using university's special paper on it and ask his professional peers to sign it as a professional courtesy" don't really do the cause any favors, so I'll just disregard them. (I'm inside the "university degree factory" myself, and, um, no.) If the enthusiasts of B who have posted here don't come up with something more concrete, I'm going to vote "Delete" myself. SCUMATT, the decision doesn't so much depend on "whether this online encyclopedia tends to inclusivity or exclusivity", or how ably you can argue in the abstract, but more on what specific references you can supply. The reviews of recordings and names of notable students that We99 asks for would help, for instance. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:13, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>KEEP! I agreed with some earlier comments that Mr. Boepple does not need a Ph.D. to receive the international commercial recognition that he has receievd. There is a complete justification for keeping Hans Boepple is that he has made many contemporary developments classical music. Even if Hans Boepple is humble enough to refer to them as extraordinary secrets, those contributions deserve to be kept because his work is unique within the music profession. There are so few Bach purists, so few tenured music teachers, old school international competitors of international renown, Western European music experts, purists who respect the international developments of the last century, who have composed works with the unique key sequences that Mr. Boepple brings to the keyboard. It would reflect poorly on this encyclopedia if those who delete him do so without trying to find his songs and listen to them. I am not sure who is qualified to delete Mr. Boepple without listening to his compact discs, reading more about him, or seeing him perform in concert. I vote that we trust the neutrality and honesty of SCUMATT that Mr. Boepple has no knowledge of these articles or of SCUMATT's attempts to independently document his story (that more than satisfies my definition of history). Mr. Boepple's accomplishments are independently and adequately documented in Santa Clara University's website and the SCU alumni association magazine and written by people of color and people of gender who speak highly of him. Every reporter knows it is necessary to interview the source directly in order to have an accurate story. I feel the stories about Mr. Boepple are either accurate because he is quoted as a direct source or they are developed independently and are therefore neutral. These salaried university employees do not have any publicist commission interests in overstating or understating the accomplishments of Mr. Boepple so we can safely assume that they are stated at the correct level because it is a university publication that has passed editorial or some peer review muster. We also need to discount any comments from anyone who has a classical music CD that competes with Mr. Boepple. Mr. Boepple's music star rivals have every incentive to give him a poor review so those reviews need to be disconted. We need to filter out any biased comments from jealous individuals who have not earned the tenure that Mr. Boepple has. He has a masters degree in music with an emphasis on piano so does that not make him a master pianist if not a master musician. Many other music chairs lack the specialization in piano performance that Mr. Boepple has. I think if we document all the money that Mr. Boepple has received for any of his music expertise, we can conclude that he is a music professional and therefore deserves privilege of an article solely for the payments he has received for his music which seems far more relevant than answering questions about a degree he could have earned before any of his students were born. Golf players are accorded respect for the size of their money purse or their professional status. Why can't Mr. Boepple be accorded some respect for the size of his professional purse? He is more than a dallying amateur who could not hack it in the competitive world of classical piano and then needed to earn a living from one of those ultra-high paying low-class televised professions that lack the artistic respect that Mr. Boepple obtains freely. Mr. Boepple has earned the role of a tenured classical professional who consistently speaks the truth and should be respected for his position instead of constantly flip-flopping between professions because he does not know what his profession is. His sphere of influence is not restricted to a monolithic organization's monolithic website. If knowledge of Mr. Boepple is ubiquitous common knowledge, then I vote that this article should be allowed to document HIS story about what his job as a music chair is.

<p>This article is currently a duplicate of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_6327.html" title="Kathy Mitchell (EastEnders)">Kathy Mitchell (EastEnders)</a> article. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what the editor has done. The original page I created was simply named Kathy Mitchell (EastEnders), the user then went on to move this page to Kathy Beale (this being the previous marital name of the character), and then, instead of using the automatic move page, simply created Kathy Hills - Hills being the maiden name.</p>
<p>However, though the character of Kathy is divorced, she still posses the Mitchell name as can be seen on the BBC character profile.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is really no more than a dictionary definition. It’s difficult to see what else could be added to this beyond the definition that is given here. A party is a party and many kinds of beverages could be, and are served. Other than the beverages served, what is the difference between a beer party, a margarita party, a wine party, etc? It’s the people that make a party, not the beverage that is served. I’ll be glad to change my vote if someone can expand on this article enough to make a real article and explain the differences between a keg party and other types of parties. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:44, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> I am going to work on this article over the next couple of days on my broadband connectin and non-crappy computer at work to try to make it a worthwhile article. I will research its social meaning, especially with American youths, its association with binge drinking, the rejection of the events by many frats, and references in pop culture. Please check my edits this weekend and see if the article has been made worthwhile. If it still stinks, then lets trash it or restore the redirect. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 03:03,

<li><b>another comment</b> I worked on this a good bit, but a power outage deleted all of my work (I was too dumb to hit save). I still plan to work on this, but its been a hectic time at work, so it might be a while. But making this article-worthy is still tops on my wiki-to do list. In the mean time, I still urge everyone to vote <b>keep</b> or at least <b>redirect</b> to party in order to give me a chance to do a proper article without going through undeletion.

<li>I agree with <b>SoothingR</b>. A geniune Welsh person would know how to spell <b>TWPSYN</b>.

<p>Hello. I'm new to Wikipedia and I found this page, and saw the comments against the band. They DO exist, and, believe it or not, are quite good! They played a university gig (Aberystwyth probably, though it might have been Cardiff) back when I was a student and they really have a solid fanbase, most of which were good guys. So I plead, for them, keep them on!!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do know Laura-Jane, and she is rather distressed by the appearance here of "Student vanity" as a result of a google search on her name. Perhaps I can clear up a few things: Laura-Jane didn't actually write this article (someone else did, perhaps as a link from the ISIS_magazine page); she is no longer a student, and is not a "The Honourable". However, the worst confusion arises over the meaning of <i>vanity</i>: to a Wikipedian, it just means <i>irrelevant</i>, whereas to a layperson, it is interpreted as <i>this person is vain</i>.

However, not being a member of their site and being completely unfamiliar with their codes, formats, styles, etc., I am unwilling to attempt to add the article there myself. If anyone wants to carry out the transfer, please contact me (or any admin) and we can recover the article in order to submit it to Comixpedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Alexa rank really isn't the best measure of notability. Consider:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a>'s US Senate campaign site has an Alexa rank of 2,530,023. Steve Urquhart's rank is 2,910,251.

Orrin's site, BTW, ranks 1,490,351.
<ul>
<li>Those people are known for their political activity outside the internet. webcomics only have their internet presence to show.

</ul>
</li>
<li>On a more webcomic-related note, it appears that all Keenspace comics get a single ranking of 5,395. That means that a comic like [<a href="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" class="external text" title="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" rel="nofollow">Saturnalia</a>], that never had a very large reader base and that hasn't updated in a year and a half, ranks more than twice as high as <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> (13,920) or User Friendly (12,251). (Nothing against Saturnalia, BTW: Space Coyote is a great artist and the story was good, too. After this long, though, it's pretty well dead.)</li>
<li>Also on webcomics, even <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a>, one of the originals, only ranks 404,199.</li>
<li>Alexa does list a few other sites that link to leveL. The best I found there was <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>.--12.160.33.128 15:39, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The point of me mentioning the visits a day was to show that it is obviously known aside from the 40 people in the forum, since some of the voters for deletion used 'forum has 40 members, noone reads this thing' as an argument. It's not like this site DOESN'T generate tens of thousands of visitors a month. I was also referencing the guy that brought up points against Alexa rating, but he didn't have a user name, so it was probably easier to refer back to me. As for the ways that need not be described, it's obvious I'm a reader of the comic and thus have a bias, which is why mentioning any points about the actual quality of the comic over the quantity of activity around it would be putting myself on display to be torn apart. When I looked at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> before suggesting the article, it still had the alternate proposal that included longevity, a certain number of existant strips/pages and some other things that I can't remember right now but that were all met. Now that it's pretty much popularity only, any such argument has become void- I can't argue against the fact that it doesn't have an audience of millions. -Flare- 13:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete: Fails every guideline we've ever had for "notability," and the fervor of its fans in voting is not any argument against that. For those who wish a "reason why" it shouldn't be here, even though there is no reason why it <i>should</i> be here, I'll simply say that encyclopedias cover that which is referred to in alien context and which needs explanation and contextualizing. This forum/comic/game is known by its fans and referred to by none else. Those who wish to know, know. Those who do not know, will not hear of it and need to know.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was the original nominator, so please don't count my vote twice. I wasn't too happy with the no-consensus of the first vote.

Dragonfiend has already established that a popular webcomic like <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a> has a respectable Alexa rank. The comparisons to <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a> are totally irrelevent, these are people who have had major press attention, something which this comic lacks, even in the webcomic community. I would however, either redirect an article on Orrin Hatch's website to Orrin Hatch, or even move to delete. Just because a site links to it, does not mean it is notable. Heck, some blogs even link to my wikipedia page. This comic has no assertion of notability, a low readership and almost empty forums. Other arguments above, saying that "keep - long archive", I just don't agree with. One of my main points against the no defunct original WP:COMIC was the, longevity = notability" clause. Would you keep an article for a person who's only claim to notability was living up to retirement age? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 18:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for that it's not actually been "re-listed", I mispoke before and have corrected it. It has been extended as is common for AfD discussions that do not reach a clear consensus. For example, a 50/50 split with strong arguments presented by each side is a "no consensus" and thus no action is taken. In <i>this</i> example, neither the numbers nor the arguments clearly indicated the "will of the people", and extendind the discussion appears to have made things clear. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:37, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, what, you're implying that anyone who votes against this list is anti-semitic are you? I've got news for you - Jewish is not a nationality. These people's ethnic/religious origin is irrelevant to both their nationality and their contribution to life in their country. Implying that there is any similarity between this list and lists of people of a particular nationality is ridiculous. Why should people be singled out for a separate list because of their ethnicity and/or religion? Should we have List of Protestant Members of the French Academy of Sciences too? It's irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 11:07, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that anyone who votes against lists of engineers, scientists, historians of some nationalty, ethnic group or both don't do that occationally. What would you say, if I and group of Jews from varios countries would try to delete List of engineers or scientists of Scottish people on grounds that they are only one of nationalities in the Great Britain&#160;? Do you think that ethic group is not intiled to do what is permitted to nationality (scottish people)&#160;?</li>

<li>Scotland is a component <i>country</i> of the United Kingdom. A different case entirely. Most people from Scotland identify themselves as Scots first and foremost. I don't believe this is the case with Jewish people (most Jewish people from Scotland, for instance, probably also identify themselves as Scots first and foremost) and I don't think you have any grounds for believing otherwise. But as a closer analogy, I would certainly vote for deletion of a List of Scottish Fellows of the Royal Society as being a pointless ethnic breakdown of an all-Britain institution. A List of Fellows of the Royal Society, if one existed, would be perfectly sufficient, and this is also the case with any other organisation. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We have differences of opinions.I think that if Scottish people want a List of Scotish Fellows of the Royal Society, it is not of other national/ethnic groups business to dictate them what they have to do. By the way, do you want to initiate deletion of alredy existig Lists of Scotttish engineers and scientists&#160;? If you don't, what is your position to deletion of Lists of engineers scientists and historians in the Lists of Jews&#160;?</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not dictated by what individual ethnic groups wish to do. We all have a say here and we can all edit. And you are not representative of a particular group just because you happen to be a member of it - others may have different opinions and it is somewhat arrogant of you to assume that yours should prevail - please cite your support from other editors (you don't seem to have a great deal here). I have already said I do not support deletion lists of Scottish whatever and also given my reasons (it is all but a nationality), as I have given my reasons for my support of deletion of lists by ethnicity/religion, which simply serve to encourage divisiveness. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:33, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

It may have been an attempt to disrupt AfD, but he doesn't seem to understand how deleting works. At first, I thought the nominations should be closed as a waste of time. Now, I suggest we leave them on AfD to decide what to do with them, since they're already here and these users refuse to communicate. It's questionable that either will abide by the decisions, however, as the edit war has continued while they are listed here. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me further point out that the article is named <i>Mr.</i> Freddie Orange. Even if someone were to use that as a search term, which I find rather unlikely, if we keep this, we might as well create new articles for every person already listed in Wikipedia with "Mr." added in front of them and slap in redirects. Say, Mr. Tom Cruise, Mr. George W. Bush, Mr. Britney Spears... Well, okay, you got me on that last one. Guess we wouldn't do that. But you get the point. It just gets to be way too obscure.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_muscles_of_the_human_body.html" title="List of muscles of the human body">List of muscles of the human body</a>. This reasoning is based on the use I've seen in the various articles that link to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscles.html" title="Muscles">muscles</a> and considering the comments above; my thinking is that if someone takes the effort in a search string to type "muscles" rather than "muscle" then they might not be looking for information on the tissue <i>per se</i> but for an access point to find out about different muscles, a list, an index of them. Along with this redirect, I'd suggest creating a Muscle (disambiguation) page that would provide a pivot point between <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle.html" title="Muscle">muscle</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscles.html" title="Muscles">muscles</a>, and the (rare but notable) few instances of using "muscles" as a nickname or stagename. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 23:58, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>previous inserted comment'</i> I'll indicate my opinion on <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i> after finishing a run through the "what links here" list ... it is sometimes the case that previously "hidden" uses or notability emerge after such a combing (based on experience from clearing what-links-here lists from disambiguation pages). It was due to this potential that I did not initially just revert the edit to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle.html" title="Muscle">Muscle</a> that introduced this *sigh* poor addition to that article. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 15:03, 2 November 2005 (UTC) <i>removal of unhelpful words</i></li>

<li>North is one of the oldest buildings on campus, and has a lot of unique history (more coming soon), including several members that became major donors to the college. I created the page because I think that it will be of use to a sufficiently large number of people...
<ul>
<li>The entire HMC community, especially newcomers, who want to understand our school's unique traditions and dorm histories</li>
<li>Dorm Alums, of which there are around 1000, will definitely want to know the current status of the dorm.</li>
<li>Prospective students want to know more about the college than can be explained in a single article. I know that I used every internet resource possible when looking at HMC, and I'm sure that current prospective students are doing the same.</li>
<li>I wish that there were more detailed information about graduate schools that I'm currently looking at--not just cursory generalizations, but in-depth information about the schools' institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the page harming Wikipedia? Only those who want the information will go to it, and the number of students interested in the dorm will keep it well maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that the page enhances the depth and usefulness of wikipedia. But, I would like to improve it... how could I change the page to make it more suited to Wikipedia? Changes that I plan to incorporate soon include:</p>
<ul>
<li>notable alumni</li>

<li>It would be an outrage to have this page deleted. Several wealthy alumni who have contributed to the college and the human condition are greatly anticipating the permanence of this page and how it honors their legacy they left during their time here at our humble college. Harvey Mudd College may be small, but that does not exclude it and its rich history from being represented in Wikipedia. In the words of Margaret Mead, "Never doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."</li>

<ul>
<li>North is substanially more notable then most other dorms at other campuses. This is probably revealed in the fact that someone bothered to write something about it in the first place. North Dorm along with East Dorm and West Dorm at Harvey Mudd are regularly sites of study for anthropology and sociology students and faculty at the nearby colleges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As to not wanting an article on individual dorms at colleges I see no reason why not to allow people to write them, provided their is enough information to warrant it. These articles could provide a wealth of information to both prospective and current students about campus life. As noted before, there are already several out there.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I see no specific criteria for deletion of this article in the offical policies beside it being a "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article." However, the North page is already of a size that it is entirely reasonable to give it its own article. Merging this article would decrease the current quality of both the Harvey Mudd College page and detract from the information contained in North Hall.</li>

Just not on the main college page, where it distracts from the main article. And, after all, certainly other colleges have dorms or halls named "North" that are of no doubt of equal interest to them.</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This page appears to have been made by current North Dorm residents, possibly by one of the dorm presidents (see Talk:North Hall). Guys, there's a reason that the "create new page" screen says not to create pages for your own groups - it's because you're not detached enough to be able to objectively determine whether the subject is in fact notable. In this case, it's not. Also, many of the facts are kind of volatile - while I was at Mudd, West was definitely the most "boisterous" dorm, and North had no particular "athletic" reputation. (I was in South Dorm 91-95.) <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 14:53, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The funny thing is that when I was there (00-04) West had the highest GPA on campus despite vying for most "boisterous".

<li>The point is not that the dorm always was what it is now. The point is that now the dorm has a certain reputation and that there is no need to strike its entry from Wikipedia because some people think it's silly. The dorm has been a part of this school almost as long as the rest of the school has and there is just as much validity to having a page for all of the other dorms as there is for having a North Dorm page. Nobody fabricated what is in the entry and nobody exaggerated what is in the entry so what real reason is there to delete the entry? NorthJesus 12:58, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In fact, at least four of Mudd's eight dorms match North's assertions of uniqueness: definitive character, annual parties, and traditional named suites (i.e., Nevada, Who Wants Jack Daniels, Atomic Bar, etc.), so North isn't even alone in this within Mudd.

<li><b>Move and redirect</b> I maintain that dorms and dorm life are an important part of information about a college.

<p>As all entries on secret societies cannot be fully substantiated, if this article is to be deleted it then follows that all entries on secret societies must be deleted.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: This entry is linked from a larger entry about secret societies in general. This article lists societies at major U.S. universities. The very nature of secret societies is just that - they try to remain secret. While much is known about some, such as Skull and Bones, little is known about others. While in no way a member or supporter of this particular society, it is intriguing that it has kicked up as much discussion as it has. Like many socities of this sort, hard verification of a society's existance is hard to come by. However, if asked, a good amount of Georgetown students and alumni will attest to its existance. I will suggest that rather than deletion, a heading is added that reads something such as "due to the nature of such organizations, the following information may be unverifible." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.59.114.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.59.114.150_cf17.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.59.114.150">contribs</a>) 23:39, 2 November 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Crux Orbis is well known for keeping its history and traditions secret. Specific details of the society should be presented, but they should be presented as part of the legend surrounding the society and not as hard fact. Crux Orbis and the other Georgetown secret societies, including the several Societies of Stewards and the Torch &amp; Talon Club, are known by students and alumni. While it is certainly the case that not every detail is agreed upon, that is not proper grounds for deleting the whole entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.161.109.67 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.161.109.67_05bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.161.109.67">contribs</a>) 00:08, 3 November 2005.</small>

<li>If an <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outside_air_conditioning_unit.html" title="Outside air conditioning unit">outside air conditioning unit</a> and an inside air conditioning unit are the same thing and the differences between them are so trivial, then why are there both of those kinds of units at my house and not only an outside AC unit or only an inside AC unit? Obviously there's quite a big difference between them if both of them are needed at my house and most other houses that I've visited. If the differences were trivial, then there wouldn't need to be both at my house controlling my air conditioning system. Also, an air conditioning unit is a part of the air conditioning system, not the whole air conditioning system, so should not be redirected to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_conditioning.html" title="Air conditioning">air conditioning</a>, but <b>kept</b> Science3456 02:28, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I believe it contravenes the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements of Wikipedia. WP policy requires that all articles in the main <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a> "<i>should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher.</i>" Since Wikipedia cannot conduct <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, nor put its articles through traditional methods of fact-checking and peer-review, all contributions to the mainspace should be based strictly on external sources that are reputable publications. If the subject of the article does not have at least a minimal body of work devoted to it, such as a newspaper clipping/report, magazine article, book, thesis, or other publication that meets the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it cannot be written about in the WP mainspace. Articles are required to comply with the three cardinal mainspace policies, WP:V, WP:NOR, and WP:NPOV. A subject that easily meets the WP:V (and the related WP:RS) requirements, such that multiple, independent reputable publications on the subject are extent, is said in common Wikipedia parlance to be <i>notable</i>. This does not appear to be the case with this radio show (nor its host, P. Briddy, also on AFD).

<p>as well-written as this is, wikipedia is not a how-to guide. I have already transwikied this to Wikibooks (though I may not have done it quite properly as it was my first transwiki.

<p>Mike Etoll may better be described as "infamous" in many circles, not all of them confined to Minneapolis. Though his name may not appear extensively on the web, his notoriety is extensive, specifically among "lo fi" realms, e.g. underground filmmaking, theater, punk rock, and countless appearances in nontraditional forums with the <i>specific intention</i> of remaining anonymous while inciting pranks, tricks, subversive activity.</p>
<p>In other words, Etoll has created, appeared in or significantly contibuted to films, videos, records and has been responsible for hundreds of creative projects not necessarily credited to same. Not only is Etoll's work most known among the non-technical and non-electronic media, his oeuvre has intentionally occupied the realm of the unattributable.</p>
<p>Please also note that Etoll's work has a long history as an artist whose work predates electronic citation. He didn't even know how to use a computer until two years ago. His contributions as a painter, filmmaker, playwright, actor, effects and prop artist, writer and performance artist can be traced to the work of Soul Asylum, Babes in Toyland, The Butthole Surfers, Curtiss A, The Meat Puppets, the Hysteric-Ontologic Theater (see also Richard Foreman), Husker Du, The Replacements, and Run Westy Run, First Avenue, Seventh Street Entry...</p>
<p>A majority of Twin Cities musicians and artists who gained their celebrity during the 80's and 90's can certainly attest to Etoll's "behind the scenes" influence on pop culture.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.tcpunk.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tcpunk.com" rel="nofollow">TCPunk for extensive and most comprehensive documentation of Twin Cities underground music scene.</a></p>

<li>Well, the article doesn't assert notability at all. Why is Shoebuy important? Why is it important to Massechusetts or the country or anyone else? Also, the last sentence referring to it's location is fairly useless as no one knows what city you're talking about. Also, street location probably isn't important even if the company is. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> 23:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Considering the term has been around since the early 1970s, and considering most other sports and teams have adopted the "Nation" terminology, one would think the historical significance of Steeler Nation would qualify it for wikipedia. On a side note, "Steeler Nation" was coined by NFL Films.

<li>As previously stated, the phrase "Steeler Nation" was coined in the early 70s and is now widely used in regards to other teams. It's pretty common for the media to simply stick a teams' nickname in front of the word "Nation." However, I think it's important that the origins of the phrase are documented.</li>

<li>Gateman, with all due respect, this is not something that Wikipedia alone does. It's a common practice in many libraries, for example, to include common misspellings in search software.

<p><b>Vanity</b> - The article, now about a fake game, was simply created to generate attention for an obscure person, who in turn tried to re-sell the "fake" game in a private auction on his forum using this article as hype for the product.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Nomination has the facts wrong about this article. The article has nothing to do with vanity, as I wrote the majority of the text back in November of 2005. There's no money or traffic to be had through this article at this point, nor was there any when the original article was put up, as I wasn't in possession of the alleged cart or even knew much more than what's in the article. Article is about a noted hoax that made the rounds throughout the internet. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This game has actually found some legs due to an alleged find of a prototype cart at a flea market. While the article name needs to be fixed to conform to whatever standard the Zelda people have set up, and the article needs to be cleaned up further, I have fixed the article somewhat to meet the standards of why it should be included in WP via removing the blatant ads and spam and replacing it with actual information. <strike>I'll withhold a vote until more info can come about regarding whether this article can be improved further.</strike> <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 14:52, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> of Badlydrawnjeff's edits. Even if this stays here the rest of its time without anyone adding anything else to it, there's still more information here than some other articles, and I thank Jeff for his work. However, it would be bad if it became a space for rampant speculation of the unsourced kind, which it might eventually because of the subject matter. So if kept, we should keep an eye on it. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 15:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>

<li>Sorry, I forgot that people of your intelligence level need everything spelled out for them. Most of these stubs are nothing more than a soapbox or a directory entry with a link, typically originated by people at the institution in question, a "non-topic" in that they are of absolutely no interest to anyone outside their immediate community, and the "such a minor branch" speaks for itself — thus because one school "does not stand out", it happily fulfils several deletion criteria.

<li>This article says nothing of the school's history. It says nothing of community involvement, notable staff or students, or alumni. It doesn't even provide the demographic excuse-for-data that other school articles do.

<dd>Agreeing with the above, but for slightly different reasons. 'Policy' isn't a reason to keep, as policy is in the end what the community consensus decides it will be. But consensus has consistantly shown that schools will not be deleted. Whatever individuals may prefer (and, if really pushed, I'd probably vote delete) this is the position. We have a defacto policy - accept it. Game over. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:04, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It may appear to be nitpicking, but I'd point out that consensus does not decide policy. Many decisions are made on Wikipedia by consensus, and some policies can be changed by consensus, but some are not. <i>No personal attacks</i>, for instance, which does not enjoy consensus support, is nevertheless official policy and we cannot ignore it with impunity. NPOV has been explicitly described by Jimbo Wales as "non-negotiable". Moreover, where a dozen or so editors decide to do something, this doesn't constitute a consensus. There is at most a grudging acceptance of deletion nominations that do not give adequate policy backing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It should also be noted that a significent number of schools, including the vast majority below high school level, come up no consensus, not keep; the lower ones often with a simple majority for deletion. Although Schoolwatch, for some reason, makes no distinction between these, the difference is significent--repeating the same vote a thousand times on a thousand different articles still can't turn a no-consensus result into a consensus. Certainly, while there are some policies that cannot be challenged even by consensus, there is no policy that should be decided by a <i>minority</i>. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 17:06, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well put, but irrelevant. There is no consensus to delete schools - so the schools will stay - and 10,000 more will come. You can keep testing that fact, or lammenting that fact, but there it is. Eventually it will be accepted. I may not like it, you may not like it, but there it stands. Of course, people have a perfect right to bang their head off walls, and perhaps I've been wrong to try to dissuade them, but sooner or later they have to realise that the head hurts and the wall doesn't really care.

<dd>Saying that there is no consensus to keep schools is superficially true, but objectively false. There is a consensus that, excepting speedy deletions which are normally decided by one or at most two persons, we will keep all articles unless there's a consensus to delete them. Thus school articles that have been kept have been kept by consensus. We don't use AfD to decide whether there's a consensus to keep a particular article; such a consensus may form but it's of no significance. The article is still kept if the debate forms no consensus at all. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is not an AfD precedent. It just happens to be the case that since April 2005, there has been a concentrated effort to disrupt AfD, and put a category of articles beyond deletion. Moreover, it can't be a real precedent. If it were, it would be reversed pretty quickly, as any measure which effectively exempts a group of articles from the deletion process without any real reason to do so would make for a dangerous precedent. Articles such as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> are not exempt from deletion. Anyone may nominate it if they feel so inclined, they just might find the article kept with overwhelming, <i>real</i> consensus, as opposed to the junkies who think that the current state of affairs is anything like a consensus. I say junkies, because anyone who <i>seriously</i> believes that 51% is a mandate needs to tell me what they're taking so we can all get some. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 20:53, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Family Altar Christian School and several others would disagree with that statement. The fact is there is no preceedent that has been concretely set.

<li>I am of the opinion it quite frankly doesn't matter to most of those voting "keep" on these articles what the subject or the contents are. The equation is quite simple. School=keep. Such an equation is utterly immune to reason, and no modification to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> will change it. Until those who take such a tack can appreciate that school articles must meet the same criteria of notability and excellence as ALL OTHER ARTICLES do, any attempt to achieve a consensus is doomed. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:04, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no general criterion of either notability or excellence in our deletion policy. The idea that there are such general criteria is a fiction. Articles on schools are no different from other articles, and as a matter of practice the debates involving those articles are closed in precisely the same manner, by the same set of closers, as other AfD debates. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>While there may be no formal recognition of notability asan inclusion criterion, there certainly is a fe facto one. Your experience at AfD must surely have shown you that. Moreover, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> uses the word unabashedly in its descriptions of what is eligible for AfD and what is not. There will also soon be a poll opened to measure support for notability to be introduced as a formal criterion. I agree with you that school AfDs are closed in the same manner as all other articles and I don't have an issue with that. The big bone in my craw is how school articles are treated by those who vote. Articles appearing before AfD are, I have to assume (I may be wrong), <i>read</i> by people before votes are cast. In the case of school articles, however, it seems to me that a number of supporters simply vote "keep" because it's a school, and no matter how pathetic the article is, they are unwilling to cast a delete vote, or even refrain from voting. All I am asking is that if we must accept school articles (And I have come to that acceptance), let us at least assure that they are good articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:54, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only notable material that could possibly be covered in this article is already covered in the article for <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>. The conference was un-noteworthy aside from Ahmadinejad's comments. Since those comments are already covered and since it's unlikely that anyone would ever reach this page without seeing the link on the Ahmadinejad's entry, I think this page probably ought to be deleted. I appreciate the effort put into it by all the contributors, but I simply can not see anything ever coming of this stub (beyond what is covered in the other article). So basically I think it should be deleted for non-notability and for being redundant.<a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakob_Huneycutt_27e3.html" title="User:Jakob Huneycutt">Jakob Huneycutt</a> 17:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
