<p>I cannot find this film on IMDB. Google produces many Wikipedia mirrors and gay film sites acknowledging its existence but with little else to say.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. IMDb and Google are not a litmus test.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although notability is asserted, it doesn't seem to be clear from the referenced sources that the film actually is notable. If this really were a "seminal" work ( can a lesbian film be "seminal"&#160;? perhaps we mean "ovular"&#160;? ) I'd expect a clear reference to a suitable professional or critical source, and this isn't provided ( the only link is to what appears to be a film festival's programme notes ). <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The existance does not seem to meet the requirements for notability, more importantly, the article makes a vast number of complete unsourced statements with no sourcing per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 06:14, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per Elaragirl and WMMartin -- unsourced statements (it hasn't been shown that they're fixable), still unproven notability; proof of existence isn't good enough; if it's seminal, that should be readily provable. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep - but rename</b> Article purports to be about the lead singer, yet the main body of the article is about "LOURDES" the band (their caps) The band could just qualify for notability due to their touring multiple states, albeit the source is their website <a href="http://www.lourdsmusic.com/tour.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lourdsmusic.com/tour.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Would suggest an article on the band is appropriate, but one on the lead singer would not yet deserve own article. <b><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_doubt_fb3d.html" title="User:Chill doubt"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•C<span style="background:#206">H<span style="background:#504">ILL<span style="background:#702">DO<span style="background:#a00">UBT•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 19:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b> The article is indeed about the band "LOURDS" fronted by Lourds Lane. More information can and should be added in about the band in its entirety. The band has toured extensively throughout America, has been the subject of articles in national publications (Billboard, for example) They have received national airplay on the Fuse cable music network as well as the national series "City Sounds". The band "LOURDS" is also chronicled in the forthcoming documentary entitled "Always". Worthy of an entry, though article needs to be fleshed out a bit.Griff 03:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definitely <b>KEEP</b> - I am the webmaster of the LOURDS official website <a href="http://lourds.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://lourds.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and the LOURDS MySpace website <a href="http://myspace.com/LOURDS" class="external autonumber" title="http://myspace.com/LOURDS" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. I will work with the leader of the band, Lourds Lane, to address the above issues, expand the content about the band, LOURDS, and create a separate page for the musician and lead singer, Lourds Lane.

<li><b>ABSOLUTLEY KEEP</b> The article might not yet do the band justice, but the band is indeed noteworthy. The debate should be about the band itself and not about who is editing their page. There is an absoloute need to flesh out the article as soon as possible. None of the detractors have shown any compelling reason to support deletion, while those in support of keeping the entry have provided legitimate reasons for the page remaining. I reiterate that the entry needs to be expanded as soon as possible to feature the entire band and not just the lead singer Lourds Lane. Slurponyou 12:20, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Whether or not Slurponyou is a sockpuppet isn't the point. "Articles for deletion (AfD) is where <b>Wikipedians</b> discuss whether an article should be deleted. Articles listed here are debated for up to five days, after which the deletion process proceeds based on <b>Wikipedia community</b> consensus." (emphasis added). Someone who shows up just to "vote" in an AFD isn't a Wikipedian and isn't part of the Wikipedia community. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notability</p>
<p>I propose the deletion of this article. The main reason is the lack of notability. This person has been the chairman of a non-notable and no longer existing Belgian party, which is largely unknown and has never played a significant role in Belgian politics. This is also proven by the fact that this article didn't get more than one sentence, while this article already exists since 2004. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 13:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>, after weighing both the keep and delete arguments. I do agree that the article needs to be re-written, but that is not a reason enough to delete it outright. The NPOV issue can be dealt with by rephrasing the words and quoting the magazine which calls this enterprise "the fastest-growing video game retailer in the United States". This is a borderline close and the nominator or any other interested party can re-nom this article for deletion after a reasonable period of time, if no more independent sources are available. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black">Nearly Headless Nick</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_0b0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black" title="Contributions"><sup><b>{C}</b></sup></font></a> 12:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Agreed that Assistant Professors are not usually notable scientists at that stage in their career. But I have checked his publication list, which is very strong--he has published approximately 40 peer-reviewed articles since receiving his doctorate, including 5 in Neuron, the highest ranking journal in his field. These publications have had a total to 1041 references to them from other peer-reviewed scientific journals, four of them having over 95 citations. That's way more than average, since average is one or two cites each and his average is 25. I did not expect to see this--in fact I had written delete before i went back and checked in Web of Science. The numbers speak for themselves. Allowing for those who have cited more than one of his papers, several hundred published scientists have found his work notable enough to cite. Mnemopsis, could you recheck your count--Web of Science is usually the most reliable source. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Pubmed indicates he has one publication in Neuron, which is not the highest ranking journal of any field btw (Nature, Nature Neuroscience, and Science all rank much higher than Neuron). He has a couple of dozen publications, which is not that many by any standards. Prominent neuroscientists typically have over 200 publications. Furthermore, he is not the recipient of any notable awards, nor do his publications indicate any significant new findings that are in any way notable. Nor does he appear on ISI Highly Cited Researchers. He seems like your typical neuroscientist who falls on the lower end of the publication spectrum.

<li>it would be interesting to compare standards. He is perhaps in the top 10% of his field--(among those who have acquired the minimum credentials, a PhD) but not the top 1%, (perhaps everyone could agree on that?) .</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Then do we include the top 10% or the top 1% in other areas of human work? Do we include the top 10% of rock musicians who have acquired the minimal credentials of producing one generally released recording?--or only the top 1 in a hundred? Do we include the top 10% of novelists, among those who have published at least one novel? or only the best 1 in 100? Do we include the top 10% or the top 1% of professional football players, among those who have ever played a professional game?
<dl>
<dd>Some of the guidelines say more notable than the average (whatever): That's the top 50%. All associate professors in any research university are within the top 50% of those with doctorates in the field. In fact, so are all assistant professors in a research university--at least half of new doctorates never get a tenure-track job in a research university. Included in the top 50% are all associate or full professors in any four-year college and up, and all full professors at 2-yr colleges.</dd>
<dd>If we think the standards are those whom we could write a meaningful article about, then anyone who has obtained these minimal distinctions count, for it could be done by analyzing their work in connection with their field, their advisor, where they publish, etc.</dd>
<dd>What I do <b>not</b> think is acceptable is to say those about whom a good article is written--we are judging the subject. If the article is inadequate, by all means we should stubbify it, and then protect it indefinitely against deletion.

<dd>Please note that, on further investigation, I now believe this article should be kept. This person's publications appear under "Rawlins JN", and not "Rawlins N", as would be expected from his name, Nick Rawlins. The fact that I could not retrieve his list of publications using "Rawlins N" lead me to nominate his page for deletion. However, he does have quite a few publications, as I subsequently found out, and they are fairly well cited, so his article should be kept. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 07:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately not. If there had been no delete votes you could have done a speedy keep close because you withdraw the nomination. But because there have been a few delete votes you won't be able to close it yourself. I suggest putting your note right underneath your nomination.

The word requires more than just a dictionary definition because its usage and the variation that arises from its usage is more complex than a simple dictionary entry would cover.Agrestis 06:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Fan-created definitions are hard to verify in print sources because they're used by <i>fans</i>, generally in online communities.

<li><b>Keep</b> Space4k is a game played by thousands of people across the world on the .com server alone. With the Italian and German servers taken into account there are tens of thousands of players world-wide... is that not notable? The article is useful for new players to the game or potential players. Adding a guide as to what each menu does and the purpose of them would make the article a great deal better, but a lack of that hardly means it should be deleted. All of the information posted in the article, at least the information posted by Siesatia, can be verified in either the game itself or on the Official Space4k Forums maintained and operated by Gameforge staff. There are a great many different forums floating around that are Space4k related, but the only official one supported by Gameforge is at <a href="http://board.space4k.com" class="external free" title="http://board.space4k.com" rel="nofollow">http://board.space4k.com</a>. Siesatia has done a great job keeping this article informative and repairing damage from vandals. If he needs help adding a more comprehensive player's guide then I would be happy to aid him in that. Ranks in Space4k are not effected by people clicking or connecting with links, so artifical gains can not be made through use of this article or anything like it.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Are you serious? None of the asteroids are notable? How do you measure the notability of an asteroid? Although Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, this list can hardly be considered a useless collection of facts.

<li><b>Note</b> I'm going to bold this, because I think everyone voting should read it. <b>If you look on the Minor Planet Center site where this list came from, you can see clearly that there are 150,000 of these asteroids identified so far.</b> Yes, that is "one hundred and fifty thousand" - and thousands discovered each year. How many of these is anyone <i>ever</i> going to care about? Probably 0.1% of them, if that. Why don't we start a list of NOTABLE asteroids? This enormous list of astronomical trivia belongs on Wikisource, if anywhere other than the Minor Planet site. I also took a look at the copyright terms, and I have no idea if our usage is legal as is; my guess would be not, principally because we haven't reformatted or reworked the data in any way.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 08:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that we are not an indiscriminate collection of data, but I'm inclined to feel that this data is not indiscriminate: we're not seeking to list every grain of sand in the sky, we're simply providing an organised arrangement of data. Although obscure, I'd rather have the complete list than edited highlights in a "list of notables". <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> — It should be possible to come up with a concensus for what makes an asteroid notable (or any Solar System object for that matter). We shouldn't have to record every single 100m rock in the sky. Here's a few thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It was discovered prior to the use of photography for finding asteroids.</li>
<li>It has had (or will have) a close approach by a spacecraft.</li>
<li>There is a solid diameter and/or mass estimate, along with good orbital elements.</li>
<li>It has been imaged by radar or other sensors, including but not limited to occultation profiles.</li>
<li>It has unusual spectral properties.</li>
<li>It has had (or will have) a close-Earth encounter.</li>
<li>It is known to have a moon.</li>
<li>There is a published paper on the asteroid.</li>
<li>It is a trojan asteroid for a terrestrial planet.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, there are lots of these rocks out there, but "notability" applies to <i>individual</i> asteroids, in my mind. I feel the Wikipedia list is much easier to consult than the MPC or Lowell astorb data files, if only for the links. I would love to see how it could be deposited in Wikisource --we've kept the discovery data and "meanings of names" lists separate precisely with Wikisource in mind. As for copyright concerns, the list is scientific data. We have reformatted it massively (all the wikicode in the individual pages, plus the organisation into blocks of 100 asteroids). I'm certain there is no problem whatsoever on that axis. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 00:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question Is this tied to an article about these asteroids?</b> Could someone answer this question? If it's not tied to any article that discusses these asteroids it's simply a list of asteroids and doesn't belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is no article about these asteroids because there is no encyclopedic information about them. The data in the lists could be supplemented with orbital elements and magnitudes but that's it for most of them (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> for the complete run down). I say <b>transwiki</b> the whole kit-and-cabbodle to wikisource and ony allow lists of asteroids that are named or otherwise assert notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Displaying a "wisdom far beyound my years", I'd like to say that it's entirely possible that the person exists, but only one claim to notability fails the "obviously silly" test: the sentence about being signed to "Def Jam" ( whoever they are ). It's possible that he has been signed by some record company - the levels of modesty and literacy conveyed by the article are of about the level I'd expect from such a performer - but until his CD comes out this article would fail anyway under "we're not a crystal ball". ( By the way, does he mean "Shao Lin"&#160;? ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Currently, there's nothing in the article which can't be moved to the article on Ctrl+Alt+Del. It only mentions him in the context of the comic itself, or in direct relation to the website hosting the comic (IE Charities he promoted on the site, merchandise he sells related to the site, etc). There's nothing asserting Tim Buckley's notability outside of CTRL+ALT+DEL, which already has an extensive article. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>reply</b> if we moved every article that didn't have much content at one point or another, we wouldn't have any of wikipedia's featured articles. This "what's the harm of a redirect" attitude is really not helpful. This person is distinct from the comic he writes/draws and has done things unrelated to CAD. Senseless redirects are a bad idea. Delete the article if it's innappropriate(which I doubt), but don't redirect unless there's honestly a reason to expect one(namely misspellings, synonyms, and non-notable spinoffs. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 19:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>rebuttal</b> This is indeed the point of contention, whether Buckley has notable contributions outside his comic. Earlier, Buckley was compared to Brian Clevinger. The difference between them is that Clevinger does have other ventures dealing with separate IP and collaborations involving individuals who <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Oeming_bd3b.html" title="Michael Oeming">do</a> have some measure of notability in their respective industries. Even this article, as it is, reflects Buckley's current lack of non-encyclopedic accomplishments, couching everything in terms of its relation to his comic. And, if we're willing to count there are exactly zero (0) lines in this article that do not mention <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a> <a href="../../../d/a/o/User%7EDaoKaioshin_8912.html" title="User:DaoKaioshin">DaoKaioshin</a> 22:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply again</b> My point was on the notion of theory not on present article state. A person is not the same as a webcomic, and really shouldn't be redirected as such. Redirects discourage actaully making an article out of something. His entry into the "hottest gamer" or whatever it was that was an international competition is a unique aspect that could be ascribed to him without being more than tangentially related to CAD. And while this information is not presently in the article, <i>it could be</i> and a redirect would discourage that and similar information from ever being added to wikipedia, thus is contrary to the fundemental mission of wikipedia, and I strongly oppose any redirect, and would stand for a <b>delete</b> over a redirect. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 05:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The article references/referenced a NY Post article and that article has, at best, flimsy references and BTW, best I can tell, is the only news report on the subject. If this was a legit issue, more journalists would be reporting on it in various media. Also, the NY Post is not known more for it's gossip and sports sections than for their hard news dept.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Obviously a solid local worthy, but not notable enough for Wikipedia.

Like other articles about local notables who are unheard of outside of their native counties, there may be too much detail; but that's a content issue, not a "keep or delete" issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you are going to delete the page, the you should delete the <b>entire</b> geofiction section and all the others worlds listed there, such as Vexillium, which has about four active players. The page is relevant to the categories listed, it exists and it is active. The page gets more than 1,500 hits per day. I thought an Encyclopedia was used to look up a variety of information, not just items that were only 'breathtakingly notable', as appears to be the standard by some here. As for that 'breathtakingly non-notable' comment - please grow up and act like an adult. I would sincerely appreciate the <b>exact</b> reason this page is up for deletion.

<dl>
<dd>The phrase "breathtakingly non-notable" may, if you wish, be read as "very non-notable", or simply "non-notable". I'll make the rest of this comment without further humorous adverbs...</dd>
<dd>(1) It is a well-established policy here that in a debate on whether or not to delete an article we do not consider the status of other articles. We aim to work on a case by case basis. You, or anyone else, is welcome to propose deletion of any articles you wish. Sometimes we examine several similar or related articles at the same time, but this is not the case here.</dd>
<dd>(2) The number of hits per day the website gets is not relevant. This, again, is a long-standing principle followed when we review articles for deletion. The reason for this is that we are concerned with notability, not popularity.</dd>
<dd>(3) <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. What would make Eshraval notable would be if it had been discussed in some non-trivial way in a reliable published work. I've tried to find such a reference, but have not been able to do so. In fact, outside a very small community there's no reference to Eshraval at all. Eshraval has particularly few references of any kind ( hence the "breath-taking" comment ).</dd>
<dd>(4) I did actually express the exact reason why I advocate deletion of this article ( note that I'm not "voting" for deletion here - this isn't a vote, it's a discussion in which I express an opinion ): I said above that the article is non-notable. I hope that when you click through to the link above on what notability is you'll see that this was comment enough, and was an "exact reason".</dd>
<dd>(5) Yes, you're right, encyclopedias are used to look up a variety of information. But the difference between Wikipedia and somewhere like Google is that here we aim to include the "notable" stuff. Of course you've now read the way we identify notability, but here's my general philosophy on encyclopedias, which I hope you find useful: I think of an encyclopedia as being a kind of general repository for information that a well-read student of a particular discipline would be expected to know, or would be interested to know. So we have an article on geofiction because it's reasonable to expect "moderately well-informed" people to know what it is. We also want to provide information that will be useful for experts in geofiction, so we should have articles on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islandia_%28book%29.html" title="Islandia (book)">Islandia</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxen_%28C._S._Lewis%29_1ec3.html" title="Boxen (C. S. Lewis)">Boxen</a>, and so on. Now, should we have an article on Eshraval&#160;? I'd say certainly "yes", if it's notable within the geofiction community. But because I'm not an expert on geofiction, the only criterion I have for making this call is to look for publications about it: fortunately, this is a nice mechanical process that simply requires me to go and look for them. If I find that someone has written a paper in a journal titled "Eshraval: a study of human interaction through geofiction", or I find a reference to Eshraval in a survey of geofiction that includes a line like "Eshraval is important in geofiction because &lt;insert non-trivial reason&gt;" then we've got clear evidence that Eshraval is regarded by the relevant people as important and different - that it stands out from its peers. And then we create an article. But at present, despite good faith efforts on my part, I can't find what we need.</dd>
<dd>(6) As you'll see if you check my record, I make most of my contributions to Wikipedia through AfD debates. This is often a rather thankless task: people who work mostly in this area are looked down on by people who focus on creating articles, because we are "not adding to the project". Though it's hard to believe, I'd be delighted if every article reviewed in a deletion debate could be kept: I want Wikipedia to grow, too. But, sadly, it is very often necessary to prune the tree so that it will grow more healthily. What makes us a useful resource is that when people use Wikipedia to look something up they know that (a) we're trying to tell the truth, without bias, and (b) an article in Wikipedia will provide references to independent sources where you can learn more about the subject and why it is important. My job is to help make sure that our articles meet these criteria. It's not glamorous, but I don't mind doing it.</dd>

<dd>I appreciate the response, but this in no way excuses the 'breathtakingly non-notable' response. It was unwarranted, ill-advised, and made you instantly come off like a belittling, pompous jerk. While you may think something is not worthy of inclusion - <b>and that is perfectly fine</b> - the way you state that is really the only way you can be interacted with here on the internet; frankly, you were judged as an jerk, for good or ill. In the future I just ask that you respect others work in both thought and deed. If you had simply said 'Non-notable' there would have been no issue aside from the fact we think you are wrong, but at least that debate is on-target and not about an immature comment by you. -- <a href="../../../e/s/h/User%7EEshCreator_cde3.html" title="User:EshCreator">Eshraval Creator</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As an Eshraval player and a long-time Wiki user and contributer, I'll have to disagree with you, Martin.

They make forklifts. They're hardly notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am also an Eshraval player, and I challenge those who are set against the Wiki page to take a hard look at the creativity and depth of the world of Eshraval.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The sheer arrogance and lack of tact by some of you Wikipedia people is astounding. People who want this page kept are now 'spam'. Why are some of you so quick to discount and minimize the effort and community of others? Seriously? We will do whatever is required to bring the page up to standard, but I believe Yahoo! and other engines returns a lot of hits. If the page requires more information, we will certainly add it, but I don't think the page itself is out of place, irrelevant, 'Breathtakingly non-notable', or 'spam'.<a href="../../../e/s/h/User%7EEshCreator_cde3.html" title="User:EshCreator">Eshraval Creator</a></li>

<li><b>Added Note</b>. I think it is worthy to note that several people have found us via your Wikipedia. They were looking for geofiction/fantasy style online games and happened upon us through you. So I think the entry is relevant, because it is providing the very service this entire online encyclopedia was supposedly designed to provide. The entire category is/was clearly getting use <b>AND</b> providing a service to the greater online community. I guess the question is, how can it be non-notable or irrelevant if people have found it through this very entry?

<li><b>Keep!!!</b>. These Tables are <b>extremely important</b> since they provide connection to a significant number of articles describing different chemical compounds. This is very important to have for anyone who writes Wikipedia articles on chemical or biochemical topics.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is essentially another way of navigating wikipedia, similar to by alphabetical order. Normally when one selects a category the articles are listed alphabetically.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a chemist I agree with Biophys that it is useful to list compounds by formula as well as by name, since most chemists actually think in formulas or in structures. There may be a better way to present the data, but I would keep the present article until something better is available. Dirac66 02:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the band <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndesmo.html" title="Syndesmo">Syndesmo</a> claim to have released four albums. Whether they are on notable record labels or not I dont know.

<li><b>Comment</b> What is the meaning of "releasing albums" in the era of home computers that can record, edit and author cds, complete with cover art and jewelbox inserts, and duplicating services that can mass produce them, or in the era of people paying for downloads? What is the standard, in other words, to be sure it was a legitimate record company, and that it was widely sold? This is a serious question, because issing a single or cd seems to be something any non-notable band could easily do these days. So was it released by a major company? Did the album achieve big sales in Poland or other European countries?? The name of the album gets bogus Google hits unrelated to the album, as it seems to be a term in the physical sciences. The article on the group and the articles on their other albums bear examination as well, but the website for the group set off alarms in my McAfee antivirus program, which warned that it linked sites which sought to download spyware. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 19:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No reliable sources. There is an interwiki link over to the Polish Wikipedia, but there is no article there. There's practically no information in the present article except for a track listing for one record. Hardly worth an encyclopedia entry. The band <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndesmo.html" title="Syndesmo">Syndesmo</a>, which made the album which is the subject of this article, has their own article (very uninformative) and three other articles for specific records, all just as minimal as this one. In their present state they all look to me like candidates for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 23:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In addition to the Herzl Award, Dr. Salinas is the author of over 20 publications, including one award winning book, and a second book that is quickly becoming a major contribution to the field of Israeli-Palestinian peace. Hardly any of the other original Herzl Award winner have such a record. In addition, he is one of only 4 Herzl Award winners in the U.S., and some of the other ones have pages in their respective language (Hebrew, Spanish). AZM-GH</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There are several pages about American Zionist leaders from the right. None, however, about American Zionist leaders from the left, progressive affiliation. Do I detect a bias here? Is there a reason why Liberal Zionist are being deleted? Kibbutznik</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are many other non-fiction authors with less stellar records. e.g., Thomas Alexander, Biplob Kumar Debnath, James Joll, Neal Lozano, etc. I have looked at Salinas' books, and they seem really noteworthy. Has anybody looked him up? Maybe somebody needs to add more notability items to his stub?</li>

<li>After some further searching I've found that Park Ridge apparently play in the Brisbane District League (not QLD State League) but aren't in the top three divisions (which is all the website currently shows fixtures for), so presumably they play in one of the lower divisions, which doesn't strike me as a "top league", personally, and certainly not the equivalent of England's national fully professional League Two, as claimed above. I'd also hazard a guess that the Brisbane League itself isn't a full-time professional league, which means that Mr Murray doesn't meet the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:55, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I deleted this under category a7, and another editor asked me to restore it based on a fairly large Ghit count. However, the article positively asserts the band's "lack of fame", and cites no reliable sources.

<p>Unreferenced article about an apparently nonnotable vehicle manufacturer. <i>Fabral santana -wikipedia</i> only gets a couple of hundred Google hits, and many of these are unrelated to the vehicles.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I click on random articles. If one is a stub, I look for sources to make it into a better article. Sometimes I nominate for deletion. This one had lingered for 6 months with no additions and no sources. No one was actively adding sources or details to it, so adding templates to it that it needed improvement did not look like a productive move. The <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standard says <i>"A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, the source of which is both: independent of the company, corporation, organization or group itself, or of the product's or service's manufacturer or vendor, and reliable.</i> A Google search did not disclose such sources. I asked that others with better access to Portuguese sources try to add some. In the end if the article is kept but with sources, then Wikipedia is a better encyclopedia. If it is deleted because good sources cannot be found at this time to bring the article up to meet the standards cited, then Wikipedia is a better encyclopedia. The nomination was made in good faith and not just to be nominating something randomly through lack of having read the policies cited. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 18:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I realize that a google search for Fabral alone will generate a lot of irrelevant hits. Sometimes more sophisticated search techniques can turn up reliable sources. This can include googling a combination of words, such as the manufacturer's name and its city, or its country, or its product together, or searching on other databases which may be available to you free of charge through your city library or university library. In this case, I checked the Portuguese Wikipedia to see if it had an article on the company. It didn't, but if such a page existed, it would have saved a lot of time. This isn't intended to criticize any other editors; I just want to explain some of my techniques for expanding articles when there is some time pressure involved. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I am not contesting the fact that there are Koreans in the Philippines, most of the article as it stands is not verifiable. A great deal of the article is unreferenced, and might not even be possibly reference-able. The article scope seems confused, being a mix of unverified statistics, history, religion, sociology and a little blurb about the entertainment industry. Notability may also be suspect, as there is most likely a minority of X nationality in most, if not all countries. Most of those communities do not warrant articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 18:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and expand/clean-up or Merge</b>. It appears that this article was written with <a href="../../../g/y/o/Gyopo.html" title="Gyopo">another article</a> in mind. After reading and re-reading the said article, it appears that this article (Koreans in the Philippines) was written as a fork of the <a href="../../../g/y/o/Gyopo.html" title="Gyopo">Gyopo</a> article...that is, written <i>after</i> it, and can be viewed as one of a series. (Note that this article is linked within the "Other countries" discussion in Gyopo). Let's face it, Koreans have been here since Philippine colleges and universities have started accepting Korean exchange students and Korean expats (Korean restaurants now seem to be a staple in the newly-opened megamalls like the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_Asia_90cc.html" title="Mall of Asia">Mall of Asia</a>). (And, like her or not, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandara_Park_ced6.html" title="Sandara Park">Sandara Park</a> chose to live and work here.) All these, to me, are signs, that the presence of Koreans in the Philippines make an interesting article...just that, the article as it currently stands, needs a lot of work to make it worthy as an encyclopdic article. Hence, IMO, one of two things need to be done: either merge this article to the main Gyopo article, or rewrite this article and add more sources and references. Otherwise, we might as well nominate the Gyopo article for deletion, as well as the other (insert-your-nationality)-Korean articles (although the <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zainichi_Korean_4640.html" title="Zainichi Korean">Japanese-Korean</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_Koreans_in_China_4396.html" title="Ethnic Koreans in China">Chinese-Korean</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean-American_20bc.html" title="Korean-American">Korean-American</a> articles appear to be well-written). --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 05:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As it is though, the article makes a lot of (possibly controversial) unreferenced claims. For example, until a sociological journal or a major local newspaper takes note of a "Koreatown" in a specific place, it is simply unverifiable and is original research. I mean, one of my favorite places, Ortigas Center, IMHO is turning into a Koreatown. But until I have concrete evidence of a demographic study done by someone, it'll still be my personal observations, and not really apt for wikiality. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article seems to be more of a half-started work or a scrapbook. The name Methane reformer (car) is used without there being any article called Methane reformer.

<li><b>Keep and move</b> I see no reason in the deletion policy to delete this article. It should however be expanded and moved to Methane reformer as it seems to have nothing to do with a car. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small></b> 19:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The topic is already covered in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_reforming.html" title="Steam reforming">steam reforming</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.Z-man</a> that it just needs expanding plus amend the title. Plus it is a superset of the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_reforming.html" title="Steam reforming">steam reforming</a> article since it mentions both <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_reforming.html" title="Steam reforming">steam reforming</a> and autothermal reforming, the latter of which I can't find mentioned in any other article.

<dd>If you read the section on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methane_reformer_%28car%29.html#Autothermal_reforming" title="Methane reformer (car)">autothermal reforming</a> closely you'll see that this is not so much it's own process but just a way of saying that the feedstock is providing the reaction energy for the process. The same concept is used in most <i>any</i> thermal reforming of an energy-rich substance. This includes numerous, possibly most, core processes in the petroleum industry, petrochemical industry, biomass refining and coal refining. Sometimes these processes might be named integrated or autothermal, but most of the time this would be omitted as it is the most common way to run such processes on an industrial scale. --<a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETunheim_e421.html" title="User:Tunheim">Tunheim</a> 22:16, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I regard your opinion but I object. Looking at the talk page, you can see that people with different points of view are involved in a discussion on how to wikify the article. The solution is not to delete the article, but to help improving it. I've been trying to gather relevant information from available and verifiable sources within the past few weeks. I'm slow on it I know, but I'm trying as much as I can.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, I belive what you mentioned is not a good reason for deleting an article. If people assosciated with Experts Exchange are adding weight against its critics in an illegal way, it is their fault, nothing to do with the article. If available facts against EE are few and/or not verifiable, this again does not mean the article should be deleted. And finally, the article does not explicitely advertise Experts Exchange or even compare it with similar services in a way which may make people feel more positive about it or negative about the others.</dd>

<dd>Actually, few or no verifiable facts about an article is the <i>primary</i> reason for deletion, as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

There is precious little coverage about the site in its current incarnation anywhere, and certainly not enough to help eliminate any of the citation concerns in the article. That said, there does seem to be a reasonable amount of chatter about two things... 1) the old domain name, but that confusion is already covered in <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_names.html" title="Domain names">Domain names</a>, and 2) that some experts-exchange articles are cloaking the google bot to get a higher ranking <a href="http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showthread.php?t=11974" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showthread.php?t=11974" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> which is somewhat covered in Criticisms. However, I don't think either of of those topics are meaty enough to fill out an entire article, especially if the rest of the article is purged of the unverifiable statements, so make mine a <b>Weak Delete</b> until the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues get resolved. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I said right at the start of the discussion that it was spam. I tried to offset puff that was stuffed into it by EE associates, and then we saw a senior member of EE staff engaging in a campaign to purge anything that was critical.</p>
<p>The fact that it is filled with unverified facts both pro and con is enough reason to delete it. However, there is still the matter of the patent. That is verified. The patent does exist. That can still be the basis for an article but the critics of the site are not going to abandon the dispute over other facts as long as administrators and other associates of EE insist on making it a promotional piece or even a review of the site. Some of the negative things entered were an over reaction to EE staff being involved.</p>
<p>What is notable and worthy of a Wikipedia article is the patent. Just about anything else is going to fuel an argument. It would be a shame to lose the article. My preferece is not to delete it, but if it is not about the patent, then there is nothing to qualify it for a Wikipedia article. There are thousands of Internet sites just like EE; forums where experts answer questions. The only thing different about EE is the patent. While there is very little research; and not much in the way of independent reviews, there is the fact that the patent exists and is the basis of a point and grading system that makes them unique. whether they are a unique tech support site, or a unique game can be debated, but that does not belong in a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>I guess the best is delete, and hope that we get an article based on the patent at some point.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Interesting. I couldn't really find any precedent for basing an article exclusively on a patent, and I'm not entirely convinced its a great idea. The only thing that exists to tie the expert-exchange website to the patent is the assignee, and there's no verifiable proof that they actually use the algorithm as designed. Other then the USPTO, there are zero third-party sources about the patent, and there isn't any reason to believe this patent is notable in the least.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is nothing to prove. If you go back and read what I said, we are not in disagrement; that it should be deleted. All I am saying is that the only thing that might be of value is the patent; which you correctly extend to implementation of the patent. If someone can supply the verifiction as to the implementation of the patent then there may be something to salvage. EE is just one of thousands of forums. I am not aware of anything they have done that is inovative. The patent was the only thing that was unique, and I can also not find any independent support to indicate it is actually being used. There are also other forums with point based ratings and grading that may be violating the patent and I have not been able to find any history or evidence that EE has ever taken action to defend the patent. It appears that the argument I made in support of the patent is moot and deletion should proceed. - COBOLdinosaur 18:49, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I was quiet baffled reading the first AfD debate <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greeneyes_89ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes</a>, where arguments for keep are used like "Simultaneous story threads as an approach is of artistic signficance. Use of elements for chapter headings is of artistic significance. Anonymity of writer and illustrator is of artistic significance." (by a current admin, no less!) I don't see how the way this comic is created is in any way an indicator of notability. The only claim to notability is that the author of another webcomic liked the way Greeneyes played with colour, and imitated it, and that another webcomic artists contributes to it,and mentions that in passing This is rather trivial, and does not constitute multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources (the bare minimum asked by most <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> guidelines.

<li>To me, it is very interesting to read the previous AFD for this article. It is truly remarkable how much the standards for a webcomic article staying on Wikipedia have changed in a little over a year. That said, while Greeneyes may be artistically stunning, unusual in being a comic published under the CCL, and may be slightly better known than it was then (constrast, say, Google hits on the previous AFD with what they are now), I have a lot of trouble with the idea that this is notable as a webcomic. <b>Delete.</b><a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 21:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That said, the original request above appears to have been generated with a biased agenda. Searching for greeneyes+Hecke on google.com - not google.be - turns up 1050 hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22greeneyes%22+hecke&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22greeneyes%22+hecke&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> and similar numbers fall out when we have searches like greeneyes+webcomic-wikipedia<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=greeneyes+webcomic+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=greeneyes+webcomic+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. While I can't see this as meeting notability by the current standards of Wikipedia, I find myself having a great deal of difficulty in assuming good faith on the part of the person starting the AFD, who has misrepresented a weak case as even weaker. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 21:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, but even just searching on google.be for Hecke+greeneyes generates 242 hits. "Greeneyes"+"jetfuel" is the singularly lowest combination of all possible search term combinations I could come up with, with a raw hit count of 27. If this was by chance, it's quite remarkable. As things currently stand, though, the only argument I find even somewhat plausible is that it was <i>very</i> resoundingly kept in the last AFD; however, it's quite clear that standards of notability have shifted substantially since then. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 21:55, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Google.be or Google.com gives exactly the same results, it's just a language skin. This is the search from the nomination via Google.com: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22greeneyes%22+%22jetfuel%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22greeneyes%22+%22jetfuel%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Still 18 distinct Google hits. Anyway, the number of hits is not the only argument: we need <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources to establich <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>. I don't like you doubting my good faith, and certainly not when you do so on faulty grounds. I think my history on Wikipedia shows more than clear enough that my AfD's (and other contributions) are done in good faith, no matter if they are met with agreement or disagreement. I always search for (web)comics with the name of one of the authors added, because the chance that you have a serious discussion of a comic <i>without even mentioning the author</i> is very small, and because for many titles, searching without the author gives many false positives (hits that aren't about the comic at all). e.g. for Greeneyes, the first hit already is this completely unrelated page<a href="http://www.greeneyes.nl/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greeneyes.nl/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Please check your accusations more thoroughly before making them in the future. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 22:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And following that policy would have led you to search Greeneyes+Hecke - the name of the author, rather than a random handle - first. In the first place, however, Google (or Alexa) hits aren't a basic measure of notability. My apologies if misfortune has led you to select the singularly least appropriate search term combination of all those, but I am not particularly happy to have stumbled upon this corner of Wikipedia and found rife misrepresentation in use in nearly every active webcomic AFD. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 22:16, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the article gives Jetfuel as the name of the author as used in the comic, and Hecke as his real name. It is normal to search on the pseudonym. Smurfs plus Peyo gives 59,800 (non-distinct) hits<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=smurfs+peyo&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=smurfs+peyo&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, Smurfs plus (real name) Culliford gives 795 (non-distinct) hits<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=smurfs+peyo&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=smurfs+peyo&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. I have taken the name which was given in the main text, not the one given in parentheses. If these is the less obvious search term, then the article should be rewritten to reflect the name most used in references to the comic. Anyway, this "corner" of Wikipedia (the main deletion discussion board) is open for everyone to contribute, so if you have any evidence that there is rife misrepresentation, please provide it. The problem with most of the webcomics is that there are a number of hardcore fans, but very little reliable sources about them. Too bad, but until those sources pop up, they don't have a place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should have emphasized the name Hecke indeed, given that the real name is in much more frequent use in discussion of the comic. Someone should pass that suggestion along to Comixpedia. As far as showing that there is rife misrepresentation in the recent spate of webcomic AFDs, I recommend you consult my recent contribution history in the past three days. I've been pointing out lots of misrepresentations - of article content, of traffic statistics, of search statistics, etc. Most, though not all, has been from users trying to delete a wide assortment of webcomics, including some clearly notable ones. My apologies for snapping at you; you haven't been the worst offender, and I can readily believe now that you were simply careless in trying only one search that happened to produce ~18 related hits when several others produced close to ~1000 related hits. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 15:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It would probably be better to search the author William van Hecke as "van hecke" rather than just "hecke". "Hecke" is the German word for "hedge" and shows up in unrelated contexts such as "<a href="../../../../de/a/b/_/Ab_durch_die_Hecke_d4b4.html" class="extiw" title="de:Ab_durch_die_Hecke">Ab durch die Hecke</a>" (<a href="../../../o/v/e/Over_the_Hedge_0579.html" title="Over the Hedge">Over the Hedge</a>). --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 15:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Very few German pages contain the exact compound "greeneyes," which filters those out pretty well. In general, if you're going to check search results - which don't in principle establish notability or lack thereof (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) - you should try a good number of different searches and look at the sort of results you're getting. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 15:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> A quick Google reveals the subject is notable enough, but I'd like to see some more English references. I don't think deletion is warranted so quickly in this case - give it time and see what happens. FYI, the "A8" deletion referenced on the talk page is, IIRC, speedy deletion for blatant copyright violation. -- <a href="../../../q/a/r/User%7EQarnos_4a9f.html" title="User:Qarnos">Qarnos</a> 10:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I took this around over the weekend. I thinks the 'quick' clarification is necessary because of the subject and WP:BLP. I studied the sources and tried to search more myself. The main issue is the scarcity of reliable sources. Of the three in English (including the one on the talks pages), two are self-published and take the 'facts' as starting point. The third one (Le Soir) talks of Servaty only as suspect, as does the French one. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 10:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Every sentence is sourced with multiple references. There are 22 citations for a three paragraph article. While I realize English refs are preferable on the English Wiki, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that foreign refs are acceptable. As to the issue of self-published refs, while <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that blogs are not largely acceptable, it goes on to say that self-published work may be acceptable if the author is a professional in the field. This ref fulfills that criterion, as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Belien_d2e8.html" title="Paul Belien">Paul Belien</a> is also a journalist who has written for major newspapers such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_Street_Journal_8de1.html" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a>. I doubt he would libel anyone, as he has his professional reputation as journalist to consider. By the way, of the five refs I currently have, this is the only one that I see as self-published. The others are a Moroccan magazine, a Belgian magazine, a Belgian Newspaper and an Arabic news site. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 16:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I hope that you examined the sources more thoroughly than my userpage. While it only lists German and Itlian as Non-English languages, that allows me also to comprehend some Dutch and French respectively.

<li>As, of course, you're the creator let me add that I had hoped to have clarified that while there are many citations, and it is clear that there was a scandal with Servaty as main suspect, not all sources actaully sustained that Servaty was identified as 'Belguel' or explained clear enough how or e.g. where and when the mentioned interview was published. Here my limited understanding of Dutch may indeed have played a role. So I felt it necessary to have this reviewed. However, I won't express an opinion in this relisting (which is completely legit since there originally was only one opinion but ours.) <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 09:36, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>The TelQuel ref</b>: t<i>he 11 Moroccan young women imprisoned following this business had designated the man who had photographed them in these defamatory positions as being "Philippe Sarfati, journalist with the Belgian daily newspaper Le Soir</i>. <b>The Brussels journal</b>: <i>Le Soir, however, forced Servaty to resign in early June when it became known that Servaty had added “anti-Islamic remarks” to some of the pictures</i>. <b>The ArabicNews.com (the weakest ref)</b>: <i>Servaty would have deluded over 80 Moroccan women, in the Moroccan south-western city of Agadir, into taking pornographic photo-shots and scenes on promises that he would marry them and ensure their legal stay in his country</i>. <b>Knack magazine</b>: <i>Servaty photographed the women, saying it was for hi8s own use, and placed the explicit photos on the internet, with sexist and racist comments, on the now closed webiste marocsluts.tk...In an interview with RTBF he apologized and said that he is a sex addict</i>. <b>De Standaard newspaper</b>: <i>In Agadir thirtten women are jailed and dozens on the run after becoming the victims of Belgische journalist P.S. During his vacations in Morocco he seduced the women, made compromising photos, and set the photos on an [internet] sexsite.</i> Every ref either states he is accused of this act, or states explicitly that he did it. One ref even contains the fact that he apologized for doing it. It's clear he did it, so I don't see how you can nominate this for deletion based on WP:BLP. it's not libel to state the facts of a case, if you have sources to back them up. The fact that the refs are not all in English does not make it fail WP:V, which explicitly allows non-English refs. I didn't think this was a good faith nomination the first time you placed it here, I think it even less this second time. As to your comment that you hope I read the references more clearly than your userpage, I didn't look at your userpage at all.

<li>As probably is clear by now, I did not place the article a second time here. That was done by an administrator.

<li><b>Strong speedy keep:</b> Excuse my language but I'm fucking STUNNED. Robben Ford is one of the best and most respected blues-rock-jazz guitarists alive - with a 30+ year history of being so. Numerous articles on him. <i>"Robben Ford came to prominence as one of those smooth, jazzy West Coast studio session players whom many compared to Larry Carlton. Both played with a group called the LA Express, which backed Joni Mitchell in mid 1970s. He also played on George Harrison's Dark Horse album, plus records by people ranging from Barbra Streisand to Kenny Loggins to Little Feat." "By the mid 1980s, Ford would become part of Miles Davis' touring band. [P]layers as respected as Pete Townshend and Eric Clapton have marveled at his work, and he appeared as a featured artist in Musician Magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of the 20th Century" issue."</i> <b>Do yourself a favor - watch this video (the whole thing) - then withdraw this meritless specious AfD as truth and justice and musical history demand. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmqQnLQhRcI" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmqQnLQhRcI" rel="nofollow">Robben Ford Live In Germany 1994</a></b> <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">FAAFA</a> 07:26, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is not a bad way to approach this. However, I am concerned that the Italian original does not cite any sources. Seems like we may just be importing a problem; another unreferenced article. Can you provide a general sense of why the person is notable from your reading of the Italian original?--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 14:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is always a problem with translations from other language Wikipedias. So far no other language Wikipedia has a requirement that articles must be sourced, although they encourage it, and as result few are. They do however have notability requirements and the Italian article has existed since August 2005 and it has been edited by a number of experienced editors on Italian Wikipedia. I think its reasonable to defer to them on notability here. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not unreasonable, and there is no harm in waiting for the translation to see what we really have. So, I'm watering down my support for deletion - though I can't quite bring myself to support keeping the article without some firmer indication of notability.

<p>Contested PROD. Fails to assert notability (unless you count <i>one of the first schools in Northern India to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program</i>); the school has been in existence since 2003. You don't get an notability from an article, but the other way around. Seems to be a vandalism magnet, littered with unsubstantiated defamatory comments.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Leaving aside for a moment that 90% of the article needs to be junked as trivia or original research, the only assertion of notability is weak. A college having an IB accreditation is not that special. Saying "all schools carrying the International Baccalaureate program to be sufficiently notable" is like saying "all licensed doctors are notable". It's an important accreditation, but it is not so unusual as to be notable. —<a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies">Dgies</a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sup> 06:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the equivalent of an American high school; it is even a particularly large and notable private high school, at that.

<li><b>Comment</b> The creator of this article translated it from es.wikipedia. It does read like a translation. Creator seems miffed about effort to delete and basically throws his hands up. Hackmeeting has a high google count in Spanish. I don't have the language skills. This might be a significant type of event in europe. Or maybe was as most links are a few years old.

However, the article <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_the_World_aa0a.html" title="Buck the World">Buck the World</a> was not properly tagged as part of the group nomination, and the editors of the article seem not to have known about the AFD. Therefore, I have undeleted the article and re-nominated it, to avoid the appearance of bias. The primary concern in the prior AFD was lack of reliable sources for this not-yet-released album. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-11 07:36Z</small></i></span></p>

<li>What verifiable information can be obtained from the young-buck.com website? Forgive me if I don't find his personal website and myspace page to be reliable, given that the working title has changed at least three times since it was announced, and the release date may as well shift on every page load. This is a perfect example of when not to use primary sources; when the album is released or there is some concrete information published about it from a third party we can create a reliable Wikipedia article at that time. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 08:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait, so now, according to the link you provided, the album is being released on March 13, 2007? That's funny, because the Wikipedia article has advertised a date of March 20, 2007 going on several weeks. I agree that these sites have proven themselves as unreliable sources. We should wait until the album is released given the uncertainty surrounding this article.

<li><b>Speedy Deletion</b> How do you self-diagnose Aspergers? I have Aspergers and I went to three doctors before they came to the unanimous conclusion that I had Aspergers. If three trained psychologists had a hard time coming to the Aspergers conclusion, then I doubt you can self-diagnose it. Sidenote, I was told the reason it took three doctors is because Aspergers takes on the symptoms of other psychological problems. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Work</a>)</sup> 09:35, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The big red warning light should have gone off in the article creator's mind when xe found that xe wasn't permitted to enter the URL when attempting to cite Encyclopaedia Dramatica. This article has zero reliable sources, and is wholly sourced to joke articles and discussion forum posts by unidentifiable people. The web page on Ridiculopathy actually says outright that it is a joke and should not be taken seriously, twice even. The only sources that <i>could</i> be reliable are the two medical journal papers. But one doesn't exist and the other doesn't support the content of this article. I've checked volume 368 issues 9551 to 9554 of <i>The Lancet</i>, and they have no such article by Leon McCouch. ("Lie on my couch", I suspect.) The journal article in ANZJoP (DOI:10.1046/j.1440-1614.2001.0896a.x) written by Halaz is in fact a book review, of a book by the same title ("Attention-Deficit Disorders and Comorbidities in Children, Adolescents, and Adults", <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0880487119</a>) written by Thomas Brown. It's about ADHD.

<li>Well there's always the French Wikipedia! If there are no sources in English, it's very hard to write an article on. After all, if we can't read any third-party sources about it, how can we be sure of its notability? The only thing that having no sources in English is that it isn't very notable, but that is not neccessarily the case. It seems that it's the same with Xuly Bet. It's all very big in France, but not great over here. We'll have to see what happens with this one then. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECream147_36cd.html" title="User:Cream147">Cream147</a> <sub><a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECream147_daf9.html" title="User talk:Cream147">Shout at me for doing wrong</a></sub> 18:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested prod for this non notable prayer day. 31 distinct Google hits<a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=%22autism+sunday%22+-%22autism+sunday+times%22+-%22autism+sunday+herald%22+-%22autism+sunday+express%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=%22autism+sunday%22+-%22autism+sunday+times%22+-%22autism+sunday+herald%22+-%22autism+sunday+express%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, and even those aren't all for this day. Seems to have received little attention in 2002 (first time around) and none since (searching for the official name, "International Day of Prayer for Autism", gives only 6 Google hits, none of them by reliable independent sources[<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22International+Day+of+Prayer+for+Autism%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22International+Day+of+Prayer+for+Autism%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22International+Day+of+Prayer+for+Autism%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=</a>). From the sources (the BBC One, given in the article and via the google search is the only notable one in my view), it looks as though this yearly event got some (but insufficinet) attention the first year around, and none since then. No multiple reliable independent sources with non-trivial coverage indicates that this event isn't notable enough for Wikipedia (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>).

<dd>The charities may have a vested interest, but are not directly connected to the organisers. The UK Parliament and the BBC are totally independent of the campaign (and imply more than 'little attention'). In addition there are numerous links and references in blogs and church sites from around the world, which whilst not reliable sources in themselves when considered en masse do imply that the campaign is international. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 11:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My Google searches are given in the opening statement of this AfD, so I presume your question was rhetorical and/or sarcastic? Anyway, the first and second link are only passing mentions of Autism Sunday (the subject of this AfD is only Autism Sunday, not the Autism Awareness Campaign or any other Autism related event). (the UK parliament one in full reads "The year's events started this week with Autism Sunday on 6 January."). The third one is a bit longer, but both the second and the third are not by reliable, independent sources as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but by charities / interest groups. The only true source is the BBC one, which I already commented upon. The only source, acceptable or not, for the continuation of Autism Sunday beyond 2002 treats it as if it is a new thing, not the continuation of the earlier one: "Autism is back in focus with February 2006 as the Month of Prayer for Autism - Sunday 12th February was also the first International Day of Prayer for Autism and Asperger's Syndrome. " (again, the full text regarding Autism Sunday). So yes, the prayer day has received very little attention the first time around, and no attention whatsoever since. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

The parade was nice, but the Republican v. Democrat frozen food fight was a fiasco. The point being that various organizations and worthy causes routinely ask politicians to announce commemorations or celebrations for their business or cause, yet few of these are really truly notable. Not that their cause is not worthy, but yet another of these commemorations orchestrated by an "awareness campaign" does not strike me as all that notable. It may have gotten some minor political attention and was mentioned in the newspapers, but getting that kind of attention was the purpose. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> for the last two 'week keep's. Have you checked the searches? Books yields nothing, Scholar yields two results which are <i>not</i> for autism sunday but for "autism. Sunday", and News gives 6 results, of which two are for "Autism. Sunday" as well, one is for a completely unrelated event (in March), one is a "letter to the editor", and we are left with two articles very briefly mentioning the first Autism Sunday (2002), and none for the later ones. So thanks to AddHoc for the searches, but I can't see how these can lead to a keep when they clearly fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> criteria on closer inspection. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am really not sure about this one. It may be a very legitimate article. However, it seems to be wildly (fanatically, even) POV, and I think it COULD be a recreation of something, judging by the creation comment of the author. Also, the author is a suspected sockpuppet. Very unsure what is to be done about it. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 20:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hindus are entitled to their own beliefs! This whole argment started when Hindu articles kept getting deleted.

<p>The deletion proposition was issued by vandals who are very racist. they do not want Hindus to show their viewpoint. First vandals would not permit Hindus to post their viewpoints on the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama.html" title="Gautama">Gautama</a> page so I designed the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha_as_an_Avatar_of_Vishnu_0207.html" title="Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu">Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu</a> page and even the Hindu viewpoints in that were mostly deleted.

This is an encyclopedia, not a debating chamber, and wiki policy is that articles shall not express points of view, save only by second-hand attribution." Response: Yes, indeed it is an encyclopedia and because the topic is Lord Buddha from the Hindu viewpoint, it should be recorded in the encyclopedia rather than being deleted just because some fools want to hide Hindu viewpoints about Lord Buddha from the world.</p>
<p>The Buddha talked about the Sanatan Dharam and the Arya Dharam and Nirvan. Do you neo-Buddhists have any explainations for that?</p>
<p>This article has to remain to educate people on the Hindu Buddha!</p>

Since there are over 200 articles concerning cocktails alone at Wikipedia and an entire WikiBook dedicated to bartending, it is difficult to fathom how these individuals who helped bring all that about are <i>not</i> notable. The list needs work, obviously, so please just <b>move it to Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed Drinks/Work Area/List of cocktail personalities</b> so that Phil may continue his work, and we do so <b>without losing the edit history</b> that is in place (per <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL license</a> requirements).

<p>This is a neologism apparently made up by the creator, a literal translation from the German <a href="../../../../de/m/a/n/Mantel-und-Degen-Film_7db9.html" class="extiw" title="de:Mantel-und-Degen-Film">de:Mantel-und-Degen-Film</a>. To boot, "cloak and dagger" has a different meaning than "Mantel und Degen", it's about spies and agents and has nothing to do with musketeers and the likes. There are some Google hits for "cloak-and-dagger-film", (the number jumped from 255 two weeks ago to now 700, however most of them clones and only 69 true hits (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Cloak-and-dagger+film%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;rls=RNFA,RNFA:1970--2,RNFA:de&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Cloak-and-dagger+film%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;rls=RNFA,RNFA:1970--2,RNFA:de&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>)), but I can't find any evidence there of this term being used for what the article says, and not even for a film genre at all. Hence, I had proposed the deletion, however the article's author, <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWittkowsky_5f4c.html" title="User:Wittkowsky">User:Wittkowsky</a>, apparently German just as I am, objected. <a href="../../../h/0/0/User%7EH005_e797.html" title="User:H005">H005</a> 12:26, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - Well, if you think <i>"cloak and dagger" in literature is something completely different</i> you are free to add content of that kind to the article. But that missing is absolutely no reason to delete the article, it is just an incomplete article. And another "well", <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=de&amp;q=Cloak-and-dagger-film+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Suche&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=de&amp;q=Cloak-and-dagger-film+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Suche&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">Google</a> finds 618 entries with <i>Cloak-and-dagger-film -wikipedia</i> (so without wikipedia-clones), not 255, with <i>"Cloak-and-dagger film" -wikipedia</i> 693 entries and with <i>Cloak-and-dagger film -wikipedia</i> about 200.000 (as of today). Seems to be "a bit" more relevant than you thought. And not being used for movies? Well, have a look at the first sentence at <a href="http://www.movie-2-dvd.org/film/fanfan-la-tulipe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.movie-2-dvd.org/film/fanfan-la-tulipe.html" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> or <a href="http://www.phares-balises.fr/en/fiche_films.php?film=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phares-balises.fr/en/fiche_films.php?film=10" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> and even the New York Times uses this term (<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DF163BF93BA35751C1A963948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DF163BF93BA35751C1A963948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>)--<a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWittkowsky_5f4c.html" title="User:Wittkowsky">Wittkowsky</a> 18:28, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As I had pointed out above, there are currently only 69 true Google hits, not 618. Of the three links provided by Wittkowsky, two are of obscure websites run by Maltese and French authors - apparently no native speakers of English. And two of the three films discussed are not of the swashbuckling type, but about spies - just as "cloak and dagger" suggests.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>After all, a couple of proper occurrences of such a term on the WWW does not justify an own article in Wikipedia.</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per the examples provided by Wittkowski. How's that, given he thinks they are arguments for the reverse? Well, note the New York Times reference is specifically a usage to reference a spy film, <i>not</i> a swashbuckler, and the others are translations from the French.

<dd>Well, the NYT-link (and the others) was/were provided to prove, that the term is actually being used for movies and was not made up. IF the content of the arcticle does not match some contemporary movies, it is by no means the best matter to delete the article, but to improve it and add content, that states (and explains), that this term also is being used for other kinds of movies. It is, like on many other articles, just a beginning and not the end. (@ H005: Please don't tell the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Maltese</a> they can't speak English.

<p><b>Save Bob's Wikipedia</b> I find it almost insulting that you suggest removing Bob Lundeberg's page. Anthony Bradbury and HeartofaDog, you both have no right or duty to do so. As his agent and close friend I can vouch for his existence. I am not surprised that he is not found on a Google search as he does not have a website and is considered, as mentioned in the article, an underground rockstar here in the Willamette Valley who is most-publicized through posters and local literature. Mr. Lundeberg deserves to be recognized on the internet and my only intention was to give him that sense of fame by dedicating a Wikipedia page to him.</p>
<p>As for Fabulous and Roy Montgomery Adams, simply because a Google search brings up nothing cannot be considered valid grounds for deletion of the article. Have you stopped to consider that, as in Lundeberg's case, any published material is found in local newspapers and magazines and not on the internet? Leave them alone, Mr. Bradbury; as far as you know, they are completely valid articles.--Samorado 11:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am kinda confused. I worked as a set designer for fabulous. I agree with Samorado, a lot of stuff from local newspapers is deleted from their databases. It's kind of insulting in fact that the only place where we can get recognized for our work even a little bit, everyone wants to delete us.--Allmighty Jimbo 12:11, 11 February 2007</p>

Regarding <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, I would be happy to locate and identify some non-trivial published material in support of Lundeberg's accomplishments. "What constitutes 'published works' is broad and encompasses published works in all forms, including but not limited to newspapers, books and e-books, magazines, television and radio documentaries, reports by government agencies, scientific journals, etc." (Taken from <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>; Primary Notability Criterion). The sources I site will be newspapers and magazines which this excerpt deems appropriate as fulfilling the Notability criteria. After inserting references to published works into the article, I think we can agree that Bob Lundeberg's article will have all the necessary credentials to remain online.--Samorado 11:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Only an administrator (who can see the previously deleted version) could tell if this is a recreation about the same person, because the previous Brian Scott article was about a musician, and this one claims musical activity as well (though mostly he is here as a wrestler).

It's presented at the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic-Con_International_ae98.html" title="Comic-Con International">San Diago Comics Convention</a> -- the largest industry convention in the country -- and is presented "along side" the <a href="../../../e/i/s/Eisner_Award_31f2.html" title="Eisner Award">Eisner Awards</a> -- the most prestigious awards for the medium. <a href="http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=003744" class="external text" title="http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=003744" rel="nofollow">The Beat</a> carried the press release when this award was founded, (note that comicon.com is not associated with comic-con.org), has press coverage at <a href="http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/05/news_schwartz_and_kurtzman_get.html" class="external text" title="http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/05/news_schwartz_and_kurtzman_get.html" rel="nofollow">The Beat</a> and the official Comic-Con website has pages on the winners <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger_1.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger_1.shtml" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger.shtml" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>.

<li>I've now updated the article, added the 2006 winners and a reference to the official press release. I'm sure the release has been picked up somewhere, and perhaps someone can come up with a copy of the convention program where it's presented. It's an important award, it's presented to important people in comic history, it's verified and notable and noteworthy. <b>Strong keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your improvements are good, but if an award is notable, it is surely covered somewhere in the press. (It's an award, after all, it's supposed to be famous).

<p>Carlet is just one of a group of people within the organization that have garnered press and this is confined to the past few years.

Pioneer? There are numerous other foreigners and Japanese who have been working in this field for decades longer than Carlet. And the March in March is considered a joke by many, including union members as it belittles the fact that many Japanese workers face the same labour problems that Carlet holds up as being discriminatory.<a href="../../../o/s/a/User%7EOsakadan_923c.html" title="User:Osakadan">Osakadan</a> 23:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>comment</b> I have no views on the notability of this article - if it was reworked I would say <b>KEEP</b>. It is important to note that a check of the posting history of the nominator of this AfD, Sparkzilla, shows that this user and editors on the NUGW (in which Louis Carlet is intimately involved) page have been in conflict for some time. Sparkzilla introduced the criticism section on that page linking to Metropolis magazine. It should be noted that a conflict of interest arises, due to Sparkzilla's intimate involvement with Metropolis ( a crisscross publication). A RfC, or RfA or simpler remedy, by interested parties, will show Sparkzilla's past IP's to fall within that of the IP block assigned to crisscross.com by apnic. It would suggest that this AfD is not motivated by a genuine desire to improve Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The demonstration in Manhattan is verifiable through the August 1995 edition of OCS News, a Japanese newspaper published in the US. An entire article was devoted to him on page 3 of a recent Mainichi Shimbun article. Also whether or not the annual March in March that he spearheaded is a "joke" or not is irrelevant to its relevance in the foreign labor movement today in Japan. It is the only march in Japan dedicated to multinational labor solidarity and march leaders, including Carlet, have repeatedly made clear that Japanese workers face many of the same job problems as foreigners. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.37.32.92 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.37.32.92_b3f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.37.32.92">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>This article has multiple considerations for it's AFD. The primary statements in the article that support its notability are mostly limited to "an Egyptian journalist and writer who has had multiple articles published, many by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_Street_Journal_8de1.html" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>". The article appears to fail <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and many statements fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></p>
<p>Note - the section listed as <i><b><a href="../../../r/e/f/References.html" title="References">References</a></b></i> is in reality a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliography.html" title="Bibliography">bibliography</a> it is a list of works the person has written, not a list of articles about the person. There is little doubt this title needs to be changed but as I (<a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">User:jeepday</a>) Prodded the article and am now submitting it for AFD, I did not want to complicate the issue by also editing the article.</p>
<ol>
<li>The article was originated 04:02, 16 December 2006 User:Yasminerashidi (←Created page with '<b>Yasmine El-Rashidi</b> is an Egyptian journalist and writer. She is a graduate of <i>Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism</i> (99) and has covered t...')</li>

<li><a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">User:jeepday</a> proded the article on 14:22, 3 February 2007</li>

<li>The first edit by <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">user:Inkpaduta</a> is 22:59, 3 February 2007 bringing <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> into question, As <i><b>this editors first contribution is 8 hours After the article Yasmine El-Rashidi was prodded'</b></i>, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Inkpaduta_e6d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Inkpaduta">Special:Contributions/Inkpaduta</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> OK, shoot me down in flames if you wish. The subject appears to be a competent journalist, who has no other claim to notability.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Seems to be a pretty well-known Middle Eastern reporter; has definitely appeared on at least Christopher Lydon's <i>Open Source</i> talk show, and of course we should cut her some slack as a non-Westerner, it would be nice to have more Egyptians in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> Seeing that the originator of the article is titled User:Yasminerashidi I would venture a guess that this article is self-promotion.

<li>is this page do exist then all these not notable unsigned bands is gonna place their entry there just for their own benefit.</li>

I'm certain one could find individual comic books that have a situation where these two characters behaved toward each other in a certain way...but unless one could find an interview with the writer and artist of that comic book, any interpretation of the MEANING of that encounter only exists in the mind of the individual, not in any objective and verifiable state. An article about a psychology textbook that uses Superman and Batman as examples might be excyclopaedic (something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_and_Philosophy%7E_The_D%27oh%21_of_Homer_d65d.html" title="The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer">The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer</a>) but a straight up article that attempts to determine meaning, psychology and interpretation to these characters is exactly what <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is intended to avoid. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 21:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, call me a heretic, but I think Wikipedia's whole pretence of not containing original research is increasingly laughable, especially in cases like this where existing scholarship is minimal or non-existant. While a worthy goal, it's entirely undercut by its very status as a text that anyone can edit (and don't get me started on "not notable" when this site has individual articles for EVERY EPISODE of most current US TV shows!). Even highly-sourced articles contain great heaping piles of original research if you care to read between the lines, so I think that new articles such as this one (which, frankly, I'm not going out of my way to defend on its own merits) get unfairly targeted. I mean really, honestly; if every unverified sentence on Wikipedia that's suspected of being OR was cut then how much content do you think we'd loose? 30%? 50%? 75%?

<p>I'm not against an article explaining what a court calendar is, or the different forms it takes.... but this article seems to not be that but is intending to be a list of internet links to all US (and potentially world) court calendars. Wikipedia articles should not be "Mere collections of external links or Internet directories" (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>). I didn't feel comfortable just deleting all the links and stubifying the article - as this effectively would mean deleting the page - without opening a discussion - any thoughts? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmedea_0f30.html" title="User:Madmedea">Madmedea</a> 17:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> <i>Currently,</i> this is a repository of links. If the links were removed, the article would be a dictionary definition, and I don't see much room for expansion. There might be another article somewhere that covers this topic tangentially, and a redirect would be reasonable then, but I don't really know what article that would be. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:39, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I suggest we delete all the links per nom reasoning and stub the article. I think there is some modest room for expansion - e.g. ways in which different states/countries use court calenders, history of the alternative term "docket" etc. As an aside, <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docket.html" title="Docket">Docket</a> really should be a disambiguation page. I will follow up on that, though I think I will wait to see the fate of this article first as that will affect the disambiguation.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 06:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The present article could be improved to meet the WP standards, provided it doesn't try to add links to all court calendars. It might be better to point to some other sites that contain more complete sets of links, to reduce the number of links needed here. In its present form it helps answer the general question, 'What kinds of online information do courts publish?', and it's so short right now, it's hard to object to it. However, the constraints of WP:NOT indicate that it should not add any more links unless it provides more analysis. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Mangojuice already said the first two thoughts that came to my mind. I might add that this is a bit US-centric, but that alone is not reason enough to delete. If not outright deleted, I'd suggest stripping the links and transwiki to the wiktionary. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is not a "how to" manual.

<p>Prod disputed without explanation by article author. This is a hoax if I ever saw one. For as famous as this guy's illness supposedly was, googling for "bradley anderson" "chief ambassador" turns up absolutely nothing. "bradley anderson" "ambassador" does turn up an article of ours, but that only lists an Australian ambassador (not even chief) who was born in 1949, and that name was recently added by an anon and the spelling changed a little bit later by the same person who wrote this article. "bradley anderson" by itself turns up lots of results (common name), but nothing at all about an ambassador. (Also nominating Maria James, a redirect page to this one, created about the guy's supposed "wife". I can find nothing to support that either.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 18:39, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Do Not Delete</b> I am personally a person who is willing to accept new ideas and embrace them before judging them, having been informed of the current debate i felt outraged at these propostrous claims of a lack of notability and credibility. I suggest that these people actually take an interest in the subject before making such ludacris comments and lowering my respective view of them. As I have been a fan of the organisation involved for the past 9 months I as a part of the online community can protest that they have a high notability and credibility in most parts of the country.NewIdeasRevolution 14:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC) <small>— NewIdeasRevolution (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NewIdeasRevolution_3b5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NewIdeasRevolution">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Do Not Delete</b> This article has a huge degree of notability for people that take an interest in such pressing new ideas being introduced to the online community, and just because a certain person has not heard of this activity, it does not mean that thousands of others have not.

<li><b>Strong Do Not Delete</b> This is a perfect example of how a backyard wrestling federation is created and done and was the only notable on ever to come from the U.K. Amongst the online communities of bacyard feds this is highly regarded as one of the best.

<p>I wanted to write about canon law scholars, and found this. A blog. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a web directory</a>. The talk page has various weblinks that it claims establish notability; I disagree. One story, linked to multiple times, merely quotes the blog's author about the subject of Jewish blogs. One other story mentions it among other similar blogs.

<li><b>Comment</b> The issue is not whether they're famous, it's whether they meet wikipedia's standards of notability for musicians. The link I provided clearly shows that they meet this one: "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in reliable sources.". My source proves that RAMBO toured Southeast Asia and South America.

<li><b>Delete</b> The concert criterion of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> is disputed. Besides that, it says that that is something that makes it very likely that there is sufficient information from reliable sources about the subject, but that does not appear to be the case with this subject. GassyGuy 01:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Oh groovy, if the concert criterion is taken away, wikipedia will have firmly established that the standard mainstream distribution route (signing to a major label, getting play on mainstream radio stations, etc) is the only way for a band to become "notable". That's complete BS. In any case, even if that criterion is disputed, it's still there at the moment so no matter what anyone says or how they vote, RAMBO ARE considered notable by wikipedia standards. If that criterion goes away they won't meet the standards, but they do now. And I'm sorry, but the Philadelphia Weekly is not a reliable mainstream source? That's where the article I linked to is sourced from, I just used the link I did because it's hard to find the reference to RAMBO in the original source.<a href="../../../s/o/k/User%7ESokeripupu_4c23.html" title="User:Sokeripupu">Sokeripupu</a> 01:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<b>Rebuttal:</b> If this were an article proposing that the GFL was a "real" league then sure, grounds for deletion. But, the article clearly states that it is describing a "Fictional League" as pertains to a work of fiction. The Wikipedia is packed with other descriptions of elements from other fictional works. How is this one different? We have an entire entry on the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_Star_Trek_0d70.html" title="Weapons of Star Trek">Weapons of Star Trek</a> yet none of them are real, there is a list of the companies named in the Star Wars canon: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_companies_cde2.html" title="List of Star Wars companies">List of Star Wars companies</a> which is strictly fictional, and there is a list of the faux Mandarin curse words used in Firefly: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Firefly_slang_words_9e2c.html" title="List of Firefly slang words">List of Firefly slang words</a>. I might note that the individual who posted this deletion actualy is a contributor to the Star Trek articles. Perhaps one might say that the other articles describing fictional elements from things like Star Trek, Star Wars, and Firefly are describing more popular works. Since when is Wikipedia a popularity contest? The fact of the matter is Scott Sigler is a groundbreaking podcaster and if anything is even more eligible for note as he is at the vanguard of a new media movement. I fail to see how there is any merit to this. Granted the article needs cleaning up, and I have posted a banner proposing just that. However, since it is describing an element of a podcast that is still in continuing production I have to imagine that the cleanup will be a continuing issue as well.</p>

<li>I don't consider a mentioning on pages 111 and 112 of an 'An Unofficial Companion Guide' to be sufficient to establish notability. I interpret <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>'s "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">encyclopedic treatment</a>" to mean that the source would have to provide out-of-universe context. Otherwise, it is just a summary of the primary source material (ie. fictional guide). I have no objections to it being re-created if "encyclopedic treatment" can be written, but currently it is just a sentance about the name followed by a long plot summary. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean</a> 04:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>How exactly would it be valuable to a researcher that, to pick one semi-random example, in one unidentified episode of the show <i>Home Movies</i> there was something called "Burpsi-Cola"? What could our hypothetical researcher possibly be studying that would make that valuable knowledge? There is no way to know from the article if this cola played any significant role in the episode, hell, there isn't even any way to know if it came in a can or a bottle or who drank it or if someone drank it or poured it over their head. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia has been banned from time to time in different parts of the world. I think that that will not be a ground for deleting the entire Wikipedia from the earth, and this applies to the site under reference. Moreover, an article's encyclopedic values should be examined and not the credentials of editors concerned who created the major contents. We do not have a system to remove all the contents added by a banned user. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 17:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> I know that may look strange, but this is in fact exactly the same as the deleted Off By One (browser) article. I would call this a G4 speedy delete, except that <i>this</i> article apparently predates the other one. As it stands, I felt that since the same article was under discussion, I would consider the balance of comments in both debates, which clearly shows a significant consensus for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is a duplicate of Off By One (browser), which was deleted (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Off_By_One_%28browser%29_b53f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Off By One (browser)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Off By One (browser)</a>) a little over a month ago with all votes in the AFD for delete. It also has no talk page. The last nom said, "OK, I am not entirely convinced about notability of this product. It seems to me to fail WP:SOFTWARE. In particular I do not see "multiple non-trivial published works", nor does it seem to be a "core product of a notable software developer or vendor". It seems to be a minor, experimental product, still in early stages of development. A browser that does not support CSS and JavaScript would be severely crippled and hardly suitable for real use, as the image of Wikipedia front page shows. On the other hand I may be entirely mistaken. It's for the Wikipedia community to decide." <a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakotGrimshine_2034.html" title="User:SakotGrimshine">SakotGrimshine</a> 21:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
Hello DukeOfDuchessStreet. This article is in development. I am adding content and the CORRESPONDING REFERENCES, as time provides. It would seem that for now I'll concentrate on adding BONE-FIDE REFERENCES (you know those things like PUBLISHED BOOKS).</p>
<p>As per your comment on the article being <b>"derivative"</b> of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteen_Colonies_9ce6.html" title="Thirteen Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> article, I respectfully do not agree. The article the <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalist_Six_Colonies_of_the_Nineteen_Colonies_b4de.html" title="Loyalist Six Colonies of the Nineteen Colonies">Loyalist Six Colonies of the Nineteen Colonies</a> is <b>"complimentary"</b>, in my opinion. What it illustrates is,</p>
<p><b>(i).</b> There were 21 British Possessions in Continental North America up to 1775 (i.e., from 1607-1775),</p>
<p><b>(ii).</b> Of those 21 Colonial Units, there were,</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>(iia).</b> 19 Settler Colonies,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>(iib).</b> 1 Commerical Colony (i.e, the <font color="blue"><b>Hudson's Bay Land</b></font>),</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>(iic).</b> 1 Crown Land Colony (i.e, the <font color="blue"><b>Crown Lands Reversed for the Indians</b></font>),</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>(iii).</b> The 19 Settler Colonies all had LOCAL LEGISTATURES, thus were <font color="blue"><b>Provinces <i>within the British Empire</i></b></font> , (e.g., the <font color="blue"><b>Province of East Florida</b></font>),</p>
<p><b>(iv).</b> That the correct term for the <font color="blue"><b>British Colonies in North America</b></font> <i>prior to 1783</i>, is that of <font color="blue"><b>British America</b></font> and the <font color="blue"><b>British West Indies</b></font>,</p>
<p><b>(v).</b> That the correct term for the <font color="blue"><b>British Colonies in North America</b></font> <i>after 1783</i>, is that of <font color="blue"><b>British <i>North</i> America</b></font> and the <font color="blue"><b>British West Indies</b></font>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_North_America_0dc2.html" title="British North America">British North America</a> as per current recommendation on both pages. Definitely an encyclopedic topic rarely well-addressed. This article has an awkward title and the BNA article needs substance, so a merge sounds to me like the best resolution. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 00:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I can find no sources using this terminology or treating these six colonies as anything but the later history of BNA. This article has nothing to merge except a list. (Additionally, the editor using the bright blue highlighting is advised to cut it out and read the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a>, please.) --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 04:48, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_North_America_0dc2.html" title="British North America">British North America</a>. per Askari Mark. At the very least, change the title. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 10:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b>: <b>Loyalist colonies in the British New World</b> (<i>Note capitalisation - Wikipedia style mandates caps for the first letter of a title, and for proper nouns</i>): I think a case could feasibly be developed to show how domestic policies in British holdings throughout the New World changed in response to and after the American Revolution, as well as showing the progress of various local sovereigntist movements, and the immigration of Loyalists coming from the republian-occupied territories. This would be distinct from, and not merely a sub-section of British America, as it has the potential to showcase the Loyalist movement in republican North America, with no regard for the borders of any given nation-state. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">samwaltz</a> 08:53, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then I withdraw my nomination.

<p>I applied the PROD template to several non-notable entries in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_Carpenters_songs_dbb4.html" title="Category:The Carpenters songs">Category:The Carpenters songs</a>, but an anon went through and removed all of them without explanation. I will list each song separately, as, per precedent, this seems to be preferred, but the reasoning is the same on all: They show no real level of encyclopaedic notability, even though I've no doubt they're fine songs. They were not released as singles. Information about them can be discussed on their respective album pages and, in one case, in the article about the Make Your Own Kind of Music TV special. That said, there's not exactly much information on any of these to merge. I apologize if anyone resents the recycling of this AfD reasoning, but all of these articles are of such a similar nature that I feel it's appropriate. GassyGuy 22:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Move content and delete</b> - if songs are not notable, they should not have their own article in an encyclopedia.

Our policy also requires that <i>you look for sources yourself</i> before coming to such a conclusion, which you haven't done. Looking for sources turns up pages 436 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0735713332</a>, which describes "Lurker mode" in Macromedia Fash UI components, where a user watches but does not interact; and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1852335327</a> which has <i>an entire chapter</i>, "Silent Participants: Getting to know lurkers better" on pages 110–132, on Usenet lurkers.

<dd>That sounds right close to an admonishment, UncleG. Are you certain you have the commission to dole out such? For you to assume that I vote on these AfD's without doing my own research is a bad faith assumption, and one I do not appreciate. I did not say there was no context. I said the context did not amount to more than a dictionary entry. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I stand on my decision, and agree to disagree with you. But I am not prepared to tolerate being admonished by you as above. Please extend a little more courtesy and keep personal attacks out of these discussions.

I would venture the content is coming from fans of the artist who are unaware there are music specific Wikis out there better suited to helping chronicle the achievements of artists they like and more open to featuring indie artists. Interesting read and good listening, but per Wiki guideline suggestions better to delete and motivate more detailed research from the zealous fans, which may result in the article being re-added later in better format and not merely cloned content from the artist official site. The artist may very well be notable for mere longevity by indie artist standards but the article needs to be original and not a mere reprint of content from an official artist web site. The same would hold true for any recording artist indie label or major. Wikipedia simply can't clone content from official artist web sites. I would also venture that any recording artist, record label, or publisher would prefer for fans to land on an official web page and not an encyclopedia article of cloned content when doing a google search.

Not only is there no evidence of non-trivial independent coverage, the one album they have released is self-funded and was recorded in one of the band's bedroom(!); they have contributed single tracks to some other albums of no evident notability. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I started to go with "keep" with the provided Google numbers, but then I noticed in the "Points of note" section that there is another band with the same name, so it's hard telling how many hits go to which band without some major research. I did, however, do another search using "death metal" with the band name, but I still couldn't tell. I believe the burden is on the author to come back and provide more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<p>Reason <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Butler_316c.html" title="User:Tom Butler">Tom Butler</a> 00:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC) I have submitted EVP for deletion. I will follow with ITC.</p>
<p>The reason for this request for deletion is that:</p>
<p>1) Wikipedia rules restrict content of the EVP entry: Wikipedia:No original research. Virtually all of the work done to study EVP and related phenomena has been classified by editors as original research, and therefore, the subject cannot be factually represented in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>2) A survey of the people studying EVP, and therefore the people who are sufficiently knowledgable to provide factual content , will show that virtually all of them have a conflict of interested as described by Wikipedia editors: Wikipedia:Conflict of interest.</p>
<p>3) It has been demonstrated on numerous occasions that many of the editors contributing to the EVP entry do not have the background in the subject to distinguish valid information from out-dated or simply erronious information. Exclusion of EVP subject matter experts assures this to be a continuing problem.</p>
<p>4) There has been a continuing conflect between people who want demonstrated fact to be presented and people who discount those facts as not demonstrated by mainstream science. Even when agreement between the two vieupoints has been reached, it is sometimes only a few hours before new conservative editors begin pushing the point of view to make EVP sound like we are delusional. When I firs tcame to it last Novemeber, the AA-EVP, and therefore EVP was being discounted because I am a Spiritualsit.</p>
<p>5) With this new wave of editors came new determination to keep people who want EVP to be factually represented from participating in consensus building. One of the arguments for why I could not edit the entry was that there are references to the AA-EVP, making it a conflict of interest. My solution was to remove those references, but in response, I was blocked from editing for "editing wars." At the same time, one of the new editors was in an edit war over tages, but nothing was done to correct this.</p>
<p>Based on Wikipedia rules and the evidence of the EVP talk pages, it is clear that EVP should not be in the encyclopedia because it is not possible to arrive at and maintain a consensus. Determination to have the EVP entry has already produced negative publicity for Wikipedia, which will only eculate while EVP remains a public contest between skeptic and "proponents." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Butler_316c.html" title="User:Tom Butler">Tom Butler</a> 00:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
