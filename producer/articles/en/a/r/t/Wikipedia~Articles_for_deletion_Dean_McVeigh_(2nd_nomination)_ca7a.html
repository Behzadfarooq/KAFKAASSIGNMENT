<p>"Dean Royston McVeigh (born 9 June 1950) is an insolvency practitioner in Melbourne, Australia". In other words, he is a non-notable figure who has found himself involved in a notable event. That event is being covered at <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_University_student_unions_b2a8.html" title="Melbourne University student unions">Melbourne University student unions</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_McVeigh_c39e.html" title="Dean McVeigh">Dean McVeigh</a> redirects there. The article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dean_McVeigh_d569.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dean McVeigh">previously nominated</a> and no consensus was reached. Since then it has been the cause of much vitriol and disruption to the project. The page is protected and a redirect. I nominate that it be <b>deleted</b>, as non notable, and <b>replaced with a redirect</b> and that all concerned editors get back to work <i>editing</i> (and fixing their numerous double redirects). <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 01:54, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article was merged to the student unions article as many editors deemed McVeigh to only be notable in the context of the MUSU liquidation and it allowed the removal of rampant POV. The only people strongly opposed to the merger were the editors who are named litigants in the legal proceedings as they no longer had a platform to criticise McVeigh's conduct. The unfortunate number of redirects and double redirects will be fixed once the reversion by a minority stops. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 03:52, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not entirely sure what this AFD is for as there is no article as such at present with this redirecting to the article that mentions McVeigh. The disruptive editors have abandoned trying to get the McVeigh article back up and are now focussing their attention on the merged article. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 04:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course there's an article. It's in the history, one rollback away. If this AFD passes, the article and history can be deleted, and a permanent redirect put into place, protected if need be.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the article is a redirect and it is suggested that it be deleted and replaced with a redirect? The only possible reason to do this that I can think of is to make the history of the article unavailable to non-admins. I don't see why that would be necessary in this case. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 06:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There was no concensus in the last AFD. I felt the issue should be settled. <i>If</i> there's concensus now (where?) that it will remain a redirect and remain protected then of course this AFD is pointless and can be withdrawn. That's all I'm trying to establish. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:49, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the issue is that the redirect is currently protected which is probably the only reason some editors haven't tried to restore the article. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 06:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>100% correct, thanks. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:49, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see. However, when an AfD results in no consensus, it usually is not renominated right away. Instead, there is a discussion of what is to be done or the issue is allowed to rest for a while. Also, if content has been merged to another article, it cannot be deleted, it must remain as a redirect to the article to preserve attribution for the GFDL. The edits of the contributors to the article must be visible in the history to non-admins. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep locked as redirect</b>. The information is where it belongs, in relation to the event. This person has no other claim to notability than being heavily involved in the event.
