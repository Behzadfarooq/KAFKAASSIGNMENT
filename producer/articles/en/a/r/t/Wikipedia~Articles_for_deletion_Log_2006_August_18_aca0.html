<p>The page is very very stubby, not linked anywhere, and appears to be pointless. If "Amateur boxer" is an official class in a notable boxing league the article should be changed to reflect that, but save that (or an actual organization called "Amateur Boxers") this article is just a dictionary definition combining the words "Amateur" and "Boxer". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> <sub><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStaxringold_cc7c.html" title="User talk:Staxringold">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Staxringold_5836.html" title="Special:Contributions/Staxringold">contribs</a></span></sup> 22:04, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">Boxing</a>. The nominator's reference to "notable boxing league" suggests that he is completely ignorant about the organisation of boxing. Amateur boxing is one of the main sports at the Olympics and one of the largest amateur sports in the world! It is different from professional boxing in many ways, almost to the point of being a separate sport (arguably as much as <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> are separate sports). The coverage of amateur boxing in the main articles is inadequate at present, and ideally there should be a separate article at <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_boxing.html" title="Amateur boxing">amateur boxing</a>, which currently redirects to <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">Boxing</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetthurst_6abb.html" title="User:Metthurst">Metthurst</a> 17:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article does not give any reason why this truck is notable. In fact if I had not stumbled upon this article, I would have never even known what the bloody hell a "monster truck" is. Allow me to reproduce the entire article, save for the links and uselss little side box, here: <i>Annihilator is a monster truck that races on the USHRA circuit.</i> <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisplaced_Brit_130f.html" title="User:Displaced Brit">Displaced Brit</a> 00:27, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I guess. Normally I'd say to merge with Martial Law (truck) [which is its current name] but we don't seem to have such an article at the moment. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 00:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although I hate to think of it as a sport, it could be argued that "monster-trucking," similar to NASCAR, is a sport. This seems to be a truck competing at the highest national level. I would apply the same criteria to this as an athlete <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 06:22, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Unfortunately, they're right. As long as <a href="../../../u/s/h/USHRA_77a7.html" title="USHRA">USHRA</a> is notable enough to be considered a sport, then the Annihilator is just as notable as <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Wallace_dc0c.html" title="Kenny Wallace">Kenny Wallace</a>. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 06:41, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I see three keep noms which claim (or even make no claim) notability of this truck. Only <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> gives any policy/guideline reference for the keep nom, and, even there, no indication is given of how the truck meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Cursory research shows only 56 unique hits for annihilator +ushra, and none of those are multiple non-trivial articles by third parties, which would be needed to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Whether or not the USHRA is considered a sport is not a factor in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and the low number of Ghits certainly reflects as to the lack of notability. I'm wondering if the keep-noms have any other policy considerations to guide other editors? <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I am pretty new to wikipedia, from what I've seen regarding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as applied to an athlete, if they play at the highest national level and are verifiable, which this "Monster Truck" appears to do, then they tend to be included. I would hate to apply this guideline to the actual driver of the truck, simply because from my very little experience with the "sport," I don't think that anyone actually cares who drives the trucks, such as long as crap gets smashed. So, assuming that it is the truck and not the driver that is considered to be the competitor in the sport, it seems that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> can be applied, at least in regards to an athlete. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 15:37, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above discussion of how <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> applies.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above.

The name is getting a new chassis, the old chassis is running as the aforementioned Martial Law.

<dd>That is idiotic. balance does not mean equality. If there is verifable, and notable information it does not need to censored because we cannot get the same imformation for "the other side".

<dd>This is all one conflict. There is no reason that we should list every Israeli death name by name if we cannot get even nearly as close in detail for deaths from other sides. On the topic of your comparison of Chess to Scrabble, that is not comparing apples to apples—in this discussion we are talking about one conflict and the parties involved, not two conflicts. Using your game comparison is like saying the World War II article should be just as long as the Gulf War article... not a fair comparison considering we are not comparing the Arab-Israeli war to this Israel-Lebanon (Hezbollah) conflict! If you are to call my idea "idiotic" at least come up with a good analogy. ~ <a href="../../../c/a/f/User%7ECafzal_2115.html" title="User:Cafzal">clearthought</a> 19:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Every single fact is separtate. Every fact should be decided for includsion based only on wheather the fact is verifable and important. <i>Where</i> to put that fact and <i>how</i> to present it should be done in a NPOV manner. If you feel that this means making a parrell article for Lebanoneze, fine. Frankly I think that the fact that it is in a sparate article, not overwhelling Israeli fatalities of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, makes it NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 19:51, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I think Jon513 is misreading the spirit of " <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>". This means that we can cover more than a regular encyclopedia, are able to give more space to specific research threads, and cannot use size constraints as an excuse to not include material. It's not meant to say that we have to include ALL knowledge, because while we are not a <i>paper</i> encyclopedia, we are an <i>electronic</i> encyclopedia.

<dd>There is already and excellent, well debated, and continously edited page on the casulties of the conflict, which is more than enough for all combatants, and does a great job in presenting the information, in spite of course of needing a lot of work. SO the information is being covered in great detail. Instead of going around creating irrelevant, unencyclopedic memorial pages, perhaps you should go there and contribute.</dd>

<dd>This page is not a memoral page. A memoral page that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is refering to is about a person who fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> but we all feel really sad that s/he died; this article simply documents who died, it does not talk about their lives and acomplishment and the family they left behind. The article does not contain indiscriminate information, it expands on an already exsisting topic. A few editor have agreed that the article is notable, and should in theory be included, but since we can't do the same for lebanene we can't include it, because we don't want to offend lebanene sensabilities. PR is also a form of POV. NPOV means showing both sides of the story, not artifically removing information so they are equal in every way. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 23:51, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I personaly support the Iranian stance on Israel, its a illegitimate state based on terrorism and propaganda. As is evident on the current events. So much for my pov. But IN ANY CASE, this list is neither indiscriminate nor OR and verifiable. Hence, it fullfills all criteria for inclusion. Having it on the main article would unbalance it since no equivalent list exist for the other side. And yes, i would vote to keep on List of people died in wars, wikipedia is not paper. I would end this by saying a few words about the subjects of this article, but its better if i don't.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This page corroborates Israeli fatalities figures by name and place of residence. If the Lebanese want to do the same, let them do it. Can they? Like in Qana, where death toll suddenly has shrunk twicefold. It would be redundant, of course, if the world was not paying such a huge, oversized attention to this relatively small conflict, but it is. It would be better if the efforts of the world would concentrate on Rwanda (too late) and Darfur (almost too late). --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleverde_a328.html" title="User:Aleverde">Aleverde</a> 16:08, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that in the light of recent fauxtography scandals, death-pimping and death toll shrinking, one might be interested in actual lists. When the world will start paying appropriate amount of attention to the conflict, and not concentrating almost all of the attenion on it (almost exclusively to flame Israel, of course), then it will indeed become redundant.

<dd>The list could be just as, if not more, full of false claims. There are always inaccuracies in these kinds of conflicts, and I don't know what "death toll shrinking" you are referring to... I just see it going up! I also fail to see your logic; if there is an even more detailed list, there is bound to be more bad info.

<dd>Yes indeed, because of the tensions Kurdish Newroz celebrations have often turned quite political (in demanding cultural rights) - which have simply made the celebrations more notable and thus relevant to deal with in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 07:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is that a fact? Are you suggesting that every kurd is required to have a political motive in order to celebrate Newroz/Nourz (whatever)? Is it a requirement?

<dd>It is a fact that the celebrations at several occasions has been politicized, is an important expression of Kurdish culture and thus has gained quite a lot of attention. Thus it would be strange not to have an article explaining the bacground and implications of the celebration on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 08:03, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Riots are an expression of Kurdish culture? Sure it gets a lot of attention, but the average kurd I met was certainly not breaking windows, burning cars, and throwing pavement peices at local law enforcment personel. Some of those political self expression was quite violent. Newroz wasnt the only time such events have occured. If the riots/political ralleys are a part of kurdish culture feel free to write about that (with proper citation). But that has nothing to do with the spring holiday. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 08:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see any relevance of discussing riots in relation with Newroz. It is a yearly celebration, that gathers millions of participants in Turkey alone. So riots or not, I cannot see how the celebration can be deemed not notable enough for Wikipedia (even though some celebrations sadly enough have resulted in clases with the security forces). <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just like I do not see why article is relevant for political purposes. Its celebrated in millions in Iran as well as many other places just like christmas (according to the wikipedia article). Many other social gatherings in Turkey such as may holiday (workers holiday) end up with simmilar political issues as some kurdish politicians and political organisations have had frequently abused such gatherings. I do not think the political stuff, riots and clashes with the security forces are in no way relevant to the spring holiday.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jeff. Based on skimming both articles, the Kurdish version of the holiday seems significant enough to warrant a separate article.

<p>The term itself, while not a neologism, is not a real genre. It was a joke coined by the members of HORSE the Band during an interview to describe the sound of their album "The Mechanical Hand". The band themselves object to the use of the term as a genre. And even if that isn't enough, no other bands have adopted the term nor has it been properly used as a genre. A look on google will demonstrate that most hits are either tags on last.fm, which don't qualify as genres or as a reliable source for that matter, Wikipedia and many usernames. There isn't a reliable source, an article or anything that describes "Nintendocore" as a real genre nor that it actually links the bands named in this article to it. Its unsourced, unverifiable and pretty much taken out of context. Also, it's beyond me why the article is still on wikipedia, because it had already been nominated for deletion and the decision was "deleted".

<li><b>Neutral</b> On one hand, it's received several mentions in reputable print sources. On the other, it's still a very new neologism (all sources found are December 2005 and later), and it also seems that only one band actually created and used the term to describe themselves, and it's being appropriated to describe over similar bands that may or may not want anything to do with the title. It still holds a very niche status. This also doesn't deserve a speedy deletion since real world circumstances have changed. But, I'm not really sure about whether the article should stay. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 14:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let us not forget that the band that created the term, did so as a joke in an interview. And actually doesn't describe themselves as such. This "genre" is nothing more than an inside-joke that got kinda big. But anyhow, if the article is kept, I guess it sort of needs a full re-write &amp; mention of its real status and use, instead of making it seem like a real "genre". However, I guess that'd also be hard without original research. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClementduval_0657.html" title="User:Clementduval">Clementduval</a> 20:49, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is not only a stub and provides little more then a page for links, but has a few glaring other problems. Firstly, the fact that any of the violence exclusive to women, such as bride burning or sati, are covered in other articles that provide more information. Conversely, the topic of domestic violence was brought up as "predominatly suffered" by women. However, many recent studies show this to be false, and that men are more often victims of violence. With several such glaring errors, and a lack of any new and useful information other then links, is a reason why this article should simply be deleted altogether.

<li><b>Merge or Expand</b> I think there are some unique categories of violence against women, and certainly, this article could have a place. But it really needs to be expanded and researched properly. Per the nom's comments, there is a false sense that 'domestic violence' is suffered by women more, and it does strike me as a pretty glaring error. Implicit in expansion is correcting these points. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshbuddy_ab10.html" title="User:Joshbuddy">josh</a>buddy, <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshbuddy_bd2b.html" title="User talk:Joshbuddy">talk</a> 07:13, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree. <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">Violence</a> can be very well defined and restrictive in what scope the article would present as <i>Violence</i> against women. Judging by the list presented in the current article, the scope would primarily be <i>physical violence</i>, which leads itself to the potential of numerous studies and news reports as sources. In the hands of a compentant editor, those sources can give way to a clinical NPOV tone. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 08:09, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable, real phenomenon. It is good to have a central point to include all the types of such violence. The article is more than a list. The nomination is notes that men are also subject to domestic violence, but they are not subject to, say clitoris removal or to foot binding. Many societies and religions have as a basic principle subjugation of and violence toward women.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Speaking of which, I see no reason to invent new policy/guidelines when the old ones still hold. Band fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for lacking charted hits, national tours, multiple non-trivial articles by third parties. "Copious" Ghits described above are confused by a lot of sound effect notations ("beep beep"), download sites, blogs, and music sales, which is why you don't use Google as the sole arbiter for notability. Notability of their label is not to be confused with notability of the band - at best, this suggests the band should be merged with the article about the label. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not believe this is a real place. As a native of the Kapiti Coast, I have never heard of Greendale; it does not appear on any map I have or can access online (all I can find are Greendale Drive and Greendale Reserve in Otaihanga); a Google search does not give any page mentioning a village named Greendale on the Kapiti Coast; the only page (besides the Greendale disambiguation page) on Wikipedia that linked to Greendale, Kapiti was the page on Sidney Holland, who was actually born in Greendale, CANTERBURY; and most tellingly, the Land Information New Zealand website's <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/apps/placenames/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.linz.govt.nz/apps/placenames/index.html" rel="nofollow">placename database</a> states the only Greendales (a locality and a homestead) in New Zealand are in Canterbury, not on the Kapiti Coast. Therefore, due to the lack of any evidence that Greendale is a real place on the Kapiti Coast, I have nominated the article for <b>deletion</b>. <a href="../../../a/x/v/User%7EAxver_42e9.html" title="User:Axver">Axver</a> 04:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Darn it, I wish people attacking me by name would at least spell it correctly. That aside, being a non-notable website failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is no sin, but it certainly leads to an article's removal until the situation should change. And again, there is nothing wrong with having friends and family (although apparently I wouldn't know), but if people are commenting on <i>their own website</i> and , um, accidentally forget to mention this, they shouldn't be offended if this omission is pointed out for the benefit of the closing admin - <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> exists for a reason.

<dd>My point was that you used the Beta status to discredit the website, which isn't reason enough because of the Google Talk reference. Can you describe exactly how it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"beta" was merely an additional observation confirming the impression that the site was small, new, and had no evidence of notability, not an effort to "discredit" it. As for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, this seems a little backwards - are there criteria you feel it meets? I've got nothing against small websites in their millions, but i don't think I'm wrong in saying that Wikitistics comes nowhere near Wikipedia inclusion threshold, as the results here show. I'd suggest you wait until the likely Deletion closure on this, and politely ask the closing admin to explain their reasoning, and confirm with a couple of other admins that they would have handled it in the same way. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 01:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Copy that on the closing admin. About the your reasoning, perhaps it is backwards, but I've already explained its worth as a WP article and showed how other similar articles exist (above). In addition, it's unique as far as I know. I maintain that the burden of proof falls on the people that want to remove potentially viable information. I'm sure the Wikitistics inclusion threshold is as high as any other website despite its current user status. You mention that it's small (though you have "nothing against" that) and new (which doesn't seem to carry much weight), but besides that, is there anything that you find non-notable about the site so that it must be removed to save the 8k of storage space? <a href="../../../j/s/m/User%7EJsmorse47_4afa.html" title="User:Jsmorse47">Joe</a> 01:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Especially given Michael's rather odd personal borderline attack on Billy as a stalker. (It looks more like the reverse.) What's wrong with putting this on hiatus, given that Michael, even if he was acting in good faith, has completely polluted the discussion by his unexplained gutting of the article?

<li><b>Comment:</b> Those discussions I've read about AfD being a "snakepit" and a haven for incivility are dead-on true. I thought Mariju might qualify for a bio because she barely meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as I read it. I guess she'd have to be elected to truly qualify. Is anyone interested in why I wrote the article in the first place? Editcountitis, in part, although I did want to see how long it would last, to sort of see where <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> ended and began. I thought I needed to create articles, and I don't write about fiction. I prefer writing about real people. What I didn't do is stalk. A stalker would have provided personal, invasive information. A stalker would have tried to bait his subject or paint the subject in a bad light or put in slightly wrong information to invite the subject's participation. I didn't do any of that, and I surely didn't even let on how I knew her, or my identity, which is none of anyone's business. Michael Snow hasn't responded to my refutations of his stalking allegations, so I deem them baseless and inflammatory. I think he needs watched for personal attacks. I probably, honestly wouldn't have had a thing to say on this AfD if I weren't attacked. I'm going to echo <a href="../../../z/e/l/Zell_Miller_62ab.html" title="Zell Miller">Zell Miller</a>'s remarks to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Matthews_9ad7.html" title="Chris Matthews">Chris Matthews</a> with respect to Michael Snow.

Comments the film is "as notable as any other indi-arthouse type film" only begs the question, since being an indie film isn't innately notable, nor is being a non-vanity film (which I'm pretty sure is not part of WP guidelines).

<li><b>Keep</b> Some facts on Love and Suicide: 1) Kamar de los Reyes is international soap star on One Life to Live for 13 years. (2) He was one of People Magazines sexiest Latinos in 2005. (3) Kamar has been and is constantly in many national magazines, TV host shows, radios shows, etc. Hence, Kamar is a very well know actor. (4) AMC Theatres picked up Love and Suicide to screen under thier AMC Theatres SELECT program. The film is currently in it's second week in Miami and AMC committed to expanding to other theaters starting next week. - Please note: Love and Suicide beat out films by major studios competing for the screen time in AMC Theaters. (5) Love and Suicide is currently screening in it's 8th week in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That is 6 weeks more than the theater first booked it for. (6) There are several more commerical theaters as well as film festivals and film socities that had and continue to garner LS the highest ratings possible. (7) LS cast is currently booked for several interviews on television shows and radio for next week. (8) We have had many articles in many forms (newspapers, magazines, blos, newsletters, websites), included two interviews on NBC. (9) LS is the first feature narrative film to be made in Cuba by a 100% American production company, in 47 years, (per Miami Herald, NBC and The Associated Press - Havana office), we believe that in itself sets it a part from any other film made. More items could be listed. Ideally the above will offer a fair case for someone to make an equitable decision when it comes to forming an opinion on Love and Suicide. We look forward to your thoughts upon seeing Love and Suicide on the big screen.

<li><b>comment</b> - WP is also not a newspaper, nor a free webhost. This has nothing to do with the artistic merits of the film or its actors or production crew. You may want to see the WP guidelines regarding notability to see what I'm referring to. Also, I note six distinct Google hits where Youtube, Rottentomatoes and a fanpage have been given video from "bobbilou" - are you an employee of the production company? <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 01:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability is not a guideline, and there's sort of a bias in Wikipedia when it comes to big Hollywood productions versus indie-arthouse films. For every big studio movie that's released, there's an article, even though many are forgotten in the same year, and will not be remembered nor notable in 5 years time. Wiki is not paper, so I think there's no harm in keeping both articles about big studio movies that might be forgotten and movies like this. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClementduval_0657.html" title="User:Clementduval">Clementduval</a> 05:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are missing the point. We have, as with so many AFD discussions about web sites, a whole raftload of editors coming to the AFD discussion and arguing <i>nothing more</i> than "This is an important web site.". This is <i>not an argument</i>. Whether something is important to individual Wikipedia editors is not a criterion for either inclusion or deletion. It isn't an argument that is acceptable when a load of forum participants come to defend an article on their discussion forum, and it isn't acceptable here. As we regularly point out to the discussion forum participants, the way to argue for keeping the articles on their discussion fora is to cite sources and show that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are satisfied. <i>This should be easy if the web site is as notable as you claim it to be, so please do it.</i> Otherwise, the closing administrator has nothing more to go on than <i>yet another</i> AFD discussion where there is nothing more than a boatload of editors asserting "This is an important web site." and citing no sources, or indeed saying no more than that bare assertion and not basing their arguments upon our policies and guidelines. <i>Such discussions usually end in deletion</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:37, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This event is not notable enough for a separate article. In fact, it probably isn't notable at all as the publicity from it lasted for about a week.

<li><b>Delete</b> We don't need an encyclopedia article for every hiccup by every world leader. Gerald ford fell several times, even leading to regular skits about the falls by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live. That might be a better candidate. Is there an article for John Kennedy's sore back? Eisenhower's heart attack? If so there should not be. There would not in a real encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - As the article's creator you can consider me slightly biased, but it did trigger two cycles of newscoverage, effectively dominating the coverage of the G8 summit the first time, and then another flurry when the police report came out.

What about merging this into an article for all of Bush's bicycle accidents—he's had nearly a dozen, all of which get some news coverage, although this is probably the most notable, save the one at his ranch during the Sheehan thing. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 16:29, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps if Google was around back during the Ford administration, then this would be a valid argument. He is the CURRENT President, so it is no surpise that it gets a lot of hits. Do you honestly think this will be remembered in 20 years? Can you honestly say notability doesn't come in go (especially when you use Google as the measure)? <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 15:36, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. I can honestly say that for the purposes of WP, notability does not come and go. It's a shame that there was net less media back during the Ford Administration, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that we should censor present events in proportion to the increase in media coverage from notable and verifiable sources. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 18:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, if there was Google back during Fords admin, then you'd want an article on him being clumsy? This is ridiculous. We don't need a detailed account of every tiny thing the President does. You can find many news articles on every single daily activity of the President. Do we need articles for every banquet he attends, speech he gives, or jog he takes? Maybe we do because there is no shortage or verifiable sources that report on these things. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 20:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK. I look forward to your article on when he choked on a pretzel, or perhaps the medical results from his colonoscopy. It seems naive to think that only notable events get picked up by multiple news sources. Do we want articles on every flash in the pan news story?

<dd>Please put more effort into your nominations. Using AfD jargon ("nn", in particular) makes you look lazy and ill-bred, confuses new users (particularly new users who want to know why you want to delete their work), and will cause pretty girls to hate you and your car keys to go missing even though you just put them down a second ago. Far better, for your reputation, your health, and your love-life, to instead explain <i>why</i> you want something deleted in simple and polite English. A bit of detail won't go astray, either.

<li>You can't <i>violate</i> <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> (well, not without ... no, never mind). WP:CORP, WP:MUSIC, etc. are guidelines to give an indication of what sort of articles the Wikipedia community is likely to accept. If a band passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, this means the article is likely to be welcome ... however, there's no reason to keep just because it passes WP:MUSIC, or delete just because it fails. If that weren't enough, guidelines like WP:CORP and WP:MUSIC are all about <i>in</i>clusion, not <i>ex</i>clusion. We don't shop around for applicable guidelines and say, "you must pass each of these, or we'll dip you in boiling lava!" (Instead we say, "if you can pass just one portion of one of these, you'll be spared the boiling lava ... for now!"). As for the article being written by someone connected with the subject ... well, "vanity" is not and has never been a reason for deletion. It can be a reason why an article is <i>crap</i>, and that crappiness then becoming a reason for deletion, but if that's what you want to argue it would serve you well to make this explicit instead of mumbling about "violations" and "creepy aliens in my underwear" and other such nonsense.

<li>Yes, and <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is also a guideline (one that is being used to justify this article's deletion). However, I use these guidlines to clearly show other voters why I think an article should be deleted. Just because the guidlines are intended for inclusion, not exclusion, it does not mean that we can't say, "Hey, take a look at these. This article meets none of them, therfore I believe it to be un-encyclopedic, and should be deleted.". However, you are right in saying that it can't technically violate these guidline, therefore I've changed to fails.

<li>It seems pretty clear to me: Kander and Ebb are a famous songwriting duo, kinda like Gilbert and Sullivan except not as good. <i>And the World Goes 'Round</i> is one of their musicals, and it's a sort of Broadway version of the popular best-of compilation format. The show itself is notable, and while the article could certainly stand some improvement, I don't see why it needs deletion at this point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:39, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Revision notes by author</b>. Sorry, I am a bit new (two weeks old) to writing for Wikipedia, but I have added occassional sites particularly to recognize the major and important contributions of some of my coauthors, and this is one of them. My initial draft WAS more like the CV that I was referencing. You are correct to pick that up, and the immediate feedback helped. Thats one of the great things about Wikipedia, in fact. In this edition, which still needs work but I will now leave alone for a bit for the review process, I bring out the importance of the work. Sorry -- I misunderstood about the remove of the prod, thought after the first revision it could be removed. Work and learn perhaps better than no input at all. For sake of complete disclosure, Scott White is my son, but is a major figure in his own right in computer science (and industry) and the collaboration that we did was a huge contribution to the sciences and to the network field. At some point I have to do a writeup for Wikipedia on the major significance of that work. He was the one, after the initial conception, who programmed and conceptualized the formalisms behind the simulation. In a reedit it would be good to work in the contributions to industry (several were major) and fit in the educational background in a more Wikipedia-approproate way. Thanks for bearing with me through the revision. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_R._White_0f7b.html" title="User:Douglas R. White">Douglas R. White</a> 14:45, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Prod tags <i>can</i> be removed by the author; you didn't err in doing so. I just mentioned it in the nomination for deletion to be thorough. However, I'm not sure that a person who is all-but-dissertated and isn't a primary co-author on a few academic papers is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to warrant an encyclopedic entry. This is not to disparage your son or his works, but WP has standards about what constitutes a notable person and I don't think his works satisfy those conditions yet. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> 14:54, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(edit conflict) Can you provide a third party source that says that he is notable in some way? Generally people writing about themselves/people close to them is discoraged because they can be biased. It might be better if you write something on your userpage(s) and let others write the article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 14:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>One <i>can</i> write about one's relatives in Wikipedia, but there is <i>only one way to do so</i>: One must write everything based upon published third party sources, cite all of those sources right from the very first edit, and be absolutely scrupulous about not using any firsthand knowledge or unsourced information at all. If one cannot do that, <i>then one must not write</i>.

<li><b>Documentation</b> excellent discussion, without prejudice (I am new to Wikipedia so bear with me), In that light, I concur, and deleted the job-history related materials (I am working from the CV and the person being written about has no knowledge of the existence of this page. If the whole page is deleted, no problem]. By the academic criteria alone, above average level of recognition and signification of the work, being a professor myself and in a position to judge, the quality and recognition of the published contributions to computer science, mathematics, networks, open source code, and even physics, is way above that of the average college professor.--<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_R._White_0f7b.html" title="User:Douglas R. White">Douglas R. White</a> 23:05, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reviews</b> Sorry to be a pest in this way but I have now added reviews of two major articles, one in the physics journal and the other in SIAM proceedings which is a high-ranking peer reviewed publication ranking above most computer science journals, and usually reserved for high quality faculty publications (unusual in that it is a conference proceedings but having more prestige than most journals in the field). I think it would be useful at this point to find a physicist, a mathematician and/or computer scientist to review the publications for the Professor test <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Then if there is agreement and one of them wants to revise and post the page, my version, which is still not well wiki-edited can be withdrawal. But this review process is of excellent quality, as a journal editor myself, an excellent peer review process. I have no qualms if it is deleted, that is normal in academic peer reviewed submissions. I just want to follow this to the end having begun it. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_R._White_0f7b.html" title="User:Douglas R. White">Douglas R. White</a> 00:03, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A few things: was Scott ever involved with writing software to help visualize the connectivity of networks on the internet?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing: I've read the paper "Generative Model for Feedback Networks" - It's quite interesting for me to see how some of Tsallis' ideas have propagated to all sorts of topics. One concern I have is that the model is pretty new - it's cutting edge, but it would probably be better to merge that information into a separate (possibly new) article on say, the History of network modelling. As a rule of thumb, Wikipedia tends to present topics proportional to the volume of existing work that is out there describing it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One last thing: In my opinion, Wikipedia tends to lean on the side of conservativeness when it comes to notability. Yes, there are articles just like this one out there somewhere, but if we had a more efficient system of article review, they would also likely be deleted. The way this AfD is proceeding, it indicates that the community wants to have an article on a subject where the notability is more self evident. If this article were to exist on Wikipedia after this discussion, it would unlikely be developed into a more extensive article (say, like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>) simply because there is a lack of information available, beyond what has been presented already.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, another reason why this article was spotted for notability concerns to begin with, had to do with the style and approach used in the article. For example, there is a sentence that says:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>His generalization of google-type PageRank algorithms for relative importance in networks and graphs represents an important advance for algorithms that run the central processes in the information economy.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an example, in the typical <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> style of Wikipedian prose, the reader does not need to be told explicitly that algorithm X is an "important advance" - instead, the reader simply needs to be told that this person worked on generalizing PageRank algorithms for use in networks. This would be sufficient. As another example, the phrase "(a field founded by his coauthor)" suggests that the notability is conditional on that fact, which is also something to avoid. However, typically an article does not reach get to that state overnight - it usually takes months and months of revisions. I'll keep this page on my watchlist. If the article ends up being deleted, there are other things a Wikipedian can do, but I'll elaborate on this later when it's more appropriate to do so. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:10, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good questions, comments and suggestions. Pt 1: Scott wrote quite a few of the JUNG package programs that dealt with that particular question of visualization. I dont know the details tho -- to run JUNG you need to build your own Java front end (GUI) and that is beyond me. We would have to get Scott in on this (he hasnt a clue that I have tried to draft a presentation of his contributions) but if he did get involved he could explain what his contributions were.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>pt 2, on the generative models article. You have what may be a better way for me to have written up that presentation: as a history of the the model classes, from small-world to scale-free to social-circle. Could be quite interesting presented that way, and could be short as well, although others might chime in on the variants and some of the issue involved. Since the first two have their own sites and you have read the paper on the third, this could be a joint venture. Usually takes me a bit to get the kinks out when writing.</dd>

<dd>pt 3, right, the SDWhite article would unfold more slowly, but somewhere I read too that we want to pick up on work that will be developing in the future and scott's work is one of these areas. As for the relative importance sentence, yes it was bad and I rewrote it. Your NPOV point is quite correct.--<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_R._White_0f7b.html" title="User:Douglas R.

<dd>I asked about part 1, because way back, I read in a magazine somewhere, that someone managed to create a meaningful "map" of the internet in a day, and this was something which was considered unfeasible. Perhaps this was in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a> or something like that. I will have to check. Actually, this is really drifting away from what an AfD is supposed to be for - stuff like this should be relegated back to the article talk page. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 10:26, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am by no means qualified to make any type of determination as to whether his work is of Nobel quality or not. However, being <b>nominated</b> for a Nobel Prize is enough to be considered notable. Let me rephrase the above statement in that he is angry that he was not nominated for a Nobel. Every research scientists loves their work and feels that it is very important; otherwise, why do it? But the wonderful thing about science is the entire peer-review process. He could think his research is wonderful, etc. But that doesn't matter. We need to see multiple, verifiable sources say that this individual is a "Pioneer" in organic electronics. Most textbooks give a history of those scientists that played an important role in their field. A google book search shows zero quotes for "'John McGinness' + organics." If he was truly a pioneer, then he would certainly be more notable and discussed a great deal more. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 23:33, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, after the 2000 Nobel business, John was nominated for a Nobel. By pioneering Melanin researcher Roberto Nicolaus, Head of the Accademia Pontanian in Naples. If memory serves, he is ex-officio a Noble nominator.</p>
<p>Second, John is like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Carr_2f9d.html" title="Herman Carr">Herman Carr</a> and figures making a fuss about "discovery credit" is, well, tacky. But even Carr finally came foreward, not to complain about the Nobel, but about getting deprived of credit for his discovery. I'm the pushy culprit here-- for years, I watched others take credit for stuff he had originally done and bugged him to step foreward, at least a little. When people he had a patent issue with won the 2000 Noble, I finally took matters in hand. Similarly, the issue is not the Nobel, but discovery credit. How would you like to discover something really important and then see somebody else grab credit for it?</p>
<p>Second, Hush in his PNYAS history of molecular electronics specifies it well. John was too early. BTW, this is not unknown--<a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Mendel_b43a.html" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>'s work in classical genetics took 30 years to be recognized and Peyton Raus' 1910 discovery of a cancer virus in chickens waited even longer. This does not mean their discoveries were unimportant, Just too early.</p>
<p>Another major problem was Shirakawa <i>et al</i>, who came along three years later, rediscovered the high conductivity potential of the oxidized polyacetylenes and then proceeded to produce over 400 papers and patents with out a single reference to John's work. Under such circumstances, how could anybody coming later have known there was something prior to them? Also see Dulbecco's law. BTW, when I asked one of the Nobel winners about this situation and noted that we had sent them several letters, his dismissive reply was "Well, there's always history". Right about that.</p>
<p>The real problem was not missing a Nobel. As I keep being correctly reminded, that is just a matter of luck. The real issue was being completely stripped of any credit at all for an important discovery. Who gets the Nobel is a subjective judgement. However, here the 2000 Nobel citation is obviously <i>factually</i> incorrect. When I asked for a slight correction, noting our "prior art", I got the usual stony silence. The reputation for infallibility of the Nobel is more important to them than the true history of discovery.</p>
<p>More recently, my efforts have made people aware of this earlier work. Which is why you are now starting to see it referenced. BTW, if you want to see the references to Johns work, use "<a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanin.html" title="Melanin">melanin</a>" as a key word. The pigment cell people always knew about John.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>There are plenty other papers--40-50 plus, or so IIRC.. E.g., John and Retsuke Kono found that Melanin is by far the best sound-absorbing material known. (Kono, R. and McGinness, J.E.: "Anomalous Absorption and Sound in DBA Melanins". <i>J. Applied Physics,</i> 50(3): 1236-1244, 1979.}. This discovery alone ought to justify inclusion. I'll fill in the blanks if we get thru this silly deletion petition, which is part of an attack a cyberstalker is directing at me, not John.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As for the history of the device-- John was working in the Physics Department of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Texas_M._D._Anderson_Cancer_Center_0aa0.html" title="The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center">The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center</a> (which is where I got my PhD). The department had an interest in the physical properties of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanin.html" title="Melanin">Melanin</a> as a possible hook to treating <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanoma.html" title="Melanoma">melanoma</a>. At the time nobody but cancer researchers had any reason to look at the electronic properties of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyacetylene.html" title="Polyacetylene">polyacetylene</a> blacks. Otherwise, it was a complete backwater. So, they hired John, a "real' solid state physicist. Which is why, by a delicious irony, the generally-acknowledged first molecular electronic device came from a cancer hospital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The device was a "proof of concept" to see whether John's theory of electronic conduction in such materials (published in <i>Science</i> in 1972) was correct. Ironically, the Nobel winners did it the other way-- they stumbled upon high conductivity in another oxidized polyacetylene and then developed a model (pretty much the same as John's with the addition of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solitons.html" title="Solitons">solitons</a> for the special case of pure polyacetylene) to explain it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many anticancer drugs generate <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactive_oxygen_species.html" title="Reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a>. So John was also looking at that too. All "physics". In a later reincarnation, John became a psychiatrist. Midbrain melanin is thought to play a role in psychiatric disease. So he also worked with psychiatric drugs. BTW, the inventor of the personal computor also eventually became a practicising physician. I'll expand upon John's interesting story later. <a href="../../../p/p/r/User%7EPproctor_c510.html" title="User:Pproctor">Pproctor</a> 13:43, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The exact exerpt from Hush's ANYAS article reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Also in 1974 came <b>the first experimental demonstration of an operating molecular electronic device</b> <i>(emphasis-added)</i> that functions along the lines of the biopolymer conduction ideas of Szent-Gyorgi. This advance was made by <b>McGinness</b>, Corry, and Proctor57 who examined conduction through artificial and biological melanin oligomers. They observed semiconductor properties of the organic material and demonstrated strong negative differential resistance, a hallmark of modern advances in molecular electronics.58 Like many early advances, the significance of the results obtained was not fully appreciated until decades later...(p 14)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Similarly, the abstract of the review article <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1546980&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1546980&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">"The Function of Melanins"</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>" Aside from camouflage, its (<i><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanins.html" title="Melanins">melanins</a></i>) other roles can be brought together by a unifying hypothesis as first proposed by .... and '<b>McGinness</b> nearly 20 years ago."</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> likes multiple accomplishments. Remember, besides characterizing the electronic and physical properties of the melanins in these and later papers, John did two things WRT the gadget at issue. The first was to define conduction mechanisms in polyacetylene-like compounds (ref. 1). This is a large part of what Shirakawa <i>et al</i> got the Nobel for. BTW, they claim not to have seen John's previous analysis in <i>Science</i>. So these were independent developments.</p>
<p>The other was, as Hish notes, <i>"the first experimental demonstration of an operating molecular electronic device"</i>. That is, John occupies the same position in the history of organic electronics as the guys who built the first transistor. Nothing analogous showed up for a decade or two. John also got two patents for solid-state organic polymer batteries, at roughly the same time as did the Nobel winners. Interestingly, the description of the material they ended up using in their batteries is essentially identical to the one John started with in 1972.</p>
<p>Similarly, I haven't listed this yet, but John was also the first researcher to demonstrate that the toxicity of the anticancer drug <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisplatin.html" title="Cisplatin">cisplatin</a> is due to generation of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactive_oxygen_species.html" title="Reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/ROS_0566.html" title="ROS">ROS</a>, as well as the fact that the toxicity of <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriamycin.html" title="Adriamycin">adriamycin</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisplatin.html" title="Cisplatin">cisplatin</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleomycin.html" title="Bleomycin">bleomycin</a> has an important extracellular component involving <a href="../../../r/o/s/ROS_0566.html" title="ROS">ROS</a>. All avery big deals these days and by itself enough to qualify any researcher for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Similarly, John did signicant work on structured water (the basis of most MRI}, and the toxicity of certain psychiatric medications. Not bad for a solid-state physicist.</p>

<p>Don't understand your objection. John meets most, if not all of the WP:PROF criteria. To give one example among many-- As I hopefully have made clear, Dr McGinness plays essentially the same role in organic electronics (e.g.) as Shockley, Bardeen, etc. play in the invention of the transistor. That is, he built the first device. This is well-documented in a recent definitive history of organic electronics, which I cite at length. Nobody doubts it, well-established.</p>
<p>If you have any reason to question this assertion in the face of such documentation, please cite it so I can give proper credit to the real inventor of the "plastic transistor". This device is the parent of (e.g.) most color displays on cell phones. Similarly, few researchers have their work the subject of a <i>Nature</i> "News and Views" article.</p>
<p>If such does not meet the definition of "notability", it is unclear to me what does. Please list your criteria so we can discuss this issue. Also, I am not sure where you get the notion that John's work has been uncited. Please cite your sources, which are almost certainly incomplete. I suggest "Citation Index". John is cited extensively in both the pigment cell literature and the literature on the toxicity of anticancer drugs.</p>
<p>BTW, ever since defending <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Damadian_6f18.html" title="Raymond Damadian">Raymond Damadian</a>, I have been getting flack from people who seem to be anticreationists and apparently have gotten the wrong idea.

<dd>Again, this AFD only occurred because I offended certain people over on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Damadian_6f18.html" title="Raymond Damadian">Raymond Damadian</a> by defending Dr Damadian, an avowed creationist.

<dd>The tremendous irony is that I am reasonably well known in human evolutionary biology. E.g., I published a paper in the journal <i>Nature</i> on one of few known examples of classic Darwinian natural selection in human evolution-- <a href="http://www.drproctor.com/rev/ascorbicuric.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.drproctor.com/rev/ascorbicuric.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Nature</i> , vol 228, 1970, p 868 "Similar Functions of Uric Acid and Ascorbate in Man"</a>. Likewise, Dr. McGinness' work pertains to the other significant example of natural-selection in humans, skin pigmentation and latitude.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One reason I supported Dr. Damadian's claims to be one of the originators of MRI was to elevate the discussion and provide NPOV by showing that we board-certified, card-carrying "Darwinists" call things as we see them, even with creationists. Next thing you know, I am accused of vandalism and promoting "creationism"--obviously, somebody had not a clue. Similarly, my posts on other pages are getting deleted under spurious "vanity" objections and this Bio gets an RFD. Pointing this out is not "clutter" and it is quite relevant to this RFD.</dd>

<dd>Back to the subject at hand. Citing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>-- You are merely expression "opinion". Not allowed here. Do you have any cite, evidence, etc., that Dr McGinness did not do exactly as the definitive documentary evidence shows. Similarly, how can you claim with a straight face that the inventor of the "Plastic Transistor" is not "notable". If you have a new color cell phone or a color display on your car radio, you are probably looking at the ultimate descendent of Dr McGinness' device. <a href="../../../p/p/r/User%7EPproctor_c510.html" title="User:Pproctor">Pproctor</a> 14:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure of the worthyness of a page like this and infact any other oldest person in a State. Oldest in the USA or UK or Germany or any other country fair enough. Oldest in the World fine.

<li><b>Keep</b>
<p>Anyone listed in the Guinness World Records is qualified to have a short article about them.</p>
<p>*<b>Weak Keep</b> Based on the Supercentenarians category I guess there is a precendent for these articles. I just looked through a few of them and none of them seem to have done anything particularly notable other than being old. This would seem to contradict <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> so I'm not sure what to do. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 20:35, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>
<p>1. This user includes stuff that many would consider 'junk' such as some third-rate footballer league that no one outside the UK really cares about. Talk about hypocrisy. He also misspelled 'worthiness,' indicating the mindset of such a claim.</p>
<p>Ok, enough of that. Florence Homan was born Nov 18 1893. Last I checked, the UK's oldest living person, Annie Knight, was born June 6 1895. In the grand scheme of things, Florence's age is more significant and thus Florence is listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records (p. 67).</p>
<p>Also, we see that people other than myself have created articles on 'supercentenarians' aged a mere 110 or 111 years old, such as 'Vermont's oldest person.' Thus, like the debate about whether Pluto is a planet, the bar has been set much lower than this.</p>
<p>Also, User JImmmmmmmm seems to be disrespectful of the USA...we've seen 'oldest in Scotland,' is that just one country or a division? Ohio has 11 million plus persons, more than Ireland and Scotland combined. <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 20:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did say other page of this nature. Scotland is a country in it's own right so there for you could argue that is a record that is notable for mention on here. Secondly I don't have anything against Americans just over American bias on here. You comment about footballers is exactly what I feel about seeing the same page about no mark American footballers, but I never complained about them, just the inclusion of things like national American sports champion in the news section.
<p>Back to this page. What is here inclusion in the Guiness book of Records for? Maybe you could elaborate on the page about it. The age of here compared to the oldest person in the UK doesn't matter. The UK is a country Ohio and Vermont are states. London has 6m people would you start an article on the oldest person in London, no because it's pointless. If she isn't the oldest in America I'm not sure what her achievement is. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmmmmmmmm_676d.html" title="User:Jimmmmmmmmm">Jimmmmmmmmm</a> 20:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> So now we get down to the REAL issue, User Jimmmm's view of the world sees the USA as one great, giant monolith (no need to know about individual states) while 'Scotland is a country' (even though it's really a subdivision of the UK, which is a country). In fact, I employ relative weights even among the US. Ohio has 11.5 million people, and is one of the most important U.S. states (remember, Ohio decided the 2004 presidential election; no Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio).→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 21:44, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So now everyone in Ohio is more important that everyone in Scotland. How many times have Ohio played at the world cup then or been represnted at the olympics? Can I have a seat on the parliment of Ohio then please, oh no it doesn't have one does it. It is just a state a part of a country no matter how big it is. There are areas of Russia larger than Ohio and how about all the Aussie states? Will they get this treatment? Of course not. Because Ohio's votes decided the Election that makes it important. Remind me next time then if Maine decides it we'll have the oldest person in Maine article. Or next time the Isle of Wight decides the UK election we'll have the same again. Madness. Ohio my have a lot of article due to it's size and population but being Ohio oldest person is still not Worldly notable achievement. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmmmmmmmm_676d.html" title="User:Jimmmmmmmmm">Jimmmmmmmmm</a> 22:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> as per User:Bjf22898. Isn't the Internet THE place to go for all sorts of information? What is the big deal if it is a subdivision of a country or not?

<li><b>Comment</b>. You are WRONG there. This is NOT an 'indiscriminate collection' of information. It's a collection that's been organized, tested, sifted, and weeded out. You don't see us adding every 109th birthday story that comes along. <a href="http://www.crescent-news.com/index.php?tD=05192006" class="external free" title="http://www.crescent-news.com/index.php?tD=05192006" rel="nofollow">http://www.crescent-news.com/index.php?tD=05192006</a>
<p>I don't even add every 110th birthday story. But I think if someone is the world's 12th-oldest person, they deserve at least a paragraph or two. People in the future will ask 'whatever happened to so-and-so' when they read the 2007 Guinness Book. It's a good idea to have the answer. Plus, just maybe we can educate the public a little. If they realize that a 'few' people make it to this age, they might start to understand what the maximum human life span is (122...not 100, not 140).→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:16, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, now to argument two. Florence Homan was ranked as one of the 'top 15' oldest persons in the world, not just U.S. state. Germany, 82 million persons, has as its oldest person Irmgard von Stephani, born Sept 20 1895...almost two years younger. So, yes, age 112 years 268 days does count for something. We've seen newspaper articles on Meta Buehrer, Toledo's oldest person (died at 109) and Herman Phillips, oldest in Canton, Ohio (died at 109, May 2006). No one ran out to do a 'county-level' article. And the truth is, we can't do Uttar Pradesh because India doesn't have the records for it. In effect, complete records exist for some nations (Japan 100%), partial and incomplete for others (USA) and some nations, no records. Thus, there isn't a whole lot to worry about 'Uttar Pradesh's oldest person.' But in theory, if you have the records, you can apply (even from South America). So that's why we have Maria Capovilla, 116, world's oldest person.
<p>The current number of supercentenarian articles on Wikipedia is 118, far less than the number of football or baseball players. If we're going to have Wikipedia information on every city and town in America, surely we could do the 'oldest out of 11.5 million people.' Sheesh. This lady was an adult when the Titanic sank. She was older than London's Tower Bridge. Not a single person left in the UK is 112.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 04:12, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Whatever you're going to categorize her for, categorize everyone in the category. If you classfied her as a 112 year-old, include all 112-year olds.

<p><b>Comment</b> (Consider this not just about Florence Homan but about articles on persons famous for age).</p>
<p>I categorized Florence Homan as a 'supercentenarian' (persons aged 110+). My general policy is to give every verified person an article who reaches 112.5 (halfway between 112 and 115). Why? Consider the current 'top 10' oldest people, the 9th and 10th-oldest are 112 (but closer to 113). To be more specific, Florence Homan was 112.73 years old.</p>
<p>News-worthiness is also decided by a number of other non-numerical factors, including a person's history, family, and personality. Clearly, this woman had no remaining family and so got only weak media coverage, while someone like Virginia Muise (aged 111), more than a year younger as 'New Hampshire's oldest person,' got multi-state news coverage. In fairness, Florence deserved more. In another state, it was claimed that Olive Dubay, 110, was Michigan's oldest person:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petoskeynews.com/articles/2006/08/11/news/local_regional/n" class="external free" title="http://www.petoskeynews.com/articles/2006/08/11/news/local_regional/n" rel="nofollow">http://www.petoskeynews.com/articles/2006/08/11/news/local_regional/n</a> ews01.txt</p>
<p>But I didn't do an article on her. At the time, she ranked 58th-oldest in the world. So, while I think this article clearly should stay (and the 'keep' is winning), a real question should not be whether to keep this but what standards should be employed.</p>
<p>I totally disagree with User Jimmm's comments. I wasn't saying that Ohioans were more important than Scots because they were superior or better. I was saying that, given the population of Ohio is over twice that of Scotland, and given Ohio's economic and political strength, it is unwise to simply dismiss a US state. The US is a Federal, not unitary, system. In Russia, governors are often selected by Vladimir Putin. Subdivisions are often just a matter of geographic convenience. Most recognize that, traditionally, national subdivisions of the USA, Canada, and Australia are shown on the map. Anglo-centric? Perhaps. But that's what map-makers do.</p>
<p>As for Florence and Australia, she was in fact older than anyone in Australia at the time (by more than a year). Jimm's comments are like saying the USA can't have the bronze medal because they have the silver. Look at the U.S. Congress. The big state/small state compromise let equal represenation in the Senate, proportional representation in the House. Clearly, it's a split-the difference solution, but each side gave some ground. The bottom line: there is something to be said that '5th-oldest of country X' may not sound like a lot, but look at the other side. The USA is #1 in the world in the 110+ population. Giving the USA more articles thus serves as somewhat proportional representation to reflect this reality. At the same time, no one did an article on Olive Dubay, even though she was older than Switzerland's oldest person (someone did an article on that one). So, like the big state/small state compromise, I believe there is a sensible line here. We are giving the USA a few more articles than 'one country, one article' but in reality, the USA is not getting its due. If anything, the INORDINATE number of British/UK centenarian and supercentenarian articles betray a UK bias. We see among 'Surviving Veterans of WWI' that far more UK soldiers have an article, even if their age were younger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, check out Americans, Italians, Germans, Poles, etc without articles.</p>

Russell 1898 1 September American USA-Army Resides in Ohio</p>
<p>So, 'oldcruft' is OK for the UK, even when not the oldest living veteran, while non-UK veterans get ignored, even if they are older?</p>

<p>Look at the other lists. Italy NO articles, France 13%, Germany 11%, USA 39% coverage, UK 71% (5 of 7) coverage. Clearly, the UK is getting more than its fair share.</p>
<p>But, you might say, that's because the UK Wikipedians have taken the initiative to do more articles. The same might be said for the USA. If you want to start deleting articles, do we really need to know who is a 105-year-old non-combat WWI veteran? And if yes, why not for all the nations, not just one? 68.219.137.224 14:20, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One comment from Jimmm...about Ohio not having a 'parliament'...is totally ridiculous. The USA has a Congress, and Ohio DOES have a legislature. Wow. It's amazing how little people really know about places outside their area.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the collapse of ICG cost stakeholders 100s of millions if not billions. This was a key bankruptcy of the internet era and there was some issue over investors reaction to it (no citation comes to mind). I remember meeting him surrounded by young acolytes who couldn't get enough of his vision.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> On further research, I question whether this article was written by a blood relative (ackabryan), which may explain the public relations tone. I agree that the ICG collapse was notable, though for sake of precedence, have other failed telecom CEOs (other than Ebbers) been given a Wiki entry? Last, though Millicom did provide cellular service to developing countries, they were in fact a pager network provider. The Bells and overseas PTTs were the cellular service pioneers, for better or worse.</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> If its the same Millicom I'm thinking of, its still extant; it is indeed one of the largest international wireless operators. Just because the article is banal does not mean there should not be an article on this man. I was there. The billions lost - peoples' entire nest eggs wiped out. This wasn't just a small start-up. It was one of the big ones. And it should be remembered lest we forget our folly at the time. Just because some others have not had a write up doesn't make it less relevant that his biography should stand. There are plenty of wikipedia articles yet to be written...</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I am sorry that you were at a company managed by Shelby Bryan. I never implied that Millicom or ICG were minor failures, rather I mentioned that I wasn't aware of other less-than-notorious telecom CEOs making it to Wikipedia. Millicom was already a wireless player, having made their first cellular license applications a good 2 to 3 years prior to Shelby's arrival. During his tenure, most of their revenue was derived from being a pager network provider. He left Millicom in rather shaky financial condition, though they have since survived after a restructuring under new management. Thus the failure of ICG was presaged by a smaller scale disaster at Millicom. If you advocate having this article survive deletion, then you are implicitly stating that it should serve as a dispassionate cautionary tale. This entails a major rewrite, as the current article falls short of that goal.</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. Seems to be notable enough. If the ICG collapse was elaborated, it would be more interesting and unbiased. Downplaying the collapse as "in part to be the result of Bryan's overspending" is clearly NPOV by omission.

Listing major accomplishments, major awards won, widely cited papers, or other highly notable accomplishments from outside sources might make this notable, but if the subject himself couldn't bring himself to list things like that (since autobiographies do have the strong tendancy to be self-aggrandizing), it doesn't seem likely that they would exist. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 00:11, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pardon? I just don't think it merits an article, and gave some reasons why. The first link on the list you provide pretty much shoots down the entire article as it currently stands.

<li>I would add that even reading more than I should have on the subject, Missouri does not come off as a "bellwether."

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> depends on whether it is all the work of the author in question, not whether or not the works cited are from <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>. I can see the argument for POV being made here, but the <i>USA Today</i> link does something to to counter these arguments. This article merely cites a well known (and frequently cited) phenomenon, who said it and why. It doesn't then draw the POV conclusion that this should then hold in the future. I'm not saying Missouri is a bellwether or not, I honestly don't care, but there are a lot of people out there who are saying that it is. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 00:32, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree completely, but the notability (in this case) does not result from its scientific rigor (however much we might like it to).

<li>Anyone familiar with my work would know that I do not believe that a cruise missile hit the Pentagon! No Boeing 757 hit the building, but a smaller plane--possibly an A-3 Sky Warrior--may have fired a missile just before it impacted. I find it just a bit much that false reasons, which are easily refuted, are being offered to keep me out of this publication. Something is not right. PLUS I am not a "college professor". I am Distinguished McKnight University Professor Emeritus, which I earned. This is a considerable distinction that someone has repeatedly edited off the page.

<li>I can asssure you that this is James H. Fetzer. I have taken Wikipedia at its word as having a commitment to accuracy. In the past I tried to correct and improve the entry on Scholars for 9/11 Truth, only to have my edits repeatedly rebuffed. Yet who in the world should be better positioned to insure the accuracy of that entry than its founder? Now I discover that someone is offering distorted representations about who I am in order to sabotage my own entry by trivializing my rank as though I were just another "college professor" and by attributing positions to me that I do not hold! I have published 27 books! Anyone who wants to know what I think about the Pentagon can go to st911.org and read "Thinking about 'Conspiracy Theories': 9/11 and JFK"! I have also added several references. Someone may be abusing his position, but I appreciate that most of you are giving me a fair shake. user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> As with the recent AFD on Scholars for 9/11 truth, Fetzer is indeed a notable person. This is ridiculous. <a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyesAllMine_b74b.html" title="User:EyesAllMine">EyesAllMine</a> 16:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not only is this ridiculous but someone, whom I suspect is Morton Devonshire, keeps changing my permanent rank as Distinguished McKnight University Professor Emeritus to something else. I am no longer Distinguished McKnight University Professor, but I am Distinguished McKnight Univerisity Professor Emeritus, as my official UMD academic web site states. So why is this person, who is Morton, if I am right, trying repeatedly to trivialize my status? And why did he create this bogus issue in the first place? It is apparent to me that there is a corrosive force at work here that is not interested in truth or accuracy but rather in minimizing the influence of those of us who are bringing the truth about 9/11 to the American people. Something is very wrong at Wikipedia! user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>

<dd>Yes, I nominated the article for Afd. No, I have not been changing your titles. Yes, there is a corrosive force at work on Wikipedia, and that's people trying to use it to soapbox their views -- Wikipedia is not a place of first publication, its role is to gather other information from reliable sources (and that doesn't include blogs and other self-published sources), and deliver it in a neutral manner. That means no advocacy of theories or ideas, just straight reporting of facts. Many of your supporters come here to advocate, and that's just not allowed on Wikipedia.

<li>For some reason, someone is putting a "reference (2)" to "Professors of Paranoia" after the list of institutions at which I have taught as opposed to later in the article when there is mention of my (allegedly) having called for a military coup. At this point in time, I have corrected it repeatedly, only to find it restored again and again. IT HAS NO APPROPRIATE FUNCTION AS A REFERENCE WHERE IT IS BEING IMPOSED. I cannot believe that Wikipedia personnel are this incompetent (since it does not belong where it has been repeatedly restored). I therefore infer that it is a deliberate attempt to perform a subtle smear. Check it out for yourself, but my confidence in the integrity of Wikipedia is being shaken for the third or fourth time based upon my own personal experience. Whoever is responsible for this corrupt act ought to be censured or replaced. It is entirely uncalled for. user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>

Articles of a biographical nature are held to a special standard. If you feel that any bias exists, place a posting to this mail list--it is read by the literal "management" of Wikipedia, including it's founder, and will draw significant attention to any situation of bias or impropriety. Beyond that, the major rule is that articles have to NPOV, or non point of view--neutral. That is, "positive" and "negative" info can be included, so long as it is factual, accurate, and meets a long list of special inclusion criteria. ANYTHING of a negative nature, including ANY criticism, must be sourced and factually cited by a very vigorous standard, or else it WILL be removed per policy. If you have any additional concerns the Wikimedia Foundation, who runs the show, can be contacted if you need to at <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us" rel="nofollow">wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us</a>.

<li>Thanks for helping me out. Contrary to the insinuation that I do not want references, I have added several to this entry; but I find the one to which I take exception is out of place. (It already appears as the citation for the final sentence.) Those of us who become deeply involved in these matters sometimes become overly sensitive about these things, because we are subject to so many unjustifiable attacks from politically motivated sources. I did not originate this entry but, once I discovered it, I have made an effort to improve its accuracy. I have made no effort to change any criticisms of me that were originally there, by the way, which tracing the history of this entry would confirm. The reasons for proposing its deletion--"not notable", "believes that a cruise missile hit the Pentagon", "doesn't want references"--are easily proven false. My apologies if I have offended anyone. If you are serious, then these objections should not be taken seriously. I just have higher expectations of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fetzer_f57b.html" title="Jim Fetzer">Jim Fetzer</a> P.S.

<li><b>Improve</b>Maybe I misunderstood, but Wikipedia is, among others, an on-line encyclopedia? Does the size of a company matter for deciding if a fact is mentioned in an encyclopedia? Under Informix mention is made of SmartWare, which has been a product of theirs, but no explanation has been provided as to what it is. So I thought lets provide one so people can learn about that fact. I can't help others mis-use the name. Han van Heerde 06:39, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The text as displayed now also mentions a book called Tips, tricks and traps. It is a whole book covering SmartWare. Does that satisfy the "Software is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, user guides, television documentaries, and full-length magazine reviews."?

<p>I am nominating this article for deletion. Most of listed names are not sourced and listing them does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Jimbo has said that calling someone a "porn star" without providing a source is something that should be removed from Wikipedia articles. Everyone who should be on a list like this and meets the sourcing rules for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for living persons should be listed in the gay porn stars category which already has many more verified names than this list. WP doesn't need two different lists on the same subject (even if one is called a category). The category is better.

<dd>Creating stubs isn't the solution, either; they get deleted before they have a chance to be developed.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with this argument is simple. To fix the policy violations we have to remove all the names that aren't verified by the list's article. Right now that's all the names if you read the policy strictly. If you read the policy in a looser way, the blue-linked names can be kept because the articles should be verified. But that leaves a list that's either the same as the category, or it has even fewer names. If we fix the list to meet the WP:BIO policy it's redundant with the category. If we're not going to fix the list, the article can't stay. So either way it should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 22:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What exactly would "fix" the list? The list explicitly defines who is listed: "male pornographic actors who appear in gay films". The header goes on to say that no claim is being made about the sexual orientation of anyone on the list. If the actor is listed in the cast of a movie and has sex with another man in that movie, he qualifies for the list. Cast lists are available at the links that are provided in the "See also" section of the page. I've copied two of the sites that were listed on the talk page to this section. Some of the sites allow you to search by an actor's name and retrieve a list of films that he is in; a commercial site may only list films that they have in stock. (tlavideo also lists films that are not available.)

<dd>Because the names must be individually sourced. Just listing outside sites and saying "look him up there" isn't good enough. Jimbo Wales has said solid sourcing for claiming somebody is a porn star (gay or straight) is "absolutely imperative." That's why I say WP should <b>keep the category</b> and <b>delete the list</b>. The category names are supposed to be verified already since they're in articles. All those unlinked names in the list aren't WP:verified -- they need specific, reliable citations. At least one of those outside sites is useless -- it just gives a not-alphabetized list of names. (All the As are together, but not in order, etc.) Another links to semispam sites with no way of proving that the names match the pictures. I get spam all the time about porn with Jennifer Lopez, Allysa Milano, etc. The pages are there, the porn pix are there -- but the pictures aren't JLo or Milano. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 18:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I don't know about all this. It seems that both sides are spamming to me. But I don't think that any rules are being broken and don't see what would be gained from deletion. Honestly, Wiki lists porn stars -- many of which are pretty obscure, too. Whatever. Don't like a show, change the channel. Don't like a web site, don't read it.</p>
<p>I don't recall reading anything on Wiki that stated that I couldn't invite my friends to partipate in discussions. I have many contributions over the past year to Wiki (I am no where near a single user account) -- a large portion were the articles mentioned on the AFD, but I have also contributed to content regarding Florida history, theme parks, automobiles, video games, heavy trucks and other topics I am familar with. I will make any changes that are suggested. But so far, no suggestions have been made. I will break it down: A. These Pages meet Wiki's Reliable Sources: I have cited several newspaper articles (New York Times/Orlando Business Journal/Central Florida Future) confirm the info. B. Wiki's Non-Notable Subject: the Subject is also listed on many other entertainment web sites. C. "Delete per well documented nom" - Not a single user has once tried to rebute any of the facts I have listed. DodgeM4S</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Thank you for pointing out the SPAM policy and I just re-read it-- but inviting friends and local newsgroup readers does not appear to violate the Wiki policy in any way. I think this debate is definitely useful -- and I'm looking to improve the quality of all the content I have submitted, not just the ones listed in the APD. Another contribution I made to a theme park was deemed a little too POV/opinionated -- so I fixed it. All I ask is you make constructive suggestions that I can use to remedy any of the content. I've put a lot of effort in all the content submitted -- and think it has made wikipedia a more complete source of information.... which has been my goal all along. I do wish I registered earlier, as I had made many earlier contributions as anonymous -- that is the reason my credited contributions seem lopsided. But I've been a contributor for about a year and a half now. By any chance, Is there a concensus of what exactly needs fixing? I'd be happy make these corrections. -DodgeM4S
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No, there isn't any policy against inviting friends and coworkers -- they'll just be more likely ignored per the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">Wikipedia:Single purpose account</a> guideline by the administrator making the final decision. So far I've only seen one source that passes the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:Reliable source</a> test, the Orlando Business Journal and if you provide at least two more article in the same vein, I'd be willing to change my vote altogether. I don't count the New York Times and VH1 links because they're not articles but movie synopsises that can be self-submitted to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Movie_Guide_b038.html" title="All Movie Guide">All Movie Guide</a>. Look, come back in a year or two's time and recreate the article if Dunn produces a film that wins a major film festival award or is distributed nation-wide. My philosophy when it comes to notability is that one is only truly notable when other people are writing about them, not when they write about themselves or have their coworkers or friends do it for them. We have to take a hard-line stance on notability because everything in an encyclopedia has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. For example, how could any reader ever determine if Dunn really "owns a collection of performance cars and classic automobiles"? How can I accept that anything written in the Trivia section is true or made up? I can't -- because no 3rd parties are constantly providing new information that we can use to scrutinise the article's contents with. We have to take your word alone -- and that's simply unacceptable in an encyclopedia. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 18:56, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps you could userfy the article -- get it out of the Wikipedia namespace -- and keep it as a user page until you get it up to snuff. That would stop the single purpose account people, because as <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">User:Netsnipe</a> says, they will be discounted anyway and the fact your article draws that type to vote ends up making your article look bad rather than helping. <a href="../../../g/b/y/User%7EGBYork_974d.html" title="User:GBYork">GBYork</a> 19:19, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> userfy is Wikipedia slang for moving an article to userspace (which means it's no longer an article in an encyclopedia, but a personal page / article in progress). To do so, copy and paste the original article into a new page called User:Dodgem4s/<i>original_article_name</i>. This means that even if this article is deleted, you can still continue to work on it and when you believe that the article will pass a future AFD review, you are free to move it back into the encyclopedia proper. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 19:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well if its more newspaper sources you need -- that really isn't a problem. They just aren't online any more (most newspapers delete their content after a few months). But I've saved lots of newspaper articles regarding the local film industry. I'm going to UCF to join the film school, but I just a sophomore still (not in the film school yet). I'd be happy to photocopy any of them and mail them to any of the editors. I've been collecting news clipping since 1998 when the Blair Witch Project came out. I've got a ton of stuff on local feature films like Blair Witch, Flora Plum, The Bros., Jurrassic Park III, Alone and Restless, Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector, Olive Juice, etc. I've also got articles for the TV shows: Carpocolypse, Sheena, From Earth to the Moon and the Pet Psychic. I know I've got at least 2 articles on Alone and Restless, I think I got one on Black Zone, too. I can Userfy if necessary -- but it would be a lot of work to Userfy all the submissions that are flagged. Which ones would I need to userfy and which ones already meet Wiki guidelines? As for the trivia section -- its almost all cut and pasted off of IMDb. The bio, I cut and pasted off the official site. Perhaps I should cut and paste the content to another Wiki article I've been working on <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a>. Suggestions????? <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>
<p>I would like to point out that WP: VAIN states this: "an article about a little-known musician or band should preferably not be by the musician, a member, or a manager, roadie, groupie, etc. Articles on very little-known subjects are often of debatable value for our readers, so if you write a new article on one it is particularly important to express the facts in a neutral way and as much as possible to cite sources that are credible, neutral, and independent." <b>This policy does not expressly prohibit content on subjects that are considered little-known -- and how many "indie" filmmakers are considered well-known? I think his occupation puts him at a unfair disadvantage. But as per wiki guidelines, even if he is deemed little-known by an administrator that still does not prohibit the content of the above articles</b> The articles are very credible, neutral and independent. ...and any passages to the contrary I would be happy to delete. <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>
<p>I would also like to argue on the grounds WP: PORN BIO -- Why is it so much more difficult for an independent film maker to be considered relavent to Wikipedia than a porn star? Does a Porn Star need 3-4 third party newspaper interviews (since movie synopsis don't count) to be deemed notable and how many porn stars actually have been flagged for the lack of these newspaper articles? <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>

<p>A decision was recently made to delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_law_firms.html" title="List of law firms">List of law firms</a> (see discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_law_firms_%282nd_nomination%29_f718.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of law firms (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of law firms (2nd nomination)</a>), and it seems that the logical next step is to consider for deletion each of the sub-lists that were created under that article, including this. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 07:59, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> For all the reasons set out in the discussion relation to deletion of the primary list - it serves no purpose that is not already covered by <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_law_firms_52a5.html" title="Category:United States law firms">Category:United States law firms</a>, and it is just an invitation for lawyers to spam. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 08:01, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Lists can surpass a category by having information about the firms. The largest subsection does, however it really is not that useful. The spam target issue is more of a concern to me than the minimal information about size of firms. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:01, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because there is no uniform definition of what a "law firm" is. Does a law school grad who hangs out a shingle his/her own "law firm". Do 2 people who set up a law practice together constitute a "law firm". If we had a list like the UK one below where these are listed by size, we would get rid of the problem. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
