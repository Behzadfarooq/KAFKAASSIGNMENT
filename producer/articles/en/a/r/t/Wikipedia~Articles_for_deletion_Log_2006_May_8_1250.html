<li><b>Question and comment</b>-- If we delete it now, can someone recreate the article after the subject does become notable? For now, it would be best to try to work the information into <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_Hill_%28film%29_5e31.html" title="Silent Hill (film)">Silent Hill (film)</a>. The article does sound like it’s pushing the film, so it needs some NPOV work. IF the soundtrack is as wonderful as the article says, the subject will be notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. That is a big “IF”.

If this were for the released soundtrack of the movie, I would say keep, but since this comprises unrealeased music that just appears in the film this seems to be an unnecessary fork from the film article.

If you're complaining that this needs to be deleted then you obviously have nothing better to do other than complain. It's simply a list of the songs that are on the film's soundtrack. It's highly-doubtful that an actual soundtrack will be released and if one were to be released, it would be because of the fans speaking up. This article would probably help to get fans to create their own soundtracks with the albums they do have. I think this article is informative and serves as a guide to the music of the film. Please come up with a viable reason for deleting this, <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a>. -Fever_Chill</li>

<dd>Woah. I never knew I was going to create such a firestorm. My main point is that as it stands the article provides nothing to the wikipedia project that isn't present in a manual already and is far too focused and technical on this one topic. We're an encyclopedia here, not a guide for those who want to play C&amp;C generals. It is a fine game, but as it stands the article is too far gone for saving. Perhaps a better idea would be to revise it to point how all of the GLA structures are different from the other sides, but as of now it's simply a laundry list of buildings with no attempt to point out how this is notable. To TomStar: Would it be an amicable solution to simply combine all of the structures lists into one page and simply point out the basic differences between the structures/how they affect strategy? I think this would solve most problems with a manual and better preserve the thrust of the "Structures of the *blank*" pages --<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakhim_a991.html" title="User:Lakhim">Lakhim</a> 23:35, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, we can merge the pages togather. I have no beef about rearranging the pages in that manner, so long as the important information is preserved. When we chose to design the pages in this manner it was with the intent that they be flexiable to adopt to wikipedia's standards and practices. This option would be vastly prefered over the mass deletion of relevant material. I would invite you to add comments and suggestions about the layout of the articles on my talk page or any of the other talk pages for users who, like me, have been involved in this overhaul from the start. Your input would be apreciated so that we can avoid these problems from the start, rather than raise a hornets nest of fury over them later. It saves everyone time and grief. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 01:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Note to administrators</b>: Some delete votes prior to 9 may 2006 may not be reflective of a vote on the compromise reached between myself and Tomstar/the GLA editors.

<dd>Please allow me to explain. This was part of a much broader overhaul that the six of us agreed to. I have been creating the new templates and associated pages, and they have been helping to clean up the spelling, fix the grammar, check the facts, and so forth. Given that the six of us have put so much work into the article(s) it seems only fair that they be alerted to this sudden development. If you wish to prove this you can check the talk pages and histories of the users I have contacted; all have had a big role in this new design. I am not out to inflate the vote in my favor, and I understand fully that in the end all articles are subject to community consensus. If I have gone against a policy or rule by alerting these six users than I sincerly apologise, and as per the law of equivilent exchange I will accept whatever punishment the community deems nessicary. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 08:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is not a video game guide, this is a valid page listing units that appear in a video game, much the same as one would list characters from a TV show or list songs sung by an artist in a certain year. Furthermore, if this page is deleted then what will happen is that all of these units will end up with individual pages, creating a massive train wreck that no one wants to see. I will also point out that many of these articles are in the process of being polished up by the community at the moment, and that this design layout was felt to work best for the presentation of relevant information involving the Command &amp; Conquer series of games.

<li><b>Keep.</b> While it is true that Wikipedia is not a game guide, it contains a tremendous amount of information about a tremendous number of video games (not just Pokemon). This article does a good job of describing elements of a game with which I have no familiarity. Having read the article, I understand the game better, but I would still need to read the guidebook before playing. Not that I would probably want to &lt;grin&gt;. It does not go on to provide gaming tips or instructions for play. While it is currently true that aficionados of the game probably already have this information, Wikipedia acts as a handy reference for people who might want information about a subject they are not familiar with. The article could conceivably survive the subject. Years from now, someone might need the article for information about <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_time_strategy.html" title="Real time strategy">real time strategy</a> PC games and be thrilled to find this article.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikereichold_c414.html" title="User:Mikereichold">User:Mikereichold</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikereichold_4634.html" title="User talk:Mikereichold">User_talk:Mikereichold</a> 14:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Rewrite so it's less of a guide and more a factual presentation of the structures as per Knucmo2 above.

<li>I think what you're referring to as "precedent" is more accurately described as "gamers made a bunch of video game guides on Wikipedia that no one has nominated yet." I'll nominate one of the MegaMan articles to see what consensus is, but I'm worried that, as has happened with this one, the video game subculture here at Wikipedia will see the AfD and will pour into the debate in defense of the article. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 18:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what? That is the very definition of consensus. If you nominate an article, and fail to build consensus, then the community has spoken for the article. Any time I see an article like this tagged for deletion, it never fails that I encounter this "I don't like the topic" or "I consider the topic sophomoric" and therefore it must be deleted attitude. Also, I will admit that "ownership" is a problem here, but I know from experience that any time someone writes or contributes to an article, they are going feel the urge to defend it, and I certainly don't begrudge them that. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 19:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The term "video game subculture" seems to be used in way to convey a pejorative association, but it just means there are a lot of people interested in this subject. I feel there is prejudice against these people, but from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> it's just an observable phenomenon like any other. We have an article on an underarm deodorant on the basis that it is of significance to a lot of people that use it. This is the people's encyclopedia, not the intellectuals, nor the "cultured" person. Let's be generous and inclusive in what we accommodate. Otherwise it is a form of censorship on the basis of taste. I have minimal interest in these games myself, but I think in society now it is the people who appreciate the arts (of whom I am one) who are the subculture, while video gamers and suchlike are the mainstream. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:57, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - So what if its a game? Just because I don't like something doesn't mean I don't start a crusade to wipe it off the website. I go through literally HUNDREDS of pages on here that other users might find useless. If this page gets the boot, it sets the stage for anything else related to gaming, because the same argument could be made that "this is not a gaming site". While I agree this is NOT a gaming site, this is legitimate information. It may require editing, but not full-blown deletion. Lemme list a few other game pages on here overflowing with info: Halo, Warcraft 1-3 + WOW (which has its own Wiki I hear), Diablo 2, the C&amp;C Universe, Doom-series. I won't even START on how the entire genre of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanimation.html" title="Japanimation">Japanimation</a> should be removed.

<ul>
<li>Yes, so what if it sets the stage? Maybe it should. Just because non-notable articles have been piling up doesn't mean they aren't in violation of policy. I am not on a "crusade," you would do well to read the notice on the AfD page which says "please don't take offense" just because it was nominated for deletion. Personally, it doesn't matter to me one way or another whether this page is deleted. If the community decides that this is a legitimate article and doesn't violate policy, it doesn't bother me one bit. But you are judging the validity of this article based on the sheer quantity of articles similar to it rather then whether or not it is actually in violation of Wikipedia policy. If there are other articles that need be deleted, they will be dealt with in time. The "argument from quanity" doesn't fly, however. ... As for "crying to Admins", I think it is useful for them to know when someone is going around posting "deletion emergency" to the talk pages of people likely to be sympathetic to his cause, basically an effort to "stuff the ballot box" so to speak. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 21:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aplomado, the deletion notice you posted clearly states, and I quote:<i>"please note that the deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors"</i>. A consensus can not be reached unless people on both sides of the issue are informed of such actions. As for your accusation regarding the so called "stuffing of the ballot box", I never asked the six Users I posted my message to to vote "keep", that is a disicion they will make of thier own free accord. Furthermore, I find your failure to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> in this matter very disturbing. A notable user such as your self should know that assuming good faith is a policy here, and it goes hand in hand with our policy of <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">being bold</a> in updating articles. Lastly, It specifically says on the AFD page not to nominate articles recently created. If you will allow us some time we can expand the articles to include artistic designers, real life inspirations and so on. Lastly, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real-time_strategy.html" title="Real-time strategy">real-time strategy</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn-based_strategy.html" title="Turn-based strategy">turn-based strategy</a> games are somewhat different from the game articles on here beacuse the units and structures of such games are an intimate part of the games.

<li>I would agree, but I think that it can be solved with a gradual phasing out of these pages rather then an AfD at the moment.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Those arguing for deletion seem to have few guidelines to cite, and there does appear to be precdent for this sort of article.

If it can be rewritten to describe the game in a way that explains it to a non-gamer like, and if it can assert notability, then it would have a place here.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I propose the following solution: We allow one month for the C&amp;C community to see if they can transform the pages listed on the template Command &amp; Conquer: Generals into something more befitting an encyclopedia article. If after one month the articles show little or no improvement then a discussion should be opened as to whether the articles have reached a state where mass merging would be a vaible option. Alternatively, if the articles listed on the pages show little or no improvement from their current state then we can open a discussion focused either on transfereing them to a wiki better suited for the information presented or simply have them deleted. I would also note that this AFD has opened a serious discussion in to what exactly constitutes a "game manual" here on wikipedia. I think that some sort of consensus must be reached so that future AFDs that cite a game manual layout as the primary cause for deletion can reinforce this claim by having an accepted definition of the term as it applies here. Unless we have a game manual definition to look to other editers will argue the same points that I have raised here, and the cycle of what gets deleted and what stays will get ugly (or uglier). Part of the problem with this AFD is that we have no definition to cite, which leaves some ambiguity as to whether this page— or any of the other pages created in this manner— should be treated as lists or as game manuals. As they say: It sometimes take a solution to identify a problem. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 01:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>"I would also note that this AFD has opened a serious discussion in to what exactly constitutes a "game manual" here on wikipedia."</i> I concur, and was thinking the same thing myself.

<li>Realizing that I am quite new to this discussion, I find it pertinent to point out that this debate really isn't a debate at all, rather it more closely resembles an internet power struggle. I say this not because I support keeping the page around, but rather because in order for a debate to be successful in any way it must have some sort of framework, an issue that can actually be fought to a conclusion. What are we debating anyway? Whether or not the article should be deleted? If such were the case, then I would expect some sort of grounds to measure why it should be deleted. All of the nay-sayers to this page have offered comment after comment about why they think the page should be deleted, but most say that it is simply because the page is a kind of game manual or guide. If such were the case, I should assume that as in any matter of intellectual dissent there would be supporting evidence to back the claim that the article is deserving of deletion, but alas, none has been provided. In fact, I would assert that all actual evidence that can be presented in such a debate points in the opposite direction. A game manual, by definition, is a book that specifically gives instructions, and a guide is, by definition a tool used for direction or advisement. Seeing neither of these prerequisites present in the article in question, I have no choice but to find that the argument supporting deletion is fallacious and flawed, and must either be presented with actual evidence or considered subservient to those who have voted to keep the article alive.<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiRoGuardian06_70e1.html" title="User:ChiRoGuardian06">ChiRoGuardian06</a> 05:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per nom. I do not accede to the Lakhim/Tom compromise (even as I appreciate the spirit in which it was reached), and this <i>delete</i> should not be construed as <i>merge</i>, inasmuch as the subject of the article, irrespective of the formulation of the article, will always be insufficiently notable/instructional (and hence unencyclopedic). With respect to Aplomado's marking the "votes" of editors whom Tom solicited to participate, such tagging is perhaps useful since it helps one to identify underlying motives, but, as we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and as each contributor has offered a defensible reason for <i>keep</i>, the primary admonishment ought to go to Tom; talk page spamming is looked upon with disfavor, but spamming with the explicit purpose of soliciting a particular vote is remarkably egregious. Nevertheless, Tom has offered an apology and explained his ignorance of the process, and so, I think, we can all move on. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:52, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if the nominator wishes to confirm withdrawal of the nomination (which currently appears ambiguous), I am prepared to close the page as "nomination withdrawn" on that basis, without prejudice to any future AfD initiated by the nominator or anyone else after a period of one month from the date of closure. It is entirely up to the nominator to make a clear decision, within a reasonable time (say, 48 hours), whether or not to withdraw the nomination. I respectfully suggest that any other admin who comes here before I'm next here follow this approach, though I can't bind other admins who may see it differently. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:52, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> for this one. The others should be debated separately with their own AfD's, but I foreshadow that I'd be saying strong keep for some of them. Of course there are no colonies on Mercury for us to write about, but the article makes no such claim. Colonisation of Mercury is a theme in science fiction and a topic for speculation among space enthusiasts, and that is what an article with this heading should be focused on. The article could easily discuss all that, and I'm reasonably confident that sources could be found. Admittedly, the current article suffers the problem that it is mainly original research about the practicalities, but that is a reason for bold editing or some other action, not for deletion of the article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:13, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, so what's the timeline we will accept? We will eventually have people on the Moon and Mars. That's probably within the next 20-40 years. Maybe Mercury will have to wait a few hundred years, but I personally doubt it, at least not if we can actually get something moving. The future is a long time. Will we prevent discussion on extra-solar colonies using the same logic? What about permanent science stations on the floor of the Oceans? We can't limit ourselves to 5-10 years on Wikipedia, not if we want to give our readers &amp; editors the idea that what they write and work on will be read by people beyond that timeframe. We will eventually reach Mercury. It's a matter of time and will.

<dd>Wikipedia is not paper. If and when those things happen, and if Wikipedia still exists at that point (which is highly unlikely), then the articles can be created. We don't need to make articles for every possible future event just in case it eventually happens. An article takes two minutes to create; there's no need to get a jump on things decades or centuries in advance. And, yes, I would advocate deleting any of the other examples you've given.

<dd>However, if you ask anyone in the NewSpace community, they will tell you that with sufficent capital investment they could do all of these things immediately. The Space Elevator being developed by Liftport has an estimated development cost of $10 Billion. That's accessible from any number of governments, corporations and even individuals or coalitions. How many conferences occured among ship captains in the 1300's talking about the potential for an ocean route to the West Indies? We'll never know. 33 years ago, we were on the moon. We will go back, unless naysayers continue to prevent it. Yes, we have a lot of work to do here, but the only thing preventing us from looking up is the people who keep saying "it won't happen".

<li><b>Followup comment: These are not exclusively about speculative future events. They are about the strictly factual past and present of a wide body of research and commentary.</b> The arguments for deletion keep repeating the idea that these are only about speculative future events needing entries to act as crystal balls, which simply isn't true. As I said above, we need to add new sources and new sourced information in the articles to contribute to their coverage of past and present research and commentary, which includes a lot of sophisticated and fascinating research by many of the best known and loved scientist of the past fifty years. I started that with the Colonization of Mercury yesterday with just sources I happened to have within arm's reach of my computer; there is a great deal of well-sourced existing research yet to be added, including many papers in the most prestigious peer-reviewed scientific journals, which many of us will be adding in the future as time allows. And that includes far more material than needed to justify each of the individual entries listed.

<dd>So because I disagree with you, my argument is specious? Don't be ridiculous. I didn't ignore your arguments; I disagree with your entire premise that there is a "wide body" of work dealing with the colonization of Mercury. There's not even a wide body of work detailing plans to <i>get</i> there, much less to colonize it. A book and a couple of websites does not a viable theory make, and therefore I think it should be deleted.

<dd>There is, in fact, a wide body of research (serious, peer reviewed, engineering sand pace science) on how to get to the various planets, and why you would want (or not want) to go to specific ones. These articles don't generally go into huge depth in those sources, but they are definitely out there. The tradeoffs of trajectories, propulsion types and mission designs, landing site analysis, resource analysis, human factors of various missions, etc. The Moon and Mars are the best studied, followed by the Asteroid belt, but people have researched every possible place to go in the solar system (and outside it, for that matter) as an engineering problem for colonization.</dd>
<dd>You may not see that research if you don't hang out in those communities, but there are hundreds or low thousands of technical papers (peer reviewed, etc) published and probably ten conferences a year on the serious technical engineering and scientific issues associated with space development and colonization, looking across the world. It <b>is</b> a very serious deep technical field. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't make any personal attack, I made a frank and informed evaluation of the argument. As I said, the references I was able to put into the Colonization of Mercury entry last night, which draw from popular and peer-reviewed literature by expert scientists, was the result of ten minutes of pulling out books I could reach without getting up from my computer. It's the very beginning. You have also shifted your argument now from denying the existence of a factual subject to denying that enough sources exist to support the entries. A very large body of work on these subjects does exist; discoveries of the breadth of this literature have astonished me more than once. Your lack of knowledge of these references does not render them non-existent. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 18:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't shifted my argument. At no point in my original statement did I say that random speculation on the subject does not exist. I know it does. I said that the topic fails to meet the crystal ball criterion that it should be a near certainty. I stand by that. If you want to discuss the speculations presented about the possibility of colonization, then this should be moved to "Theories of interplanetary colonization" or some such thing. It has nothing to do with the references; I don't care if you have 100 of them. The actual colonization of Mercury has not happened (and, I'd say, will never happen) and therefore this is in the wrong place. Don't worry about it - there are enough supporters here to keep the article from being deleted without you trying to have my opinion disregarded. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nowhere in this article, or in the others, is there a prediction speculating about when colonization might occur.

<dd>Let's not lower ourselves to make comparisons with religious articles. The rapture (which, as a matter of fact, some believe has already happened) is a notable topic inasmuch as the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Bunny_43a3.html" title="Easter Bunny">Easter Bunny</a> is a notable topic, whereas the colonization of Mercury is not. The speculation about colonizing other planets is, and I did suggest moving this to some more appropriate title.</dd>
<dd>Religious theories never rise above speculation; that's what makes them religious theories. If they came true, they'd be science. On the other hand, "speculative science" is a nice way of saying "science fiction". We should be holding our science articles to a higher standard than that. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:56, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The point is that the fact that this has not happened, and may never happen is irrelevant; whether you consider a valid analogy to a religious topic "lowering ourselves" is up to you. The article is not about making predictions; it's more comparable, for example, to an article about a proposed bridge that was planned, engineered, discussed, and possibly even partially financed, but never built. Such would be an equally encyclopedic topic, and similarly not making crystal ball predictions. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 19:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think a more appropriate analogy would be the idea for a bridge that was discussed among a few architects and filed away for being completely impractical, without ever having professional plans drawn up or receiving any significant financing. A real-world analogy might be the myriad plans for developing a memorial for the World Trade Center. The hundreds of absurd ideas that didn't get past the discussion phase do not have their own articles here. They were impractical, they were not acted upon, so they would only be notable as part of a larger subject, or with a qualified title. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strongly Keep All - and improve according to Wikipedia standards</b> I agree that there is a need for these articles. If they must be spun off from another article then that is not in itself an argument that they should not exist - that is just a question of organisation. Planets and the moon and Titan are factual matters. Space exploration is factual. Space exploration of the solar system inevitably raises issues of the habitability of the solar system. These issues exist as a function of the relationship of human biology and terrestial life, generally, to hostile but reachable environments. These issues are real, not fictional. If the subject is denied then it is censorship of information necessary to the ongoing human exploration and settlement of new environments that took us out of the Rift Valley of Africa many hundreds of thousands of years ago to the point where we are now on the verge of colonising neighbouring worlds. Anyone who suggests that this is "speculation about the future" should not bother to post on the internet, since they are speculating that someone will read what they have posted. Some assumptions about the future are well founded and reasonable while others are not. Science assumes that what holds true today will hold true tomorrow. It is speculation about the future, not scientifically verifiable, since we cannot time-travel into the future to verify our assumptions, but scientists do it all the time. In this case we are using facts about planetary objects, physics, biology etc., and the speculation is that human nature, curiosity and necessity will urge us as a species to do what we have done in the past, that is, to explore and colonise our environment. All life does it - why should it be unreasonable speculation about the future to suggest that humans will continue to do so? Rather, to suggest that we might not is <i>highly</i> speculative and unsupported by any evidence that I am aware of! - <b>Elizabeth Jane</b> <i>(registered with Wikipedia) 6:04 AM 9/05/2006 Adelaide (C.S.T.)</i></p>

There are so many vanity pages to be deleted, is it practical to give a detailed reason for every AfD nomination? Besides, the precident is well established that nn is an acceptable abbreviation for "non notable". I would have speedied the article but for the fact that that it is a celebrity's son.

<dd>An Afd proposal is not the way to force changes to an article. If you object to the contents then as a matter of courtesy you ought to bring it up with editors on the article talk page (as a matter of fact, I might be wrong but don't believe that you have made any particular contribution to the article - 1 minor edit, that seems to be all). As for the article title, 'Major power', I will take your word for it that this does not have a basis in academic political science. If this is the case then it would have been nice for you and Thames to bring this up on the talk page; I don't think that you would have found any disagreement with moving/editing this article if you had calmly and reasonably explained the situation - simply slapping OR tags on the page isn't really a meaningful contribution towards its improvement.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../x/d/a/User%7EXdamr_c318.html" title="User:Xdamr">Xdamr</a>, you, I think, are missing the point. We have before us a <i>purely</i> OR article; discussing "changes" or plastering its content on another page won't solve anything. It simply needs to go. Also, your talk of "forcing changes," I find, is disingenuous—"Major power" is not a scientific term and so cannot be "defined" in a manner that would not run contrary to Wikipedia principles. I think this AfD nomination is legitimate and its goal is simple and very clear: delete the current OR article and replace it with a redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Power</a>, where the general concepts, provided they are encyclopaedic and verifiable, can be developed. I am glad you noticed that I never substantially contributed to what I have openly identified as OR; why would I add to the problem? I see no contradiction.

<dd>Obviously I can't vote in this matter, but I would like to defend the claimed OR in the article. GB, France, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, and India are widely talked about as Major Powers in the world. Other countries also deserve mention such as Italy, but because they are not "documented" as a major power are not included. Whats ironic about this is that Major Power is the older article of the two. Anyway, if this is merged, all content should be merged. Anyway, the content currently presented, is only there after a <b>LOT</b> of discussion. Slowly but surely, these articles are becoming NPOV, with the current group of dedicated editors, namely Xdamr, Guinnog and Noble Eagle but several others as well. 12.220.94.199 01:44, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, being "widely talked about" doesn't mark them down as legitimate. If these countries were <i>expressly classified</i> as "Major Powers" in <i>social science texts</i> and <i>peer reviewed journals</i>, you'd have grounds for an article. They aren't, and you don't. Like it or not, Xdamr, Guinnog and Noble Eagle, whatever their other qualities, <b>are not the arbiters of polisci taxonomy</b>, and their discussion, however much of it there was, is no justification for an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 02:11, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term major power perhaps. But major power is simply a term describing the usage in the media. Take this link that took me five seconds to look up for example. <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_1998/yax-105.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_1998/yax-105.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> While the article is purely speculative, it does make the important point of the major powers in the world. It lists off China and the U.S.(obviously) as the main powers, with the spoilers being India and Russia and the signficant allies being Europe for the U.S.(speculative) and Japan for China(highly speculative). Nonetheless despite the large amounts of speculation, it does show who are the signficant powers in the modern world. 12.220.94.199 02:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's not mince words: Since when is Wikipedia a repository of terms that are in "moderately common colloquial use?" Which guideline sanctions; whose authority supports, the creation of Wikipedia articles that are venues for personal opinions developed through the editors' own research? Our mandate here is not, I would think, to pick up scraps of what the media blurt out and to try to cobble articles out of them. Another expression used fairly commonly in the media, for instance, is "major player," i.e. "the Republic of Foo is now a <i>major player</i> in Southeast Fooian affairs." Should I then go ahead and create Major player (international relations) and define it arbitrarily? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 05:33, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is somewhat beyond me how you can state that there's no common usage subject to verifyable criteria. I just pulled up a bunch of sources with 30 sec on Google, and from having studied the field for a decade on and off I can tell you that any semi-competent library search in a Poli Sci / Geopolitics section will find loads more. The word is
<ol>
<li>in common use in the field</li>
<li>clearly enough defined that people in the field don't argue about it all the time</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The specific country entries are highly problematic; they don't say anything I know to be false about the state of geopolitical analysis / publication, but it's very opinionated and many of them approach or pass OR on content summarization. A shorter list of nations which are labeled <i>Major power</i> in the literature would be far superior, without the problematic longer expansion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:06, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You just pulled up a bunch of sources that use the term frivolously and arbitrarily along with a handful of others ("major player," etc.) that ought not to have articles. Good effort, but not good enough. ("common usage," by the way, means that the <i>sense</i> (meaning) of the word shouldn't vary substantially. It does.) And if you think the term is "clearly enough defined that people don't argue about it all the time," then you ought to conduct that semi-competent library search you've been talking about and <b>find a definition.</b> The onus is on you. (Oh, and I recommend you take a look at the article's talk page, for instance the section titled "ITALY, WHY YOU DON'T YOU EVEN MENTION ITALY?" Not exactly encouraging.)</dd>

<dd>Then feel free to try and get reputable cites for the criteria the article is based on, and the content written around them. The main reason it fails is its all-OR nature.

<dd>I've put those references into the article. The basic definition there, and its usage re: the validity of the term, should be established sufficiently by now.</dd>
<dd>The question of whether the individual nations listed, and the format or detail of their listings, are appropriate is a completely different question. Shrinking those to a much more compact list, and clarifying that there is no universally accepted list but that these nations have been labeled as such (and preferably, working to reference each nation's labeling) are good things. But that's article improvement work, not deletion justification. I will poke around and work on that, but I can't do it all today.

<dd>Good effort. The trouble is, as it stands, beyond the dicdef, the <b>entire article</b> consists of "the individual nations listed, and the format or detail of their listings". I don't think anybody doubts the possibility of a viable article with this title in the future, though it is harder to justify when there an adequate article exists on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Powers</a>, a term with a much better academic pedigree which seems to include this article's subject. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In terms of fixing this article; articles which need major repair are specifically listed as a reason <b>not</b> to AfD in the AfD criteria. This needs to get tagged with cleanup and related tags (and <i>fixed</i>...), not deleted.

<dd>The only difference between "Great Power" and "Major Power" is the former is well-defined and solidly entrenched behind history while the latter remains redundant and unsubstantiated (look at the list of Great Powers and spot those without a "downfall" date—<b>they correspond <i>exactly</i> to your ad hoc list of "Major" powers!</b>). As "Great Power" falls out of fashion, other terms like "major power" (or "major geostrategic player," as per your links above) are popping up to express basically the same concept. Or am I missing some Earth-shattering difference between states "that have substantial influence on other states" and those "whose opinions must be taken into account by other nations before effecting initiatives"?
<dl>
<dd>Uh... the only difference between "Great Power" and "Major Power" is that a Great Power status is a historical recognition and that a Major Power is a current status designation. A country <i>was</i> a Great Power, or <i>is arguably</i> a Major Power. This is not just a minor semantics point... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:33, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Nuke it and recreate it later more appropriately" is a gross misrepresentation of the situation when we're talking about an unencyclopaedic term defined only by a smattering of OR: There's nothing to nuke, and very little to recreate that can't be added to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Power</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_in_international_relations.html" title="Power in international relations">Power in international relations</a>.

<p>I would question though whether this one reference (interesting though it is) is notable enough to base an entire article on.</p>
<p>I would note too that their criteria (which are unreferenced) are subtly different from the ones in the article, and that the conclusions they draw are slightly different from those in the article. There remains the nagging doubt in my mind too about whether this article may be based on an earlier version of this Wiki article, leading to a circular situation! Best case scenario, we establish that this article is based on (plagiarised from?) the OR of one website, moderated and modified by the original research of several Wiki editors.</p>
<p>While it is an interesting debate, whether such-and-such a power is a "Major Power" or an "Emerging Superpower" etc, I don't think it belongs on an encyclopedia as it is too arbitrary. Really, who are we to decide whether Russia (say) is a Major Power?</p>
<p>If this article is allowed to stay on Wiki in anything like its present form, we could have next an article on Possible Superpowers of the 22nd century, or one on Countries which will probably never amount to much, or one on Countries which could have been Superpower contenders but blew it. Synthesise some OR criteria and make a list of countries, then let the arguments begin. Entertaining though this might be (up to a point), it doesn't seem apppropriate for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I appreciate the work you have put in to try and improve this article, and understand how galling it must be to see the work seemingly deprecated; be assured this is nothing personal (as I mentioned in your talk page), but just a recognition that there is no way to save this from being OR. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 12:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>From my reading of the Afd proposal there are two main points of contention: firstly, the concept of 'Major Power' is OR and secondly the listing of nations within the article is OR. To my mind only the first is a valid AfD criticism; debates over OR in the article content are properly dealt with on the article talk page - the fact that an article is poorly written is not a reason for its deletion, it is a reason to improve it. As Georgewilliamherbert says above, 'the "nuke it and recreate it later more appropriately" approach is against standard WP policy'.
<dl>
<dd>Either you have not thoroughly read the discussion or you are deliberately obstructing the issues involved. No one wants to delete the article because it's "poorly written." What we have here is an indefinable term built on foundations of bickering and sloppy OR. The grounds for deletion, as previously stated, are that the term is redundant, OR, and, not being a polisci term, <i>"cannot be 'defined' in a manner that would not run contrary to Wikipedia principles."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The question of whether 'Major power' is a term of political science is one for political scientists to debate. Personally, I accept in good faith Albrecht's assertion that it is not. However I do not consider that this alone makes the article OR. We see above, and now in the article, that 'Major power' is a term in colloquial usage amongst those involved in the area; it can no longer be seriously asserted that this is 'OR/interesting intellectual speculation' (per Martinp above). Whether it is a strict term of political science is not the point; it has been shown to be a term of art, this makes it worthy of remaining.
<dl>
<dd>If colloquial usage warrants an article then I expect your full support when I create Major player (international relations), Geostrategic player, and Restless Power.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The term is now sourced. The content of the article may remain open to debate, but the grounds for a legitimate Afd have surely now gone. Informed discussion as to content should now take place on the talk page.
<dl>
<dd>The term, as I said above, is sourced to a laughable assortment of blogs, news stories, dead links, and a <i>book cover.</i> Sorry, no game. The AfD, if anything, is <i>more valid</i> now than when it began since we now know that <i>none</i> of the article's main contributors have shown any serious interest in finding a legitimate basis for the term or demonstrating that it can stand on other foundations than OR (the poor job with sources confirms this). Why not channel our energies toward something productive?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I question whether the votes above can now legitimately stand; now that the term is sourced it is no longer OR. Those who voted above based their conclusions on a superceded version of the article. Either way it would have been much better to have thrashed this out on the talk page before bringing it to Afd. Albrecht said '[I] have never substantially contributed to [an article] I have openly identified as OR'. No-one expects you to contribute to such an article but I would ask whether this precluded you from raising your concerns on the talk page?</dd>

<p>I talked to people in wikipedia and they say that I could edit the page, according to the facts that I showed. Neverthless, I talked in the discussion page,because I want things to be done fairly. I'mnotasking to includ my country or other minor powers. Its Italy.I already showed more facts than all thefacts that areon that page for all the countries, and I showed only for one, because I know what I'm talking about. Even if GDP, military, industry know-how and self-knowledge to construct their own things besides geopolits aren't enough, look at Italy cultural and historical impirtance since Roman epoch untill nowadays. 50% of the worldpatrimony is there. I can provide facts and facts, people doesn't wan't to see them because they prefer a forgotten and more fragile Italy.But the reality is very different. I reed above someone saying that Japan is Major Power, while UK is also a Major Power, usefull to USA but a restless power. Its wrong. Besides UK GDP, financial markets strenghtit has the second most active personel on "peacekeeping" actions in the world, its a major EU member, member of Nato with nuclear power, has a UN Permanent Seat on Security Council besides being the chief country of the British Commonwealth. As you said,one must take into account the powerof the region itself and the power that the coutry has in the region to determinate its power in the world stage. Japan is a Major economical power, but can't influence all Asian continent byitself, altough itsan importantcountry in world stage, its more a regional power of East Asia, not even Asia at allits dimension. Japan cannot deploy its armed forces for war purposes, only in peacekeeping or if it where attacked.In that it's more a puppet of USA than UK. The fact the page has the same nations since the begging is a very poor argument.Everything evolves and develops. The Wikipedia project is always in development, look at the newarticles, pages, expanded articles it has compared with the beggining of that project. The english page is evolving every day. The fact that you don't want the page to be developed is that it was created according to your views or its you that have some prejudices against the thruth. Since you have a personal aproach to these geopolitics,you say that are the others that have this sentiment. Nobody its ownerof the thruth, people could only know more of this or moreof that and someone knows more of this and the other knows more of that. You are not owner of the thruth and not even of Wikipedia, you should listen, or reed what someone knows better than you. I've been studying Italian Geopolitics,culture, politics, military,...,for a very long time. What I want is that the Major Power page shows more fairness and the Great Power pages shows historical accuracy, things I don't see on them now. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">ACamposPinho</a> 2:18, 13 May 2006</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would invite all people here discussing this subject to extend this treatment to the Emerging superpowers (China, EU, and India and Russia...and blablabla). All sourced points there can be used in their appropriate articles (India..or China..etc). All of them contain original research and NPOV. I know that many fragments are sourced, but to draw a global conclusion based on several facts (very recent ones, still needed to be analized in an historic context) is a little complicated. Anybody here remembers about Japan in the 80's? When the Japanese Royal palace used to worth more than California??? Well, that's my point.

Fourthly, there are also a number of links used that directly link India's, China's, EU's power with a rise to Superpower status so that isn't OR.

However, this article is not it: unsourced, with some of the claims appearing hard to verify, and written in a very POV style. I think that there is a much stronger case for an article on John T. Flynn himself, who appears to have been a prolific writer on these matters for decades, from a perspective which is notable. Such an article could discuss the book as well as his other writings and broadcasting, and more readily accommodate a balanced account of the man's work. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 08:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Ironically, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrawingfreak_c4e4.html" title="User:Drawingfreak">User:Drawingfreak</a>'s keep argument is actually a good reason to delete. In Wikipedia, if your site can still be described as "fledgeling", it probably hasn't achieved enough notice for us to maintain a document that abides by the three content criteria (i.e., <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). Many assume getting an article on Wikipedia is a good way to get the word out, but that's not how it works. Krewmembers will get more traffic from Wikipedia over the days of this AFD than it would for years otherwise. It's just one article in a million, after all.

Other than the Wikipedia related pages the search only shows two links which point to one website in north queensland. The article contains edits that looks like a case of somebody writing an article about themselves and editing out criticism and calling it vandalism.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is listed on CKD Breakaway Organizations with other styles of similar notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A review of the history of CKD Breakaway Organizations seem to indicate that the JSYD/Advanced Choi Kwang Do/Choi Professionals 'founder' created the list in order to give his newly created organization an appearance of credibility and to place an external hyperlink to its website on the Choi Kwang Do wiki page. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazydaisy_a2a0.html" title="User:Lazydaisy">Lazydaisy</a> 10:32, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just for <b>clarification</b>, the CKD Breakaway Organizations page was originally within the main body of the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Kwang-Do_9217.html" title="Choi Kwang-Do">Choi Kwang-Do</a> article under 'Hybrid Styles'. It was added on the 6 June 2005, by user 65.35.195.210 from Florida, USA. This user added 8 out of the current 10 'Hybrid Styles' and, in the introductory paragraph to the section, described some of the styles as "outright forgeries". Given this user's choice of words, they are probably not the founder of any 'styles' in the list. <a href="../../../b/m/u/User%7EBMurray_5fb5.html" title="User:BMurray">BMurray</a> 12:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The user contributions for the ip <a href="../../../b/m/u/User%7EBMurray_5fb5.html" title="User:BMurray">BMurray</a> mentions, shows contibutions done over 3 days with no furhter activity in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">Bacmac</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The user from Largo, Florida, USA originally created the 'Hybrid Styles' section (now CKD Breakaway Organizations) to disparage Shim Shin-Do, a breakaway style of Choi Kwang Do (CKD) which operates in their geographical locality. The user claims to be the instructor of Steve and Shelley Elrod, which a google search shows are members of the CKD Martial Arts International organization; Therefore this user is a member of the CKD Martial Arts International organization. It is alleged that the user <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">BACMAC</a> is from Townsville, the self-proclaimed Australian headquarters for the CKD Martial Arts International organization. It is also alleged that the user <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazydaisy_a2a0.html" title="User:Lazydaisy">Lazydaisy</a> is from Kennesaw, Georgia, USA, which is the actual World headquarters for the CKD Martial Arts International organization. Any user who disagrees with <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazydaisy_a2a0.html" title="User:Lazydaisy">Lazydaisy</a> in article discussions is automatically labelled as 'Rod Cook', which highlights thier personal vendetta. Surely it is wrong for interested parties and direct competitors to have input into such a project, with the aim of reducing exposure of, or discrediting their competitors? <a href="../../../b/m/u/User%7EBMurray_5fb5.html" title="User:BMurray">BMurray</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../b/m/u/User%7EBMurray_5fb5.html" title="User:BMurray">BMurray</a> to continue typing "Keep" will not result in ballot load of the voting, <b>Comment</b> would be more appropriate for your third entry and would make reading easier. Get rid of the conspiracy theory and instead of allegations against people who are contributing provide information that would support your 'Keep' vote. This article is up for deletion because it has been tagged.." not notable group". <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">Bacmac</a> 10:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Any input from organizations in competition with the subject of the article really should not be given any credence. But if they are, why does the same organization get to use two user names, isn't this a form of '<a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet_%28Internet%29_6d9a.html" title="Sock puppet (Internet)">sockpuppetting</a>'? Just of note for users in this discussion, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">AfD</a> is not a poll or a 'vote' as perceived by <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacmac_043c.html" title="User:Bacmac">BACMAC</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I suspect there is a misunderstanding here. If someone calls an <b><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a></b> a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugger.html" title="Bugger">bugger</a>, it is an insult; moreover, the word used as an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insult.html" title="Insult">insult</a> has an interesting <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>: it comes from "Bulgarian", which is an ethnic group name. That is what this list is about; this is very different from ethnic slurs; in the example the fact that the insultee is Australian is entirely irrelevant or (presumably) not the reason why he was insulted, but rather the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> that he finished the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon.html" title="Bacon">bacon</a> from the fridge that I bought for <b>my</b> <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast.html" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm truly lost here. Isn't semantics supposed to be about the meaning of utterances? So saying it is "pure semantics" is saying that it concerns the meaning of what we are saying, rather than the typography. Is there something wrong with that? Further, do you seriously want to maintain that calling someone who, say, added lots of <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four-letter_word.html" title="Four-letter word">four-letter words</a> to your user page a "vandal" is an ethnic slur? I say that you are really stretching the meaning of "ethnic slur" beyond reason.

<dd>What I'm saying that that there is no reasonable distinction in my opinion between "ethnic group names used as insults" and "ethnic slurs" despite the editorial claims on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_group_names_used_as_insults.html" title="List of ethnic group names used as insults">List of ethnic group names used as insults</a>.&#160;; "ethnic group names used as insults" would fall under the canopy of "ethnic slurs". Saying that they are 2 entirely different things is, in my opinion, a semantic division. I don't see any logical reason being advanced why "ethnic group names used as insults" would not fall under a reasonable definition of "ethnic slurs"... and yes I would consider "vandal" to apply as it is ethnically derived though it has no current ethnic stigma attached to it. On a side note... I predict a keep for this on at least a "no consensus" so interpretation of the terms is kind of a moot point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

Obviously, the title is confusing, and there are still some mistakes (<a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir.html" title="Kaffir">kaffir</a> went the other way, becoming an ethnic slur after being coined as a general term for an infidel).

I know people can use "Goth" as a pejorative, but I know just as many people self-describe themselves as "Goth" or see it as a positive term. Moving content to List of ethnic group names that have become English words would make more sense based on the current content of the list if this is indeed kept (which it looks like it will be).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:48, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b>. All votes for merging into ethnic slurs don't unserstand the basic difference: "<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">Bohemian</a>" is <b>not</b> an insult for Bohemians, i.e., Czechs. It is an insult for something else, even <b>not for any ethnicity</b>. The suggestion of AKADriver about renaming/extending the scope is very reasonable, but it doesn't require AfD intervention. However we should be careful with renaming here: the name suggested by AKADriver opens the door to, e.g., <a href="../../../a/u/s/Aussie.html" title="Aussie">Aussie</a> and the ilk, which are out of question in the current article. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – Renaming may be a good idea, but this specific proposal has a problem that the present title also has, which is that it does not suggest that the meaning has changed and that the ethnicity of any designees is irrelevant to the applicability of the terms on the list. Is "Gypsy" in the meaning of Roma/Sinti an English word? One could argue that it is, and then the new title is an invitation to add it. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:28, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've revised the lead paragraph to better cover the actual list (as well as the intention). The first sentence reads now: "This is a list of words used in the English language whose etymology goes back to the name of some, often historical or archaic, ethnic or religious group, but whose current meaning has lost that connotation and does not imply any actual ethnicity or religion." Perhaps this will inspire someone to come up with a better title for the article. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - After reading usenet for more than a decade, I can attest to the fact that many people use the word "hipcrime" and support his/her/their activities.

<dd>Sorry, didnt intend to mean it that way. You'll find my back trail full of attempted puns|broken pottery by this bull in the Wikipedia China shop (there I go again). Just a (sick) attempt at humour. Strong keep because, in India, we have very few social service organisations as per density of our populace. An organisation such as Matru Seva Sangh reflects the Indian nationalist effort of the early twenties at following Gandhian ideals in the service of mankind. I think I'll send crzr an apology barnstar so that I'll have at least twenty gaffes more in interacting with him to my credit and I can rest in peace. BTW, I dont normally get involved outside butterflies unless I plan to get actively involved in the article.Hence strong keep since I plan to work on this for a couple of months.<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshLin_f411.html" title="User:AshLin">AshLin</a> 02:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tagged for speedy as nn-club, but notability clearly asserted; I can't offhand think of the applicable guidelines and can't make up my mind whether this claim to notability is encyclopaedic or not.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. It's pretty clear to me that the article itself focused on nothing but the fact that he made racial slurs in class outlines he posted on a website.

<p>The notability of the person in this article is suspect. As of the most current edit, this article does not fit Wikipedia notability criteria (see Wikipedia:Notability (people)).</p>
<p>There are only three unique points in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>He graduated early from Harvard Law School with a fellowship.</li>
<li>He wrote an arguably offensive article.</li>
<li>He coaches high school debate at Mountain View High School.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people coach high school debate, some graduate early, and others let the word <i>nigger</i> slip out on accident. More than half of the article has to do with how Camara pissed people off. Not only is this article uncited, but one of its important external links are "humorous video at debate practice."</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> suggested that Camara's status as a former <i>John M. Olin fellow in law and economics at Harvard</i> is grounds for notability as a fellow is basically a junior professor; however, this is a misunderstanding. As evidenced by Wikipedia's article on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_M._Olin_Foundation_d6be.html" title="John M. Olin Foundation">John_M._Olin_Foundation</a>, the foundation gives a grant to fellows at universities, including Harvard. Now that the confusion regarding the "John M. Olin" moniker is out of the way, let us examine what a <i>fellow</i> really is.</p>
<p>According to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fellows" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fellows" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, a fellow at a university would be <i>a graduate student appointed to a position granting financial aid and providing for further study</i>. This means that a fellow can hardly be equated to a college professor of any sort- they are just not the same thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Jahiegel</a> has argued that the publicity surrounding the racial conflict at Harvard and Yale would be grounds for notability and would merit an evolution of the article into that incident. However, I contend that publicity is not enough to substantiate importance of subject based on two premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can be subjected to publicity for any reason, good or bad. To set a precedent of writing articles based on the subject's publicity would be writing millions of articles about people who are potentially not notable. So, if there was any way for us to assume that publicity is a notability factor here, we would also have to assume that:</li>
<li>The reason why Camara's publicity would be notable is because he himself is already important. However, I have already disproven this assertion in the first half of this nomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Camara himself is not notable enough, which logically means that the publicity surrounding him is not notable either. Consequently, this article should be deleted. <b><a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig.p_5a70.html" title="User:Big.p"><font color="#1E90FF">Big</font></a><font color="#1E90FF">.</font><a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig.P_Esperanza_1d6a.html" title="User:Big.P/Esperanza"><font color="#008000">P</font></a> <font color="black"><small>(<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig.P_e35f.html" title="User talk:Big.P">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_big.P_5eb6.html" title="Special:Contributions/big.P">contribs</a>)</small></font></b> 04:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Nevertheless, the controversy surrounding his prospective YLR publication, and the media coverage such controversy received, likely seems to confer notability. Notwithstanding <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>, I see nothing in this situation to distinguish Camara from <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristi_Yamaoka_48ae.html" title="Kristi Yamaoka">Kristi Yamaoka</a>, whom we've found to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kristi_Yamaoka_%28second_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kristi_Yamaoka_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">notable</a>. On the Yamaoka nomination, I supported "delete", believing that "where a personnage is notable only in view of his/her tie to a specific incident, our article ought to focus on the incident (as against on the person)"; I thought, then, that the Yamaoka article ought to be retitled and refocused on the incident writ large. Here, though, because the incident and person are wholly inextricable, because and where a singular person is the main participant in an incident, I am inclined to think that we ought to have an article apropos of the person; in either case, the event/person is notable. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 15:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This "salt the Earth" philosophy, is one reason why so many people find it necessary to keep just about anything that has a hope of turning into something good. While some would like to delete certain articles in poor condidtion, and have a new/better version made later, they can rest assured, that, if deleted, the page will be protected for all of time (effectively). Isn't this suppose to be a wiki? (e.g. where anybody can edit any page, right now)? Also, the fact it was re-made under a different title, pretty much shows how useless such protection is *except* against those wishing to make a good faith creation. note: I'm not objecting the the speedy (I can't judge what I can't see), but the protection seems unwiki.--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:09, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, the biggest problem I see with this article is that it is patently ridiculous... It basically admits in the article this is a complete impossiblility (<i>a surface colony on Venus in its present form would appear out of the question.</i>) Moreso than any of the other colonization articles here this is complete science fiction crystalballism.

<li><b>Keep</b> As someone who has worked extensively on this article I realize I may have a POV in this discussion. However, I believe the article <i>is</i> encyclopædic. It concerns a matter that has been under discussion in the mainstream <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_community.html" title="Scientific community">scientific community</a> for decades. The article does not try to predict the future, nor speculate, but rather simply lays out differing perspectives that currently exist about its topic, as per Wikipedia convention. Furthermore, the impact upon or resemblance to science fiction of the topic is not a sufficient reason for deletion, in my opinion. In fact, I had been planning to add an "In Fiction" section where the topic was a major background or plot element in science fiction. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoO3_4e6d.html" title="User:LeoO3">LeoO3</a> 16:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - because it (ideally) discusses objective, factual information about the great deal of past and current commentary and technical research on these ideas, a great deal of which has been funded by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> and other space organizations and which has been carried out in peer-reviewed <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_literature.html" title="Scientific literature">scientific literature</a>, the record of which is entirely a matter of fact, not speculation. The first peer-reviewed scientific paper on colonizing another planet (by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> in the prestigious journal <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i>, on the potential to terraform and colonize Venus) was published almost fifty years ago, and such literature has been growing exponentially since then. Such factual information on past and ongoing research and commentary is no more speculative in nature than is any subject of scientific or engineering research. The Colonization of Mercury page is so far sparse and lacking in sources, but those should be remedied by further work, not by trashing a valuable subject.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's more of a magazine/summary article, but deserves a place. However, it needs <b>a lot</b> of work, as some things in it are stupid IMO. E.g., Enceladus is easier to colonise than Europa, because it has liquid water closer to the surface. Sheesh, if you're in outer space, the first thing you'll have is a good energy source, and you just use that to melt the ice for water. There are a hundred other bigger problems than melting ice. If it doesn't improve in 12 months I'd just ask for it to be deleted. Basically it's borderline speculative, but does have some sources. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesHoadley_cb7a.html" title="User:JamesHoadley">JamesHoadley</a> 04:37, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is <u>huge</u> difference between "signed to" a record label and actually having released a CD, and having significant numbers of people buy it.

<li><b>Comment</b> While the above point is a viable one regarding accessability of music downloads, the argument for the wiki to be deleted is that it does not follow the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> policy.

<li><b>Comment</b>, am I correct in reading that the claim that Michael Television's Interloper meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is based on the inclusion of one band member (Felix Milburn Foster) who is also in the band British Beef? I'm not sure British Beef meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, so that would kind of kill the idea of confered notability to Michael Television's Interloper under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I'm still looking into it before rendering an opinion though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> suggests <b>"Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)", "Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network" and "Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network"</b> As the band have been as interviewed in the national press, widely publicised magazines , television and radio rotation and airplay and the inclusion of the single on the console game <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_Street_2_d092.html" title="FIFA Street 2">FIFA Street 2</a> then the argument that British Beef and therefore it's guitarist is not 'notable' would be a woeful assumption.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> -- with exactly <b>three</b> hits on UK Google for MTI, two of them being this band's Myspace page, one being its website (and <i>zero</i> links from Alexa other than itself), I take any claims of national press, radio airplay and magazine articles not merely with a grain of salt, but with the whole bloody shaker.

<li><b>Comment</b> May I request should you like to argue about the verification that the above band British Beef have not the credentials listed above that you re-read all the comments in the article. It currently features a link to a multi-national console game. Should you need to find an article, there are dozens online. <a href="http://www.newsworcs.co.uk/rhythmandbooze/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=194" class="external text" title="http://www.newsworcs.co.uk/rhythmandbooze/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=194" rel="nofollow">This</a> article clearly mentions heavy rotation on tv and radio. There are more. <a href="http://www.quitegreat.co.uk/clients/british_beef.php" class="external text" title="http://www.quitegreat.co.uk/clients/british_beef.php" rel="nofollow">This</a> one mentions winning BBC Radio 1's best unsigned act and getting airplay from that. Unfortunately for people requesting it's deletion are on the grounds of contributors who have mostly scan read articles. Hopefully, should we be allowed to continue working on the wiki by moderators who do more than do a quick browse. The band is by an large fledgling, but the request for deletion should be based solely on the dispute that it does not serve a higher purpose, which frankly, if it's enough to annoy contributors who seem largely not to read English publications, would be justifiable in itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> - (glancing at the top of the page) Err, last I checked, this wasn't British Beef's AfD -- although you do need a page in the first place for that, and BB doesn't have one. But MTI scarcely <i>exists</i> -- just one gig, no albums, no singles, no nothing. Even stipulating that BB is notable, MTI sure the heck isn't, short of Eric Clapton deciding to front it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:20, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> New Way Of Decay is latching onto the line "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable" in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The logic is: since MTI contains a former member of BB, if BB barely makes the cut as notable, then MTI can stay. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Arguably by the logic instilled in the reasoning for its deletion is that it doesn't hold up to the wikipedia rules, when it does in fact do this. Simply arguing that the band entry itself has no reason to exist because you personally doubt its merits when it more than succesfully fulfils criteria is sour. The argument by following the string of text should be as follows: the claim that the band are local, when the information has been garned globally, that the band have no recordings, when songs are directly available to download for free and that the band have played a venue of no sizeable note when in fact an entertainment license must be held by the proprieters. That the band have are not a profitable enterprise should not be the first and foremost reasoning for a wiki not to exist. Fairly pointed out by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> that the page may be deemed as vanity is a fair one and has been noted above that the text will be adjusted accordingly. However, further arguing against obvious links to reliable media sources should be discounted or more realistically, contributors should honour the media source before posting further doubt. As for the comments regarding 'whether the band gigged once or twice' should be held as valid, in the first instance because the reason a page should be flagged for deletion should at least be factual to gain any weight and secondly, that the information by standards is grossly inadequate. The example in this case comes in the form of <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> and their reassurance about gig numbers. The room for error was 100% When you do the maths, this is no small percentage. If the argument for the pages deletion is in splitting hairs, then the case for its approval should be held with equal intensity. In other words, if contributors are reluctant to stick to the discussion in hand, then they should at least honour the facts, or find another wiki page to gripe about. Noteably <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> is under the impression Eric Clapton needs to front a band for it to fulfil the criteria, which clearly shows a lack of understanding of both the wiki guides and irony.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Perhaps you might debate the points we've actually made, rather than presenting straw man arguments. No one has said MTI should be deleted because it's "local," nor does the "information [having been] garned globally" factor in to the slightest degree -- any 14-year-old wannabe can put up a MP3 that can be downloaded worldwide. Nor does anyone allege that it has made no recordings at all; simply that no recordings it has made has verifiably satisfied <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s 5,000+ (or certified gold) sales mark. Nor do the reasons MTI hasn't played in a major venue figure into the criteria; only that it hasn't. My comment about Clapton was a sound analogy; it might not take a Clapton to make a band notable, but it sure does to make a band with only two (tiny) gigs, no albums, no sales and no airplay notable.

<dd>This is a synthesis of facts in so many ways:
<ol>
<li>The mere allegation of "threats" is mere speculation based on current policy. A nuclear-armed NK isn't acceptable either, but it's pretty clear we're not about to attack them.</li>
<li>the three-country link. There's no link between the U.S. and Israel other than expressed concern over Iran's nuclear weapons programme. That's hardly unique and many other nations have expressed such. Yes, they are the most likely to strike Iran, but that's OR and not apropos for this article.</li>
<li>combining "possible attack targets" in this article. I don't see the point of combining this with the threats or perceived threats other than as crystal-balling a future attack.</li>
<li>Motives. When the U.S. hasn't even issued an overt threat to attack, merely stating that it doesn't wish Iran to be armed with nukes, and now we're speculating about oil? Speculation on the motives of a yet-to-happen event is just terrible.</li>

<dd>Yes. First of all, the title "Threats to attack Iran" imposes that the US and/or Israel deliberately threaten Iran. It is not the case. Iran actively procures nuclear technologies that will allow it to have nuclear weapons in 5-10 years, while US and Israel react verbally to these actions. It is not a symmetrical situation, and highlighting the threats, as is done in this article, serves Iranian propaganda by making the verbal threats look as frightening as Iran's nuclear plans. Second, every insignificant statement said by any US official is recorded, as if it is really important and reflects an official policy. Again, US officials are just reacting to Iran's actions and statements, which are an order of magnitude worse. All this makes me want to just delete this article and put just a small paragraph about the whole issue in "United States-Iran relations". --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 12:46, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the title could be changed to something more NPOV, but that is not a reason to delete the article. I don't understand your claim that the threats are not deliberate. How can you accidentally, repeatedly threaten to invade a country? These threats have been repeated numberous times by many high level US political figures. It is widely believed that the US is threatening Iran. It is daily news. Rebels in Iraq have vowed to defend Iran from attack, so they must believe it too. Many writers and commentators, including numberous respected US journalists have commented on these threats. The former UK foriegn minister commented on them. France today declared it would not support such threats. It is notable.</dd>
<dd>You say that US politicians are simply reacting to Iran's actions. By this I assume you mean Iran's production of nuclear fuel. Why do these politicians react to Iran's actions with talk of bombings and invasion, while they give no such reaction to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2006/04/20/brazil_quietly_pursues_own_nuclear_path/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2006/04/20/brazil_quietly_pursues_own_nuclear_path/" rel="nofollow">Brazil's recent announcement of production of nuclear fuel</a>. Surely this difference of responce is notable?</dd>
<dd>Finally, Iran has no proven plans to produce nuclear weapons. The only countries which accuse it of secret plans are the US and Israel. On-one else seems to think there is a great threat. Infact the entire issue of this supposed Iranian conspiracy theory, true or not, has no evidential backing and is based solely on US and Isreali government statements. If this article is deleted, then there is a very strong case to also delete <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iran and weapons of mass destruction">Iran and weapons of mass destruction</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 13:26, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article contains no comments from US figures other than speculation from journalists and other outsiders about unnamed high-level officials having made up their minds on the matter, and the official U.S. position which is fairly vague about invasion.</dd>
<dd>WMD is not solely nuclear weapons, there is well cited material regarding Iran's biological and chemical weapons programs in the Iran WMD article.</dd>
<dd>The link between the US and Israel is OR. Until such an event happens and you can point to a link between the two countries, these shouldn't be covered together.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, as I stated above, the article is collected around crystal-balling a potential attack - listing potential targets and motivations. This is silly and absurd when there is only speculation about treats to attack/invade. If and when such an attack is made, these no longer become OR.

<dd>President Bush has stated publically "all options are on the table," and specifically refuses to rule out military action. Pretending this is not a threat is naive. Abe Froman 15:23, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why should he rule out military action, and why would you expect him to, invasion or not? The link is speculative and OR.

<dd>Yes, but I'm not proposing we put my speculation in the article. You are. Bush has said all options are on the table W.R.T. North Korea, as well as the speculated tax hike, for strengthening social security, and many other policies. The belief that "all options are on the table" somehow translates to "we'd really like to do this" is a fallacy and speculative on your part. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:27, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> - i think the relevant NPOV definition of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threat.html" title="Threat">threat</a> in the wikipedia is <i>A threat is also an explicit or implicit message from a person to another that the first will cause something bad to happen to the other, often except when certain demands are met. Often a weapon is used. ... <b>The message may be vague and implicit in an attempt to avoid blame, including legal consequences, while still clear enough to serve its purpose</b>,</i> (<b>emphasis</b> added) except that the definition in our case concerns States, not individual people. i think the last sentence may particularly help for people who think that "All options are open" statements are vague. In a legal system, many options are closed. In a typical legal system, a policeman walking around carrying a gun does <i>not</i> have "all options open" for using that gun; in fact, he has a very restricted set of (legal) possibilities for using that gun. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:55, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Libertarians are frequently ignored by the news media. In 2004 only people who selected the Libertarian ballot in Washington State in the September Primary Election were allowed to choose between Michael Nelson and Ruth Bennet. Nelson received 43 percent of the Libertarian vote. Bennet received 56 % and won the Libertarian nomination and then went on to represent the Libertarian Party in the November General Election. Since only about 1 percent of the voters had selected the Libertarian ballot and over 50 percent of the voters selected the Democratic ballot, it is unfair to compare Mike the Movers Democract vote total with Michael Nelson's vote total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people who run as Libertarians know that they are not going to win their election race, but they run because they think that it is so important to be a spokes person for individual liberty. In the political arena, people who run as Libertarians are like people who are willing to die in battle because they believe that individual liberty is so important. When the Libertarian Party lost its major party status in 2004 in Washington State (leaving only the Democrats and Republicans as major parties) the news media did not even feel this loss of choice was newsworthy and did not significantly inform the voters of the loss of this third choice. The big significance of Goodspaceguy is that he is actively advocating for the coming Orbital Space Colonies which will be the huge accomplishment in our new Twenty-first Century. Our technological advancement is continuing at rapid speed. In the 20th Century we humans went from the Horse and Buggy Age to the beginnings of the Space Age in only 57 years - In 1957, the orbiting Russian Sputnik announced the beginnings of the Space Age to the people of Earth. People just do not realize the fantastic future that is coming. Libertarian Democrat Michael Nelson (goodspaceguy) is attempting to contribute.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Indeed, candidates for legislative office do become notable per Wikipedia guidelines by virtue of winning. That being said, Fan1967's comments are spot on. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>, and I'm sure that as you must respect that legislatures have rules and laws governing their operation, so do we. Indeed, there's a standard delineated on <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>: "The best way to increase the level of one's wide ranging interest to others is to first actually <i>do</i> something of interest itself, then wait for someone else who has a neutral interest in what you have done to write about it. Attempting to raise this type of interest in one's self or in one's associates via Wikipedia is putting the cart before the horse. Since we are all inherently biased towards ourselves, it is usually best to await the day when someone whom we have never met might choose to write such an article about ourselves, thus proving beyond a doubt that such a neutral interest does indeed exist."

<li><b>Save</b> Encyclopedia- a reference work offering comprehensive information on all or specialized areas of knowledge. As long as the data is appropriate for all ages, it should be fine. After looking through your “deletion policies,” I have found nothing on “Mandarin Tigers” that has violated these rules. If you could be so kind to try and point them out. So far the only thing I have seen on this deletion entry is: “Wikipedia is not for things thought up in class.” Shows how well you examine things before deletion. Show me a quote where you thought that this creature was “made up in class.” Also, how do you think most scientific theories were created? Didn’t Einstein create his 4 theories while working at a patent office? And the very internet that this site depends on? Some person even went so far as to call it a hoax. I’ll just speculate that none of you have even seen Bergen, so I will rest my case that you have no idea what you are talking about.</li>

<p>1. <b>Primary (original) research-</b> The Tiger wasn’t my idea, but I did research it. 2. <b>Original inventions-</b> Its not my invention. 3. <b>Critical reviews-</b> The entry is kept strictly unbiased. <b>4. 5. and 6.</b> have nothing to do with the Mandarin Tiger entry <b>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers-</b> It is a fact that tigers appear at Bergen Catholic, and many people are interested in the subject. Who is a more reputable publisher then an eyewitness to every single event? <b>A fact is an actual state of affairs, which can be an historical event, or a social or natural phenomenon-</b> Mandarin Tiger spawning are not only a piece of history for Bergen Catholic, but is a social and natural phenomenon as well. <b>One common temptation for young editors is the urge to share new phrases, fashions, or ideas that they or their friends have invented. Writing an article on Wikipedia might seem like a great way to do this -- after all, if you enjoy this new fad, won't other people appreciate it too?-</b> Mandarin tigers are not a fad. The entry on them does not explain how to create one in great detail, and only is listed in order to give some background. We are not encouraging people to create them, just explaining the history.</p>

It is more than debateable that if a unicorn no matter of its fame, being a mystical creature conjured in the imagination of another...a "original idea" if you will which falls under the policy of deletion as do all the topics that i gave the links to, that a mandarin tiger is a myth just the same which becasue of all in favors of deletions opinion of the topic it is in violation of the deletion policy. I propose that though this (mandarin tiger) is a myth,, your unicorns and leprechauns are just the same, and so in since the only difference between them is that you wish to delete our myth and keep another, and that ours is not as widespread in fame but then again the only way for the Mandarin Tiger to gain the reputation of the unicorn it must be spread to the public through sites such as this as a historical myth of a real place: Bergen Catholic High School case closed -Peter Coyne <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.99.10 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.81.99.10.html" title="User talk:67.81.99.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.99.10_a397.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.99.10">contribs</a>) 02:57, 9 May 2006.</small></p>

How would you seriously expect anyone to believe your little "study" on Wikipedia? Other encyclopedias don't need you volunteers because they can't be changed. "Volunteer Fact-checkers?" Did you think of that clever title all by yourself? I hope you do realize that anyone with the mentality of a five-year-old could run this site. My "prank" wastes their time? Anyone who thinks being a "volunteer fact-checker" is something cool to do, they obviously have way too much time already. As for it being a prank, everyone has still failed to prove it so. Its interesting how you all leave a comment and then run away from the computer so that you don't see how much you are ripped apart in these entries. <i><b>WHY DON'T YOU CHECK THE WHOLE PAGE, AND THEN COMMENT.</b></i> Or is even that out of your aptitude for reading? And if you think one organized tiger page is too much for Wiki to handle, try a thousand angry students with all the time they want during school to paste little Mandarins into every single Wiki article. Your blocks are too easy to skirt anyway, so don't think you are protected. AA Savage 17:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, the study that showed that Wikipedia is legitimate is a real study. It was in a lot of magazines, for example: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html" class="external free" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html</a>. The "Mandarin Tiger" is not an actual creature. I am basing this assertion on the fact that there is no record of it existing anywhere. By nothing I mean no scientific studies, no captured specimins, no published papers, etc. It is your job to prove that this creature is real, not the job of the fact checkers to prove that it isn't. I am willing to believe that the Mandarin Tiger is an idea that is important to your high school. But this is too small a group to support its inclusion as an entry on Wikipedia. Also, saying that being a fact-checker is a waste of time is very judgmental of you. What do you do with your free time that is so important? <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 20:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>See, now you go and waste my time. If you read the above, then you would realize that the "Mandarin tigers aren't real argument" has already been tried by you Wiki people, and destroyed. Once you delete all the other mystical creatures entries, then you can come back. Again, it is not a hoax, as we all have said before, it is a historical document, that is updated as required.

<li>It isn't that they are fictional. As I said, it is because it is not a fictional creature believed in by a large enough group. Dragons, unicorns, etc., have been a part of world cultures for thousands of years. Even the Flying Spagetti Monster has thousands of people who use it as a cultural reference. Look at that website if you want something to model yours on - they do not claim that the FSM is real, only that it has relevance to a large segment of society. They explain exactly what the idea behind it is and link to a <i>large</i> amount of outside sources that have referred to it. But the Mandarin Tiger still doesn't qualify because is only relevant to a handful of people and therefore not important enough to merit an entry. I agree with the person above who suggested it as a <b>subcategory</b> on your high school page. But your argument that because there are other fictional creatures on the site you can make up whatever you want is not a valid argument.<a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 21:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tsk Tsk Tsk. How many contradictions can one man possible make? "The "Mandarin Tiger" is not an actual creature. I am basing this assertion on the fact that there is no record of it existing anywhere. By nothing I mean no scientific studies, no captured specimins, no published papers, etc. It is your job to prove that this creature is real, not the job of the fact checkers to prove that it isn't." Well then you can prove the unicorns are real. "As I said, it is because it is not a fictional creature believed in by a large enough group." Stop changing your mind, it doesn't help your argument. How is it not important enough? Last time I checked, there wasn't a restriction on how many people had to know about it. Don't make up rules. Also, if you don't consider an entire school, then how many people should have to know about this. And as for your website, all I found was some statistics that did not prove your argument, and some jokes aimed at Wiki. "almost as accurate as the online Encyclopaedia Britannica, at least when it comes to science." First of all, wasn't your statement "And they did a study that showed that Wikipedia is more accurate that Encyclopedia Britannica." Not more, but less. And take a look at that last part of the Magazine quote: "at least when it comes to science." Why would it be science? Whats wrong with histo. . . . Oh Yeah! that's right . . . . Wikipedia doesn't like Mr. Seigenthaler. Where were your "Volunteer Fact-checkers" then? My counter-point, not argument, was that you can't exclude certain animals, because they are more recent. Once again, the Mandarin Tiger is a historcal entry, not a fictional hoax. Everything on that entry is true. And adding things to the Bergen Catholic entry never worked, everything tried has been deleted. Believe me when I say that one Mandarin Tiger page isn't a problem, compared to thousands all over the entire site. Scroll up BJAODN. I have already told you why my entry doesn't break these rules. How do you all edit pages, if you don't know the first thing about reading. Here's a tip: start from the top and go down.

<li>I was wondering if you would actually read the article. You are absolutely right, the article only deals with the scientific articles of Wikipedia. But the goal of the people who treat Wikipedia seriously is to make it as accurate as possible in ALL areas. That is not an unreasonable goal because there are sites like Urban Dictionary for people who just want to have fun. It is unreasonable and immature for you to argue that because other people vandalize (and get caught) your site should be allowed to stay. Also, I don't think you understand the difference between the mythical creatures articles on Wikipedia and the mandarin tiger article. Regarding the unicorn article as an example - the unicorn article does not refer to it as a real creature. It refers to it as a "legendary creature" and does not use the definate language that is used in the mandarin tiger article. Unicorn horns are "said to" have healing powers, but your mandarin tigers "can" fly and become invisible. It seems like a minor thing but changes the whole tone from one of scientific skepticism to baseless assertions. Maybe if you phrased things that way on the school article people would stop taking them down, but I looked through the page's history and didn't see the attempts that you were talking about. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 23:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If I say so myself, I persoanlly think that Wikipedia is extremly corrupt and bias towards what they allow on their website. You guys are very hypocritical when you allow unicorns and such to be on the site yet you exclude the Mandarin Tigers. Also, i would like to ask a few questions: Are livestrong bands a school carze, fad, and a fashion? Yes they in fact are considering I walk around the halls at school and about one in three kids has one. On this note, has there been scientific reaserch, a book, or an academic paper published on a livestrong bad? No, there has not. So why should it be allowed on Wikipedia. Oh and... if anyone thinks that livestrong bands are legitimatly on this site because Nike has written numerous magazine articles on it, then whats stopping Nike from writing any old article to be posted on Wikipedia. What I am saying is: Wikipedia says that it wants to obtain the sum of all human knowledge when in fact a "Mandarin Tiger" is part of the sum of all human knowledge. I think you should change that to "the sum of only a select few 'Fact-checkers' knowledge", which in my opinion, is not much at all.&#160;;) 24.56.143.101 00:26, 10 May 2006 (UTC)Chris, Thaureaux (Long live the Mandarin Tigers!)</p>
<p>The livestrong band was widely published in verifiable sources. This exists in only one high school. We are trying to have a credible and reliable encyclopedia, and allowing a craze that exists in only one school to be here does little towards that end. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 00:36, 10 May 2006 (UTC) , I'm leaving this discussion, as many people here refuse to be convinced no matter what reason we provide.

<li>Check and Mate. "But the goal of the people who treat Wikipedia seriously is to make it as accurate as possible in ALL areas." Thanks, I believe that Mandarin Tigers fall under the category of "ALL areas." Here is something for you: www.reading-tutors.com Try that for a month or two then come back here. How and where did you find anything remotely close to "It is unreasonable and immature for you to argue that because other people vandalize (and get caught) your site should be allowed to stay." in my statements? The only thing I ever said about vandalism, was that in the magazine article you gave me, there were jokes played on Wiki. Anything else you get from that sentence means that you have some sort of hallucinatory disorder. I see what you mean with the sentence structure, which I fixed, however, many people edit that page, so I lose track of what the original entry was like. That's what you fact-checkers are for right? You should make sure it stays in the proper context, and if it isn't then change it. As for the school article, it has been tried to add a <b>Culture</b> section, but to no avail. In conclusion, quit pointedly skipping over some of my points, and only answering the ones you can. It doesn't say much for your comprehensive skills. And for you "Grandmaster" what material were livestrong bands published in? A shopping catalogue? "does little towards that end." but it does do something. "as many people here refuse to be convinced no matter what reason we provide." HA-HA Reason? you mean you and your Wiki buddies going "l00k t3h WP:NFT!!! t3h 5k00l cr4z3!!!" Meanwhile we actually respond to this, and then you skip right merrily over it, and put up warnings for people not to enter their thoughts, because YOU ARE BEING SHREDDED!!

<p><b>Save</b> - Everyone opposed to this article keeps dodging the fact that there are other made up characters that are on Wiki. And you claim that they are there because they have a lot more people that believe in them. BIG DEAL, more people will catch on to the Mandarin Tiger, just like they did for the first "warlock" or whatever.

<li>Right! Warlock started as an idea; so does Mandarin Tiger. But Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought, so Mandarin Tiger can't start here.

<li><i><b>Save'</b></i>: The mandarin tiger is not a hoax. You cannot say that simply because you've never heard of it before. True it is a made up creature but there is a myth of a mandarin tiger Bergen Catholic. Let me just say this. How do you think we know about the cultures of the few still uncivilized groups of natives and tribes left in the world? (and by uncivilized i just mean they are untouched by modern society) People go out and study them. And that is just what we are doing with the myth of the mandarin tiger. Maybe it isnt real but all we are doing is studying the myth and recording it for posterity. You say that not enough people belive in it, well how about a school of almost a thousand, when those tribes i said earlier only had 1 or 2 people studying them? The only way more people will know about those tribes or the mandarin tiger is if it is allowed to be recorded where people see it.

I could conceivably add any show I wanted, becauzse there's no way to really check.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting reference, as noted above. I believe this has survived AFD before, too.

<li><b>Delete</b>, no context or citations. Either original research, or a direct lift from whatever website originated the Westphall Universe 'family tree'.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Aside from being completely unsourced, the logic upon which the universe is based is fundamentally flawed. I have not seen a reliable source supporting the existence of the "universe" from a factual standpoint (quotes from producers or writers on these shows) or a sound, convincing logical articulation of how and why Tommy Westphall dreamed all these shows. The whole concept is the domain of "wouldn't it be cool if" and is completely speculative.

<p>The linked to article does not appear to relate to the article. No google results about "torrent shocking". Bittorrent is designed in such a way it is not possible to place different material in a torrent than that which it was originally supposed to contain, or at least there has been no reported cracks have occured.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../b/i/t/BitTorrent_9cbd.html" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, but this needs a thermonuclear-grade cleanup before that: currently, this is just unsourced <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> and a neologism, too. Plus, P2P poisoning is hardly a new idea, and as the nom says, BT is a bit more resilient to that, due to a robust protocol and lack of centralised index... I'd be interested to see if anyone has researched BitTorrent's actual resilience against P2P poisoning, though, so as a part of BT article, this might have some value. Just rewrite it. Pretty much. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I looked quite hard to see if BT poisioning is possible. Doing it would involve first cracking SHA1, which while theoretically performed hasn't been practically done yet. If it was, quite a lot of other programs would be in trouble, for example most linux distributions use it to sign packages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrjeff_93a8.html" title="User:Mrjeff">Mrjeff</a> (<a href="../../../m/r/j/User_talk%7EMrjeff_98a3.html" title="User talk:Mrjeff">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrjeff_dd55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrjeff">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>Ok, so it's <i>hard</i>.

<p>This article has no use and is on a non-notable topic. It doesn't even need to be transwikied as this is not a definition of a word, nor of a phrase that cannot be understood from its constituent parts, both of which (<a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza.html" title="Pizza">Pizza</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box.html" title="Box">Box</a>) have their own definitions already. It is not possible to give a cultural history of the pizza box, nor its current cultural impact: it's a box; it contains pizza; that's it. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 16:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'll point out by comparison that <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popcorn_bag.html" title="Popcorn bag">popcorn bag</a> survived AfD because there were citations showing that it was a bit of technological pioneering that influenced the industry.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The song has a good number of Google hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">80 for "el kondor pada"</a> and even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">254 for "el condor pada"</a>. Unfortunately they're almost all in Serbian, so I can't read them, but they do seem to indicate the song is notable. Serbia is not the most Internet-wired country, and half the country uses <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic.html" title="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> (including, presumably, the most anti-NATO parts, so there are probably even better searches that can be done), so over 300 links is notable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 18:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can vouch and translate, if you trust me&#160;:) See, the thing is that we can't link to most "references" because they include links to mp3 songs and lyrics, which are probably not most appropriate for us, because of the copyright issues. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 18:32, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>What does the site say about the song's notability? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First of all, it's from '99, during the war, and it says that "Popular group Indexovo (radio) pozorište" already recorded songs and videos that are satirical, including <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_kondor_pada.html" title="El kondor pada">El kondor pada</a>, Ja sam ja, Oni su oni, and that they are available on mp3.co.yu&#160;:) Anyway, the song was recorded, apparently the video was shot too, <b>it is</b> notable. Indexovo radio pozorište is not as popular as Monthy Python, but it's nevertheless as popular as things in Serbia get. So please, do understand that standards of popularity for art in English cannot apply to other, relatively small, countries and cultures. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 18:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, existence is not notability. Did it get used at political rallies? Was it a popular hit? <i>That</i> is notability. And I'm talking about popularity within Serbian-speaking areas. How many records did it sell, and how does that compare to other record sales in the region? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:44, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The song was released during the war, and as you can imagine, nobody kept top charts in the country at the time (not that they do otherwise). The song was used on protests, and was popular on the radio. The song, however, was later released on two compilations of songs by "Indexovo radio pozorište" (as they are not a musical group, they don't really release albums), namely "Gotov je!" and "Oproštajni koncert". Once again, sales are not kept track of in Serbia. As this is a political song, about a war, made during the war, it's not really normal to have it in your CD player. Prominent Serbian daily newspaper Glas Javnosti, released it as mp3 at <a href="http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.co.yu/audio/audio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.co.yu/audio/audio.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. The CD's where it was released are available on most Serbian on-line shops. You have to understand that the song was recorded during a freaking war, not much entertainment information was posted online at the time, and Serbia simply has no public record of sales or charts. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 19:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>(Not intentionally putting words in Zoe's mouth, but) ... and is there a page of text, anywhere, in any language, in print or on the Web, that we can reference, that says that? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 19:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said before, I can't find online sources. The song was released during a war, Indexovo radio pozorište stopped working in 2003. But, do you really think that all of us who were in Serbia back than are lying? Everything in the article is verifiable, and if I were in Serbia and had extra time, I'd try to call radio stations and ask them. There are many notable things which simply aren't source online. However, the song is referenced a lot and apparantly everyone from Serbia here knows it. I personally hate the song, and I think making songs during a war is disrespectful to the victims, but I was nevertheless constantly exposed to it. And again, this is not a song by a popular band, it's a satirical, political song created by a theater group. There are no charts or sales numbers for it (mind that if you wanted such info for any Serbian music-related article, we wouldn't have any). --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 19:55, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not an article about a pop hit, which would need proof of "popularity" to be included. It's locally well-known political satirical song about a relevant historic event, one of the most notable examples of Serbian propaganda war against NATO in 1999. The lack of online sources which would say anything remarkable about the song is simply not reason enough to delete it.

<dd>Well, maybe. But this reporter was presumably living in Belgrade in those days, talking to Serbs, listening to the radio etc. If this song was so hugely popular, why would he not mention it? Surely it would be juicy tidbit for his readers. Anyway, the point is, clearly one can find Western newspapers writing about Serbian humor during the war. So, presumably, if this song was popular, one ought to find a mention of it in some newspaper, somewhere. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:17, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You have not answered me weather you dispute the notability of Indexovci; there are <b>no guidelines</b> for notability of a song on wikipedia. However, a prominent song of a notable band should be notable. I can offer several links poiting to this. First link, from balkan repository project:<a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> - song is included in 3 Index hits during NATO war.Second, they have published 'oprostajni koncert' on which this song is one of their 10 choices (the main hits of theirs) - it is a fairwall sort of compilation, so this testifies about the importance of the song for indexovci; you can google it, for instance here it is sold,<a href="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" class="external autonumber" title="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" rel="nofollow">[33]</a><a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 20:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To quote it: <i>There is consensus that the vast majority of songs do not deserve an article specifically devoted to them. Most songs should redirect to another relevant article, such as on the album the song was originally released on, or the artist in question. Songs should only have an individual article if there is enough verifiable material to warrant a detailed article. If a song has a body of published criticism, the song should probably have an article on Wikipedia. Even if a song is otherwise notable, there is no reason to start an article which can only say the name of the song and who performed it.</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, if that is a criterion, than it is more relevant that it has some individual relevance than that if it was a hit. The relevance of the song is that it was an expression of a spirit of defiance during the war. That is larger cultural connotation. This context is confirmed in the links provided - the balkan repository project about nato art, the article in Serbian above (explaining the context) as well as what people from the Balkans say. It is not <b>just any</b> song or even hit. It is a song with much more background and significance than <i>just a name and who preformed it</i>. The relevance of this song indeed is greater for Serbian (and other Balkan) people because of this larger social context - it was a phenomenon that it illustrates that makes it notable. This is what makes it different from other songs, and this is, as you can see, why people care about it. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:03, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are searching incorrectly. Try to put quotes in your search box, as in "el condor pada", and that will look for that specific word sequence, which is of course what we need for the song title. This way, we get on Google:
<ul>

<dd>Quotes??? Why you little... Why don't we just put question marks at each end and see how many hits we'll get. Internet doesn't follow YOUR rules, and not everyone puts quotes at the beginning and at the end of a certain title of the song. Your quotes mean nothing to me, just look at how many times the word <i>el condor pada</i> or <i>el kondor pada</i> appears when you type it in without the quotes. My golly, people will really think of anything to push their agenda... --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 22:54, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The quotes on google mean you search for exact phrase. So, indeed, there are less hits, but there are still hundreds of hits. And some links, like this one (a very relevant link) do not have "pada" at all: <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" rel="nofollow">[36]</a></dd>
<dd>You misunderstand. Enclosing a sequence of words in quotes simply means that Google is looking for the words in that specific sequence. It does not mean that actual quotes must be present for there to be a hit. Your searches without quotes will return all pages that mention el, condor and pada somewhere in the text, not necessarily together. Please educate yourself on how Google works. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 23:00, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's possible. Google works in strange ways sometimes. When I click on the links I inserted, I get 77 and 25 (slight change from before), but I cannot guarantee that everyone will get the same thing.

<dd>Look, I am no expert, but here is one possible explanation, based on information from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_platform.html" title="Google platform">Google platform</a>. When a user does a Google search, he actually connects to one of the servers which is closest to him. These servers, located all over the world, are not completely synchronized, so it would be possible for two users located in different places to get a different number of hits. This is especially true in this case since, as the title "El Condor Pada" was recently created in Wikipedia and is now being picked up by all Wikipedia mirrors, the number of hits should be continually going up. So, that is one possible explanation. Am I certain this is the case? No, so take it for what it's worth. Feel free to change the number of hits to reflect what you are seeing at your end. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 01:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>actually, there is non milosevic press and it does mention indexovci and the song. but it is really a little of it available even on the wayback machine - this was in 1999; a link above from the article in 1999 was provided, i am trying to dig up some more, but wayback machine is slow. Note that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not ask for such strong proofs of notability, and I would like to see if any other articles have been scrutinized with such attitude of disbelief. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know about other songs, but this song is clearly different, since the main argument for having an article about it is its supposed great political and propaganda significance. Well, if it was so great and all, one ought to be able to find some mention of it in newspapers of the time, or in books about the Kosovo war. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:53, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And the song is mentioned in such sources. However, the old newspapers, let alone books, are not available online (and why would all sources have to be online?) - try for instance searching for 1999 serbian newspapers on wayback machine (like major newspapers - politika.co.yu, blic.co.yu; or freeb92 station etc) to see how little is archived even there; Here is one source, online, that is about art during NATO agression and it gives the song in question as an important example of it:</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see that Albanian users are mobile here - saying that song is not notable. What evidence you present to that? Serbian users (and users from Slovenia/Croatia etc) that were exposed to radio broadcasts of this song certainly can comment on its significance. They can testify about the song and what they lived through and point out to relevant things. However, the votes of Albanians (who presumably did not hear about the song, which is not at all surprising given that they are living a completely separate lives, and were not exposed to any of the Belgrade radio stations, which did not play in Kosovo, and share little culturally with Serbo-Croat speaking part of the Yugoslavia) are merely asserting that a song is non-notable (I am not able to judge what Albanian song is notable, and would not make such unfounded claim) - for reasons, which I strongly suspect have more to do with serbophobia than honest opinion. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 22:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mention of the song in English newspapers and in books about the Kosovo war would be fine as well.

<dd>Weather the song is mentioned in English press, I do not know. I think Serbian newspapers are stored in few libraries <b>outside</b> serbia, if at all. However, they are available probably in the major national library; some people might store the papers themself - I have a whole bunch of newspapers at my home in Serbia (I live abroad though, and cannot browse them until I go there on holiday), but some other people from Serbia might be able to do it. It is not a small task to browse through the old newspapers though if one does not keep them - since there is probably few libraries that have them. Asking by e-mail the group itself would be the best way to get the references, as they are probably aware of that. See their site <a href="http://www.agitprop.co.yu/irp-web/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agitprop.co.yu/irp-web/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> and write to indexovo@eunet.yu &lt;indexovo@eunet.yu&gt; and ask them about the song references in the media directly. It is probably the shortest way to check it - if you want to make a good faith effort to come to the bottom of this, the best thing is to ask them directly (they do speak english, I am sure). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 23:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you elaborate.

Also, what do you have to say about aking Indexovci themself about the media mentions of the song on indexovo@eunet.yu - it is a way to verify the claims that the song was indeed used on rallies, that it was broadcasted, to check the copyright status of the lyrics/ask permission etc - they can provide you with the data, since you are not satisfied with what users here are claiming; not all sources have to be online, and then, a claim that such and such a paper contains such and such a thing, verifiable in principle, can be established. And what do you think about the claim that you place an undue burden here? What exactly you want to verify, and how does it follow from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> policies or policies relevant for AfD <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 23:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So far all I have seen are links saying that the song exists and that people liked it, not that it was notable. And it is the responsibility of people making a claim to contact those who might prove the validity of the claim, but just contacting the group who recorded it would probably only get their own inflated feelings of importance. Is there a journalist we can contact? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:48, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was suggesting to verify the claim <b>that there were radio broatcasts</b>, <b>that the media mentioned the song</b> etc. by asking them for references, not opinion; If you distrust all Sebrs whatsoever, that not only violates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but also makes it difficult to make any arguments at all. For instance, do you dispute the <b>notability of Indexovci</b>? Unlike for songs, there is accepted guideline for that; I have provided a detailed explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" rel="nofollow">on the talk page</a>. per that guidelines. So, do you agree, per evidence presented (newspaper links with indexovci etc - it has been detailed there) that <b>Indeksovci</b> are notable. And then, the question is what kind of notability about the song you ask to be proved? If it is broadcasting on the media, yes, it has been broadcasted a lot, <s>for instance, on b92 (site freeb92)</s> and one can check with the radio stations that people who claim popularity listened to in bunkers. You can verify it by emailing the radio stations. It is an undue burden to ask people to prove it in a way you do, just to provide means of proving it, as a reference etc. And asking a site is a valid mean - it works that for copyright issues with regard to pictures - providing a way to check copyright status. Why should there be higher burden of verifiability of claims that we make here. Anyone, who doubts it, can ask the radio station about what songs were broadcasted. Given a reference which is not online, it is not a burden of those who reference it to scan it for those who want to see - they have a means to check it, and assume good faith until a reference proves to be bogus. Isnt it that way that it works for copyright issues? Why it would be different for other sources, which are not online? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 00:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What motivated you is of no importance. You can ask for evidence, but I am saying that there is a policy here [WP:AGF]. Also, please state your concerns <b>clearly and explicitly</b>, so that there is no misunderstanding.</dd>
<dd>I have put a detailed argument on notability of the band on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, per criteria. The notability of the band does not seem to be disputed - they meet several criteria, and reliable sources have been given, as required (media articles discussing them are one example, then their numerous tours etc). So, the argument now seems to be not about notability of the band, that is established, but just about the song - and song itself has relevance; there are no accepted notability criteria, so I ask those who dispute the song's notability to state what they ask from a song to be notable. Then we can check how these criteria are applied in wikipedia, and I would ask that <b>same standard</b> be applied. Also, those who claim song is notable, would at least know what they have to prove to those who are saying that it is not notable. So, please, list your cirteria for notability, and we can then proceed discussion in a constructive way - we have to know what we are talking about, and to see bottom of the dispute about notability here; I would want to know what needs to be shown, and then, the sources can be provided (though not all will be online, but that is allowed as far as I understand) <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 02:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Or, even better, write a separate article Shooting down of the F-117A stealth fighter in 1999 during the Kosovo War or some equivalent title, and describe exactly how that happened, with a section devoted to its propaganda, cultural and political consequences. Nobody is attempting to blot that event out of Wikipedia. In fact, given how many Wikipedians seem to feel so emotional about that event, I am actually quite suprised that such an article has not been written already. Anyway, the entire argument here is whether the <b>song</b> merits its own article, according to the rather strict criteria Wikipedia sets for having articles about songs.

<dd>There is <i>no accepted policy on notability of songs</i>, and the proposal that you quoted (it is just a proposal for a guideline, nothing more), says that song has to have greater sociological relevance, and more content and context to it than just a title and authors.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it is high time to see what a proposal for a guideline (best that we have) says:</p>
<p>A song may be notable if it meets one or more of the following standards. If a song meets three or more of these standards, it is probably notable; if it meets two, it is a good candidate for notability, and if it meets one, it may border on notablity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has appeared in the Top 20 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It has been a hit during nato bombing in Serbia, so certainly one of the 20 - this can be checked by contacting by e-mail radio stations b92 (www.freeb92.net), radio index, etc. who can confirm that the song was played during the bombing extensively. Also, listed here <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> as one of the few examples of art in the NATO period (this link is perhaps more relevant in establishing media campagn); as there are no online links establishing popularity directly, verifiability can be best met with contacting the journalists - freeb92 is one of the most popular radio stations, and it is the way to proceed and confirm what Serbian people here say for those who dispute their claims.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Charted in the Top 100 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country, for at least six months (need not be consecutive)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure if this is formally met as there are probably not such charts, but in Serbia, it was popular for quite a few months during and after the bombing, well in the top 100; if there were some charts, it might be possible to dig them up - but system in Serbia is different, and what songs were broadcasted would be the best information that exists. But, under reasonable interpretation, this is clearly true.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a song that helped define a specific genre of music</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not the case</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is the signature song of a performer</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, index theatre have made few dozen songs, and this is one of their most well known. one can verify that from the index theatre themselves (contact e-mail address provided above). see also the deletion talk page where argument about this was made.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a historically notable song for being the first to do something interesting, stylistically or technologically</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>No</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Helped launch a notable record label</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>No</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been officially released in at least one remixed version and/or has been the subject of a music video that played on a major music network and/or was the subject of a major publicity campaign</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. It has been published on two compilations and there was a music video - as evidenced by the article from newspapers in '99, quoted above <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, that talks about music video being recorded, as well as a major publicity campaign - in fact, anti-nato sponsored propaganda effort; also evidenced in this newspapers article <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, corroborated by many users here.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been placed on a "best of" or "most influential" list from a major music media source</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not exactly sure what is meant here - probably not (what is a major music media source). It has been among "best of" (or the best of) Index songs, is one of the "best of" NATO-war songs, it is on the compilation Oprostajni koncert (evidence provided) but I am not sure if it meets formally the criterion. It was not considered "influential" in some musical sense though.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been downloaded a high number of times through digital download websites</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is also the case. Numerous tribute pages and mp3 links for it provided source for download, and it has been downloaded by many users in ex-Yu and Serbs in the world. However, what high number of times means, is relative. The exact quotes might be available from some sites, like nostalgija.com <a href="http://www.nostalgija.com/muzika/4967.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nostalgija.com/muzika/4967.php" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> - warning - this site has popups; it is a site where much of the ex-yu music can be downloaded (piracy or not - it is the way many people get music from such sites, and one can get a quote from them and get an idea about relative popularity of the song); there are other sites that offer free download, some mentioned above.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a particularly well-known song from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As Indexovci are also a comic theater troup, they have incorporated this song in piece of theatar - that is what they do with all of their songs. No quote yet though - might be available from the indexovci group directly; we have their e-mail, so this is verifiable. also, there is a video of their play with the songs - sold here, cover shown and a synopsis, testifying about this:<a href="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" class="external autonumber" title="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" rel="nofollow">[45]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The synopsis: <i>Snimak predstave u Banjaluci odrzane 2001 godine .Na ovoj kaseti cete cuti I sve ove pesme obrade -El kondor pada,Sta ce mi zivot bez tople vode,Narasli su dugovi,Kada pocnem drugi dnevnik ja,Madlenka,Ja sam ja I oni su oni,Mi smo mi,Donatori gde ste da ste,Govovi se da me vavas,Lepa li je Dano vlast u krugu dvojke,Taze tursija,Sanjala sam nocas da te nema,Zazmuri,Doslo je do krvi,Ne odlazim,Kad sam gladan,Igra ruski rulet srpska Jugoslavija,Zamislim zivot u kom enosis nove cipele,Prica o Bobi Vladackom,Kasno je za brzu prugu,Stranci u Peci</i></p>
<p>Translates: a recording of the play held in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banja_Luka_fddc.html" title="Banja Luka">Banja Luka</a> in 2001; you will get to hear their songs: El kondor pada (<b>notice it was listed first</b>), Sta ce mi zivot bez tople vode (what do I need life with no hot water), Narasli su dugovi (debts have grown)...(list of other songs performed during this musical play).</p>
<p>In short, it seems that there are quite a few criteria met, and some are completely documented at this point as well. So, it reiterates the notability claim; nothing to say of the larger war context. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 03:18, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. No need to set an example of this article, there's tens of thousands of articles without references which additionally <i>no one cares about</i>, so why not delete those instead of this one.

<li><b>Keep</b> and add a request for additional references as and when they can be produced.

<dl>
<dd>That is not what I said, and I think you know it perfectly well. There are on-line references listed, some of them fully establish points for notability; but not all of the points are established by on-line references. Popularity of the song is <b>not</b> confirmed in a way you want it by an online reference (if you dont count google hits), but it is verifiable, since one can check with the station. Other points are (for instance, claim that the song was part of a play - there is a recording of a play being sold; then that the song is Index theatre major song; than that there was a music video; that the song was used in media campagn etc.). But you insist that the popularity is to be proven - while providing contact address for the radio stations (like www.freeb92.net) is, especially for the purpose of this AfD, quite enough - just as providing means of checking copyright status of a picture is enough. Copyright issues were always greater concern for wikipedia than notability of some articles. And why would there be tags for notability etc. if any article that did not present the proofs for notability (and some have much, much less indications and proofs of notability than this article now has) would be imediately deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 17:32, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, note that only a few points are needed to judge song notable - one and it is on border of being notable, and three or more mean that song is notable, per the proposed guideline. This song satisfies more than enough points, and would not even depend on the popularity. So, it would be quite malicious not to take all this into account in judging notability of the song. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 17:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Notifiability and Verifiability do not have the same standards. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the content of an article must be verifiable: "Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources". Per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "a topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact". However, note that there is no requirement that <i>the notability</i> of a topic has to be verifiable in the sense of <i>already been published by reliable and reputable sources</i>. That's the standard we often use for both, but I think this is one of the few exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we have half a dozen Serbian editors giving first hand testimony that basically the entire country regularly heard the song in their bunkers; and we have a good number of links to the song in Google, considering the country and age of the song. Sure, we can't write that in the article - but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and given the fact that no one is denying it, and not giving any argument against it, we can take that as evidence of popularity. I'd be much happier if someone found an "already published" reference for popularity. But if not, the already published references for verifiability, plus this unpublished evidence of notability, should be sufficient; because the standards for the two are not the same. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 18:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact remains that we just don't have any verifiable sources for the song's notability. So, in my opinion the best way to resolve the issue for now is to merge the contents of this article into <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indexovo_radio_pozori%C5%A1te.html" title="Indexovo radio pozorište">Indexovo radio pozorište</a>. The article about that group, which has been shown to be notable, is a sad stub at this point and could use some content. Once verifiable sources are provided, the article can be created again. Let me again quote the first two sentences of the guideline, with my emphasis added: <i>There is consensus that the vast majority of songs do not deserve an article specifically devoted to them. Most songs should</i> <b>redirect to another relevant article</b>, <i>such as on the album the song was originally released on</i>, <b>or the artist in question</b>. <i>Songs should only have an individual article if there is enough</i> <b>verifiable</b> <i>material to warrant a detailed article</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there is plenty of <b>verifiable</b> <i>material to warrant a detailed article</i>. The only thing that isn't verifiable is notability. But there isn't any doubt of notability, given the testimony of the editors, and the many Google sites. Given that, I don't believe <i>verifiable sources for notability</i> are required. That's my whole point. Verifiable sources are required for all information in the article, and the article must be about a notable topic, but the notability merely needs to be true, not verifiable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 19:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But is that testimony entirely accurate? How can we be sure? For example, some editors claimed above that supposedly B92 radio played this song all during the war. However, that radio was actually closed down by the Milosevic regime on April 2, 1999 (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990424073033/http://www.b92.net/" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19990424073033/http://www.b92.net/" rel="nofollow">archived internet page</a>), and only reopened in 2000 (according to information on <a href="../../../b/9/2/B92.html" title="B92">B92</a>). Could someone care to explain this discrepancy? (the F-117 was shot down on March 27) <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>IIRC, B92 was taken over by government, not closed down. The old team formed Radio FreeB92 and regained the control of B92 only after Milosevic was deposited. I don't know when and how long the pro-government B92 broadcasted.</dd>
<dd>But that's slightly beside the point. All of the editors from the wider cultural area, from different countries and different political positions, people who are often in disagreement over minute details of articles about local affairs, says that this song was popular and notable. Yet you continue to doubt them and bring up small incosistencies in their acconts of events which occurred 7 years ago.</dd>
<dd>May I ask on what grounds? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 20:45, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Simple. On Wikipedia, you cannot source facts based on the testimony of anonymous editors. I find it puzzling that some contributors to this discussion are unable to understand this. My demonstration here simply served to illustrate how memories are imperfect, facts can get mixed up, emotions can get the upper hand, guesses might be made about facts which turn out to be wrong. This is why <b>verifiable</b> sources are essential. Don't take it personally.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:09, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it is not about sourcing <b>facts</b> in the article, it is about judging notability. And confirmation for some points on the guideline do exist even online (see the talk page), while other claims can be verified by checking what was broadcasted (regarding popularity, though major broadcasts are just part of popularity, as the whole phenomenon of cult movies etc. is a sort of underground popularity - how is that to be checked?)<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>For the record: the only user who mentioned b92 was me, as a suggestion how to check the claims of those who were listening the song in those times, simply because it was the first radio station to come to mind. I personally was not in Serbia at the time, and was suggesting how to check the claims of users who were. And journalists of b92 might still be able to say weather the song was played in Serbia and to what extent, but it seems that contacting other radio stations might be more relevant (someone who was in Serbia during the bombing can say which stations). That I suggested b92 does not change what they said at all. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 20:54, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, as far as I know, when a song in Serbia is popular, it will be broadcasted at most radio stations (if they play that type of music at all - some stations for instance do not play folk music etc.), so my guess is that any Belgrade radio station would do; and probably B92 has some of the evidence too. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here is a very specific statement you made: <i>If it is broadcasting on the media, yes, it has been broadcasted a lot, for instance, on b92</i>. So you asserted it has been broadcasted a lot on b92. That assertion is wrong, but it was allowed to stand. No Serbian editor corrected it, even though if they were in Serbia they must have known that B92 was taken off the air, as this was a very big deal at the time and even I remember it being mentioned in Western press. Like it or not, this demonstration of one inaccuracy in your facts puts a dent in the credibility of your other claims. In the light of this, I again insist that <b>verifiable sources</b> are essential, and we cannot just take the word of anonymous editors for notability, as shown here. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:14, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is it wrong? As I said, any popular song would be broadcasted at most stations, and that B92 was taken over does not change that. I still think that it was broadcasted there by the new station policy; however, others are in better position to say it. In efect, in that paragraph I was making an argument for verifying the claims about song being popular that were already made. The fact that such claims can be verified still stands. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The notability of the song (a satirical song during the war, not ordinary music hit) lies in its sociological relevance - it was sort of a chief resistance song during the war. So, it is actually more notable than the compilation itself. Also, please see the criteria listed to judge songs and how this song fits into them on the talk page of this deletion page. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Would you please read the article before voting? There are no singles, there is no band, it's a theater troop which often performs songs and sometimes publishes them. Anyway, probably no single of any kind was released in Serbia since 1980s, especially not while the country was at war with NATO. This is not a popular commercial hit, it wasn't even available in stores when it came out. It was a political statement and is notable and became popular because of that.

<dd>Can we stop with all these inaccurate guesses already?

<dd>Balcer, when El kondor pada was released, B92 did not exist. It was raided by the police on the night the war started, and it didn't come back to life till after the war. Most newspapers, except for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politika.html" title="Politika">Politika</a>, were coming out irregularly, and usually had 4-5 pages (just to give you the perspective of media at the time). Second of all, Indexovo radio pozorište is not a pop band. They don't release records, but they do have some compilations. P.S. the only single from ex-Yu I remember during the 1990s was by Van Gogh, somewhere around 1997. It was not a commercial endevour though. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 21:45, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Since you are the first to come up with the claim that "that no records were produced in Serbia during the 1990s", you will have to find evidence yourself. "Produced records" are not "released singles". From the death of vynil singles until the age of cheap independent production of CDs, only albums were released in Yugoslavia and later Serbia. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 21:48, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right, I took <i>singles</i> to mean <i>records</i>. My mistake. My point was to suggest that maybe the Serbian music industry was not in such disarray in the 1990s as some people claim. For example, why is there such certainty that there were no music charts, so that this song could not be ranked?

<li><b>Comment</b> Here's just something for people to chew: Should the verifiability criteria put as the question "can verifiable third-party sources be found?", or the question "is there a <i>possibility</i> that verifiable third-party sources can be found?" It's almost like the question on Original Research: "Are there sources?" vs. "<i>Can</i> the statements be sourced?" I'm personally always leaning on the latter of these interpretations: It's not OR if something <i>can</i> be sourced to some work, it's Verifiable if the primary source exists, and there's a <i>possibility</i> that some independent source will show up and verify the claims.<br />
These rules are in Wikipedia to stop crackpots from pushing their theories as undisputedly valid knowledge. The rules aren't meant to stop discussing cult fictional works - that's what <i>notability criteria</i> is for! What I'm seeing here is trying to delete a work by simply stacking charges: we're proposing the article's deletion as a matter of <i>technicality</i>. "You can't verify this." The way I see is this: <i>Could</i> a reputable game magazine cover this game? (I'm guessing someone might already have.) <i>Could</i> some notable blogger review this game, for example? (Probably, and may already have.) <i>Could</i> some researcher go and conduct a methodical study of EO's player base? Now, you can ask these questions, and answer is a definite "maybe". Ask similar sort of questions about some crackpot scientific theory, and you get a definite "hell no, not even probable". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For the record, that was a statement I really regret making (as can be seen by anyone who takes a look at my user page), because I knew it would be twisted, and this AfD clearly shows it was. I'm <b>NOT NOT NOT</b> advocating <i>complete</i> lack of verifiable sources, just that <i>if the subject has provided statistics</i>, they can be considered verified (and this is what the verifiability criteria does concur with!). Further, this was a case where such thing was <i>present and forward-looking:</i> The game existed, it had statistics, and people <i>could</i> go there and research it further. I believe that particular principle was applicable in the AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Endless_Online_%282nd_nomination%29_80bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Endless Online (2nd nomination)">I used it in</a>, because we were talking about a case where there was absolutely <i>no reason not to believe</i> the statistics put forth by <i>the subject of the article.</i> That AfD was about a net game, where this was pretty much clear-cut: The game publishes live statistics, we should believe them unless there's documented evidence to contrary. However, <i>this</i> AfD is a bit different: The article doesn't really provide any such evidence of popularity from the primary source, and the claims are vague. This is same as no sources <i>at all</i>, which is <i>not</i> fine with me. Also, this article deals with a <i>past</i> event; it's not something that can simply be verified by sending in the researchers and letting things observe the supposedly popular phenomenon.

<dd>Dzoni has been a disruptive user, and Zocky blocked him for the insults that he had thrown (on nationalist basis). However, he is Serbian (judging by his knowledge of the language, and other things) - was communism vandal Serbian? I find it curious - I will take a look who is the original communism vandal. To me, Dzoni seems to be a very bitter Serbian user, who has lost his house in Croatia and a nationalist, I dont know abut the other stuff. But this is not relevant for this particular discussion, as enough users from the area (Zocky, Dijxtra - Slovene and a Croat), and Serbian editors (dcabrilo, bolmagurski etc) have made the case. I dont think that Dzoni has helped this cause much (even if he started the article) because of his disruptive behaviour, and in fact it seems that this has probably played the role in the first hasty deletion (which went against the majority keep votes). But an article has its place irrespectively of who started it. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 02:04, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hence, this notability must be shown with verifiable sources, in accordance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 03:01, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dont you think you are streching things here? There are reasons why there are guidelines (too many songs for instance) and this song is not the one to be eliminated in the first place. But besides, the notability has been established for some points with online references already, and verifiability is provided for the other claims (refering to band and the ststions); so even if you were right, much has been done (and even verifiability of the content does not have to be established in short time - per deletion policy, placing tags like {fact} is the right response, and listing for AfD is only a <b>last resort</b>). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 03:57, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are still missing a key piece of the equation here. If you want to prove notability this way, <b>you</b> should write to the email address of the station in question, receive a response confirming the notability of the song (for example information on how often it has been played), and post it here. Then invite others to check if they doubt your verification. At this point you are even assuming that the radio station will answer emails, but what if they will not? <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:15, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are enough pieces even without verifying the popularity - there are more elements to notability of a song (per proposed guidelines) than just popilarity. And I disagree with you what verifiability means. Saying that a public broadcaster has broadcasted something is verifiable per se, as it is a public information. Saying that portugese (or polish) television has broadcasted some series or TV show in the 60s or 70s might also not have any on-line references, but people will not question good faith of those who remember this and enter such things into the article. Such information is verifiable since there are documents about it, as public information. Verifi<i>ability</i> does not require what you claim, and that poit was already made to you. Also, as I said, even if you were right, since the popularity is not the only claim of this song to notability, and since notability does not even have an accepted policy, the common sense is to be applied here. You could maybe ask for verifiability of verifiability, and go as many steps upwards, but at some level you have to rely on common sense (we can determine something - that there are sources, but you ask to source the fact that there are sources; then you might as well ask to source the facy that we can source the fact that there are sources, and so ad infinum; in fact, for notability, we apply common sense directly, for facts in articles, we provide sources and apply common sense that they are sources, and even there we do not source the fact that they are sources). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 04:32, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW. I just found another reference. Once again, the reference does not talk about how many songs were sold (because they weren't, it's not a pop album, we went over it again and again), but <a href="http://kapija.narod.ru/Authors/Ajdacic/ajd01_bombard.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://kapija.narod.ru/Authors/Ajdacic/ajd01_bombard.htm" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> (it's slow to load from North America) talks about humor during nato bombing. It lists jokes, several emails which were circulating usenet at the time, jokes on the banners on protests, etc. Look for "мотив овог бомбардера нашао се и у песми Ја возим стелта 117-а Индексовог радио позоришта". The article talks only about one song, and that's our baby here&#160;:) The article goes on about bomber 117A, and dedicates that paragraph to saying that "motif of this bomber occured in song I 'drive' stealth 117A (most people heard it on the radio/TV, apparent ambiguity about the song name)", and goes on to retell the song, in similar manner as the article in question does. The article is well written, and shows that the song was important part of that humor (or cynicism some would say) on the Serbian part. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 05:07, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for digging up the author's bibliography, it was not linked from the page given. I will let the community judge whether this one sentence mention in one article, the only direct mention we have been able to find after presumably extensive searches, is enough for evidence of notability. For me it is not, and I am sticking to my vote for merging the content into the article about the group which created the song. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 13:44, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not all should go but some definitely should. But that is a subject for another discussion.

Don't you find it odd that at this point the article about the one song of this band is longer than the article about the band itself?

<dd>Agreed. I must say my contribution to the discussion here was extensive and might not have been entirely objective (though I tried to be polite and not break any rules). Maybe I was ticked off at least a little at the first, atrociously bad version of this article, which was created by User:Dzoni, a ridiculous troll who has now been permanently banned. I will stop at this point and let the community make its decision. But I still hold my opinion that the best way to proceed here is to merge the content to the article about the band and leaving this as a redirect. That will not remove any information that has been entered so far, and will mean we will have one stub article instead of two (at this point). Plus, that will be in accord with the spirit of Wikipedia guidelines.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 16:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a review of the steps that brought us to this point:</p>
<ol>
<li>A rather incivil newbie editor creates a bad article about a Serbian song at the wrong title.</li>
<li>It gets afd'd. Local editors uniformly say that the song is notable and that it should have an article. Despite minority opinion for delete, the article is deleted for lack of references, prompting a rather premature RFC.</li>
<li>The incivil editor recreates the bad article at another title, this time correct but misspelt.</li>
<li>It gets afd'd and then speedied as recreated material.</li>
<li>A group of established editors writes a new, proper stub about the song at its proper title.</li>
<li>It gets tagged for speedy deletion. The tag is removed by a yet uninvolved editor.</li>
<li>An old hand speedies the article twice and finally puts it on afd after it had been undeleted twice by different editors.</li>
<li>A series of editors from the wider cultural area consistently say that the song is notable.</li>
<li>The incivil editor is first blocked, then permabanned.</li>
<li>The old hand that afd'd the article accuses the editors who wrote the article of bad faith and, in user talk, refuses to back it up or take it back.</li>
<li>We establish that the song is one of the most important songs by probably the most important satiric radio and theater troop in Serbia and that it has a number of google hits and web references.</li>
<li>We go through a painful tit-for-tat repetitive argument about notability, verifiability, sourcing of facts, sourcing of sources, workings of google, state of Serbia in 1990s, etc.</li>
<li>We finally establish that the song is notable, by finding a discussion of it in an article by a prominent Serbian ethnologist, who happens to be the head of university library at the Belgrade University, by far the most important education institution in Serbia.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are some things we hopefully learned along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics should be judged on their own, not by the editor who first created an article about them.</li>
<li>Shouting IN ALL CAPS and insulting people will make things harder for your side of the argument (and get you permabanned, of course).</li>
<li>Pick your fight wisely. When a wide-ranging group of editors disagrees with your actions, it's good to check what's going on and who's doing what before engaging in knee-jerk reactions and personal attacks.</li>
<li>When a long series of people who are likely to be familiar with a topic because of their education, experience, or location, consistently says that it's an important subject, it's likely that it is.</li>
<li>If you're out of your depth on facts, no amount of bravado, rethorical devices, appeals to authority, nit-picking and reiteration will make your case better in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's hoping that next time we'll avoid some of the mistakes we made here. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How come? Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. Why would a notable song from some other culture be excluded? It is not what wikipedia policies say. English is a universal and most widespread language, and there are many people who might be interested in understanding other cultures. Your reasonong does not make sense to me. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 22:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whoa, whoa, Stubbly head, this is one of the stupidest reasons I've heard so far. So, the English wikipedia is only for non-Serbia-related articles? That sounds a little unfair to me, if it's worth mentioning in one Wikipedia, is there a different standard on this one? This article is a millionth of the encyclopedia, having an article about a song that caused SO MUCH comotion when it was suggested to be deleted, proves its notability, as well as the sources and Google hits given on this very page. Whats there to talk about? Keep the song, end of story. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 00:07, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but I disagree. I don't think that notability is a universal thing.

<dd>Then why are there notability criteria that mention explicitly countries other than English-speaking? Do you want to remove German songs, or Jewish issues?

The user has no idea what El kondor pada means, he didn't read the discussion, he knows nothing about what the hell we are even talking about, and yet, his vote is as valuable as the votes of people who have read the discussion, investigated the notability, and are on top of what we are discussing.

<dd>Taste should play no role in this discussion. Dcabrilo said that he didnt like it, and neither do I particularily like it, but that is irrelevant.

<li><b>Keep</b> --- It's funny, and I, as a Serb diaspora haven't heard it before, but find it funny and I agree that this song must have played a key role in keeping the hopes of people in Serbia during the bombings alive, and that made a lot of people rally together.C-c-c-c 03:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>And valid arguments for deletion are what, you've never heard of it? Since when has world opinion been solely based on <b>YOUR</b> statements? If we should delete all <b>"irrelevant"</b> pages on Wikipedia, maybe we should get rid of your user page. I mean really, are you notable, are you famous, and superbly rich? Does anyone here really care about you? Do they really want to know whether you can speak a basic level of Spanish or whether you love/hate user boxes? No one cares, yet no one's petitioning to delete it.</li>

</ul>

<li>
<ul>
<li>So you know, don't comment you something that <b>YOU</b> are so uninformed about. God, such ignorant Americans.... Oh one tidbit, I was on the phone with my one my cousins in Novi Sad (oh, wait you don't even know where that is!) this morning, and I asked him about the song and he said that it is still very popular. Unless you want me to tap the phone next time, pay a "neutral" translator to translate it to English, send you the tape to prove my point, I suggest you take my word for it and try to better Wikipedia for all, by adding articles insteading of deleting them. The only people that are not voting for keep here are you, uninformed, pro-democracy fanatics and/or Albanian nationalists who have no idea what they are talking about and just want to see anything Serbian wiped off the map.

<li>Ouch. Zoe is just trying to do the best by Wikipedia as she can.

<li>My comments on this subject have absolutely nothing to do with the language that it's in or even the subject matter, for that matter. My sole concern is for whether or not an article whose only claim to notability is "I remember it, it was played all the time" and "it's funny", none of which satisfied <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Now, please point to any guideline under which your reasons for voting keep are acceptable criteria, and I'll change my mind. However, I also suggest you read up on <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. And your cousin in <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novi_Sad_3a12.html" title="Novi Sad">Novi Sad</a> (see, I know where it is, we even have an article about it) is not an expert on the popularity of songs in Serbia or anywhere else, is he? I do, however, find your comment about "pro-democracy fanatics" deeply disturbing. As a matter of fact, it just struck me: Why are you even <i>voting</i>, if you're not pro-democracy? We should just delete this now, since democracy is such a bad thing and anybody with authority can just overrule everybody else, huh?</li>

<li>And on another point: are you suddenly in favor of this being a vote? It seems that the earlier ruling was that some sort of consensus emerges in spite of the vote -- a sort of Rousseauean "general will."

<dd>Nothing "pretty obvious" about any of this. The articles were different in structure, content, motivation of creator, intent. You know that, but you can't overcome your urge to pick at it. Just because I don't have constant edits in here as I dog the creator of the new article doesn't mean I haven't been following along closely. You've taken over Balcer's role as pedant-in-chief.

<p>Of course I support democracy fully, so much, that I wish to vote in the Montenegrin referendum coming up, vote in the British Parliament, vote for Quebec and Alberta separistism, and vote for cheaper gas prices. But what? I can't? You mean to tell me I can't vote in the British Parliament? Why can't I vote in the Montenegro referendum, or for the Bloque Quebecois? What, shouldn't my opinion be important as the opinions of the CEO of Exxon Mobil or Shell? Oh right, because I'm not a citizen in any of those places, or a board member of any big oil companies. This same idea applies with you, you have nothing to with Serbia, you are welcome to comment and voice your opinion but not try to push your own ideas (and unfortunately they will probably be ignored anyways, but that's life). You believe that you have the God given right to vote on anything you wish to even if it has nothing to do with you whatsoever, that's the problem with AMERICAN democracy. Why else are Americans always bombing/invading countries?</p>
<p>They think they have the God given right to change whatever they want, and leave everything they don't want to touch alone (ie. Sudan), but attack places oil rich Iraq. Also when quoting, please quote an entire sentence and not just a word (ie. "funny") so not to change the meaning of what I have said. And what I did say was <b>"... but find it funny and I agree that this song must have played a key role in keeping the hopes of people in Serbia during the bombings alive, and that made a lot of people rally together."</b> There is the reason right there.</p>
<p>My cousin may not be an expert (then again, neither are you), but the point is that in Serbia it is a still a popular and relevant topic, and as my cousin was a teen in those years it would have very popular for people his age, and that is the point. What he says is much more credible than what you can say, or I, because he has always lived there, he's much more familiar with things over there than I, you, or most people here anyways, with regards to Serbia, because he is in Serbia. My parents spent about a $300 every month calling relatives in Serbia, for over two months, to make sure they were alive during the bombings, and kids had nothing else but this to keep their hopes up. Sorry for sounding arrogant and angry, but this is really frustrating as I'm only trying to make the same point as almost everyone here. C-c-c-c 20:49, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for butting in, guys, but can we get back to talking about the <b>article</b> instead of trading unrelated insults? It seems obvious to this outsider that:</p>

<li>The "notability hasn't been verified" side will not and cannot not back down unless verification is provided, because at this point it would damage Wikipedia policy to do so.</li>
<li>If any verification whatsoever were provided, the article would be allowed to live, since anything that was at all significant in an armed conflict/resistance clearly has much more long-term notability than thousands of forgettable ditties that do have Wikipedia pages.</li>
<li>The "is notable because I say so" side has suggested some excellent ways to provide verification, by contacting the theater group, radio stations etc. They just don't seem to understand that the burden of doing so falls on themselves.</li>

<p>Alright, I know this one is going to be controversial due to the gaming subculture that is creating these articles all over the place who are going to come in defense on this article, but a debate really needs to be held about these kinds of articles before there are so many of them that it's impossible to get a consensus due to the sheer amount of them on Wikipedia (everyone citing "precedent"). "Nip it in the bud" so to speak. To put it simply, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not a video game guide</a>. If I am mistaken, help me understand how this article does not violate this principle. For example: <i>Ice slasher: "Fires a burst of freezing ice that immobilizes an enemy on contact, but does little damage."</i> This is not encyclopedic. The fact that there are other similar articles does not ipso facto establish a precedent. It could just mean we have more deleting to do. That said and without further ado, debate away. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 18:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> To clarify my above comments, I don't mean to generalize all gamers as putting this kind of stuff up there. The vast majority of them have created a lot of helpful articles without including a bunch of listcruft etc., so hats off to them. I'm a gamer myself so no offense. I'm generally referring to the gamers who turn Wikipedia into their own video game guide. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 20:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>, slept on it. Looking at this article, I recall only constructing it as a addition to List of Mega Man weapons for the sake of inclusion as there was some talk of readers ignorant of the source subject not knowing the difference between gained attacks and consistent weaponry. If not for that, i would not have created this in the first place. Now I'm not sure about the nominator's reasoning of a "game guide", as this doesn't devulge any data pertaining to such a thing (anyone searching about for that wouldn't find it here), and if it were such, a deletion would have been executed long before now. That said, a transwiki to the Mega Man wiki or wikibooks seems quite reasonable. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 23:35, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I actually started to userfy this thing, and then changed my mind. First of all, I think Doc glasgow's right--we have no obligation to host people's bios. Second, since this user obviously edited from an IP <i>after</i> making his one edit from his username (to create this article), the account should not be considered active, so what's the point of having content on the userpage. Third, since all of the userfy votes are tentative and paired with delete votes, and Doc's is an emphatic don't userfy, there's no real consensus to userfy anyway. QED!!! If any non-admin wants the text I'll fish it out for you. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 05:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not userfy</b> (no other vote) I'm fed up with people calling userfy on nn bios. WHY? If it isn't worth an article, then just delete it. Userspace isn't myspace for bios.

<p>I see your point, but the term needs definining as it is in common use. Suggest a NPOV re-write should be done. I don't know how to do it though. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunanimal_3c0f.html" title="User:Punanimal">Punanimal</a> 19:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The content <i>maybe</i> is salvageable, with rewriting, but i suspect its already covered several times over within wikipedia. Its the title we can do nothing with. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 19:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The title is a phrase in common use and it therefore needs to be defined. The name of any emotive subject will inherently imply a POV (I can think of others), but it's not the purpose of Wikipedia to block out terms that are difficult to handle. Instead, Wikipedia serves to define and lay out the neutral point of view in relation to things that themselves may not be so neutral. In choosing to delete a definition, we would be expressing a view about that subject ourselves, in the same sense that silence can be viewed as a powerful form of communication. Better therefore to define it and then lay out the various views of it. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunanimal_3c0f.html" title="User:Punanimal">Punanimal</a> 19:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b> I agree with much of what's said above, apart from the decision to delete. I also think it deserves its own definition rather than a merger, since it is a term that has many Google hits. The term is controversial in some sense but absolutely still needs to be defined, and linked to related ideas. We can't suppress controversial ideas, even if we don't like them. That's not the point of Wikipedia. Put it this way. Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>. So why shouldn't it define Corporate Fascism? If you delete one, surely you have to delete the other. Wouldn't deleting a definition that one doesn't necessarily sympathise amount to, well, something akin to fascism?
<ul>
<li>The difference is that <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> is the correct name. <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_fascism.html" title="Corporate fascism">Corporate fascism</a> is a derogatory term. By all means we should document that the term is used, but that's too dic-def to have an article to itself, and would be better in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a> (with a redirect there from this title). At present there's actually a discussion of the political and economic philosophy there, which would be like having a discussion of British history and culture filed under <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limey.html" title="Limey">Limey</a> (or something more offensive). - <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudomonas_e71a.html" title="User:Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a> 23:19, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I get tired of these articles where a few media writers put the same two or three words together, usually a hyperbole and inherently POV, and then someone puts it into Wiki as a central concept. The article is at least slick and written in the style of NPOV, but there reallys isn't any defining concept. Cf. constitutional theocracy, also on the delete list, which is a comprehesible term in political science. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonbarge_c30f.html" title="User:Masonbarge">Apollo</a> 11:14, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The best solution to me seems to be to <b>include</b> the term in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a> as suggested above, but <b>delete</b> this article and <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a>. (This is an awkward outcome, but I'm not aware of any policy that it contradicts.) Google scholar and google book give enough references that I conclude this is a real term, and at least one of them is from the 1930s so it is not a neologism. However, the term appears to be used primarily as an epithet rather than with a substantive meaning. In the cases where it has a substantive meaning, the corporatism article already covers that meaning adequately. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, would it not be rather POV to redirect this title to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a>?

Both of these are real terms, i have heard both used, but it would be POV to include them anywhere other than at the political epithets list, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 18:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Including it in the list of political epithets seems to be the right idea. The article comes off (intentionally or not) as a sneeky way to push a certain POV.

<li>Actually it's someone else's protologism; based on Google, someone named Webster G. Tarpley, in the August 9, 1993, issue of "The New Federalist", or maybe the book you cite had it first.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am the article writer, and this is certainly NOT a neologism. I have no reason to invent a word for something I don't really sympathise with. It appeared, albeit humourously in "The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook" (Beard &amp; Cerf) published over TWELVE years ago (therefore not new), and "borealocentrism" has been used within po-mo circles for as long. It is no more ridiculoous than the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reversed_map.html" title="Reversed map">reversed map</a> idea (which is ANOTHER wikipedia article on the same subject area) or <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentrism.html" title="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrism</a>. I would suggest you look this up at the library, in the books, rather than on google. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 18:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - neologism doesn't necessarilly mean that you invented it. But if it is an English referenced nowhere on Google, including <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Borealocentrism&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Borealocentrism&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar Search</a>, then I question its notability. <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> says this: <i>"Neologisms that are in wide use — but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources — are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic or use the term within other articles."</i> I would think that would apply here. It may be a real word, but it hasn't reached a point where it is ready for WP.</li>

<li>"Neologism" (in the form of English most people speak), means a new word. This word isn't new. The notability's an issue, but the "neologism" issue is a nonsense, for the reason I've just stated. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 18:50, 10 May 2006 (UTC) p.s. Google search notes "australocentric" which appears to be used in opposition to borealoentric.
<ul>
<li>Neologism doesn't just mean something invented last week. English is hundreds of years old. This word is 12-13. That makes it a new word in the context of the English language. There are words that new which have passed beyond neologism stage because they've entered common usage (e.g. "blog"). This one hasn't. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:43, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes it does "neo" comes from the Greek for "new" and "logos" is the Greek for word. The notability is the issue here... it certainly isn't "neo logos".--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 18:43, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete This Article</b> This article is a gift of knowledge given graciously by it's creator to the free beings of humanity. Furthermore, it is correct, and it is the first theory ever to describe the mathematical properties of everything, which is a real number. Therefore this theory is seminal and unprecedented and deleting it would be a great injustice. The article may not be found noted anywhere because it is entirely original and unique and has been realized for the first known time in history, by the author himself. That is why it is imperative that the article remain for the sake of historical documentation and also for the free enlightenment of everyone who cares to know about the number everything. Deleting this article would be a shame to the free evolution of knowledge and an impediment to mankind's destiny of understanding the universe. Respectfully Bossk2 21:32, 8 May 2006</li>

<li>admittedly the article was written somewhat poorly but I believe it's been revised. I wonder, if everything can not be a real number, then perhaps you can tell us how the definition works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greetings, and thank you all for your concern and interest in this article. The article has been revised for readability so I encourage all of you to re-read it. Also, be sure you look at the image of the number circle (<a href="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/?action=view&amp;current=circle_of_everything.jpg" class="external free" title="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/?action=view&amp;current=circle_of_everything.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/?action=view&amp;current=circle_of_everything.jpg</a>) because otherwise you will not be able to grasp the theory. Also I may note that the article has nothing to do with spirituality. This confusion was probably due to the inclusion of the word absolution which links to a Roman Catholic entry. This word was removed as that is not what it was supposed to refer to. Also the author wishes me to make an article about the number circle, because it is probable that the number circle will be accepted and will eventually replace the number line in textbooks. I also wish to note that this is not original "research." It is, however, an original realization that has been made by the author, which can and has been made by other people as well (they are now listed in the beginning of the article). Again, I encourage everyone to re-read the article as it has been improved and hopefully you will find it more compelling.
<ul>
<li>The changes were mostly minor, and the article still isn't really about anything of consequence... <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 04:46, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The changes make the article much more understandable. The article is about 1/0 which has been ignored by mathemeticians (sort of swept under the rug) and which deserves more attention and investigation. 129.138.2.196 05:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2
<ul>
<li>I don't know how much this needs to be argued, but 1/0 has not been ignored. I learned about it in class in high school. 1/0 is in general "undefined", but there are various circumstances that "look like" 1/0 that resolve to infinity (often), or sometimes 0, or 1, or something else. It depends on the context. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 05:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but in it's pure form 1/0 is greater in absolute value than either negative or positive infinity. Also when you say it resolves to 0 or 1 you may be referring to 0/0 which is not the same thing. 1/0 is the same thing as 2/0 but it is different than 0/0. Did you look at the image of the number circle? <a href="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/circle_of_everything.jpg" class="external free" title="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/circle_of_everything.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y9/sect/circle_of_everything.jpg</a> Bossk2 05:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2
<ul>
<li>Yes, I saw it. It's a nice picture, but not very useful for anything. And are we dealing with sockpuppets, or are there multiple people involved in supporting this? <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 05:53, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm glad you asked. Yes, this theory was also essentially realized by Arceliar and Edward Solomon. See this page <a href="http://owl.infosys.utas.edu.au/mathemagicians_circle/table22.html" class="external free" title="http://owl.infosys.utas.edu.au/mathemagicians_circle/table22.html" rel="nofollow">http://owl.infosys.utas.edu.au/mathemagicians_circle/table22.html</a>.

<li>Just because you can not understand the theory does not mean it should be deleted. Really the only people who have any validity critiquing this theory is mathemeticians. They will probably approve of it once they see what the author has realized.129.138.2.196 05:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2

<li><b>Comment</b> My degree is Math (though I wouldn't say I'm a <i>mathematician</i> per se) and I see what hes's saying -- it's a lot like the filler we published in the Math faculty student newspaper back in the day as a joke -- there are whole obscure branches of math dating back centuries in this field and mathematically this is simplistic rubbish, and <b>very</b> reminiscent of the ancient Greek philosophy schools that were also part spiritual (and gave us such lasting concepts as the 4 elements: earth, air, fire &amp; water) -- he's just a couple of millennia too late

<li>Mr. Walstad's degree is in Physics and Environmental Engineering and he knows what he is talking about.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you all again for your interest in this potentially ground breaking theory. I am the spokesperson and I wish to point out that the co-author of this theory tested in the top %99 for math on the ACT, and he is currently gaining his degree in Physics and Environmental Engineering at New Mexico Tech and is in high standing, and high esteem with the professors who think his theory is very fascinating and holds much promise. If you do not believe me you can email Dr. Lisa Young (pHd) who knows Lee and who teaches Astrophysics at his college. Her email is lyoung@physics.nmt.edu but if you must e-mail her please do not bother her in a rude way. Also as the spokesperson I would like to say that this is not original research, it is merely a wonderful and true realization which the author has made and which anybody can see for themselves. Therefore it does not need to only be published in a scientific journal, it needs to be available for free to everyone regardless of anything. Also this article on wikipedia is important for historical documentation because Mr. Walstad is the first person in history to have publicly announced these realizations in such a way. 1/0 has not been covered by mathemeticians accept for Brahmagupta who is respectfully listed in the article. 1/0 is the most important concept ever which has been ignored by people for centuries and which holds the key to all understanding. Therefore I implore the community not to delete this article and instead to think about what it is saying with a little bit more respect please. You may be amazed when you realize that it is theoretically correct.Bossk2 18:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just want to let everybody know that I am not a sockpuppet. I am in no way trying to hide the fact that I am Lee Walstad. The reason why I say I am only a spokesperson for the author of this theory is because I did not invent the theory of everything; everything is the author of the theory of everything. I am merely a realizer. And also I want to remind everyone to assume good faith, as that is your official policy. Sincerely, Bossk2 19:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - ...regardless of the number of new edits. It should be noted is the only votes not to delete so far have come from the author (sorry--realizer) of the article. No original research --Lostart 19:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I respectfully object because all the people who have nominated for deletion are only those who do not understand the theory and this is not grounds for deletion. Furthermore the theory is not original research, it is only an inherent realization which anybody can make for themselves and which is the sole property of 1/0 itself. Therefore it does not qualify as original research. Respectfully, Bossk2 20:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see the new "reference" is pretty well a copy of the article to an e-mail list on the theory of everything. It has so far prompted one reply - "My calculator has the correct answer to the 1/0 problem; It says ERROR. Attempting to assign meaning to nonsense will only create more confusion.". I think that sums it up. bossk2, you asseretion that this is not original research does not make sense. It is OR. When there is a decent peer reviewed paper in a mathematical journal, come back and try again. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:14, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, it seems all too often people respond negatively when they do not understand something. Apparently everyone thinks they have the authority to say this theory is wrong, just because they do not understand it, yet I find it funny that nobody realizes they have the authority to realize for themselves that it may be right. "Official" Peer reviewers will likely have the same problem and that is why this is a very big problem which only we have the power to effect. This is not original research because it involved no research, merely intuition, and common knowledge about the world around us, and that is a gift that everybody has. SO it is your responsibility to not follow a blind consensus and to think for yourself. Don't expect to surf the web and find the answer, the answer is in your own mind and in your ability to understand this article. Sincerely, 129.138.44.62 23:49, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2

<li>I understand it all too well. The theory is incorrect. You do not understand mathematics. "Common knowledge about the world around us" is not good enough to do good mathematics. Also using intuition is not good enough, but it is "Original research" even if it is bad research. It is not a matter for Wikipedia if you can not get peer reviewers to accept your paper in an academic mathematics journal. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:38, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your well based concern sir. However I think you are not truly considering what the article is saying and you are jumping to conclusions and not backing up your critique with any sort of concrete argument other than "this is false." Recall that I made a %99 on my ACT for math so I think I have a pretty darn good handle on it. What did you make on your ACT?</li>

<li>I appreciate you researching this. I only took up the additional major of physics this semester and I never actually went through the process of acquiring a new advisor, so that is why I am not listed on the physics department homepage (a small technicality I think). Nevertheless, I have been studying physics for quite sometime and that is what I am enrolled in this semester. You should see me listed if you go to the environmental engineering department page. If you wish I can provide a scanned copy of my registration which shows that I am taking almost strictly physics courses this semester, even though I am not officially listed yet in the physics department. Also if you wish to e-mail Dr. Young who's e-mail I've listed above she will verify that I am indeed a student of physics at New Mexico Tech. She was my Astrophysics teacher last semester and she has been very encouraging of me and my theory. Just e-mail her if you really want, but be sure to be polite. Thank you for your interest and attention to this issue, 129.138.44.62 23:54, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>
<li>Well I just went to the environmental engineering department homepage and they do not list their students&#160;:( However, you can still verify that I go to New Mexico Tech by going to this page where I am listed as the treasurer of the caving club <a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~nmtcaver/aboutus.php" class="external free" title="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~nmtcaver/aboutus.php" rel="nofollow">http://infohost.nmt.edu/~nmtcaver/aboutus.php</a>; Also you can send me e-mail at bossk@nmt.edu thanks 129.138.44.62 00:01, 10 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I truly appreciate everybody's deep concern for whether this article is worthy of inclusion in the wikipedia which is definitely an awesome resource that I respect very highly. However, I am a little confused as to why people are having so much difficulty grasping the concept that 1/0 is the number everything. It seems quite plain to me, but perhaps it is still a bit difficult to wrap your mind around. I can understand that. Please give it time and these things will come to you. I have just received e-mail from Arceliar, the other one who has realized the same thing as I have (so you can see this is not original research, it has been realized by others besides me, but I am the one who has taken it upon himself to serve as spokesperson and bring the word to the people, so that you all can take part in this fascinating new realization about the theory of everything, 1/0). I think his comments are very intriguing and can shed light on this debate, and I will post them (provided I have Arceliar's permission) when I get back from a trip to the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gila_Wilderness_9e0e.html" title="Gila Wilderness">Gila Wilderness</a> which my Dad has invited me on. <b>Also when I come back in 5 days I will finish the article and show you all how it is possible to send something faster than the speed of light.</b> Hopefully you will find this information valuable, and hopefully this debate will remain open until after that time.

In good faith, when I come back, you will see that I will show you how to send something faster than the speed of light. You owe it to yourself to receive this information. Feel free to e-mail Dr. Young in the meantime and she will confirm that I have discussed with her my theory and that she encouraged me to go on and get a pHD because otherwise nobody would believe me (as is becoming evident by this discussion). Make sure however if you e-mail her that you are very polite and respectful because I do not want her to be mad at me for any reason. Sincerely, 129.138.2.196 03:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The article takes a LONG time to come to the point, and it appears to be this: in at least some contexts one may take 1/0 to be a sort of point at infinity that is approached by going in either of the two directions on the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_number.html" title="Real number">real line</a>.

That has long been well known among mathematicians. It is explained in various other articles on Wikipedia. Those other articles are clearly written; this one is not.

<p>It's not correct to delete the article HMC International. The company does excist and the article is a overview about their activities. If this article will be deleted hundereds of other should be deleted as well, for example pwc (pricewaterhouse)!!! If someone wants to delete this article it should be stated clearly which part of the article should be changed because all policies and guidline have been fullfilled.</p>

The remainder either duplicates existing information in the mass spectrometry entry or constitutes original research that is a primary source for mass spectrometry nomenclature (it is referenced five times in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> article and the article's novel proposal to replace the accepted <i>m/z</i> with the new <i>m/q</i> notation makes this Wikipedia entry the top Google hit for '<i>m/q "mass spectrometer"</i>). This notation is in conflict with the definitions that exist in the peer-reviewed literature (e.g. American Society for Mass Spectrometry <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(91)80025-3" class="external autonumber" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(91)80025-3" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> and IUPAC <a href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1991/pdf/6310x1541.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1991/pdf/6310x1541.pdf" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> - for an simplified overview see Ken Busch's Spectroscopy Magazine article: <a href="http://www.spectroscopymag.com/spectroscopy/data/articlestandard/spectroscopy/192003/55961/article.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spectroscopymag.com/spectroscopy/data/articlestandard/spectroscopy/192003/55961/article.pdf" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>), books (e.g. McLafferty <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0935702253</a>, Dass <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0471330531</a>, Siuzdak ISBN0126474710, Sparkman <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0966081323</a>, Grayson <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0941901319</a>, etc.) and on-line glossaries (e.g. The Little Encyclopedia of Mass Spectrometry <a href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~bl5/encyclopedia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~bl5/encyclopedia.html" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, Pharmaceutical Mass spectrometry glossary <a href="http://www.genomicglossaries.com/content/mass_spectrometry.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.genomicglossaries.com/content/mass_spectrometry.asp" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>, Base Peak Mass Spectrometry Glossary of Terms <a href="http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/ms/news/glossary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/ms/news/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>, Spectroscopy Magazine Glossary <a href="http://www.spectroscopymag.com/spectroscopy/data/articlestandard/spectroscopy/212002/19886/article.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spectroscopymag.com/spectroscopy/data/articlestandard/spectroscopy/212002/19886/article.pdf" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, Shimadzu Mass Spectrometry Glossary <a href="http://www1.shimadzu.com/products/lab/mass/m.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.shimadzu.com/products/lab/mass/m.html" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>). The POV and accuracy of the article have been repeatedly flagged and the author has each time removed these flags. The article makes many valid points and contains some novel suggestions on how to improve the existing nomenclature.

<p>He is telling the story from the perspective of a <b>small part of the scientific community</b> which has <b>established its own nomenclature</b> which is <b>not used by the rest of the scientific community</b>, <b>nor is it compatible with the international standards</b> issued about exactly this topics, the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a>. Here are the facts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>0) <b>The article expresses the standard view given by <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a> whereas Kmurray's version is non-standard.</b></dd>
<dd>1) mass-to-charge ratio is a quantity that is used by a wide field of sciences, not only the mass spectrometry part. Therefore mass spectrometrists should stop hijacking this term on Wikipedia</dd>
<dd>2) even within the mass spectrometry community many people realize that the IUPAC definitions are boguous, incoherrent and not in line with <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a> and therefore should be abandoned.</dd>
<dd>3) Kmurray as the chairman of the IUPAC group <a href="http://sunsite.wits.ac.za/iupac/projects/2003/2003-056-2-500.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sunsite.wits.ac.za/iupac/projects/2003/2003-056-2-500.html" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> that should prepare a revised set of definitions for the <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_2cc4.html" title="IUPAC">IUPAC</a>. Unfortunately he is not qualified for this job. He does not understand the basics of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrology.html" title="Metrology">metrology</a>, he continuously mixes up <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantities</a> with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Units.html" title="Units">units</a>, he does not know the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a> document whith which his work <b>should comply</b>.</dd>
<dd>4) In order to cover up his dismal track record he tries to hijack and delete the mass-to-charge ratio page, because it includes definitions that are according to the wider and more basic <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_31_13dd.html" title="ISO 31">ISO 31</a> standards instead of the boguous, incoherent and outdated Kmurray standards.</dd>
<dd>5) Since Kmurray is running out of arguments he is now trying to have this page deleted. He is trying to censure the internet from facts he doesn't like.</dd>
<dd>6) Everyone willing to invest the (unfortunately huge amount of) time to read the relevant documents documents will see that the page is correct and should not be deleted.</dd>
<dd>7) The reason why he wants to delete this page is because he thinks the definition <b>1 Th == 1 u/e</b> is not in line with what Cooks and Rockwood wrote in their article. They wrote: <b>1 Th = 1 u/atomic charge</b>. <b>e</b> is the internationally accepted symbol for the elementary charge which is equivalent to the <b>atomic charge</b> unit. Now, you be the judge.</dd>
<dd>8) Conclusion: he is looking for a straw-man reason to delete the article. The real reason is that he does not want to comply to the international standards to which the article complies.</dd>
<dd>9) Kmurray is advocating his own boguous terminology, against the internationally accepted standards of ISO 31. Please check yourself:</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Verify if it is scientifically correct. It does not really look original research. Might be useful (because much shorter), than the long <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrum.html" title="Mass spectrum">mass spectrum</a> article. It is a related concept. Original research means to introduce new theories, not to remap existing knowledge, or to spell a formula/calculation method. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere%26target%3DMass-to-charge_ratio_57ef.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Mass-to-charge ratio">Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Mass-to-charge_ratio</a> - looks very disputed, not the 1st time. Deletion vote overly long and difficult to understand for non-science people.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am completely appalled that scientists can not reach agreement here. There is no real big deal. We, and I speak as a scientist here, deal with differences in units and so on all the time. When I publish in the Journal of Chemical Physics, I hate having to use kcal/mol rather than the SI kJ/mol, but I do not make a big deal of it. Come on, stop grand-standing. Write it in a NPOV way - some people use this expression and these units and some people use this expression and these units. You should not be fighting like this. If deleting this article stops this childish fighting, it might be the best outcome. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am also compelled that some scientists want to delete the ISO 31 compatible nomenclature just in order to replace it with a version that is outdated and boguous. I agree that there is space for different units. There was an agreement until Kmurray put this AFD: ISO 31 compliant version is on <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">mass-to-charge ratio</a> and the non-compliant version is on <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectra.html" title="Mass spectra">mass spectra</a>. Therefore we need to keep the article. Otherwise I will have to start revising the mass spectra article in order to make it ISO 31 compliant. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 12:33, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You miss my point. kcal/mol is outdated. We still use them. Wikipedia is not the place to debate which units are correct. We follow what people use. Wikipedia is certainly not the place to argue that some units are boguous. Stop it. I am not just getting at you. The other side is just as bad. Just learn and accept what Wikipedia is about. There is no need to think that you "have to start revising" anything. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:50, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bduke, you miss the point. kcal/mol may still be used and has its place on Wikipedia, but kJ/mol should not be deleted, because (i) some people use kJ/mol, (ii) kJ/mol is the ISO 31 compliant unit. <b>Therefore wee need both</b>. And you are now voting for just keeping kcal/mol. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 06:22, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Kherli does not get your point. I have tried to explain this to him. I abandoned the article because he does not get this point. As a scientist unfamilar with this particular area I should infom you that your analogy is totally correct. What is represented on this page is not a standard notation. Please take a look at Kehrli's user page to understand his <i>argument</i> for change to this new system to <i>make it more in line with other standards</i>. The AfD is based on redundancy. The fact that it is advocacy of a new unit system is just a bonus.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 16:40, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nick, I am not advocating a new unit system, I am defenting what is the ISO 31 standard which is the most important standard in this field. You are advocating a minority view to replace the majority standard.

<dd>Bduke, nobody is arguing about standards. It is just about which standard to use, e.g if both standards should be represented or just one. There are two standards in place, the wider ISO 31 and the very narrow (mass spectromeytry only) IUPAC yellow book standard, which is not in line with the ISO 31 standard. You are now voting for the deletion of the widely accepted terms that comply with the ISO 31 standard and instead want to keep the page that advocates the narrow standard that is only used by mass spectrometrists and is not used by the rest of the scientific community. My point is: IUPAC has established a non-compliant standard, which is ok, but we still need to keep the wider ISO 31 standard and therefore we should not delete the article. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 06:22, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word began as a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. If you read the article it includes many neologisms which have articles on wikipedia including <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>.

<dd>I'm not sure what you're talking about, but the word "neologism" is more than 200 years old. Neither "gay" nor "blog" were neologisms when their articles were created on Wikipedia.

<p>"<b>don't delete</b>:::Wow. The wiki-elitism of this discussion just keeps increasing. Oh I'm sorry...wiki-elitism...that would be neologism. The word "weenis" has been around for many years now and was not simply coined by me after sticking gum to the underside of a desk. While it is a neologism, it still has the potential to become more. It is comparitively young as compared to others and I feel that you high-and-mighty weilders of the delete function are acting a bit unfairly.

<p>A map does not publish lengths, so analysing it to find them is OR in my view (but debatable), as it depends on the map chosen and the method of measuring. Further analysis to create an ordered list is more clear OR, though. Since the last Afd when references were requested, very few have found since, but the article occaisionly gets reverted as "trivially verifiable", where the main reference is the word "(map)" - not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to me! Given the nature of the article, and the problems above, I can not see how it can be expanded without much original reasearch, so am putting it up for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 22:18, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sure, if we wanted to make this textbook original research. The street numbers on those sites are usually pretty whack anyway, Google Maps and Mapquest list my house (and just about any house in my city) as being 0.1 to 1.0 miles away from the actual house (if you look at the satellite map on Google this is easilly confirmed). And that's the whole problem with OR... Wikipedia isn't a very good place to do it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 12:45, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article should be expanded and improved. As it stands, the article relies on no measuring of maps (although one reference is an enquiry to a mapping web site), and only uses source-based research (as encouraged by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). All entries are properly referenced to reliable sources but I agree that "map" would be an unsuitable reference. No Crown Copyright information is involved but, in any case, infringement of copyright involves reproduction, not use. Ikkyu2's view, cited above, "...a truly garbage article that satisfies WP policy, can't be deleted, and is useless..." provides no reason for deletion. I have added Harrow Road to demonstrate how the article can be developed. Roads, and London, hold little interest for me but the article is at least potentially encyclopedic and currently infringes no policies. However, even I would not propose it for Featured Article status! <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThincat_aebc.html" title="User:Thincat">Thincat</a> 12:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this has had every opportunity to show that it can grow to a verifiable and useful article, and that hasn't happened. If someone wants to measure the streets and publish their findings somewhere, great, then we should be able to write a good article. But it seems like no one but AfD voters is actually interested in this topic... so anything that's proposed as a solution sounds like original research. The article can always be recreated if the verifiability problem is actually solved. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:14, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Are we looking at the same version of the article? Try clearing your cache. All entries are actually referenced to reliable sources and so are demonstrated to be verifiable. Above you criticised the lack of explicit reference to the end-points of Western Avenue ("we have no way of verifying, that the two points chosen are the beginning and end of Western Avenue, as claimed") and concluded that the information cannot be verified. A further click in Multimap verifies each end-point but if you really require more references these can be provided by referencing a reputable map or encyclopedia article, gazetteer, etc. If you want to challenge the sufficiency of references, please raise the matter in Talk:Longest streets in London rather than seek to have the article deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThincat_aebc.html" title="User:Thincat">Thincat</a> 11:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Of the roads with lengths, two have sources (time out). Your addition has sources, and would be a useful addition to an the road article. For Western avenue, you cannot say "Multimap says A, and map says B, therefore A+B=C", as that is an example of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Example_of_a_new_synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#Example_of_a_new_synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position</a>. The sufficiency of the references <b>was</b> challenged three months ago (by myself included) on the appropiate talk page, and I think three months is a more than reasonable time to wait for sources to be found, and if they haven't been found after three months, chances are they can't be found, which is why I nominated it here. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 12:59, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The lists are public information in Norway. It is not copyvio in any sense. The numbers in front of the names are <i>gardsnumber</i> which is a term used in norway to uniquely identify a farm within a local area. In addition to gardsumber there are <i>bruksnummer</i> in use. Those numbers refers to smaller areas or farms within a larger area. The lists are not temporal in nature as the numbering has been in place for a very long time. The numbering are also in use on detail maps, whats known as <i>økonomisk kartverk</i>. Such lists has a direct analogy in lists of road numbers in an area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The lists are useful for those who writes articles about local history as it is easy to check if the farm has been given a description or not. In Norway it is very common to have the farms described in collective works about a municipality. Where I come from we have <i>Gardssoge for Sør-Aurdal</i> (<i>Farm history of Sør-Aurdal</i>) and similar books are available for most of the municipalities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Norwegian farms are very often very old. It is not uncommon that farms are noted in historic sources like <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snorre.html" title="Snorre">Snorre</a>. Still, it is not wise to describe every farm in Wikipedia. There are also the situation where people wants to use a description of an old farm as a reason for writing genealogical articles about their own family. This could create a lot of unwanted vanity articles, yet this isn't a very good argument for deletion of those lists.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> – In my view these lists are not so much collections of information as collections of invitations to write articles about the farms listed. (Articles with information about a farm's history, political importance, etc., can hardly be called vanity, although articles about the families who lived on the farm may be.)<br />
I am pretty sure that the parallel articles in the Norwegian wikipedias will be kept (and expanded). If the lists get deleted from English Wikipedia, maybe a link to the Norwegian articles can still be kept?<br />

<li><b>Merge</b> with the respective municipalities. These are not simply lists of <i>farms</i>, even though that is what "gård" means in Norwegian. The list is of "gårdsnummer" which is a subdivision of the municipality and such lists may be useful in describing the location of where people live. Even at places where there is no farming any longer, the "gårdsnummer" remain. I don't think these lists are deserving of a separate article, but they <i>are</i> relevant when it comes to coverage of the municipalities' geography. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Am I the only one who sees the lovely (and useful) <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> of the comment, “WP is not a database.”? If it is anything, Wikipedia is MOST CERTAINLY a database... The Wiki software is a server-side script, with the content stored on a server in a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_database.html" title="Relational database">relational database</a>. That’s precisely what makes Wikipedia so useful and powerful…</dd>
<dd>This insight is most instructive… Folks are hung up thinking about Wikipedia as if it were a classical encyclopedia… It is most certainly NOT a classical encyclopedia… once we agree on that we can think about what it actually is!</dd>
<dd>Our basis for deciding what should be allowed as a list is bizarre. We tell the reader what a list in not (<a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not</a>). Decision processes based on <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negativity.html" title="Negativity">negativity</a> are always weak and open to debate.</dd>
<dd>It is time for a logical and systematic statement of what warrants being placed on a list. Here are my quick thoughts on a systematic set to rules for a list based on the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html#Characteristics" title="Encyclopedia">characteristics of an encyclopedia</a>:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>… “comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge” …“an encyclopedia treats each subject in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject”… Since the use of the encyclopedia is research, the primary purpose of a list is to facilitate research. THEREFORE A LIST may cover any branch of knowledge, but must be arguably relevant (i.e., useful for some form of research):</li>
<li>“General encyclopedias often contain … as well as embedded dictionaries and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazetteer.html" title="Gazetteer">gazetteers</a>”… a gazetteer is a “geographical dictionary, an important reference for information about places and place-names”… THEREFORE A LIST may cover gazetteer information if it provides important reference information about places and place-names. (Note: this does raise a question whether we shouldn’t create a sister Wiki project… a Wikigazetter.)</li>
<li>“Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain.” THEREFORE A LIST should convey important accumulated knowledge for an identifiable subject domain.</li>
<li>… “systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable as a work of reference.” THEREFORE A LIST should logically enter into the Wiki list structure as a head set or subset… the proposor of a new list has the responsibility for proposing a logical structure under which a list falls in the current scheme of lists.</li>
<li>“As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, they have had an ever-increasing effect on the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds.”… THEREFORE A LIST may be proposed if it is a logical collection or summation of information… the logic must be clear to the casual reader.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>We need to get beyond… well I think so… well I don’t think so… well, I still think so… well I still don’t think so… Anyone have comments/thoughts on my thoughts on how to set up systematic criteria so our discussion is more rational? <a href="../../../u/m/p/User%7EUmptanumRedux_1747.html" title="User:UmptanumRedux">UmptanumRedux</a> 16:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC) Added a discussion on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Time_to_rethink_the_philosphy_of_the_page_.22What_Wikipedia_is_not.22" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">criteria to the <i>What Wikipedia is not</i></a> talk page.<a href="../../../u/m/p/User%7EUmptanumRedux_1747.html" title="User:UmptanumRedux">UmptanumRedux</a> 17:22, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
