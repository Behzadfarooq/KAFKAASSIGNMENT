<p>In the Afd for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Thingbox_e4ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thingbox">thingbox</a> it was suggested that this article might not meet the requirements for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, therefore I'm nominating it for deletion. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 18:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the oldest online gay community websites in the UK. Any particular reason Artw is on this crusade against homosexuality-related articles? 217.196.231.46 20:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> the article provides no evidence of notabilty but it does have an Alexa rank of 47,821 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.outeverywhere.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.outeverywhere.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It would be nice if the article showed more evidence of meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It is mentioned in a newsletter by what claims to be the U.K.s largest charity for Multiple Sclerosis <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:hpg2p__lnLoJ:www.mssociety.org.uk/document.rm%3Fid%3D314+OUTeverywhere&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=24" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:hpg2p__lnLoJ:www.mssociety.org.uk/document.rm%3Fid%3D314+OUTeverywhere&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=24" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As a side note, I think the above comment went to far with a very blatant insinuation that the nominator has something against homosexuals. That borders on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 20:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. OUTeverywhere is the most significant (I would guess the largest in membership) website of its kind in Britain, if not worldwide, ie a consciously non-sexual, non-commercial gay and lesbian online community. It could do with more sources, but it has already been cleaned up once (which I did, I think after the last AfD). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 21:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> OUTeverywhere does not meet the notability requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I am unsure that this is sufficient for deletion on websites that cater for minority groups due to their nature, but consistency should be maintained with the Thingbox article. Additionally, OUT is also a fully commercial site (it is no longer non-commercial) and this article could be considered advertising if it fails to meet notability requirements. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 21:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s><b>Keep</b> One reading the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements, it can be seen that this entry does not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and, furthermore, is a commercial site, and so its entry could be viewed merely as advertising. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 22:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would say that the SinG website may meet notability requirements (though the links are somewhat trivial) but there's no evidence of meeting the requirements for the main article. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 12:58, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This website does meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, although it needs tidying up and editing a little more, perhaps this will help justify its inclusion to those who are concerned.

<li><b>Comment</b> Someone has messaged me saying that I don't have experience on Wiki so my views may not be taken into account on this AFD. For the record, I am not a new Wiki user, I just don't like having a user page! Please see my edit history and you'll see that for the last few months I've been involved in a number of AFDs am a new page patroller and also have created and edited a number of articles, usually on LGBT issues: hence why I felt qualified to comment on this AFD. Please take into account my views: I am NOT a new user or sock puppet! --manchesterstudent 00:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Outeverywhere is a significant element of the UK online gay "scene". -- Flaxton 00:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: links have been added to the article which show its notability. -- <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemoneProjectors_565e.html" title="User:AnemoneProjectors">AnemoneProjectors</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnemoneProjectors_b870.html" title="User talk:AnemoneProjectors">talk</a>) 09:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I've added some links to the page after some research to show it's notability (forgot to sign in when I made the edit though - d'oh!). -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorky1979_7690.html" title="User:Corky1979">Corky1979</a> 09:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The entry is neutral, non-promotional and accurately describes the ethos of the website in question which is notable by its differewnce from other sites of a similar nature.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by DJ Jamie (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DJ_Jamie_a01a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DJ Jamie">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: The links on the page (just about) establish notability for Silence is not Golden. They don't do so for OUTeverywhere.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.43.97.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.43.97.231_3833.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.43.97.231">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I think it has achieved some cultural relevance and thus notability: some fringe plays have references it (directly or indirectly) and it has achieved some notoriety/cultural relevance. I've added the sausage-tossing incident as being one of the most 'public' examples of its wider cultural significance. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottkeir_a23e.html" title="User:Scottkeir">Scottkeir</a> 23:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Conditional neutral(???)</s></b> If the site was founded as long ago as 1995 and that can be documented, that's somewhat notable in its own right for this type of site. The web was just barely starting to take off around then. I don't have an exact sense of those times but many things were being done that were quite new, and thus could be thought of as pioneering. Documentation added so far (about just about everything) is quite skimpy however; self-released press announcements aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Change vote to <b>delete</b>. On further research there was more happening by 1995 than I realized. Salon.com and Amazon.com both launched that year, and Amazon had VC funding in 1994. So I'll push my cutoff date for notability-by-longevity back to 1993 or so. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: How many gay social networking websites are there that enable gay people to meet away from the scene and without the usual sex obsession of gay meetup websites? One. It was also the first gay social website in the UK. Whether that happened in 1993, 1995 or 2001 is less relevant than the fact it was the first. OUTeverywhere publishes some of its media coverage. See these: Independently written and edited interview <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/attitudejanuary2006.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/attitudejanuary2006.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28Magazine%29_9ce3.html" title="Attitude (Magazine)">Attitude (Magazine)</a>, major page feature <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/pinkpaper28april2005.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/pinkpaper28april2005.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> in the UK's gay newspaper Pink Paper, and OUTeverywhere is referenced by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun (newspaper)</a>'s agony aunt Dear Deidre <a href="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/thesun28dec2005.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://photo.outeverywhere.com/media/thesun28dec2005.jpg" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> in referring people to good organisations to help with 'coming out' support. 217.36.233.38 08:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC) DG</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: OUT is a commercial website where paying members can meet each other. The circumstances (sex-related or not) don't make it notable, as with the thingbox site. Minor coverage in the gay press or references to the URL don't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements. 84.92.141.190 13:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I'd not read "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself... includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." to exclude gay press or other UK-wide (in circulation) media. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottkeir_a23e.html" title="User:Scottkeir">Scottkeir</a> 00:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It does, however, exclude trivial references, such as a quote of the URL or brief summaries. 84.92.141.190 17:45, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Even as a member of this website, I think this entry should be deleted, as the website should be treated in the same way as other community websites (e.g. the deletion of 'Thingbox', which triggered this discussion).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The assessment of OUTeverywhere's encyclopedic entry on Wikipedia should be judged on its own merits, on facts and independent research, and not a 'battle' by users of either OUTeverywhere or Thingbox (which includes many disgruntled ex-OUTeverywhere users). There are numerous commercial websites described on Wikipedia with a notable history and/or heavy contribution to social networking. 200,000 people (mainly gay/lesbian/bi, mainly UK) have so far signed up to OUTeverywhere in its 11 year history; this can be verified by signing up and checking account numbers. 82.68.195.78 08:44, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
