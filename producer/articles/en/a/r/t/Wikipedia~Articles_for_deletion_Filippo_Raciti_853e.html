<li><b>Comment</b> - A lot of the purported Notability seems to hinge on how significant (long) the football stoppage will be ("...there are repercussions we have yet to see.."), and that is not yet known. Therefore, until more important repercussions occur, not notable. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightspeedchick_dc5f.html" title="User:Lightspeedchick">lightspeedchick</a> 03:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong merge</b> to article about the Catania violence. The violence is unquestionably notable, but Mr. Raciti is only notable insofar as he connects to the event. Certainly a plausible redirect, though. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 03:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Completely different. "Football" is a broad sport played in various incarnations. An athlete who habitually participates at a sufficiently notable level in such events is notable, and we have specific guidelines to determine which ones are and are not. Mr. Raciti has no long-term notability with something like "football" - he is connected to a very specific news event. His notability is inextricably tied to the event, whereas footballers often have slight claims to notability outside of football. Regardless, Mr. Raciti is known for one thing, and one thing only - being killed in the Catania violence. It would, therefore, be more sensible to cover him in that article, where his notability is better contextualized, than to break him off from the event and have two articles on what are, notability-wise, the same subject. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 04:18, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b> But this is a notable event and Herr Raciti is a major person in this case. How can he not be notable? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 17:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He is notable as part of the event and should therefore be covered in the article for the event. He is not notable as a person because he receives no actual coverage as a person prior to this event, and, as he's now dead, will not be able to become notable as a person. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 19:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This discussion is becoming silly. Does it even matter what I say? I keep trying to explain my reasons and you don't even address them, so why bother replying? Yes, it does matter. To be notable by Wikipedia standards, you are the subject of multiple non-trivial yadda yadda yadda. Raciti is not. The violence is. Raciti is a plausible search term and makes a lovely redirect as an aspect of the Catania violence covered within that article, in my opinion. Obviously there won't be a consensus to merge and I'm not even bothering to propose it on the page. I only keep explaining myself because you keep replying, which I assumed meant you wanted to discuss my idea. If you do not and simply wish to keep reasserting that you disagree, then that's unnecessary and I will stop attempting to explain myself for some vain non-purpose, but please then do not lead me to believe I should be further discussing the reasoning behind my opinion to merge. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGassyGuy_6931.html" title="User:GassyGuy">GassyGuy</a> 21:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay, let's stop it all. The guideline says "the person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial works...", not "he has been the most primary one". On these works, Raciti is a subject too, together with the events itself, Catania football club and so on. Then, you can find another criterion which says "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for playing a major role in a event receiving major news and media coverage" are likely to be notable here in Wikipedia. Raciti's name achieved notoriety worldwide following the events. Sorry, GassyGuy, but it seems you're wrong, and it seems also I'm not the only one to have such opinion on the matter (look at the discussion and votes). In the end, even <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirhan_Sirhan_4378.html" title="Sirhan Sirhan">Sirhan Sirhan</a> is notable solely for a single event, but this is quite enough to make him notable for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelo.romano_5e58.html" title="User:Angelo.romano">Angelo</a> 21:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
