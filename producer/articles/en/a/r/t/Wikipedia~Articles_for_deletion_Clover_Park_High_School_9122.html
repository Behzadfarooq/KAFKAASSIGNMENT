<li><b>Keep</b> and continue to expand. High schools should not have to prove notability.

It is a public institution and more notable than the British train stations. (And I didn't get this by reading GRider's page, I monitor the VfDs; but is someone's opinion who gets it from there less valid than ours? How about the person who hears about it from <a href="../../../w/_/_/WP%7EW_f2f3.html" title="WP:W">WP:W</a>?) --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 20:35, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again, someone confuses Wikipedia with the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Olympics_df87.html" title="Special Olympics">Special Olympics</a>, where every article is special and it's "elitist" to draw distinctions about worthiness and quality.

<ul>
<li>If we set standards only by school quality, we end up with the top 2% and the occasional scene of a shooting incident. How does that represent the real range of schools to the user? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:42, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not supposed to. Representing the typical is the job of general articles. An article on American High Schools could contain such information, or an article on American eduction could. Furthermore, unremarkable schools could be mentioned on a town page or even perhaps a school district page. It is just plain silly to claim that not having an article on every single school in the world would mean that no information on typical schools could exist on wikipedia. An encyclopedia is supposed to highlight and synthesize. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:07, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article on American High Schools would be too generic unless it included specific examples. I'm not saying we need articles on every single school in the world, but we do need scope for representative examples of all types. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:04, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would you extend this to other types of articles? How about articles on representative examples of people? I could write an article about my plumber. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 06:09, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>In my opinion, a better parallel is the inclusion of every city, town, village and Census Designated Place on Wikipedia. There are far more of those than there are high schools, plus there is no debate about whether <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Cave%2C_Texas_0f38.html" title="Bee Cave, Texas">Bee Cave, Texas</a> is notable. This, despite the fact that the city of Bee Cave has only 656 people, less than most high schools.--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 18:07, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If people are so obsessed with notability then just merge the damn high school page into the local town page. Towns are unquestionably notable, and high schools are unquestionably significant in terms of their local town. However, this page has so much information that it deserves it's own page as a "subpage" of the city of Lakewood. So after you merge it, you are gonna have to unmerge it.&#160;:-) In other words, just keep the page. Incidentally, I think I've just proven the inherent significance of any school page that is larger then a stub. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 19:06, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Topic is notable: data interesting (because having more than 50% minorities means well, the majority isn't really present, is it?) How do you expect it to grow out of non notability if you keep pressing to delete it? It has the capacity to grow out of non notability. Plus, I disagree with the notion that it is not distinguished from the countless other schools around the world, because you realise, that in China, the student mindset would be different, there is no reduced lunch, the syllabus would be different, or in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, having much more different sets of characteristics than US schools, or even within the US itself. If I made an article about some relatively unknown species just discovered in the Amazon Rainforest, much of detail yet to be discovered, its report printed in a small section of some scientific journal among thousands of others, in the same family as another species, are you what, going to delete it for having non notable information? Even before the article has a chance to evolve?...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yet according to the Tree of Life project, Wikipedia doesn't mind documenting each and every species. Because notability can be established, can become notable research information, when networked, overviewed in conjunction with other articles, if you let it live. Its genome would be different, there would be lessons to learn, no matter how small, and then its important for say, genetic statistics, research, confirmation, checking for codon exceptions, etc. In the same way, schools are an important part of demographics, no matter how non notable it is now. Would you object to Wikipedia storing the genome (taken from DNA databases) of every species if it had people bothered? Isn't the record of such evolution of the individual nucleotides and its analyses valuable, even though it seems small? Should we omit a point from a circle in our mathematical drawings because its only one point out of an infinite number? Yet we don't. Why then object to having this article exist for demographical purposes? The NPOV problems can be fixed. It has a chance to be proliferate into something of note. Why do have articles every day of the year, even into the future, or documentation of every possible enzyme there is in life? Isn't it possible that a string of non notable things can be used in analysis into something of note? And isn't it true that the patterns can be so diverse they need their own individual articles? Isn't it possible, that gasp, something event might happen that links two relatively minor things into a big one? And if the article existed beforehand, it would have been easier to correlate when something did happen. One article about a seemingly insignificant thing, when linked and correlated with other articles to show similar concepts, or trends, patterns, for cross reference and such, then extending this depth to possibly many others because of the links? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 02:46, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Amen. This article enhances the information value of every page that links to it, and every page that will link to it in the future. I think that: if a topic is a common link between two or more notable topics, then that topic becomes notable as a result of it's association with those topics, and that a page should probably exist for that mutually shared topic. Ergo, if two significant people go to a school, then that school becomes notable as a common link, a shared bond. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 08:31, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
