<p>I normally try to extend a presumption of good faith as far as possible, but in this case it is impossible. The topic has been narrowed only to opinion on an execrable individual, and only to such a time frame as to eliminate any comments to the effect that, bad as he was, the results of the war were worse. Anti-war figures are quoted only for their qualifying statements agreeing that Saddam is awful. There are no quotations at all from anyone in the Reagan administration in the 1980s when they were more or less allied with Saddam. There is not a single quotation from anyone who is an Arab, a Muslim, or even a citizen of any other country than the United States. There is not a single quotation even about how Saddam might stack up against, say, the leaders of adjoining Saudi Arabia; not a single quotation that deals with a single positive of his regime. We do not handle even Hitler or Stalin this way.</p>
<p>The article is little more than a collection of quotations. It is possible that there is material here that might be appropriately usable in some broader context. I would be open to suggestions for something short of outright deletion, but (1) I do not believe the particular scope implied by the title of this article is appropriate and (2) I believe that the person who has so far written almost the entire article has narrowed it even beyond this scope in a way that creates an even stronger bias. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:22, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to add all the statements you can find supporting Saddam Hussein's good will (and harmlessness) from prominent opinion leaders and public officials in the United States. It can't be too hard. If you want, just send me the links and I'll do the grunt work of adding them myself -- just make sure they're prominent public officials or prominent in the media. Why would you opt to destroy information (in an article several days old and still expanding and being refined) rather than help make an article better? I specifically separated the idea of trusting Saddam Hussein from being pro- or anti-Iraq war in the first two sections of this article. Also, see the Ted Kennedy section. I didn't create this to be an overall "Iraq War debate" article -- I wanted to focus on what important opinion leaders and public officials thought about whether Saddam was dangerous.

<dd>More thoughts: The "Bush lied, people died" position has been shouted for some time. One (not the only one) reason why this article is useful is that it provides a fair account of what people beyond the Bush administration actually said about the danger from Saddam's regime. There was a consensus that it was dangerous. So if someone wants to argue that Bush lied, more needs to be proven. I have no problem at all with including even earlier, Pre-Gulf War statements from the Reagan administration. Why do you want to destroy the article rather than add to it?</dd>

<dd>Also, I've included Republican comments, including one from Trent Lott opposing the '98 strikes. Another useful feature of this article is that it could show politicians changing their tune as the president changes from Democrat to Republican. And that applies to both some Democrats and some Republicans (and doesn't apply to others. Why can't you give me a few more days to develop the article, which I've already said is (a) a work in progress and (b) something I'd welcome help with?

<ul>
<li><b>Conditional Delete</b> <i>if</i> the article is not massively overhauled. I feel that the article as it stands now is intended to push a particular point of view, but what is here is not completely irredeemable. A great deal of work must be done on a number of fronts.
<ul>
<li>First, instead of focuses entirely on the U.S., it must focus on global opinion as a whole, notably including Europe, Asia, and the Muslim world. In an ideal article, the U.S. might have more opinions cited in the article than any other one country, but the country would occupy only a minority of the text on the page. This means that many of the American quotes will need to be stripped out (or else we will end up with a 200kb article).</li>
<li>Second, the article is fraught with sentences that make it clear that its author is trying to convince readers of a point that he can't explicitly state without violating NPOV. The whole gist of the present article is <b>"Democrats used to admit Saddam was dangerous, but because they are filled with blind hatred for Bush they betrayed their convictions to oppose the war."</b> There is no other reason for statements like <i>"Supporters of the Iraq War have noted the statements numerous Democrats and others that emphasized the danger of Saddam and WMDs in the past while the people or institutions who made those statements later opposed the Iraq War"</i> and for the bulk of the text being quotations that all <i>just happen</i> to come from members of one particular political party in one country.</li>
<li>And then there's the lead that goes out of its way to say "Democrats and liberals knew Saddam was dangerous. Republicans and conservatives too." The article structure itself makes the same distinction, dividing statements into those made by Republicans/conservatives and those by Democrats/liberals. Why break it down along party lines like that unless you're pushing a point? In fact, why mention the opinions of elected officials and journalists at all, when the <i>relevant</i> opinions on the matter all come from people in the intelligence community (and related fields like diplomacy)? It is entirely on the findings of these agencies, after all, that the politicians and media figures base their statements. The only reason to quote them and not their own sources is to try and score points against them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 03:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

In other words, the article is saying that those who opposed or protested the war believed Saddam to be harmless. Does the author really believe that this fairly or accurately refects the reasoning of the war's early critics? This is one of the clearest indications that he is trying to sneak a political agenda onto Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 03:21, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Responding to Andrew Levine: 1. I've started to include Republican comments on both the '98 U.S. strikes against Iraq during the Clinton administration and how those views sometimes contrast and sometimes don't contrast with their views during the Bush administration. None of that fits your characterization. And I have specifically stated that people could oppose the war for other reasons. 2. the article does focus on opinion in the U.S., which should be reflected in the article name. (I've said before that I had trouble with the article name.) It gets broken down along party lines in organization because that's a clear way of organizing it and to make the point that a consensus existed. Levine, you didn't really read to the end of the article, did you? Another point: the relevant opinions are the opinions of the decision-makers, and ultimately of the people who affect public opinion, especially in the United States.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speaking of howlers</b> Andrew is shocked, shocked that a political agenda might be sneaked into Wikipedia. Take a look at the Iraq War category pages (links at the bottom of the article in question here) and see the shape of Wikipedia's coverage of the controversy: tons of information on opposition to the war, tons and tons of it. If Andrew is saying that the article lacks information, it can be added. I get the impression from the comments here that the real objection is that certain facts should not be noted in Wikipedia and rather than make the information readily available to readers, information should be suppressed because it makes some people uncomfortable. Reasons for opposing the war despite thinking Saddam was dangerous can be added. People who thought back then that Saddam was not dangerous can be added, but none of that disproves that the consensus was that he was dangerous. Why that fact should be controversial or politically biased is beyond me. Why people are more interested in suppressing information rather than dealing with it is beyond me. But it can't be that people here are trying to sneak a political agenda into Wikipedia, Heavens no! Again, check out the articles in the several categories linked to at the bottom of the article in question here. It's quite a statement about politics in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment -- Arbusto</b> No, I'm admiting that I wrote an article reporting an area of consensus (about the danger from Saddam's WMDs) which was later part of a larger political controversy (on whether or not to go to war with Iraq). Do you think it's possible to fairly do an article on that (reporting on what the consensus was)? Do you think we should have articles on such subjects? What specific ways could I have been more fair in doing it? Are you admitting that you object to it because you think it hurts a particular side of a controversy simply to get the facts out? None of these are rhetorical questions. I realize a lot of the problem here (not all of it) stems from the title of the article. What if it were "American pre-Iraq War consensus on whether Iraq was dangerous" -- what would such an article look like to be fair, or should such an article exist at all? Again, it's not a rhetorical question -- I'd really like to know what you think.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:41, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment -- Dhartung:</b> you say <b>all its about is POV</b> but it's about <b>other people's</b> POV -- the POV of the people I'm quoting, and they're from all parts of the political spectrum except the far left and the far right because it's an article about what the consensus was. What the consensus was is a FACT, not an opinion, and I'm reporting it, not editorializing in support or opposition to it. I guess the overarching problem that I'm seeing here is that you people don't want an encyclopedia article that (no matter how fairly or accurately it's presented) covers what a consensus opinion was about an important issue. When you say "all it's about is POV" you really mean, "all it's about is reporting on a POV" (although I dispute that, it's all about what the consensus was and in some cases how that changed among both Republicans and Democrats). Is that a fair description of your ultimate objection? Because with all the complaining about NPOV, I don't see what could either be added or taken out to satisfy you. It's the concept of doing an article on this subject that you really object to, right?<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply -- Dhartung:</b> Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I think it would be hard to have any kind of article about history without including points of view, and it's hard to have any deep coverage of something important without separating parts of it into individual articles, so I don't see how Wikipedia could operate well under the restrictions you'd set for it.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:26, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Noroton, I did indeed read the entire article. But while I was reading more and more of it, the faith I had that you were attempting to be neutral disappeared. The simple facts are these: Your article presents quotes in a way that is <i>deliberately</i> meant to demonstrate a contradiction between what certain people have said and done, and imply that those making the statements changed their stated positions out of political expediency. This is what you admitted above. To that end, you have almost completely ignored the context in which the statements were made. You chose to present the information in a structure that was broken down by party lines and not a chronological structure that would allow the statements to be viewed in the context of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_disarmament_crisis.html" title="Iraq disarmament crisis">Iraq disarmament crisis</a> and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terror_fa24.html" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a> that formed their backdrop. Thus your article ignores the fact that the execution of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Fox_876d.html" title="Operation Desert Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a>, by degrading Saddam's WMD projects, rendered moot (or at least cast in a different light) all of the pre-December-1998 quotes, and with it ended the consensus that Saddam still posed a danger. Your article also ignores how the presentation of intelligence by the Bush administration was the primary influence on the opinions of politicians in the year preceding the invasion of Iraq. You left out global opinion on Saddam Hussein, even you have not provided a reason why the article should focus solely on the United States. If these cannot all be addressed, what we have left is an article that presents information deceptively, and we cannot keep such an article on Wikipedia. And yes, as Dhartung says, if you think that some articles have an anti-war bias, you remove the bias instead of adding counter-bias. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 06:43, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment -- Andrew:</b> (Please see my comments to Dhartung, above, I'd be interested in what you think about them.) You claim to have read the article, but I don't see it. First, I've added (and was in the process of continuing to add) context and direct links to full sources for as many of these quotes as I can get. I deliberately put information about Operation Desert Fox in the article to show that some of the comments were made before and during that episode, and each statement is dated so that anyone can see that. I have also reported that some people have made the political point that these statements seem to contradict later statements. What you say about Operation Desert Fox is interesting and wrong. I DID put in that context. People thought (see Clinton comments in this article and see Albright comments in the "Degrade..." section of the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Fox_876d.html" title="Operation Desert Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a>) that Operation Desert Fox had delayed Hussein's WMD program and destroyed some material and production capacity, but no one claimed at the time that it destroyed it. Some people said it delayed WMD production for six months (Kissinger, Brzezinski), some said four years. Besides that, some of the statements, as I said in the article, but which you ignore here, were made well after Operation Desert Fox. This is all in the article you say you read (I did add to it yesterday, perhaps you didn't catch the additions?). Second, I did leave out global opinion -- it didn't affect the American consensus, and global opinion would belong in its own article, I think. It was America that decided to go to war and that was decisive. Frankly, global opinion held us back for a while, but ultimately it was irrelevant because we went to war anyway. Figuring out what the "global consensus" was is not something I can do, and I'm not sure how valuable it is. Figuring out what the American consensus was is obviously valuable as background for understanding the decision to go to war. And how do you show there was a consensus unless by showing that the major players across the political spectrum, identified by party, for instance, were essentially of one mind on the subject (which was PART of the overall debate on the Iraq War). I suppose you can quote others saying "there was a consensus" and that probably should be done, but you've got to at least provide plenty of examples of it. Only by having articles about part of that massive debate can we adequately cover, in enough detail, what the overall debate really was. Or do you take the position that we can't have articles covering debates, no matter how important they are? By the way, it's not that I think the articles have the bias, it's that I think the articles themselves are focused on aspects of the controversy over Iraq that are designed to put the anti-war side in a good light, ignoring other aspects, which I think is the reverse side of what your real objection is about this article.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment post script:</b> I have absolutely no problem including quotes from people like Jay Rockefeller saying why they opposed the war despite having thought when they first voted to authorize it that Saddam was a threat, and even blaming Bush's presentation of intelligence. The value would be that it informs everyone what the position of someone like Rockefeller's was and why it changed. There were plenty of people who recognized some degree of danger from Saddam but who opposed the war nevertheless. I have no problem with including that information as a section in this article and even contributing to an article solely on that position, because I think it would be a valuable contribution to anyone trying to understand the debate. My motive here really is to help readers <b>better understand the debate</b> which this article is one step in doing.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:54, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment p.p.s.</b>: By the way Andrew, if I were so partisan in wanting to hurt Democrats, why would I be including Republican comments like Trent Lott's, and why would I treat Ted Kennedy the way I did, adding his statement in opposition to the war despite his view of Saddam trying to get WMDs? And why would I keep replacing links from bloggers who were making a political point with Web pages that reproduce entire statements, giving context? And why would I constantly link to the Snopes.com Web page that gives context?

<dd>Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. And use of the word "repair" was unnecessary. I should have just said "work". I apologize for being rude. But this is a thoroughly biased article.</dd>
<dd>Have you read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? The policy in a nutshell is: "Assume that others are trying to help Wikipedia rather than harm it, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary." I don't think you created this article with malicious intent. I have not assumed bad faith. I've no doubt you mean well. I certainly have never said that you were attempting to harm Wikipedia. I apologize if I haven't said this nicely enough, but what I am saying is that on a fundamental level this article does not meet <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It also fails a few other requirements for quality articles.</dd>
<dd>To begin with: In its first sentence, [[Pre-Iraq War opinion on Saddam Hussein]] narrows its scope to only one topic: American opinions on Saddam Hussein relevant to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, which if nothing else is an instance of ethnocentrism. Later we learn that even that isn't really the article's scope: It's actually just a collection of quotations from U.S. politicians and a pair of U.S. newspapers.</dd>
<dd>This article is fraught with bias and misconceptions. Returning to the first sentence: "<b>Pre-Iraq War opinion on Saddam Hussein</b> in the United States had developed into a consensus (not without dissent from a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War_adde.html" title="Protests against the Iraq War">minority</a>) that Saddam's regime was dangerous to the United States and the world."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The "and the world" bit is hopelessly vague. The primary object of Saddam's aggression was <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, followed distantly by Israel, which he and many others in the Middle East regard as an interloper on Arab land, and more distantly by Kuwait in 1991, when he invaded because he regarded Kuwait as a thorn in his side and he believed he could get away with invading.</li>
<li>"Consensus" connotes an agreement reached after a meeting, rather than a widespread misconception.</li>
<li>The "minority" mentioned is at best inaccurate, since the protests against the invasion of Iraq were protesting the invasion of Iraq for a wide variety of reasons, not necessarily arguing that Iraq posed no threat to the U.S. or "the world". Many of them argued that, actually, Iraq posed no <i>significant</i> threat, or even that what Iraq posed a threat to was Iran, which actually is the country that most of Iraq's military aggression was directed towards.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it was rude of me to conclude from the article's obvious bias that the article's sole contributor's political proclivities were showing in the way that it was written. If so, I am sorry, but that is the way it appears to me.</dd>
<dd>Another relevant part of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is as follows: "Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that actions should not be needlessly attributed to malice. <i>Accusing the other side in a conflict of failing to assuming good faith can, itself, be a form of failing to assume good faith.</i>" --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 17:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the problem here is certainly mine: My conception of what the article is about was too hazy when I started it and this debate is helping me clarify it. Because I was so hazy, it led to misunderstandings about my intent, which was to report on what other people's opinions were and how that formed a pre-war consensus on ONE aspect of the overall issue of Iraq: whether Saddam was dangerous. That doesn't end the debate on the war and in fact it was a consensus that existed independently for several years before the idea of going to war was debated. I think the subject I've described is valuable enough for a fair article in itself, do you? I think the subject here should be covered and covered with roughly the same scope in one article, but that other articles on related subjects would better put it in context. I just wrote several replies to Arbusto, Dhartung and Andrew and I'd be interested in what you think about some of the questions I asked. As to your specific objections:</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ethnocentrism -- we're a nation state that essentially had its own debate about going to war with another nation state. Therefore limiting this to America is justified, not for ethnocentric reasons but because this country is its own political unit and each political unit makes its own decision (so we have histories of Massachusetts in colonial times, for instance, and histories of Virginia, and having those histories is not parochial in any wrong way). Did the opinions expressed in other countries have an affect on our debate to go to war? Even if they did, what's relevant is what my article is about, which was what our opinions in this country were about the danger of Saddam's regime. Opinions elsewhere, particularly England, France, the Arab world, could make valuable articles as well and I'd read or even contribute to them.</li>
<li>"Consensus" -- interesting point. I think there were various meetings, though. I prefer that word (it's concise for one thing and probably useful for a title) but I have no problem with prominently discussing what widespread misconceptions there were. For instance, it appears that <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Fox_876d.html" title="Operation Desert Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a> was more successful than even the Clinton Administration believed. This wasn't discovered until after the war was over. Desert Fox appears to have actually knocked out the WMD programs right up to the invasion. I think some discussion of what was misperceived would be useful in the article, with a link elsewhere for the fuller discussion.</li>
<li>"minority" I think you're right, and putting that link in was a bad mistake on my part. I'll take it out. I also think it's worth mentioning who was in that minority and why they thought that way.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"and the world" the threat was vague and I would be amazed to see you back up your points about Saddam's threat being almost entirely a concern of Iran and Israel. I think you're way out on a limb there. In any event, in reporting on what the American widespread belief was, it was that Saddam posed some danger to us (I think I've certainly shown that was the belief) and we also believed he was a general danger to anyone he could lob a missile at or wherever he could sneak in a terrorist with a WMD.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Prepare to be amazed, then. As the Iraq Survey Group noted: Saddam didn't have any WMD but he wanted them. As to <i>why</i> he wanted WMD, they observed: "Iran was the pre-eminent motivator of this policy. All senior level Iraqi officials considered Iran to be Iraq’s principal enemy in the region. The wish to balance Israel and acquire status and influence in the Arab world were also considerations, but secondary." As Brent Scowcroft, National Security advisor to George H.W. Bush observed in August 2002: "Saddam is a familiar dictatorial aggressor, with traditional goals for his aggression. There is little evidence to indicate that the United States itself is an object of his aggression. Rather, Saddam's problem with the U.S. appears to be that we stand in the way of his ambitions. He seeks weapons of mass destruction not to arm terrorists, but to deter us from intervening to block his aggressive designs."</dd>
<dd>As to whether it was known before the invasion that Desert Fox had degraded Iraq's WMD capability, refer to the Snopes.com article from which you collected many of these quotes: Afterwards, the military "announced the action had been successful in 'degrad[ing] Saddam Hussein's ability to deliver chemical, biological and nuclear weapons." National Security adviser Condoleezza Rice noted in 2001 that "We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt." Colin Powell said the same month that Iraq "has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbours." It is misleading to say that the whole world was unaware that Saddam no longer had any significant WMD.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, this article's content (just a collection of quotes) is <b>more suitable to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a></b>, although again, proper context is essential. That and the palpable bias in its creation that JMabel and others have noted is why my vote is still Delete. My perception (just an impression I get) is that the changes Noroton has made are efforts to save "his" article rather than actual efforts to reach neutrality. He believes that his opinions in this discussion are "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPre-Iraq_War_opinion_on_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=78034886&amp;oldid=78033171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPre-Iraq_War_opinion_on_Saddam_Hussein&amp;diff=78034886&amp;oldid=78033171" rel="nofollow"><i>the voice of sweet reason amidst the howling storm</i></a>," which indicates a continuing view that he is right and everybody else is wrong. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 20:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment: Mr.Billions:</b>What amazes me is how you insist the limb isn't already cracking: The <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Survey_Group_776b.html" title="Iraq Survey Group">Iraq Survey Group</a> was formed AFTER the war. We are talking about before the war. Brent Scowcroft is certainly someone to be listened to as a person who once had considerable responsibility, but he is hardly the last word, had no inside information on Iraq's capabilities at that time (to my knowledge, anyway), and would have been relying on educated guesswork. I don't think Scowcroft presented (or had) any evidence at the time for that statement. I'd be happy to include his thoughts on the subject as the minority view, however. The assassination plot against George H.W. Bush doesn't appear to fit in with your Scowcroft statement.</dd>
<dd>As to whether Operation Desert Fox degraded Iraq's WMD capabilities, the consensus was that it certainly did. The consensus, even from official government spokesmen at the time, was that the degrading was not permanent. There were varying estimates as to when Hussein could eventually get WMDs built. Just see Clinton's comments in the article. See Albright's comments in the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Fox_876d.html" title="Operation Desert Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a> article (I put them there). As I said, ONLY AFTERWARD did we realize how effective Operation Desert Fox was -- the Iraqis seem to have given up after that. Feel free to include those quotes from Rice and Powell in the article, and please explain why they fly in the face of everything said by everybody quoted the next year, in 2002. Could it be because Iraq continued to play games with inspections and because, after 9/11, the U.S. became concerned about nonconventional delivery of WMDs via terrorists?</dd>
<dd>As your comments show, the subject itself is interesting -- you just don't like the information I have put in the article. Rather than censor, you should be helping, or at least supporting others, in putting all of this into a coherent whole, as I keep suggesting. I have no problem taking this subject wherever the facts lead. Do you? I've also demonstrated on this page that I can change my conclusions instead of stubbornly holding on to a position unless I feel it's correct. Now that hardly seems like I'm impervious to other people's opinions, does it?

<dl>
<dd>Since you seem so easily offended by other people speculating as to your own motivations, it would behoove you to refrain from accusing others of bad-faith motivations. I'm somewhat offended at your claim that I "just don't like the information [you] have put in the article", and that I'm only seeking to "censor" it. You might yourself review WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF. What I dislike, and what several other people on this page have said they also dislike, is the brazen bias inherent in the way you created this article.</dd>
<dd>The Iraqi obsession with Iran was well-known before the Iraq Survey Group was established. The fact that Iran was by far Iraq's primary target was already well known to the United States military. Regardless, even if they somehow had no idea of this, it would be irrelevant to the current discussion. I was replying to your claim that it was impossible to support the observation that Iraq posed a danger primarily to Iran. You said "I would be amazed to see you back up your points about Saddam's threat being almost entirely a concern of Iran and Israel," and that I was "way out on a limb there." I presented evidence in support of my statement, and you changed the subject to <i>when</i> the United States became aware of Iraq's military goals. That is a red herring.</dd>
<dd>I haven't seen anywhere on this page where you've changed your conclusions. Presented with evidence of the fairly obvious fact that Iraq's goals were traditional and regional, you attack General Scowcroft's credibility without any evidence of your own. When it was first observed that the article is thoroughly biased, you attacked me for not being nice enough and allegedly breaking WP:AGF.</dd>
<dd>General Scowcroft was well aware of the attempt on George H.W. Bush in Kuwait in 1993. The U.S. had already tried to assassinate Saddam <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html" rel="nofollow">260 times</a> in 1991. And as Scowcroft said, if the incompetent 1993 attempt were any sort of justification for invading Iraq, why didn't we do so in 1993? It is at best an excuse. Even after 1993 George H.W. Bush himself did not advocate invading, and in fact still remained strong in his insistence that it was right not to invade in 1991. As he wrote in his memoirs, doing so "would have incurred incalculable human and political costs." The 1993 attempt <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/?020930fr_archive02" class="external text" title="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/?020930fr_archive02" rel="nofollow">may not be all it's cracked up to be.</a></dd>
<dd>By the way, I don't think you can so easily erase from memory things that you've said by merely saying "hey, don't take me so seriously." Even if you're merely joking, insulting people who are part of this discussion is in very poor taste and represents a violation of WP:CIVIL, a policy which I'm aware you are very concerned about. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 16:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment -- Mr. Billions</b> You're losing track of what was said. On Iraq's danger beyond Iran, Kuwait and Israel, you seem to want to argue what actual danger existed, whereas I contributed an article about what was thought at the time, so any points you make that go beyond what was known and believed at the time is irrelevant to this particular discussion (although interesting in itself, this is the wrong forum for that debate, which I'd win). You are the one changing the topic, not me. The quotes in the article show that it is a historical fact that there was a widespread belief -- a consensus -- that the Iraqi regime was dangerous to America. Nothing about what Scowcroft says contradicts that historical fact. I do find the Rice and Powell quotes dispositive and much stronger, however, and definitely worth including. I can say that because my mind isn't closed and can accept contrary information. In part, that's what collaboration is about. What I want is to get information out so we can come closer to the truth. I guess that makes me biased.</dd>
<dd>You insist on taking seriously and personally a flippant, humorous phrase I put into the edit summary. You also characterize my criticism of your rude initial comments, which you appeared apologetic for later on, as an "attack" on you.

This is not helping us.

I'm just <i>"disappointing"</i>: "I'm disappointed that you feel that discussion is not a helpful way of resolving disputes" It's just an impression I get, but after all you've said, does that wording ring a little false coming from your keyboard? And do you think this response of mine is meant to be humorous or earnest or both?

<dd>Calm down. You seem to be getting very worked up over this. I am displeased at the attempt to push a point of view (and about a dozen others have also concluded that the creation of this article was such an attempt, so it's not just me) and your subsequent behavior. I don't think someone can legitimately alternate between flippancy and earnestness, then claim to have been consistently earnest. I don't have anything against you personally, but I wish you'd drop the POV-pushing.</dd>
<dd>It is good that you've chosen to return to the discussion, but the sarcastic and confrontational nature of your return has not helped matters. I don't know why you've taken my statements so personally, but I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings.</dd>

<dd>This discussion long since ceased to be productive. I've shown where the confrontation started and who started it. I leave it to anyone, including yourself, to check the accuracy of your description of your comments and mine -- I don't find your descriptions accurate in the least. There is no sense trying to create an article on a controversial topic when so many Wikipedians are more interested in suppressing information than in trying to improve an article. The standard is that the article has to be perfect at birth or we'll kill it in the crib.

<dd>I'm not sure what you're saying is inaccurate. Nor is it clear what you mean by "who started it." JMabel was the one who nominated this article for deletion, not me. Several others have had the same criticisms of the article's structure as I have had. Perhaps you're focusing on me because I was the first one to point out the obvious political intent. Regardless, the point is not that Wikipedia doesn't or can't have articles on controversial topics--There is no shortage of those--but that Wikipedia shouldn't accept articles that are clearly intended to push a point of view. Your accusing "so many Wikipedians" of merely seeking to censor your innocent pursuit of truth is insulting. That is itself a very poor attempt at working within a group. We are not blind, and we can recognize partisanship when we see it. Please stop insulting us.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Noroton, I think that your latest efforts at improving the article present a good-faith effort at removing POV issues. There is a lot that still needs to be done, however, in terms of its structure. I will see if I can work on it a little more over the next few days.

<p><b>Delete</b> as I feel the article as presented is incapable of conforming to NPOV and reaches too far into the realm of OR (even leaving aside that the title suggests a topic 100 times broader than what it is). I admire the degree of research done here, but I think the author may misunderstand the meta-academic nature of wikipedia. This is not a place where one does research and presents a paper. This is a place to cite a published academic paper if it regards a broader topic.</p>
<p>That said, since the author has obviously done some extensive research, there's no reason for it to be completely lost. I would say that all of the quotations in the article have value to the public debate about Saddam Hussein and the Iraq War, but best practice would be to create a third party site with only those quotations and add a passage or two to related articles here with a citation to that third party site. My OR concern is not about the primary sources, it's about their presentation here 'with findings' in an original way.</p>

<dd><b>Comment -- Markeer:</b> You make good points, but they don't apply to this article. I'm not advancing a thesis that doesn't exist, I'm providing an account of what was said. I think I can find citations of what others have said about the positions people have taken, but Wikipedia (and any encyclopedia) has always used direct quotes, too. There are more here than usual, and writing an article about a debate is something new for me, but this isn't fundamentally different from other articles and doesn't have to be. You don't say why the article is incapbable of conforming to NPOV -- why?<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:11, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment -- Angus:</b> You ignore information included in the article that is contrary to some simple partisan "soapbox" statement. You call "polemical" what reports on polemical statements from people (what article about a controversy wouldn't do that?). You ask the purely rhetorical question "Why shouldn't the opinions of all the people who thought Saddam was a great guy in the 1980s be included here?" because you ignore the top part of the article itself (relying only on the article title, which I'd prefer to change to the boldface version in the top paragraph). Rather than ask a rhetorical question, why not make it a real question? The real answer would be: That doesn't relate to the perceived danger of Hussein to the U.S. and the world, which is the subject of this article. If "the opinions of all the people who thought Saddam was a great guy in the 1980s" aren't in Wikipedia, I think that's a worthy subject for an article or part of an article. If it doesn't exist, I'll be happy to help put it in -- how 'bout it, Angus?</li>

That makes it a violation of the policy against collections of primary source material. Plus, I think there's an original research issue here. If someone else had done a literature review, and an article in the "Academic Journal Of American Opinion" had used all the quotes copied here to do a statistical analysis on "Pre-Iraq War <i>U.S.</i> opinion on Saddam Hussein" (there's a systemic bias issue in the current list, but that's not grounds for deletion), we could use that journal article as a source. The quotes themselves, though, without an intermediary analyst...

<dd><b>Comment</b> No. One, I'm inclide to agree with the part of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guideline that says blogs and forum posts should never be accepted as secondary sources. Two, the analysis is of the wrong sort. I offered statistical analysis as an example. A secondary source that used the quotes as the input for calculations that found a 95% confidence interval of 57% to 79% of the U.S. population felt a certain way, that would be fine. An academic journal article that used all or some of those quotes for a case study in how political leaders present themselves in response to or in an attempt to shape public opinion, fine. All of the analysis presented in the first 5 sources, source #9, and source #25 (the 7 I checked, assuming them to be a representative sample) in my opinion either addresses a topic other than the topic of "pre-Iraq War opinion on Saddam Hussein", and is therefore irrelevant for our purposes here, addresses the topic but lacks enough of an academic nature to be a reliable source, or both. They'd be ok as examples backing up a statement like "Bloggers and op-ed columnists have used quotes by some politicians to suggest that they have flip-flopped on the subject of the Iraq War," but that's a different subject. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 03:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment--The Literate Engineer:</b> You're joining the discussion late and I can't really blame you if you didn't catch my comment somewhere in the ocean of words above that my original title wasn't well thought-out. I suppose I should have changed the title of the article (there's a process to do that while a delete discussion is going on, but I didn't have the patience to figure it out). My preferred title, and the real subject of the article in question is in the boldface words at the top of the article. Therefore public opinion isn't part of the article (and it's addressed in another article anyway). As I said above, it's an article about a political-opinion controversy: that's where the sources are. You either use the sources you have in as fair a way as possible, or decide you don't want to do an article on a particular subject. It seems to me that the subject is important enough to include in Wikipedia. Some contributors to this discussion have said they don't think so. Can the subject be covered fairly at all, or is there something inherent in the subject that makes it impossible to be covered fairly? My thinking is that any subject above some level of importance (however you define it) can and should and even must be covered by a project like Wikipedia. I can't see any way that the subject of whether there was a consensus on the danger of Iraq WMDs is not an important subject. I think it's one important part of the debate about the Iraq war. It's in that overlapping area of political controversy and recent history, and it affects the way people think. This subject is not the only part of the Iraq War debate that's important, but it's one part that is. In all the commentary of this discussion so far, I've seen a lot of emotion, a lot of invective and a lot of complaints, but hardly any grappling with (a) whether or not this is a subject important enough for a Wikipedia article; (b) whether or not it can be covered in Wikipedia fairly; (c) how to do that. The response to the article has been mostly emotional and often childish. Wikipedia seems to have its limits. I'm resigned to seeing my work wiped out and to see nothing but invective (except for a few responses like yours) in response to attempting to do an article about a controversy.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:21, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The content of the article appears to be entirely OR, as if the editor simply tossed in any divine, angelic, or demonic name he could think of without reference to whether the beings in question are even part of Christian belief, or can be referenced as such, or is designated by any reliable source as part of a "Christian pantheon". The definition of the article title appears to be extremely nebulous to judge from the Google results. Its meaning appears to vary depending on context, so an NPOV version of this article will likely be impossible to achieve. It's certainly not itself a Christian term. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 01:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Googling the term seems to bring up some existence of the term being used. An article for that term <i>might</i> be able to exist.

<li><b>Comment</b> If we are going to keep Wikipedia from spiralling out to nothing more than a database of every two-bit author &amp; part time journalist in the world, then these two Alternative tests seem applicable and perhaps need to be more widely employed when assessing Notability:

<dd>The one Times review of the Carnegie Hall performance is largely sufficient for me.

<dd>1) The article states "Mr. Kendrick debuted in Carnegie Hall with the Verdi Requiem in 1995" with a NY Times article linked.</dd>

<dd>3) Then the article continues: "The <b>performance of the Verdi Requiem on Saturday evening showed that the union may have a point.</b> Although the orchestra's strings produced a unified, warm sound, its winds were lackluster, and its brass players muddled their big moment at the start of the Tuba mirum. The performance, conducted by <b>Donald Kendrick</b>, was surprisingly leisurely; only the most overtly dramatic sections had any real drive."</dd>

This issue is tangential at best and we can address it when that article goes to AfD. Also, it would be best not to refer to her as my choir teacher, as I haven't been in a choir for many a year.

<li>Re-opening this discussion a mere 7 days after the prior discussion was closed, with at least two editors saying that the article should be marked for the attention of and cleanup by Irish Wikipedians, given the existence of quite a few sources on the subject, is an abuse of AFD. AFD is not cleanup. This renomination is effectively a demand by the nominator that cleanup progress at the rapid pace that xe sets. One doesn't get to demand that volunteer editors work to a pace that one sets. A better use of xyr time would have been to take the sources cited in the prior AFD discussion and, using them, improve the article xyrself.

Restarting a correct AfD on such short notice is a disruption of the AfD process.

<li><b>Keep? Extend?</b> I just discovered this page thanks to Google Alerts. I could add a whole lot of content to this entry to make it significantly more, well, significant. I can certainly elaborate on my contributions to the field of computer software design, web sites, etc., dating back to 1994 at least and including many (honest) industry firsts. Unfortunately, it would feel incredbily awkward to write about myself, and I'm not even sure that's allowed under Wikipedia rules. Any advice? Can I enlist good friend <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Frank_2975.html" title="Steven Frank">Steven Frank</a> to improve this entry and give it one last chcance before you guys delete it?

<li><b>Reply</b> Writing about yourself isn't actually outright forbidden (a lot of people are mistaken about this), but it's strongly discouraged: <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">Vanity</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">Autobiography</a>. The general rule of thumb is that if no one is independently inspired to write about you, then you're probably not notable enough to have an article. By extension, you really shouldn't enlist other people to write about you either. However, if you want to add something to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cabel_Sasser&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cabel_Sasser&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">discussion page of the article proper</a>, I'll consider folding it in as a disinterested party who had never heard of you before last night.

<li><b>Reply</b> also <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panic_%28company%29.html" title="Panic (company)">Panic (company)</a> is a good idea. I want to second everything that Richfife has to say. Writing about yourself (OR writing about your buddies OR getting your buddies to write about you) <i>feels</i> wrong. It is still possible to do, but you had BETTER make sure you have LOTS of goot citations from third parties as to your notability. Copious citations from reputable press would be a good start. Do people in major newsmagazines write about you? Do you appear in any Forbes list or equivalent? Does a textbook cite you as an authority in your field? Do others cite your work? Has a major publication named you to its "Top 100 most" whatever list? If any of these are true, then CITE THE SOURCES for the rest of us to check out. If you can do that, and do it many times, I will change my vote. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 02:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>so heres how it is.</p>
<p><br />
i made this up</p>
<p>and thats not a bad thing</p>
<p>in fact</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>i know several people who are incredibly angry at bruce willis and the director of Torque for having such a bad idea</p>
<p>i dont know if theyre still buying it. but if they are</p>
<p><br />
please find it in your hearts to keep this up for atleast two or three more days</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>but yeah, the first ammendment thing was a joke</p>
<p>so dont make me out to be some lame ass clown that uses bill of rights as an excuse to buy an assault rifle</p>
<p>no, im much more partial to bolt action rifles myself</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
if you got a problem with this then come to my house (i live in rhode island near providence, i will give you the info later if you wanna go)</p>
<p>but seriously. come over</p>
<p><br />
i will school you in a game of checkers, and you will shamefully walk out my door and back to wherever you came from</p>
<p><br />
but if you do win, which i doubt will happen cuz i totally own at checkers (seriously with in the first like three turns i already have like eight kings and your gonna be like woah howd he get all those friggin kings???), i will totally take down the article</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>hakuna matata,</p>
<p><br />
jakke</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ps. i'm still waiting for some loser to correct me for saying colonol hilts instead of captain hiltz</p>
<p>pps. the original great escape is way better than the new one, believe me, i've read the script for this one and that excerpt is about as cool as it gets the rest is just talk scenes and bruce willis doesnt even take his clothes off</p>

<p>I am reluctant to nominate a page for deletion that has had so much work put into it. The work here has, as far as I can tell, never appeared in a peer-reviewed journal (one of the criteria for inclusion for physical theories in general on wikipedia) and the entirety of the links supporting assertions made in the article appear to be to private companies. Even though the article sometimes takes great pains to announce its non-mainstream status (i.e., satisfies <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), for the reasons above it violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and thus I believe should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I happen to be one of the two persons which are responsible for Sdedeo's departure. It's a pity as he was a good contributor. However, I do not feel guilty. I never attacked him personally and moreover the more LQG papers I looked into, the more I felt he was wrong about the rather obscure problemm we discussed. I simply believe Sdedeo had a bad day. I sincerly hope he will return soon to Wikipedia. I do not believe his Wikibreak changes anything in the procedure which he started. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendly_Neighbour_e987.html" title="User:Friendly Neighbour">Friendly Neighbour</a> 12:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment / Question: Hi, Sdedeo. I am extremely interested in critical articles/papers/texts analyzing HT. I am aware of Sean Carroll's short statement which is quoted a few lines below. I also noted John Baez's statement in his reply below. I am 200% sure that their judgement is based on careful examination of HT. Unfortunately, i havent been able so far to find any detailed analysis/critic of HT by Baez, Carroll, or anybody else. Since HT is 30+ years old, i expect that several documents exist, that explain why HT must be wrong. Please could you give me just some (3-5 maybe) links to those Plenty you mention&#160;? I admit its annoying, but i prefer to be convinced instead of just believing. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillka_8623.html" title="User:Millka">MillKa</a> 06:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are none; that "many excellent scientists" have "weighed in" on the "tremendous promise" of HT is, of course, a fabrication. I never said there were "plenty" of articles describing how ridiculous HT is. I said it had been ignored by the scientific community and that not one peer-reviewed paper had been published on the topic. You are not going to find a serious scientist spending more than a minute on this silly thing; that two have (Phil and Sean) is surprising, but I suggest if you are looking for an education that you read up. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 19:53, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reply to Sdedeo: Now im confused, maybe because my native tongue is german, not english. The 'tremendous promise of HT' statement which you qualify as fabrication came from that 'anon esoc.esa guy'. But my question didnt refer to his statement, but your statement above: <i>Plenty of excellent, knowledgable scientists have weighed in on the ridiculousness of Heim theory's claims. It's disappointing that nobody wants to listen to them.</i> Well, i want. I always thought 'plenty' means something like 'more than enough' and so i was asking you for some substantial arguments instead of just soundbytes. Unfortunately im not as mentally gifted as those serious scientists you mentioned, who need just one minute to evaluate quite complex theories. I am way slower. So if you know of some substantial arguments, i would love to read or listen to them. Having only the option to believe authorities is somehow intellectually unsatisfying, instead i prefer to torture my brain cells till they give up (dont worry, that wont take that long ..&#160;;-P). Then i can still turn to those brighter than me. But first i want to try on my own, because there is a difference between learning by heart and understanding: Back in school when i first heard about special relativity, i quickly absorbed the formulas. Then my physics teacher showed me a few crackpot proofs denying relativity and i realized that i 'knew' they were wrong but i failed to spot where exactly their error was. It took me a while to learn that 'why-level'. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillka_8623.html" title="User:Millka">MillKa</a> 12:03, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>COMMENT. Bruhn is knocking down a straw man. <b>CLASSICAL</b> GR (general relativity) simply stated has two principles. 1) matter curves spacetime and 2)matter takes its instructions on how to move from curved spacetime. Implicit in those principles is that "empty" spacetime is FLAT because there is not matter there to curve it. <b>But in quantized spactime</b> such as in HT AND LQG artifice matter exists in 1) HT as excitations in the metron lattice and in 2)LQG as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preon.html" title="Preon">preons</a> (very small building blocks) constituted of braids of spacetime able to survive quantum fluctuations. Bruhn is using classical methods to misconsture quantum mechanical concepts. Not the first time the strange world of QM has confounded.

<li>I don't think so. The problem isn't that the manifold is flat in the absence of matter. The problem is that their manifold would appear be flat in the <i>presence</i> of matter, as well (which means that they can't account for how <a href="../../../g/p/s/GPS_8c57.html" title="GPS">GPS</a> works). Vague appeals to "quantum fluctuations" and so forth don't help: more is needed. And the blunder that Hauser and Droescher make in calling a spacetime with imaginary dimensions "<a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclidean_space.html" title="Euclidean space">R^n</a>" is also rather worrying, questions of metrics and manifolds and things aside...it doesn't bode well for the rigour and accuracy of the rest of their work (because at any time, they may appear to be talking about one thing, but meaning another: how do we tell?). Bruhn was being <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_charity.html" title="Principle of charity">charitable</a></i> when he started working with a spacetime with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minkowski_space.html" title="Minkowski space">Minkowskian</a> signature, because the letter of what the Heim theory people wrote says that their spacetime's signature is <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positive_definite.html" title="Positive definite">positive definite</a>, which doesn't cut it. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 14:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi, Byrgenwulf. Bruhn is essentially just splitting hairs over notation. He objects to the use of symbols like R4 to refer to Minkowski space, while Hauser and Droscher just say it's clear in context what they mean. It's somewhat disingenuous of Bruhn, as he would do better to attack the idea of hermetry forms and show where Heim-Droscher went wrong in applying a sort of Kaluza-Klein reasoning to get the forces out of the subspaces. I.e. to be meaningful as an objection he should go to the meat of the theory and not footle round with nicities of notation. Which is all beside the point. Just as many scientists have given the thumbs up here as against. Sdedeo in his or her last comment again commits the crime that Milka had objected against - i.e. "as as far as I can tell it's just riddled with inconsistencies and nonsensical statements" - without being more specific or inspiring confidence that Sdedeo has looked intot he matter in any detail. Any more than Jordan, Von Weizacher &amp; co. did, for example. So as I say - all beside the point - the consensus here is clearly to keep the article. So let's just wait for the Bot to do its job and remove that unsightly deletion notice.--<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 08:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Bruhn's criticism <i>isn't</i> just about the notation. It is that Heim theory is not relativistic, whatever its proponents might say. A globally Minkowskian spacetime may work for SR, but it contradicts what we know about gravity. And even if Hauser and Droescher say that their version of "R^4" just means Minkowski space, and we live in "R^4", then the theory <i>still</i> does not live up to GR. To Will: yes, I was referring to the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_positioning_system.html" title="Global positioning system">global positioning system</a>. A theory formulated in a globally Minkowskian space would predict that GPS co-ordinates would be out by a little bit, because the corrections the software makes to deal with spacetime curvature from gravity etc. would be unnecessary. But whether or not Heim theory is true is not important here, according to Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 10:26, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: According to <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">this article</a>, Heim theory not only can be tested, but has been! For example, its predictions of the proton, neutron and electron masses are wrong by about 100 standard deviations. That's impressively far from correct! According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality" rel="nofollow">Chebysheff's inequality</a>, a prediction that's 100 standard deviations off has at least a 99.99% chance of being wrong. So, we can be pretty sure that Heim theory is "utter bunk". But as you note, it may still deserve an article, just because a bunch of people believe it.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If you took the trouble to read the article carefully, you would have noticed that <i>all</i> these predicted masses are wrong by about the same percentage in the same direction (Heim's predictions are consistently about 95-100 SD's too massive). This is easily explained by having the incorrect value of gravitational constant <i>G</i> as a starting point; the calculations have been made based on the currently known value of <i>G</i>, which is quite approximate. They are <i>internally</i> consistent, though. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 03:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In an ideal world, I would agree with you entirely. However, our world falls short of the ideal in many ways — one being the difference between the number of living phlogistophiles and the number of Heim theory admirers. On abstract, philosophical grounds, I can see an argument for keeping this article around, but as a practical matter, I can only see the interests of truth being served by allowing the article to die. (Gosh, aren't I melodramatic today?) It's easy to tell the way the "consensus" decision will turn, though, so I might as well go away now. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 15:52, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice of you to concede defeat. On the point about accuracy of the masses, this laughable point has been made by others on the article's talk page. I.e. it predicts the masses from first principles and gets to within great accutacy. This is more than any other prospective 'theory of everything' has done. Yet, though these other theories produces more inaccurate values using input data which Heim theory does not need, we do not strike off the Standard Model etc. So it is not a question of whether the predictions get exactly inside error bars, but of its accuracy relative to those other theories. --<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 16:20, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The problem is <i>keeping</i> the article in a state which accurately portrays just how discredited the theory is: in an ideal world, it could be kept, but we all know how much maintenance and "looking after" these sorts of articles need. It could be lovely to have articles on all the different "theories" like this, and good solid sections explaining why they are no longer (or have never been) seriously pursued.

<li><b>Strong Delete.</b> I second what Byrgenwulf just said. The only "discussion" which Heim "theory" is "generating in the scientific world" involves how bad the pop-science magazines are. It provokes mournful sighs and shaking heads, and comments much resembling, "Was there ever a day when the media had standards?" None of these constitute a scientific response to the supposed theory itself, which only makes sense because the theory has vanishingly little content to which one can respond. It's Velikovsky for particle physics. I have lately come to the morose conclusion that NPOV for such subjects is impossible to achieve within the constraints placed upon Wikipedian editors; the next best thing is to toast this dreck in the napalm bath it deserves. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 02:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm undecided so far. For systematic reasons, I'd like to have separate (short) articles on far-off theories and their inventors, but experience has shown that the theory-articles have a tendency of uncontrolled growth by feeding from fans. The really worst case is, when the topic starts metastasizing, and adding an <i>according to Heim theory</i> in in article on real physics.

<li><b>Delete</b> All other things being equal, I would agree with those who have said that Heim theory is notable as a fringe theory with a small but devoted following and whose originator has past connections with Nazi science. However, all other things are not equal. Currently, due to persistent POV-pushing by Heim theory fans, who are unable to accept that their pet "theory" is not taken seriously in mainstream physics (or even regarded as a recognizable theory of fundamental physics at all), this article requires constant intervention by the small number of trained physicists, who are thereby prevented from doing more useful work at Wikipedia, like adding new good content. That is, <i>the Wikipedia community is not able to maintain this article in NPOV state at an acceptable cost to the community</i>. That is why it should be deleted. If policies are put in place making it easier to curb POV-pushing in controversial articles, it can be reconstituted at a later date. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 15:36, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why do you claim that “originator has past connections with Nazi science”? AFAIK, Heim's only “connection” is that he was of age (19yo) to be drafted during WWII, was drafted, worked in an explosives lab, and lost both hands in a lab accident. See the Wikipedia bio page at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkhard_Heim_0098.html" title="Burkhard Heim">Burkhard Heim</a> for details. That hardly makes him a Nazi. Most Germans of his age were drafted, and worked for the war effort. His theories were developed long after the war, in democratic Germany, and have nothing whatsoever to do with “Nazi” science.

My opinion is that this is a notable crackpot theory that must have a place on wikipedia. Because it's notable there are quite some vocal supporters. They come here to write about their theory because there is no better place for them to present their flawed ideas, i.e. in peer reviewed journals (although I would have though that journals like Physics Essays were created to get such theories published to appease the crackpots). There are only a few such notable crackpot theories, so I don't think this poses such a big problem for us. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Iblis, you are not wrong about Physics Essays, but you'll have to ask the proponents of "Heim theory" [sic] (you've got some right here on this page, such as Hugh Deasy in the next vote) why they have not published there.

<dd>Hi, <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a>. Would you please explain what you are trying to say by '.. whose originator (Heim) has past connections with Nazi science ..'&#160;? What were those connenctions&#160;? What exactly are you referring to by the term 'Nazi science'&#160;?</dd>
<dd>Do you claim that Heim was member of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_8d44.html" title="National Socialist German Workers Party">Nazi Party</a>&#160;? Heim was born in 1925. The last free election in Germany before WW2 was in 1933, Heim was 8 years old then. When Heim reached the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_majority.html" title="Age of majority">Age_of_majority</a> in 1946, WW2 was already over.</dd>
<dd>When you refer to Nazi science, are you referring to <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Physik_fe66.html" title="Deutsche Physik">Deutsche_Physik</a> (an antisemitic and nationalistic group of idiots with degrees in physics, nevertheless denying relativity theory and quantum physics, trying to 'delete' Einstein and others from the history of science just because of their ancestry and religion)&#160;? Thanks to the efforts of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker_e963.html" title="Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker">Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizsäcker</a> and others, this group lost their influence in 1940. Heim was 15 years old then. By the way, the very same Weizsäcker later was Heim's teacher in Göttingen.</dd>
<dd>Or do you refer to the fact that Heim was contacted by <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werner_Von_Braun_83d8.html" title="Werner Von Braun">Werner_Von_Braun</a> (Rocket scientist of german ancestry, since 1937 member of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_8d44.html" title="National Socialist German Workers Party">Nazi Party</a>, since 1940 member of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a>, (ab)using prisoners from the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mittelbau-Dora_4757.html" title="Mittelbau-Dora">Mittelbau-Dora</a> concentration camp as 'slave workers' in the production of the <a href="../../../v/-/2/V-2_rocket.html" title="V-2 rocket">V-2_rocket</a>; nevertheless later playing an quite important role in the NASA)&#160;? Yes, i know that von Braun didnt exactly begged for joining the Nazi party, but others faced with a similar moral dilemma either left Germany or picked research topics which were less relevant for war ..</dd>
<dd>Or do you confuse him somehow with <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pascual_Jordan_4f4f.html" title="Pascual Jordan">Pascual_Jordan</a>, a physicist who was, to put it politely, blind enough to support that cranky 'Deutsche Physik', but nevertheless smart enough to find out a few things that are part of todays mainstream physics and mathematics&#160;?</dd>
<dd>Could you please explain, maybe using Jordan as an example, why and how those completely unspecified, unsourced and unproven allegations of political and moral failure of Heim are of any relevance to Heim Theory and this nomination for deletion of the article about it&#160;?</dd>

In addition, asking me a long and complicated question (which I only just noticed) in an AfD which seems about to close doesn't seem likely to guarantee a thoughtful response, so if you <i>really</i> want a response, I suggest that you cut and paste this exchange to your own user talk page. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is a very important theory. Look at the extensive discussion archives to see that this was tabled for deletion before the AIAA prize last year, New Scientist article etc. that signalled a renewal of interest. Thus it seems absurd to again suggest it should be deleted, so soon after it obtains a measure of recognition, where the charge had been that this was an unknown theory with no awards to its credit. And there have been peer reviewed papers on this, and more are forthcoming. As if Heim was some upstart crank. In the 1950s he was perceived as one of the top physicists. Von Braun was interested in the propulsion aspects, and in March 2006 Tajmar's breakthrough experiment, almost certain soon to be replicated at Berkeley and elsewhere, generated for the first time ever an artificial gravity field, the strength of which has been quantitatively calculated using Heim-Droscher theory. So the prejudice of the 'pure' physics community, that real advances can't come from the impure field of space propulsion studies, has been again shown to be just that – a prejudice – since Tajmar et al seem to have the first proof of quantum gravity, of which Heim Theory is an important form. So the idea that it is mere POV that retains the article is seen to be the POV of those who have shown bitterly negative thoughts w.r.t. the theory, as the involvement with the Tajmar breakthrough alone would be cause for retention - see discussion for other reasons to think that htis might be an important piece of physics. Its mass formula is not a work of fantasy but a careful piece of work from first principles that seems to succeed where other 'theories of everything' have failed in predicting particle masses. --<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 20:18, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As mentioned before, Heim Theory has made very accurate predictions with the mass formula and offers an explanation of the Tajmar effect. Also, the recent discovery of artificial gravitational forces from em fields may give this theory more support. Also, the fact that a theory is not mainstream is not highly relevant. Just as an example, at one point in our history, mainstream science said that the Sun orbited the Earth. --User:djrosenau 00:48 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a high-quality article; I used this article as a starting point to do my own research on the theory. Removing this article would be a disservice to the Internet community. I feel dismayed that people feel that we should remove articles that are not mainstream. When someone says the theory is "not notable by any standard", who are they to tell me if something is notable? I personally feel that the predictions of particle masses are substantially more than anything string theory has given us, for example. If Copernicus existed in the 21st century, would his theory page on Wikipedia be listed for deletion because it was outside the mainstream thinking, and "riddled with inaccuracies"? <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigizen_3647.html" title="User:Digizen">Digizen</a> 05:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Besides what has been said already...: Heim theory cannot be accepted science at the moment since the publications haven't been translated from German into English yet. It is not a coincidence that the Tajmar experiments that fulfill a prediction of Heim theory were done in Austria. Heim theory is certainly in its very early stages, and its acceptance (if it happens) would take years, but that doesn't make it bad science. At any rate, it isn't worse than <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">String theory</a>! String theory only has more followers and more publications, but no testable predictions, no established body of theory, nothing. So before Heim theory goes, String theory should (and we know it won't because it has so many believers). Heim theory will only receive the full scrutiny it deserves once it is available in English.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The point is not whether the theory itself has merit; possibly or even probably it doesn't. But one of the glories of Wikipedia is that it is a place where one can find information about an extremely broad range of things. (And often high quality information at that.) This article makes it clear in the lead that the theory is not mainstream and has not been published in peer reviews journals, so it's not like it tries to mislead the reader. The theory itself exists, is being discussed (googling "Heim theory" gets you about 20,000 hits), and many a reader may come to Wikipedia looking for information about it.

<li>General Comment. I have a B.S. in Physics from a fairly prominent university. Bryce Dewitt taught there for a few year as well as other prominent physiscts. No, no Einsteins, Feynmans, but I did meet Dirac once. I made A's in my Physics and math courses. Can I follow Heim equations all the way? No. I can't follow Loop Quantum Gravity all the way either. But I get the big picture. They're both background independent (I often get this part reversed) implementations of quantized spacetime. they both result in what i would call "artifice" matter. That is matter arising as an oscillation of spacetime and they both lead to a mass formula. LQG has a very strong following and is well published is rigourous mathematically and peer reviewed. HT is none of those things, obscure, but predates LQG and has an Achilles heel of no quarks although it accounts for some shadow quark behavior. Extended HT is very interesting as it predicts faster than light travel. I am not putting the mathematical development, the participation, or the peer review of HT on a par with LQG- just pointing out core similarities. Some critics such as Friendly Neighbour while skeptical have contributed greatly to improving the article. Others use epithets such as "crank" and so forth and are destructive and non-constructive.

<dd>Heim published his Theory in 1977 on pages 233-243 of Vol 32a of the 'Zeitschrift für Naturforschung' (= Journal of Nature Science) under the title 'Vorschlag eines Weges einer einheitlichen Beschreibung der Elementarteilchen' (= Suggestion of a way of a unified description of elementary particles).

<dd>At that time (1977), the <a href="http://www.znaturforsch.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.znaturforsch.com/" rel="nofollow">'Zeitschrift für Naturforschung'</a> was the journal of the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Planck_Society_2fb0.html" title="Max Planck Society">Max_Planck_Society</a> (kindly check the WP article for the relevance of that research organization).</dd>

<dd>I am glad that Sdedeo agrees that the HT article already tries to be NPOV, right from its very first sentence. If some Wikipedians think the article needs more improvement, lets discuss it, section by section - instead of nuking the whole article out of WP. I already made several suggestions for improvment on the articles TalkPage.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>Some general thoughts:</b>:</dd>
<dd>Every now and then, some popular science journal writes about HT or other theories (e.g. LQG). The latest journal publication i know of was the New Scientist article in February 2006 (i am aware that some consider New Scientists reputation as debatable - nevertheless many people read it). I think many readers of such articles, most of them interested laymen, turn to WP to check for the current state of affairs and further information to form their own decision and judgement about those theories. In my humble opinion, its our duty as WP editors to provide this information as NPOV as possible and let them decide what they want to believe and think.</dd>
<dd>Articles about scientific theories should clearly explain, where the theory is in sync with mainstream science and experimental results, and where it deviates. They should explain what a theory claims and what it doesnt claim (e.g. HT does not claim existence of neutral electrons - check the archived talk pages for my post showing that this wrong claim results from translation errors).</dd>
<dd>If the HT article is deleted, WP throws away the opportunity to inform the reader that HT is not mainstream physics and to explain why.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article is a well-thought out and informative article on a topic which has drawn interest and media coverage. Even if the theory eventually turns out to be wrong, it deserves an entry in Wikipedia. No, it has not been peer-reviewed: but the page makes it clear. There have been scientific publications, and an award by a reputable agency. There are bona-fide physicists involved. The theory makes falsifiable predictions, which makes it science, regardless of the outcome. The outcome is not yet known; but that makes it no different from String Theory, or other current fads in physics. The page is not written by a crank pushing his own idee fixe, but by an informed and concerned group of editors. There is considerable interest in the topic, and it belongs in an encyclopedia. I have taken part in the discussion on the talk page and have seen the page evolve in a heated exchange of views. This attempt at deletion, coming after so many people have put so much work in a legitimate topic, goes against all that Wikipedia stands for; it is a thinly disguised attempt at censorship. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 02:38, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>General Comment. When the New Scientist article came out in January 2006, it referred to the Wikipedia article on Heim-Theory. Also, in Wikinews, when Heim made the top headline, where did they point? Right, this article sitting on death row. There will be one or two peer reviewed articles from Droscher and maybe others next year that may cause similar media interest. It would be ludicrous if the WP source of info on Heim had suffered capital punishment at that stage.--<a href="../../../h/d/e/User%7EHdeasy_98fb.html" title="User:Hdeasy">hughey</a> 14:08, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's very heartening to see this great interest in Physics both by HT pro and con. Initially, HT occupied the field of quantized space time alone. It is an old theory. I believe it predates quarks. In HT, matter arises as ocillations in the metron lattice of quantized space-time. But now LQG has a similar concept, but at a more fundamental sub-quark level. <i>See</i> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preon.html" title="Preon">Preons</a>. <i>Barkeep: Wiskis for the Editors and Beer for the Horses.</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">Will314159</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill314159_88de.html" title="User talk:Will314159">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Will314159_ffc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Will314159">contribs</a>) 16:20, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I already voted above.</dd>
<dd>The article already mentioned the first publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal in 1977, but didnt give details where to find that publication. Since <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (Verifiability) requires these details, i just added them to the article (in section <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html#Further_reading" title="Heim theory">Heim_theory#Further_reading</a>).</dd>
<dd>I assume we can all agree that there are quite different opinions whether Heim Theory is true or false. Therefore i would like to remind that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>.</i>.</dd>
<dd>As far as i understood <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl_Popper</a>, <i>absolute truth</i> only exists in mathematics - in nature sciences the next best thing is <i>current state of knowledge</i>, which in science history has been a (sometimes pretty fast, but not superluminal) moving target ..</dd>
<dd>Yes, i am aware of the 100 StdDevs error of the HT mass formula. However i cant exclude, that reverse engineering might find a <i>biggest blunder</i> ..</dd>

<dd>Comment: The StdDev objection is bunk. Standard Deviation is a criterion for <i>random</i> statistical error; the discrepancy in mass formula result is <i>systematic</i>: all the results are off by the same percentage in the same direction. Thus if you were to change the value of, say, the gravitational constant G slightly, you would get “on-the-spot” results. The catch? The value of G is only known to about 0.001 accuracy, so its anybody's guess what exactly should be plugged in. Therefore the “100 SD” argument against Heim Theory is invalid, unless the discrepancies were different for different masses, which is not the case. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 15:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reply to Freederick: I fear the StdDev objection is valid. Adjusting G would severly disturb the general Feng Shui of the Universe (or even the Multiverse - or is it Multiverses&#160;?)&#160;;-P</dd>
<dd>However, as you correctly point out, the errors look quite systematic. The interesting question is whether it is possible to apply a corresponding systematic modification to the mass formula so that it delivers better or even exact results. Then the even more interesting next question would be: Whats the physical meaning of that nifty math trick&#160;? I have severe problems to understand why so many physicists consider that question as completely unworthy to investigate. Since a correct HT-type mass formula would drastically lower the number of universal constants, even the most stringent stringists should be interested, cause it might help them to fight the recent <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_even_wrong.html" title="Not even wrong">Not_even_wrong</a> debate by <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Smolin_7643.html" title="Lee Smolin">Lee_Smolin</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Woit_5d9e.html" title="Peter Woit">Peter_Woit</a>.</dd>
<dd>Which is by the way a major reason why in my humble opinion the HT article should stay: Unsolved problems should be attacked from all sides, instead of just the familiar or promising looking ones. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillka_8623.html" title="User:Millka">MillKa</a> 12:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: It's hard for me to understand why the article should be deleted. Everybody at least a bit open minded should be able to see the difference between nonesense and Heim's work. Even if somebody is not willing to accept the theory, somebody else might - and for theses other people the information present in Wikipedia might be valuable. Also there is quite a lot of material available, just not in english right now (what hopefully changes over time), so just because there are little english information available, doesn't make the whole theory wrong or nonesense. And how should any theory get accepted if these kind of discussions mislead potential interested people in thinking this theory is (non-science or whatever ever words have been found for it). After all it's theoretical physics and nobody is able to judge something like Heims theory by a quick glance over it. So please keep the article as it would be a shame to have all the work of the article's authors be destroyed. --Mvuori 17:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I am not a physicist. I am a mathematician and I have no opinion whether this theory corresponds to the physical reality or not. But regardless of that this is a theory and as such it deserves its article in Wikipedia. By the way, reading these comments, I am happy that I am not a phycycist - qualifications such as <i>pseudoscience</i> make me really angry. In mathematics we also have alternative theories - even theories that deny almost everything you know about the mathematics (<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuitionism.html" title="Intuitionism">Intuitionism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructivism_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Constructivism (mathematics)">Constructivism</a>).

<dd>Ideas still exist which can only be termed <i>pseudomathematics.</i> Crank schemes for <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squaring_the_circle.html" title="Squaring the circle">squaring the circle</a> spring to mind; I could provide many more examples.

Heim theory is, according to what mainstream scientific judgment has been said, the equivalent of these pseudomathematical notions. The overbearing weight of evidence indicates that this "theory" does not and indeed <i>cannot</i> correspond to physical reality. That's not the question. Per Wikipedia policies and community practice, articles on "theories" which completely diverge from physical reality can still exist, if those "theories" and the articles written on them satisfy certain requirements. Arguably, Heim theory does (it has attracted a certain amount of media attention); arguably, it does not, or at least the current article should be abandoned (to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and other policies). <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 18:34, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heims theory seems to be distinctly different from the Crank's which appear in mathematics. Mathematical cranks generally make obvious errors in their working, exploit tricks, like dividing 0 by 0, or do a lot of handwaving, missing out important details in their theories. Heim from what I can tell has not committed these sins, unstead he developed his own mathematical framework, worked very hard developing the theory. Heim seems to have more the character of Adrian Wiles who worked for years before publishing that that of the cranks who tend to do a mimimum of work spending all their time rating about their theory. Maths Grad student are frequently set the task of finding flaws in crank's theories, yet for heim we have post-grads busilly translating his work. I'm not sure how to describe Heim, excentric/recluse, but chrank he is not. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 20:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er... <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wiles_2324.html" title="Andrew Wiles">Andrew Wiles</a>? If so, the comparison is laughablle. First, Wiles is no crank and no-one has ever suggested that he is a crank. (Except maybe <a href="http://www.crank.net/harris.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crank.net/harris.html" rel="nofollow">James S. Harris</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a>, but their opinion may be safely discounted!) Second, Wiles was already acknowledged as a leader in his field well <i>before</i> his work on FLT. Third, he was teaching and attending to various departmental duties (at one of the most prestigious math departments in the world, be it noted) just like other faculty members. Even spending regular blocks of time working hard by oneself in the attic is rather normative for research mathematicians. What is highly unusual about Wiles's labors is that he told very few colleagues what he was doing for many years, and of course the epochal nature of his results. (OT: I continue to be surprised that no-one seems to challenge the "secrecy" which is part of the Wiles legend; I recall hearing highly credible rumors in 1990 that he was working on FLT and making remarkable progress.)---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 04:24, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I just wrote 200 words and lost it when I hit a key by mistake. So I will make only two comments. Some of the contributors to this discussion have adopted a snide, put-down tone when discussing the arguments/thinking of other contributors. This is not consistent with the principles and ideals that have led to the creation of Wikipedia. As/if this continues, we risk having the Wikipedia form overwhelmed by pointless debates among individuals stroking their egos or private agendas. Generally, in this discusion, one finds this snide voice predominationg among those proposing deletion. Second, discussions of Heim theory would profit if a first-class theorist familiar with general relativity, German, English, perhaps a student in Germany when Heim was still fairly active in the 1960s took an interest. Sounds like Julian Barbour, Oxfordshire, who also consorts with LQG theorists such as Smolin. Now is he ready, willing, interested, or even a companion among the quick in having his imagination tweaked by a stray concept?</li>

I also did a spot check of some anon votes, and am glad to say that I found no clear pattern suggesting that someone was multiply voting as an anon. But I remain concerned about the above noted votes. So, it seems, do several other users. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I came to this article because I saw mention of it elsewhere and decided to look it up on wiki. This article told me almost everything I could have wanted to know. While the article is guilty of minor NPOV violations (It certainly needs a criticism section), the fact is that it's an example of Wikipedia doing what it's designed to do - providing fairly accurate about something, even if that something is a load of crap.Fdgfds 02:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another general <b>comment</b>: this page makes utterly chaotic reading, in part because many commentators randomly inserted comments somewhere after a bulleted item, which means that earlier comments appear further down and suddenly become almost impossible to undertand because it is no longer clear what they were referring to in the above. I would like to see a a thoroughly revised AfD process, but there seems no chance of that. Barring this, I would like to see revised guidelines for the format of AfD pages, but there seems little chance of even this. It's really absurd that some of us had to do to try to clarify who said what above by wikisigning would-be voters after the fact, calling attention to single use accounts which were very possibly created only to vote in this AfD, etc. I'd like to see automatic wikisigning of comments in talk pages, or at least AfD pages, but again there seems little chance of this happening.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 04:06, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"I do not understand the purpose of this article, or in what manner it contributes to an understanding of racism. In the examples given hostility towards the Germans was born out of the specific circumstances of World War II, and was not historically transcendental. It was also directed towards the German state of the time, no similar hostility being directed towards Swiss Germans. Stalin's ethnic purges, moreover, embraced all suspect national minorities, including the Crimean Tartars, and not just the Volga Germans (who, incidentally, could NOT speak German in the standard sense). The mass relocation of German citizens in 1945 was part of a political process arising from Yalta, and not the result of 'anti-Germanism'.

[FT] IS significant inside the counterstrike community because we have been around for longer than something like 97% of all gaming clans. Also, it is our original server FTC2 that the &lt;DAWG&gt; clan was a major part of.

<p>I admit that I am a newbie, but I am also very passionate about helping low-income countries with their transport problems. There is an enormous lack of information available for the 66% of people who live in cities of less than 3 million. The big cities such as Cairo and Bangkok have the opposite problems of too much study.</p>
<p>I would like, therefore, to collect the existing knowledge in a structured way. Wiki is, I think, a perfect place for this, though I am open to other suggestions, because I would also like to create a method in which users can evaluate their own cities and put the results online for others to compare with.

<p>This is your standard "author-removed CSD" case, which people more wedded to process than I have deemed "a controversial deletion" (I would argue that the author of a rogue article who removes the CSD and does little to show why it was erroneous is continuing their fun, rather than engaging in controversy). An anonymous editor who may well be the original author has announced that this is all factual on the article's talk page.

this is Philip Brown delete all, but i am sure that wikipedia will one day write articles about this man and his intiatives. By the way i am not advocating that these articles must be on the wikipedia, i will read and love the wikipedia all the same, delete all if wikipedia considers these articles fabrication irrespective of the references. but it tells me one thing nobody can really tell what is fabricated and what is not. As for me one day you will agree that these articles are not indeed fabricated. Good luck UTC from me it also DELETE ALL at least now you do not have any contest for your speedy deletion on Internationl Peace Institute "The page has been improved, go look again before deciding.": 86.129.68.54 14:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

Igbogirl is correct in that this is a real historical person on which the lead character in a famous Igbo novel by Pita Nwana has been based. This is mentioned in Alain Ricard, <i>The Languages and Literatures of Africa: The Sands of Babel</i> (James Currey Publishers, 2004, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0852555814</a>, available on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Books_5e58.html" title="Google Books">Google Books</a>), p. 84, and in Harold Scheub, "A Review of African Oral Traditions and Literature", <i>African Studies Review</i>, Vol. 28, No. 2/3. (Jun. - Sep., 1985), p. 38. Scheub references an article by A. E. Afigbo, "Chief Igwegbe Odum: the Omenuko of History", in <i>Nigeria Magazine</i>, 90 (1966), p. 222-231. According to Scheub, Afigbo calls the novel "perhaps so far and from a literary point of view, one of the greatest ahievements of the [Igbo] language" (Scheub quoting Afigbo), but also argues that Omenuko, the fictionalized version of Chief Igwegbe Odum, is "nothing like his historical character" (Scheub's own words referencing Afigbo).

<li><b>Comment</b> - The primary problem with the <i>proposed</i> guideline on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a> is that it is fairly obviously Eurocentric. A number of problems exist in attempting to analogize out of this to non-European traditional leaders. Nations of the sort whose borders are recognised by international law may represent colonial impostures that don't correspond to local realities. Similarly, the fact that the holder of a traditional title holds no <i>legal</i> precedence recognized by a national government may not accurately reflect the fact that local traditions make them persons whose decisions are given great importance. For example, the office of the <a href="../../../o/b/a/Oba_of_Benin_64c9.html" title="Oba of Benin">Oba of Benin</a> continues to exist, and the Oba is treated with great deference, even if the kingdom no longer exists as a legal entity, and the territory where the Oba's writ extends crosses several national borders. Per <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>, each holder of the title is as entitled to an article as the kings or queens of England, as far as I can see. If Igwegbe Odum held a similar position, his inclusion should be equally automatic, even if he's an obscure figure in the English speaking world. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:54, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am a Nigerian Igbo as you can tell by my username. I have an MA in Igbo history. In Igbo culture, 'Kings' and 'Chiefs' are ALL "local". King does not have the same meaning in Igboland and other parts of Nigeria/West Africa as it does in, say, England or Sweden. For example, if you were to compare it to New York: there would a be King/Chief for Manhattan and another for Queens and another for Staten Island. In some instances there might even be a different King/Chief for the Upper East Side and another for midtown. I think that <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppland.html" title="Uppland">Uppland</a> has basically established Igwegbe's notability in his research above. African history at the period during which Igwegbe lived was not generally a written history. For this man to actually show up in books, on a Google search and to be discussed at lectures to this day, in my mind establishes him as somebody notable. And the book, <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omenuko.html" title="Omenuko">Omenuko</a> which is allegedly written about him, is a major part of Igbo literary history. If this were the first-ever English language novel published, I think it would have been given more respect here<a href="../../../i/g/b/User%7EIgbogirl_5b54.html" title="User:Igbogirl">Igbogirl</a> 15:33, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously, the first English language novel should have an entry in the English Wikipedia. My point about the king vs. chief distinction was not to cast aspersion on the person, just to note that the notability criteria is written assuming a western-centric definition of the word, "king", which may not apply to Igwegbe Odum. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a> notes, for example, that a royal person is someone who is an official member of the ruling family of a country. Igwegbe Odum would not fit this definition. However, it is not my contention that this person is automatically not notable because he is not royalty (as per the notability definition). My only contention is that this person is not <i>automatically</i> notable for being a king or local chief. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 15:54, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Gotcha. Sorry to be pedantic but here is another example that illustrates my point. Princess_Comfort_Okpudili_Amobi_of_Ogidi This family were rulers only of Ogidi and therefore absolutely not the ruling family of any country - Ogidi is simply a regular sized town, in Anambra State, in Nigeria. Only 6 Google hits on her, two of those being Wikipedia hits and two being Answer.com hits hit. Therefore this person and her family would not seem to fit your critera for being notable for being royal, but you have however seen fit to include the article. I'm not meaning to be a pain, just trying to point out that Nigerian history and royalty is complex and sometimes indecipherable but should still be included.

<ul>
<li><i>room for expansion and organic growth</i> is a euphemism for "leave it alone and maybe someone will do something to it in the future." If these articles are precious as you state, please make them notable such that they survive. Merely asking for a "stay of execution in case some future fellow passes by" is a recipe for a load of non notable stub and sub-stub articles. I realise you take the topic of schools very seriously. An excellent use of that seriousness would be to research genuine notability and assert it within the articles. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Forbidden, you have now claimed in multiple articles that all schools are notable and insitsted that they are Wikipedia's "most precious articles" (apparently more important than featured articles or articles about basic things like <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> or biographies of influential people like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>) without giving any explanation or grounds for this.

The fact that many editors disagree with the assertion certainly doesn't help matter. I'm not attempting to discourage you, however, your repeated assertions with no attempt to back them up is significantly reducing the signal to noise ratio in the school AfDs.

<p>"Exploding Cows" does not even seem to be a real issue and does not even seem to rise to the level of an urban myth. It seems as if this article was put up along with all the other animals. The subject just seems to be complete nonsense. ---Gothere 14:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If Dave Barry writes of exploding cows, then this topic does indeed serve a purpose. It becomes an anchor point for those who seek to research his works of comedy and parody. If we start deleting topics simply because someone thinks they are "pointless", then soon it cud lead Wikipedia into udder chaos. I say this: Let the exploding cow remain!

<li>This is a valid article and should be retained. Exploding cows are a routine event, although not widely reported. This should really be left well enough alone. In fact, more research needs to be done into the subject of exploding cows and the wikipedia entry could even be expanded more broadly. --rbenjamin 27-Sept 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.32.227.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.32.227.90_8091.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.32.227.90">contribs</a>) 2006-09-27 16:07:53 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article does no harm. It's not hurting the site or anyone who uses it. If you believe it to be nonsense, just ignore it and be on your way instead of insisting on taking it down, for which there is no valid reason anyway.

<li><b>Comment</b> If an article is nonsense, then there is no reason to keep it. Leaving bad articles in the encyclopedia undermines its (admittedly already poor) credibility. If the encyclopedia knowingly includes nonsense, then it is a nonsense encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcartwright_74e5.html" title="User:Djcartwright">Djcartwright</a> 20:32, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we let individual's opinions decide which articles remain and which are deleted, Wiki would be in chaos, at least what would be left of it. I saw people arguing that a page on some aspect of physics (the specific one eludes my memory) needed to be taken down because it was "irrelevent."
<p>To those who consider this to be inappropriate, obscene, disgusting smut, let me remind you that many of Wiki's most viewed pages are lists of porn stars. This article is much more appropriate than any of those, yet this is the one that gets marked for deletion. This article also serves more of a purpose. It may just save some farmer's life by, say, teaching him not to light up a cigarette next to a cow that has just flatulated.71.100.4.176 19:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If we could just cite a reputable source for the composition of cow fart, there shouldn't even be an argument about whether or not to keep this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I note that the following guideline on Wikipedia's page regarding article deletion, and specifically under the heading of what <b>not</b> to delete: "Articles we are not interested in -- some topics are of interest only to some people, but since Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, articles that interest some people should be kept." Exploding cow is part of American culture, as are the familiar topics of most widely syndicated or published humorists and social commentators. Not because of Dave Barry per se, but because of the result wrought upon our culture, the article should stay. 68.160.254.170 23:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC) Avon</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It has a reference now. And I should point out that whether or not it is an urban myth is irrelevent. Wiki still has an article on "sasquatch." Why don't you go try to kill that article? Just think of this article as describing an urban myth instead of trying to prove it. And as a previous user already pointed out, just because some individuals don't like an article, doesn't mean it should be deleted; this is even in Wiki's official policy. It does you no harm, and I don't see why any of you should actually care enough to fight so vehemently for its deletion.71.100.4.176 02:07, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Not one that's to the point. We all know that cows produce lots of methane; the question is do they explode if you light their farts? Your reference says no.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I have previously said, there are many Wiki articles about things whose reality is in question or already disproved. The fact is that even if the exploding cow myth is not true, it has still had a very tangible influence in pop culture, as evidence by the article's list of media in which it has appeared.</li>

<li>Of course it is a duplicate, look at the articles, they all three purport to do the same thing: list doomsday scenarios.

Now we have a third person (yourself) with an unsourced list of doomsday scenarios and a third approach to the same problem. It's highly confusing for the reader to determine which list to look at. Also just because it is a list it is not exempt from original research and POV rules. Who says these are doomsday scenarios - half of them are science fiction as far as I and many others are concerned (based on previous edit histories of the other articles). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 23:49, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

That is, we seem to have enough articles on this topic (the list is functioning as a category, basically), so try to improve the other articles and, of course <i>cite your sources</i>. Also, rationalize what belongs. Terrorism can, of course, have a "catastrophic effect on humans" but it would only be an extinction level event as a proximate cause of something else (e.g., nuclear holocaust). I do not agree, BTW, that this "just can't be made encyclopedic." Potentialities of this sort can be sourced, and I think there might actually be an absence in our coverage (after just a glance): are we separating human level extinction from terrestrial tree of life extinction? Terrorism won't bother bacteria—is there anything (beyond the Sun's demise) that <i>would</i> eliminate <i>all</i> life on Earth? We should list/describe that, if we don't already. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:06, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am unsure what you accuse me of objecting to by using the paradoxical term "neutral bias." I will tell you what I do advocate, however, and what I do object to. I advocate making objective decisions, by which I mean making decisions (<i>keep</i>, <i>delete</i>, <i>merge</i>, etc.) <i>a posteriori</i>. I consider Wikipedians who monitor the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">Articles for Deletion</a> page more likely to be objective and <i>a posteriori</i> compared to Wikipedians solicited specifically because of the extent of the discussion's correspondence with their own preconceived ideas. By soliciting votes from fifty-eight articles related to the article we are discussing here, <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/User_talk%7EMapleTree_ba42.html" title="User talk:MapleTree">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MapleTree_eb96.html" title="Special:Contributions/MapleTree">contribs</a>) has compromised this discussion by introducing possible <i>a priori</i> judgements. Specifically, because the preconceived ideas of Wikipedians who monitor Articles for Deletion are less likely to correspond to the article in discussion here than Wikipedians solicied from fifty-eight articles pertaining to doomsday scenarios, I consider the former more likely to be objective and more likely to be capable to pass <i>a posteriori</i> judgements than the latter. I consider the former group more likely to be able to accept or deny the strength of a deletion proposal on the basis of the strength of the arguments in support of deletion, rather than the extent of the proposal's correspondence with their own preconceived ideas. I do not think that your vote is <i>necessarily</i> impartial because you were solicited, Serge; because MapleTree solicted requests to "save this article," however, I think that he introduced sufficient <i>a priori</i> and subjective judgements to this discussion to create an impartial, subjective, and <i>a priori</i> discussion. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. It is the "save this article" language to which you object. I suppose that might be a problem, but it could work either way. When I saw it, I wasn't overwhelmed with a desire to go save an article, it piqued my interest to find out what the fuss is all about. I read the comments here, and the articles in question, and voted accordingly. It could have gone either way. I honestly don't think I was biased to find in favor of saving because of the language used in the solicitiation. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 15:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I admire your <i>a posteriori</i> judgement, Serge.

Granted, the notice on every page discussed for deletion is specifically such a solicitation and is arguably most likely to attract possible <i>a priori</i> judgements, but I think it is necessary to prevent confusion; but it is unacceptable to attract any more possible judgements and thus further subjectively bias the discussion. Nonetheless, it is "...considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated [for deletion]...."

How <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> could possibly know the views and bias of me or anyone else who happened to stumble on to one of his innocent solicitations, I have no idea.

<dd>I apologize for leaving out that clause. I did not intend to, as you accuse me of, "redact the relevant portions" and "conveniently [leave] out [the] critical clause." I honestly did not, at the time I quoted <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, find it [the clause] important, although I can see I was mistaken. I fid not think I needed to illuminate that point. I was mistaken. I disagree, however, that the solicitations of <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/User_talk%7EMapleTree_ba42.html" title="User talk:MapleTree">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MapleTree_eb96.html" title="Special:Contributions/MapleTree">contribs</a>) were innocent or innocuous; I argue that they were indeed harmful. I think that specifically because MapleTree's posts were a request to "save this article," they inherently attract (not solely, but largely) users with known views and biases that specifically correspond to this article, thus violating the specific clause of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> in its entirety. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 06:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So your argument rests on the assumption that the "save this article" wording in the solicitations is likely to attract more of those who are inclined to save articles in general, to save this particular article, or both, than those who are more inclined to delete it for some reason. I disagree. I could see it working either way. It could just as easily have backfired on him, and, judging by the way the votes are going, appears to have accomplished exactly that. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 22:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If the result is <i>keep but define a set of criteria for inclusion</i>, I doubt the criteria will be created because the list will have already been kept, the goal of achieving favorable consensus already achieved; but if the proposal is <i>delete unless a set of criteria for inclusion is created</i>, then there is significant timely motivation for the condition to be met. If a set of criteria cannot now be created, but can be created in the future, then the article can be nominated for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:08, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unles a set of criteria for inclusion are created.

None of the events in this list give any note by any reliable published source as to their apocalyptic nature. Thus this list is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. But I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarskell_425e.html" title="User talk:Marskell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marskell_5d95.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marskell">contribs</a>) that the content in this list can be made encyclopedic. But until specific criteria for inclusion are created such that this list cannot exponentially grow, and such that it only permits <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> information, I nominate it for deletion. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I thought of specific criteria I want to know immediately if I were to come to this article. Is it an article about doomsday, or about any events that pose existential risk? The two events are dissimilar. Doomsday may refer to different Christian eschatological beliefs, or it may refer to any doomsday event, which "...may range from a major disruption of human civilization, to the extinction of human life, to the destruction of the planet Earth, to the annihilation of the entire universe." (<a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_event.html" title="Doomsday event">Doomsday event</a>) <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">Existential risk</a> may not necessarily "...annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life...," but may merely "...permanently and drastically curtail its [Earth-originating intelligent life's] potential."</dd>
<dd>So, is this article going to,
<ol>
<li>elaborate on and illuminate various Christian eschatological belifes,</li>
<li>list any doomsday event,</li>
<li>detail any event which may "...annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life...," or</li>
<li>merely list any event which may "...permanently and drastically curtail its [Earth-originating intelligent life's] potential."</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If it is the first, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a>; if it is the second, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>; if it is the third, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>; and if it is the fourth, it is deserves an entirely new name and new content, <i>if</i> that content is verifiable.</dd>
<dd>There, if anyone can provide a specific set of criteria that does not specifically describe another article as I layed out, or if anyone can show me where my reasoning is wrong and how this list could be distinct from the three (and fourth hypothetical) article, then I will be impressed and will gladly consider changing my vote. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We've been through this before in the other articles. Just because a source lists it doesn't mean it's valid. Many of the sources list scenarios that are science fiction.

<li><b>Keep but edit</b> I think it holds merit as an article, but things like hurricanes, which affect relativly few people in the whole world, and the article titled "The End is Nigh" should be removed from the list as "The End is Nigh" is not an actual even that could lead to eventual desturction of the world as we know it, but an editorial.

<p>I've listed this one for deletion because it seems an obvious instance of using Wikipedia for self-promotion.

<dd><b>keep</b>- Article has been re-written. However,non-notable flag is inaccurate. Ndorward seems to have some personal issue with Royal. He/she erased a reference from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geri_Allen_9ca5.html" title="Geri Allen">Geri Allen</a> that she first recorded in DC on Royal's debut album Dream Come True 1979, citing it as false. FYI Gregory Charles Royal, Geri Allen Clarence Seay Warren Taylor and Jeff Corbett personnel. Reference the album via the song Dancer on web search. Internet Broadway Data Base, Duke Ellington Orchestra albums on major labels and Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz etc etc. are all legitimate. Article information is factual. bethbar5 20:55, 29 September 2006</dd>

<dd>I'm still voting <b>delete</b>. Sure, Royal has played with notable musicians, &amp; was in the posthumous Ellington band decades after Ellington's death, &amp; he's in comprehensive specialist jazz resources like Feather's book. But playing with notable musicians doesn't in itself make you a notable musician. -- I deleted the ref. to him in the Allen entry because no details were provided about the recording, &amp; it didn't turn up in AMG or in a discography of Geri Allen's recordings that I consulted. Fair enough: a 1979 recording would certainly make it her first recorded date, though the album seems to be extremely obscure. I'd glad to see you've deleted some of the more obvious puffery in the article ("renaissance man" &amp;c &amp;c), but I'm still not convinced Royal is deserving of a page, especially when it starts to have ripple effects on the pages of major jazz musicians (since irrelevant links to him keep getting added to pages of players like Art Blakey). --<a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 04:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>keep</b>. This is my final response. To repond to the previous comment, one can simply find tons of artists on Wi that have far less creditials. As far as the critertia set by Wi on what constitutes notable, Royal meets this test. Not to mention that he is the judge on America's Hot Musician, a nationally distributed program, that is part of the Plight of American Music Program being distributed to schools nationwide. He also has two charting pop songs to his credit Trust the Love You See and Can't Let Love by Ariel... 13:31, 30 September bethbar5</p>

<p><b>Additional Comment</b> because of additional comments by others...This twisted logic that because Royal does not travel in the circles of musicians, who by the way are very respectful of Royal's work, who are strictly "jazz trombonists" entirely misses the point that Royal is MORE than just a jazz trombonist and he is not seeking inclusion as a jazz trombonist-even though he could. Not only has he performed in many of the same bands as the afforementioned (Turre and Royal were in the CBA ensemble), Turre, Eubanks, Anderson and Royal toured with World of Trombones etc in addition to Slide Hamptons comments which are in a Downbeat Magazine ad in May 2006)</p>
<p>What makes Royal stand out in addition to the additions to the article is that he is in the social front of music TODAY with American Youth Symphony and his program America's Hot Musician which is a significant program for music education and awareness. It seems the contributors are jazz affectionados. I submit how many average people know of any of the musicians you have cited-including Art Blakey. Notability and obscurity should be considered from a neutral vantage point and the totality of the artist. bethbar5</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the reason why Royal's entry came to my attention in the first place was the efforts of himself or his friends (I assume you're in some way affiliated with him?) to associate his name with the <i>jazz</i> entries, through inserting contrived references to him in the entries of well-known <i>jazz</i> musicians like Art Blakey, Mercer Ellington &amp; Geri Allen. Anyway, there are no entries in Wikipedia for the American Youth Symphony or America's Hot Musician (I dread to say this, as I get the feeling that I'm unintentionally inviting their creation....), so I guess they're currently obscurer than Art Blakey. Sounds fine to me. --<a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 04:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Response</b>The reason the links to others was put in in the first place was because of the Wi message that the article contained no links and should be added (check the history of the article).Accordingly, they were added. If this was done in error it was not meant to be. However this does not diminish Royal's accomplishments regardless of whether he is a "widely" recorded as the trombonists mentioned. As we know that artistic quality does not necessarily correlate with a discography. American Youth Symphony and America's Hot Musician are not ripe enough for addition at this time. 10:00, 3 October 2006 bethbar5</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Not ripe enough" meaning "not actually broadcast" I assume? A websearch reveals the show is only set to debut next year. This is getting ridiculous: you're suggesting he's important because of something he's done that <b>hasn't even yet taken place</b> (i.e. the future broadcast of a show). This is precisely why the page reeked of self-promotion. --<a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 14:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Duh</b> and you have a problem with that? You obviously have a bone to pick at any cost. Why would a page go up on a show that hasn't yet aired?...And correction, <b>YOU</b> are suggesting he is not important <b>merely</b> because he has a career of playing with major productions,bands and musicians in addition to social music educational work...Your suggestion is more ridiculous.

An unfortunate side effect here is that an attempt to make an NPOV article (or series of articles here, as may be the case) is also spilling into other trollish behavior due to several individuals espousing POV edits on these articles. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Horning_299d.html" title="User:Robert Horning">Robert Horning</a> 19:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Since there is enough material to create seperate articles for "People to People International" and "People to People Student Ambassador Programs," this page may function better as a disambiguation page (as both organizations are referred to as simply "People to People"). That way, Mr. Horning's concerns about confusing the two groups will be clearly addressed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 01:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree. Each page should describe the relationship of the organization it's describing to the other organization, and each page should link to the other. Mark Rosenthal 03:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Sage Software chose Snap Technologies to provide the SnapTech CMS to over 3000 Sage Partners in North America. Re: Google.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article certainly shouldn't be deleted, as it contains a wealth of material which is actually quite useful and beyond trivial. Funnily enough, it's actually a pretty good article! I agree that the "good" material ought to be farmed out to other articles, or this one renamed, but that can't happen if it's zapped. Also, the article serves as a tremendous pressure valve for the main <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> article which otherwise gets filled with every fact our many anon visitors can throw at it. Finally, your quoting of precedent is extremely one-sided. This article has previously survived AFDs as have other articles with "trivia" in the title. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the main problem with this article is that the bulk of it isn't trivia, it's genuinely useful information of the type that people could easily come here for. That said, I'm not sure what else it could be called.

<p>OK, here's where we stand so far.. in all of our discussion, and from allof google, we've been able to have people pull up many citations from people against BI (per the straw man argument), one has demonstrated a Christian organization refering to themselves as literalists but only in regards to Genesis and with no definition. (it's likely they are inerrencists working with a different def of literalism). And we have one source of a historical usage of the word with no text.. This leaves us with no notable, refrenceable, citable definition of the word literalism other than from those who use the straw man definition that literally no one has owned up to. If our examination into the notable teachers on the subject reveals no additional insight..where do we go from there?

<dd>close.&#160;:) Inerrency = what the author was relaying is without error. If an author tells a parable as such, the meaning of the parable is factually true not the historical facts of the characters involved. The assertation of the literalism article is that literalists do not believe in parables. Jesus taught in and explained the meaning of his own parables. There is no such thing as a person who believes the Bible and does not believe parables. And certainly there is no reputable doctrine or teaching as such. --<a href="../../../d/j/s/User%7EDjSamwise_6d61.html" title="User:DjSamwise">DjSamwise</a> 22:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Whitewash or Delete</b> The article was originally prod'ed on 29 August 2006. I deproded because I believed both that biblical literalism was a real, incorrect hermeneutic and that the article was repairable. I still think biblical literalism is a real hermeeutic. I no longer believe the current draft is repairable or helpful. Evidence from the talk page is that this may have started as a POV fork from <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, where the section on biblical literalism (now gone) had its own problem with a lack of a neutral point of view. Multiple editors have been expanding the OR bilbical exegesis, and declining to listen to multiple other editors that have been trying to educate them on the talk page that biblical exegesis with citations directly to scripture does not constitute what is expected as an article. I believe their intentions are good, but that they don't yet adequately understand the Wikipedia standards, and dramatic action is needed to demonstrate that the standards are real. This dramatic action could be by whitewashing or deleting. A whitewash needs to totally replace the content with a stub adhering to our policies. An example is what happened here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery_and_religion&amp;diff=62626386&amp;oldid=61399866" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery_and_religion&amp;diff=62626386&amp;oldid=61399866" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> as a result of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Religion_and_slavery_b5de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religion and slavery">this AFD discussion</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> From my personal experience with this article and the editor who <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNs</a> it, it was created as a POV fork of biblical inerrancy. I tried to explain that, under guidelines, we should only create a spinout article if we have more content than can fit reasonably in the parent article, not (as it turned out) to combat the poor treatement of literalism in the inerrancy article. I suggested we focus our energies in improving the inerrancy article before creating a spinout. Next, the format of the article is clearly not encyclopedic with the use of bulleted lists and sentence fragments. Third, the main editor doesn't understand the difference between citing the bible and the original reseach of interpreting the bible. If someone believes the bible literally, don't cite specific verses, cite the individuals who hold these views. If someone believes there are contradictions in the bible, don't posit these controadictions ourselves, but instead cite this interpretation. Finally, I asked on the talk page for the main editor to name a single person who is a bible literalist. And I asked, if this person existed, why they weren't cited as a source. The response was "Luther", who isn't mentioned as a literalist or inerrant in his article. I am truly skeptical on whether this position even exists. After working on this article, I do not believe it is salvageable. If <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">relaiable sources</a> are ever found, we could add some content over at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, but I strongly suggest returning this article back to a redirect to that article due to original reseach, formatting, sourcing, verifiability and possible hoax issues.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Arbeiter seems skilled at defending his edits, but we should still recognize this article as worthless. Wikipedia articles should never make mainstream Christians uncomfortable.

DjSamwise's revisions are even worse. There are plenty of Biblical literalists. Repeatedly claiming they don't exist doesn't make it true. And because the Bible explicitly states Jesus spoke in parables, literalists recognize the parables of Jesus as such. DjSamwise's version offers misrepresentations of references and misrepresentations of terms (AKA "straw man" terms). DjSamwise even includes references conflicting his own thesis. It would be better if both versions simply disappeared. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillstone_da96.html" title="User:Millstone">Millstone</a> 10:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not presenting a thesis. Yes my edits for this article are bad, the article is bad. The term Literalist is a slanderous term used by certain people to proove a point. In other versions and discussions Arbeiter (NOT ME) came up with the parable point that you are refuting, that they (literalists) disagree with the Bible's parables. (trees of the fields clapping thier hands?) His original argument was that it's stupid to believe treeswould grow hands, and literalists believed the literal version of that therefore literalists are stupid. How is that not a strawman argument that he presented? NO ONE believes that, though that's what the article said. So I changed the article to call it what it was.--<a href="../../../d/j/s/User%7EDjSamwise_6d61.html" title="User:DjSamwise">DjSamwise</a> 18:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for saying that I am "skilled at defending" my edits. "Worthless" is a bit harsh, and a little too vague to counter or consider constructive criticism.

You were not talking about making <i>everybody</i> comfortable -- just mainstream Christians. In that case, I disagree completely; this attitude lacks the neutrality you just proposed. As for being neutral myself, I covered this above. I have maintained high levels of civility in the articles, but in these discussion pages, it is difficult to swallow my sarcasm when I feel the arguments are disingenuous or recycled endlessly. Amen. Amen. Amen. HALLELUJAH. I had mistakenly thought people would naturally understand this point. This omission could have been easily fixed and did not warrant wholesale deletions.

<dd>wow, thanks for the link to that classic work. That may be the one. The others, particularly the Creation Research one, it's "Biblical Literalism" doesn't fit the same definition. They apply the Literalism only to Genesis. They don't claim not to believe in parables or hyperboles. They only claim that Genesis is not a parable. That's different than not believing the Bilbe contains them. In the scholarly definition, they fit the inerrency camp.

<li><b>Comment</b> by the previous article's main contributer. I don't know if this group is voting on the article as it exists or on the one to which I had contributed.

This type of dubious behavior seems to be quite prevalent on Wikipedia. After my short break, I documented a disturbing trend. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed nearly 7000 words; 8.6% of them remain today. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed 157 Biblical references supporting my statements; 0.0% of them remain today. To various main articles within Wikipedia, I have contributed 35 non-Biblical references supporting my statements; 2 remain today. (I have listed these separately, because <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> believes the Bible is not an acceptable reference if used by me.) My supported concepts vanished along with their references -- sometimes replaced by completely opposite concepts without references. I had hoped my edits would benefit from either support or intelligent opposition. (I am always especially pleased when someone changes my perspective.) Instead, I have defended my edits from vandalism and attempts to usurp, obscure, or delete my concepts. This is nothing but a waste of time -- a waste of life. I will soon abandon Wikipedia to its devoted censors and vandals. Let them make what they will of it.

<dd>Question for ya, whats your opinion on lack of citeable definition? What if the only concensus on definition was for the same as inerrency.

<dd>From my understanding "Biblical literalism" referred to taking the Bible literally, a position supported by some Christian groups (i.e. <i><a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-literal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-literal.html" rel="nofollow">gotquestions.org</a></i>). However, as you point out, the article does not have a lucid definition to cite. The article (as well as its references) also seems to be vituperative of those who would support the position as well. If the only concensus on the definition was the same as inerrency, I would support the merge with <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a>, a much better written article.

<li><b>Weak Weak Keep</b>. It was proper to bring this to AfD, although a much better explanation for why it ought to be deleted is necessary, as the article itself asserts notability. However, the real notability might not be what is asserted in the article, but more to do with the controversy surrounding this person. That is not to say the article does not have serious problems. Most of the templates (i.e. POV, verification, etc.) on it are merited. Most of it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> - I don't think I can believe much is what is being said in the article. In fact, there's no reason why much of the unsourced or improper material has to remain during this discussion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, article does need more sourced information. However Mr. Null success and popularity as an author and radio show host is notable and the controversy surrounding some of his views and therapies is not by itself cause for deletion. Article should focus on radio show as starting point for providing sourced material without needlessly biasing the article towards Mr. Null's POV. That is, more sourced facts are needed to provide a context for the opposing POV's surrounding GN.</li>

Unlike the PSX version, there does seem to be a POV problem here in assigning "primary regions" to games -- for example, Final Fantasy X is down as a "North America" game, and it's not exactly clear on what basis that decision was made.<br />

I admit the page has some problems such as not having the developer or publisher, the whole "primary release" thing, which I think was addressed on the page.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. This is a regularly used term and its dissected in an NPOV manner. I think it can be added to and expanded. The mere fact that a term can be taken negatively (and is normally used in a derogatory fashion) is by no means a reason to delete an article (I don't think a recitation of some of the more infamous terms is necessary). The term is used on <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2144061" class="external text" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2144061" rel="nofollow">ESPN.com</a><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?page=bottom10048" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?page=bottom10048" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, <a href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/5846099" class="external text" title="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/5846099" rel="nofollow">CBS Sportsline</a>, <a href="http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/uwire/010606aag.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/uwire/010606aag.html" rel="nofollow">CSTV</a><a href="http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/uwire/011205aal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/uwire/011205aal.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>, and other sports websites. The fact that it's popular on a wide swatch of sports blogs and websites only further demonstrates it's use in regular college football parlance. I argue it is not a mere dictionary term because the usage of "Directional Michigan" is more complex than a mere one line definition --which itself would almost certainly be insulting. In addition, calling it "obscure" college football slang is flawed because (1) "obscurity" should have not have an absolute bearing on a something's worth, i.e. I know there would be no challenge to the inclusion of many archaic legal terms and concepts (of which only a handful of the lawyers on this website would be familiar) and (2) this reeks of "I haven't heard of it, thus it <i>must</i> be not worth having." --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 21:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

Western Michigan, East Carolina, Central Florida, etc. It is a common <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjorative.html" title="Perjorative">perjorative</a> to refer to them as "directional". For example, "we have an easy next week against Directional Carolina". ESPN.com, in their "Bottom Ten", frequently groups the various Directional Florida and Directional Michigan schools together, as well as F_U (Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University). So the term is commonly used ... but that said, it is NOT encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not a forum for joking about rival schools. Every school has pet names for their rival. We refer to UVA as DSU (Dopey Scissors University, a reference to their logo), France, UVA-Unwise (differentiating them from the UVA campus in Wise County), or UVAC (UVA Charlottesville).

<li><b>Comment</b>: How is this article intended as a "joke" about them? While I can agree this is not the place for something like the "University of Spoiled Children", I don't think this is quite the same: it describes a phenomena that covers three different schools that fall in a class. I don't believe any specific rival use that name for them (especially since they're rivals with each other). I learned the name several years ago in ESPN's Bottom 10. There's no particular ax to grind in its usage. As pointed out in the article, the Directional Michigans do pull upsets --like WSU's recent win over UVA or CSU's near-near upset of BC.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hey, I helped to create the website and here's what I have to say. it's not a joke; it's something that I love to do. Because of it's emerging position as an activity where I live, I decided to chronicle it on Wikipedia. It's not self-promotion; it's just an activity that's been part fo the community of kids for 5+ years. It also could be considered an offshoot of parkour, which is a very valid sport. Thanks.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I live in Wisconsin and play missions. Some Minneapolis kids made this page, albeit not very well, judging by the fact that people thought it was a joke, but it should be included on Wikipedia with a little editing.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Perhaps link it to a parkour site if necessary but the article itself is impressive and I see no reason that simply because something is obscure doesn't mean it has no value here; Wikipedia allows people to get knowledge in ways they never could before and if it out does Google regarding that then I say more power to it. As far as it being sourceless this IS the source. If these kids created it then they are THE authorities on the matter.</li>

<p>The starships listed here are not notable. The vast majority of them never even once appeared on screen, they were either mentioned in a single throw away line of dialogue or appeared for a couple of seconds on a display screen on the Enterprise bridge or somewhere similar. Wikipedia is not the place for pages devoted to extreme trivia. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 22:20, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages for the same reason:</p>
<pre>
   * <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Starfleet_ship_classes_6a27.html" title="List of Starfleet ship classes">List of Starfleet ship classes</a>
   * <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Ships_of_Starfleet_47d3.html" title="Lost Ships of Starfleet">Lost Ships of Starfleet</a>
</pre>
<p><b>Update</b> I think people are missing the point here. I didn't nominate because of the lack of sources. The problem is notability.</p>
<p>Take as an example the first starship mentioned on "List of Star Trek ships", the USS Adelphi. The only time the Adelphi appeared in Star Trek was in dialogue from the episode <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_Man_%28TNG_episode%29_bc72.html" title="Tin Man (TNG episode)">Tin man</a>. Specifically this dialogue... GEORDI: "I've heard something about Ghorusda. Weren't about forty people killed --" RIKER: "Forty-seven, including the captain of the Adelphi -- and two friends from my class at the Academy." And that is that. Never appeared on screen, never mentioned again in dialogue.</p>
<p>How about the second starship mentioned on "List of Star Trek ships", the USS Ahwahnee. It appeared briefly (seconds) as an item on a list of starships on a display screen in the episode <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption_%28TNG_episode%29_28dc.html" title="Redemption (TNG episode)">Redemption, Part 2</a> and appeared briefly (seconds again) as a wreck in the background of a battle ground in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_%28TNG_episode%29_310a.html" title="The Best of Both Worlds (TNG episode)">The Best of Both Worlds</a>. Never once mentioned in dialogue.</p>
<p>The various starships Enterprise are notable, the Reliant, Defiant and Excelsior, etc play significant parts in various movies/episodes. The ships listed on these pages do not. Even among Star Trek fans, ships like the Adelphi and Ahwahnee are extreme examples of trivia... is that what Wikipedia is for now?</p>
<p>To those who say we should have lists of ships, we have articles on the notable ones (<a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Defiant_f372.html" title="USS Defiant">USS Defiant</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Reliant_%28Star_Trek%29_7374.html" title="USS Reliant (Star Trek)">USS Reliant (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Excelsior_%28Star_Trek%29_b3b8.html" title="USS Excelsior (Star Trek)">USS Excelsior (Star Trek)</a>, etc) and categories to collect them for easy reference <a href="../../../f/e/d/Category%7EFederation_Starships_69cc.html" title="Category:Federation Starships">Category:Federation Starships</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 14:53, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>(After edit conflict)<b>Strong Delete</b>. Most of this info that is 'right' must have been copvio'd out of the Star Trek encyclopaedia, and the overwhelming majority is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">non-verifiable</a> - e.g., the 'USS Interceptor' allegedly from <a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">FC</a>. Never mentioned in dialogue, no Nebula class ships seen close enough to make out a name, far less an NCC. Much as I'd love to burn this article and its ilk, delete is the best we can do.

Most of what is in the articles needs to be deleted, but the Lists themselves are probably valid. However, if kept, the list of ship classes should list the ship classes, not the ships by class, and lost ships of Starfleet would only serve redundant to Ships of Starfleet (put an 'x' or something by the destroyed ones in the Ships list and then Lost ships is totally useless). <b>Keep</b> List of Starfleet Ships and List of Starfleet ship classes, <b>delete</b> Lost Ships of Starfleet. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 10:14, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've tried to improve some of the Star Trek articles on Wikipedia. This started out as one article that I was never happy with. Now, instead of improving, the article has grown even worse and spawned... Please look at the edit histories of these articles, there is a constant effort needed to keep out fan cruft. People adding the starships they have invented for their own fan clubs and fan fiction... The articles are a mess and unless someone is going to dedicate a large portion of their time to tidying and maintaining them they aren't going to improve. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 14:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - While they may not be needed for the vast majority of casual reads of wikipedia, I know from my own Trek gutter days [who am I kiddin'; I'm still in those 'gutter days'] that these lists do interest a great deal of people. In the end, as long as the qualification for making the list (onscreen text, mention or appearance) is consistent for all listed ships, then it holds some value for some citizens of Wikipedia; afterall, its a list of all known ships in Starfleet, and how do you cut ships that weren't used as characters and achieve that goal? Note: I have not been a contributer to the list, did not know it existed until exploring today's Tip of the Day (topic lists) nor was I led here as a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a>, but I have definitely appreciated having this list when compiled elsewhere. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyteWolfer_61e5.html" title="User:LeyteWolfer">LeyteWolfer</a> 03:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Ensure data retention then delete</b>. The page for most of the classes of Federation ship includes a list of the known ships of that class, along with references to the episodes in which they were mentioned. It would seem to me to be a good compromise that we ensure that the current data is replicated on the "ship class" pages, then the list of classes removed and replaced with a Category. This would be exactly as easy/difficult to navigate as now for a fan interested in this as a resource, but would remove the duplicate data, and conform more to Wikipedia standards.

<ul>
<li>This article is less than a stub. It is <b>25 words</b> long. The article is too insignificant to be eligible for an entry as an article in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>It is mentioned that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrasekhar_Tiwari_e9fd.html" title="Chandrasekhar Tiwari">Chandrasekhar Tiwari</a> alias <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrasekhar_Azad_99e4.html" title="Chandrasekhar Azad">Chandrasekhar Azad</a> (Indian Freedom Fighter) was born in this village. Wikipedia article of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrasekhar_Azad_99e4.html" title="Chandrasekhar Azad">Chandrasekhar Azad</a> (and history, for that matter) says he was born in <a href="../../../j/h/a/Jhansi.html" title="Jhansi">Bhawra</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/a/Jhabua.html" title="Jhabua">Jhabua, M.P.</a>). Thus this article is in absolute contradiction with one of the articles in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>There is practically no information, no sources and no facts about the place other than its name. One cannot be sure if even that is correct.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, my rationale for the weak keep was based on the fact that the place exists and has a name (TruthbringerToronto backs this up). The dispute over whether a famous person was born there is immaterial, since a place is not only notable as a result of a famous person being born there. The location of the gentleman's birth would only be relevant if there were no indication that this village exists. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 00:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Real place, some notability claimed. Length is no justification for deletion - I've seen articles less than half this size which should be kept.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Sorry, the evidence of Badarka being a real place is still unproved. Even more disturbing is the incorrect 'claim to fame'. I don't think a 25 word article on a place whose existence is unknown/unproven should get a place in Wikipedia. I will be more than happy indeed if this Article can be expanded and some evidence included. Right now it is doing nothing but providing misinformation.--<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_2898.html" title="User:Vikas Kumar Ojha"><b>Vikas Kumar Ojha</b></a> <sub><a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikas_Kumar_Ojha_776f.html" title="User talk:Vikas Kumar Ojha"><i>Talk to me!</i></a></sub> 07:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Wikipedia always keeps any location stub or article <i>pending</i> verifiability. Further, the burden of establishing verifiability is on the stub creator.

<p>A list that is nearly impossible to verify, so this list can be classified as original research. It seems as if just because someone was known to smoke and had lung cancer doesn't necessarily mean it was totally tobacco-related. What about genetics and simply being of old age? And most of these celebs lived long lifes, most at the average life expectancy or even extended. It's a bunch of <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_science.html" title="Junk science">junk science</a> and violates the principles of WP having no original research and a neutral point of view. I don't want to rant too much, but this list is not suitable for WP and doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 23:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The articles is not cited and most of the sources are from POV personal websites. Some of these people had other health problems such as being overweight or old.

<li><b>Delete</b> While I have no doubt that cigarettes kill a lot of folks, this page is completely unsourced. Even then, as Giant onehead noted, it's almost impossible to say with 100% certainty that someone's lung cancer was caused by smoking (though it's probably 90% or more likely). It may be appropriate to make a category for this, but certainly not a list page. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 23:32, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
