<li>Sorry if I gave the wrong impression. The CoI is that you started the article about yourself, not that you commented on the Ben Pfeiffer article. Hope that clears it up. WP requires neutrality in content and the fact that you started a biographical article about yourself makes it nearly impossible for other editors to seperate the two. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 20:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Barry Schwartz is by far one of the most recognized names in the SEO Industry. Being an SEO, if I were asked who should one talk to about anything that is going on in the SEO industry? I would point to Danny Sullivan and then immediately to Barry Schwartz.

<li><b>Keep</b> Barry Schwartz is a famous name in the industry, a speaker at conferences such as SES, and actively quoted in outside sources.

<dd>Some of those are good. Just remember that <b>you</b> have to be the focus of the article for it to count as a source about you. The news.com article mentions you briefly as a quote (which wouldn't really count). You're referred to as "a commentator" in the Publish.com article (which means it DEFINATELY doesn't count). The Web Pro News articles could probably be used as a source, and the Clickz.com article might work too (I suggest you check out WP:SOURCE for more about properly sourcing an article). The Ziff Davis news wouldn't work as it's focus is on the AdWords program, and neither would the E-consultancy.com article. I hope that helps clarify things. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 23:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and <s>rewrite, completely</s> continue editing. Barry is noteworthy, but I regret that he started the article before other editors had a chance to write one. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJehochman_26e5.html" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/e/h/User_talk%7EJehochman_9100.html" title="User talk:Jehochman">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jehochman_1c53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jehochman">Contrib</a></sub>) 03:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've done a lot of editing, but the article is still a mess. The list of references was terrible. Many didn't even mention the subject and some had just a short quotation of the subject, which isn't useful. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJehochman_26e5.html" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/e/h/User_talk%7EJehochman_9100.html" title="User talk:Jehochman">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jehochman_1c53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jehochman">Contrib</a></sub>) 04:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Can I call it a night and fix up the article tomorrow?" -- Answer: Barry, you don't own this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> There's nothing wrong with him starting an article about himself, even though some consider this a bad habit. Barry is one of the more important people in the SEO world and deserve his page here. The article could use some work perhaps, but I think it should be kept. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdevalk_c89b.html" title="User:Jdevalk">Jdevalk</a> 10:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW, for those not involved in the field of Search Engine Optimization and Search Engine Marketing, it might be harder to distinguish if Barry is notable. As an SEO I can tell you that he IS notable, having been one of the primary editors of Search Engine Watch, and now Search Engine Land, the leading news sites on Search Marketing. Lots and lots and lots of SEO's will confirm for you that his doings are indeed a "widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdevalk_c89b.html" title="User:Jdevalk">Jdevalk</a> 16:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but the "word" of everyone in the field isn't what is required to meet the WP:BIO guidelines for notability. Everyone in the world of widgets may know my uncle as the best widget seller this side of the Atlantic, but that doesn't mean he qualifies for an article <i>de facto</i>. We need reliable sourcing and independent assertion of notability in order to satisfy the existence of the article. And there is something wrong with starting an article about yourself, please read <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> full well, that doesn't force me to agree with it though, but that's another point of discussion. In earlier versions of this article Barry put some references that were good, I think, but removed in the process. However, if you look at what's there now, you will see that those are reliable sources. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has very good guidelines, and MY opinion is that this page should be kept because of those, in reference of the following quote: <i>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</i> My $0.02. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdevalk_c89b.html" title="User:Jdevalk">Jdevalk</a> 19:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Barry is a noteworthy individual in the field of SEO.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the domain expert issue.

<li><b>Keep</b> when even those wanting to delete say the person is notable but not quite notable enough, they are not following the spirit of the guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b>: When the major contributor is the subject of the article and then he further solicits help through his personal blog (see above) and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" class="external text" title="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" rel="nofollow">a second blog</a> solicits help for SEO AfDs, calling me (as the AfD submitter) a vandal...well, "everyone says" acts more as a vote and not a discussion which is not the point of AfD. Notability is not subjective and the article (as acknowledged by other editors above) was poorly written and likely did not meet the criteria when I submitted it for AfD. The intent is to have the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiabililty</a> necessary in the form of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> proof of notability and not to poll the audience to see enough colleagues will vouch for the subject's notability or not. This article has been improved and the closing administrator may see that WP:BIO has finally been met. For an example, it would be useless to have the criteria if I could create an article about myself and then ask fellow bioinformaticists who read my blog to come and say "Aw, come on, he's notable...let it go!" and satisfy the guidelines in doing so. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 07:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I had no influence on the "second blog" and I never solicited votes, I just informed people I made a wiki entry for myself. I later found out that was frowned on.

<li>I did not intend to suggest that you had influence on the other blog. I was only intending to point out that because we can't always control what people will do outside of wikipedia, we need to follow the guidelines and policies that are put in place to establish neutrality and notability for each article on its own. Also, we must do so in discussion of whether the article fits policy and guidelines and not as votes of confidence for the subject matter for conditions such as notability. Argue to the facts of the article and whether they meet specific criteria, not to emotion or (not-so-)common sense and subjectivities. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 11:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
