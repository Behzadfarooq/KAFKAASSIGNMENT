<li><b>Delete</b>. But I have to sympathize with the argument that there is lots of irrelevant stuff on Wikipedia, so why pick on &lt;fill in the blank&gt;?

<li>I don't believe a "lot" of irrelevant stuff would have made it past four times. Wikipedian editors aren't that gullible and it's up to voters to ensure that the irrelevant articles dont hang around very long. Because only a small percentage of editors actually vote, it becomes problematic when an article has some emotional/political attachment and someone voting sees that it is up for VfD. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 00:52, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. His widow is notable in her own right, but not his father. In practice the only case where close relatives become notable enough to warrant articles of their own merely by existing are children and wives of the President of the United States, but only because they are inevitably turned into minor celebrities in their own right by the media, like Chelsea Clinton or the Bush twins. Other relatives of the President only become notable if they get in trouble like Billy Carter or Roger Clinton. And in the case of anyone other than the US president there is no coattail effect at all. Note Bill Clinton's mother is not in Wikipedia, why should MLK's father be? He was a pastor and a decent man, but that's not enough. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 14:03, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>He's no more notable or famous than Bill Clinton's mother. A better case could be made for the father of Venus and Serena Williams, because he actually accomplished something notable in his own right by coaching his daughters his own unique and unorthodox way... and he's not in Wikipedia.

<li>A very well written article, but I suspect it never would have been written if not for the stories and rumors that Hitler's real name was Schickelgruber, that he might have Jewish ancestry, and the whole circumstance of him being Austrian by nationality rather than German. Rather than entitle an article as "Hitler's family origins" or whatnot, it's more convenient to create an article about his father and put it there. Well, if an article about MLK Sr. ever reaches that level I suppose its existence might be justified in a way, although it's not a promising start at all. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 18:39, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Agree with <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a>. Also Wikipedia is not genealogy or a memorial. Unless Martin Luther King, Sr has done something notable in his own right - being a church pastor and author of one book published by a church doesnt fall into that category. What next? A list of every church pastor and authors of church publications on the grounds that they are "notable", doesn't augur well for the future of this encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Megan1967, as I wrote, his autobiography was published not by a church, but by a major commercial publisher (William Morrow &amp; Co.) I noted specifically that the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Brethren_3462.html" title="Church of the Brethren">Church of the Brethren</a> (through Brethren Press) published the book half <i>about</i> Rev. King Sr. (and his son) because the Church of the Brethren is so many worlds apart from Rev. King Sr.'s African-American church - it's predominantly a bunch of German emigres!

<li><b>Very strong keep.</b> Curps is not correct. "Daddy King" was indeed notable in his own right. Besides being a significant preacher he was a social activist and a patron of Morehouse, a traditionally black college of high significance. I think that a vote for MLK Jr's father would be in order even if this were not the not the case, actually, for the same reasons as Starblind and Everyking, above. No, there's not much at this entry at present, but just because Wikipedia is woefully deficient in African American subject matter at present is not a good enough reason to delete.

<p>Delete, crudcruft. (OK, OK, I just wanted to a chance to say "crudcruft," the real reason is "dicdef.") Rather schizophrenically, I am nominating this for deletion just after editing it for language, and to improve the accuracy of the first definition. However, having done that, what I now have is three meanings for "creeping crud." Well, the first meaning I know is correct, and is vouched for by Wentworth and Flexner's slang dictionary.

<li>I'm not particularly attached to the notion of there being a "Two Finger Test" article <i>per se</i>. The only real expansion potential that I see for this article is the inclusion of yet further tests that people have that involve the use of two fingers in some way. I haven't found one that is individually <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">notable</a>.

<li>At Dpb's request: a two finger test must be unreliable due to the size difference in fingers. A doctor with <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acromegaly.html" title="Acromegaly">acromegaly</a> would find the woman a virin, while his colleage with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marfan_syndrome.html" title="Marfan syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a> would find the opposite.

<li>Back in the early 1990's I saw a woman (Kimberly Bergalis) who testified in a Florida Court of Law that she was still a Virgin and they proved to the Judge that she was not. I asked my Surgeon who was a Board Certified Urologist how they could tell!<br />
He told me of this TFT and said that a woman who has repeated Sexual Intercourse will become "loose" and stay that way.<br />
I asked my Sister an Brother In Law who are physicians and they said yes it is true! Are there any MD's here in Wikipedia?<br />

<li>No problem, then. Under "references," or on Talk:Two Finger Test, give the names and professional contact information of the doctors who told you this, so the information can be verified. "Dr. so-and-so, (year), thus-and-such clinic, city, state, personal communication." I'll call when I get a chance this week and if I can verify the information I'll change my vote to "keep." One of them can probably give me a relevant citation to whatever code specifies that this is the legal definition (in whatever state this applies to).</li>

<li>The story about Kimberly Bergalis is false, in any case. She was, as per my memory, but more importantly, as per the <i>Washington Times</i> (09/17/91), p. F2, a "nonhemophiliac virgin" who contracted AIDS from her Florida dentist Stewart Acer. It was the first case of such transmission, and her virginity was certainly not "disproved", no matter what one's brother-in-law says. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:30, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Possibly, but do you also think that if someone bothers to write an article about <i>anything</i> it must be notable? (That too makes sense in a certain way.)

<ul>
<li>1. AFAIK, you must get a license from local authority to start broadcasting, so this makes radio stations special. Student radio stations are more special because they don't get paid for it. 2. I wrote an article on semi-notable radio station myself and I don't want it deleted. 3. I vote keep on almost everything that may have a remote chance to be interesting to someone. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 17:43, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's bad reasoning. If someone writes an article about a broadcasting station, or a small pop group or band, it's sometimes the case that it is one of the persons involved themselves writing it, with the intention of getting it listed on Wikipedia and its mirrors, and thereby <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebomb.html" title="Googlebomb">increasing its Google page rank</a> and the attention of its Google-cruising audience. Wikipedia is a convenient means for people to get around the fact that Google charges a fee for the placement of advertisements. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:17, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)

<li>Actual radio stations, IME, are notable. For instance, being a <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_radio.html" title="College radio">college radio</a> veteran myself, I'm personally <b>very</b> interested to know more about stations outside of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, which is exactly where this station fits in the grand scheme of things. If this isn't notable, I don't see how <i>any</i> university radio station could ever qualify. To me, it's a keeper. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree completely. To me, it's very easy to imagine that some university radio stations are significant and others aren't. Indeed, I've read about some that I'd certainly say are significant. This one too <i>may</i> be significant, but I haven't seen any reasoning for this, other than that it was the first of a certain kind of radio station in Britain. For one thing, I'd like to know if it has any programs to which a moderate number of students <i>listen</i>. I spent some time at a British university recently -- I'll kindly forgo naming it, but it wasn't Hull -- and after some time was surprised to see an ad for the campus radio station. The people I asked seemed hardly aware that it existed. It seemed to be a low-budget imitation of commercial pop music radio, minus the commercials -- a respectable enough hobby for a few who were involved in making it, but of little significance to anyone else. (People had regular radio, web radio, CDs, etc., playing in the background.) Maybe Jam 1575 is entirely different. I'd be happy to hear about the differences, and would consider changing my vote. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:33, 2005 Jan 16 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, not all radio stations are notable. There are many stations that get licences and most are not notable. This is a university radio station - its not notable enough to have its own article. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:52, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>The Thousand Yahren War</b> (aka <i>The Thousand Year War</i> and <i>The Great Cylon Conflict</i>) was a fictitious intergalactic war set before the events in the original <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_film.html" title="1978 in film">1978</a> movie <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_a415.html" title="Battlestar Galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>.</dd>

<p>It appears to be specific to this movie (actually a TV movie, scoring 5.8 out of 10 at IMDb, and of which the representative "user comment" starts "Not as bad as its reputation").

<li><b>Keep</b>. Since Wikipedia allows a large amount of articles related to Star Trek (I should know) as well as Doctor Who and other franchises, I think this is worthwhile keeping as a major component of BSG.

<li>Ah the usual tactics of a Linux zealot. Claims I am banned user (I never heard of this Willy on Wheels idiot), had to get a new IP address because he banned me. This guy is a Linux zealot and has repeately reverted attempts at Wikipecia documenting the truth about Linux and calls the documenters trolls. Troll is a term used by Linux zealots to discredit their opponents. If this article gets deleted it will be proof that Wikipedia is a fapping ground for Linux zealots and Slashdot nerds. I hope that some normal users (what Linux users call trolls) have the sense to see that this "vote" is a fraud and seak action against linux zealots who deliberatley warp the truth about their operating system!

<li><b>Keep</b>, an art movement with a presence in at least three different countries sounds notable to me.<a href="../../../b/j/o/User%7EBjones_50e8.html" title="User:Bjones">Bjones</a> 18:04, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Google is not the final arbiter, and art has to have different criteria to pop stars. The crux is - will people wish to find out about this movement and access Wiki to do so. They have certainly been covered by the Irish press and elsewhere, so have a public presence, which will generate further enquiry. It doesn't matter how old they are - it matters how much interest there is in them. Media coverage is also a valid criterion. I am not affiliated to Defastenism, but have found it of sufficiently note to research and contribute to the article. P.S. ""They're the most vital thing that's happened in contemporary art in Dublin in a while." - The Dubliner, May 2005. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:22, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
