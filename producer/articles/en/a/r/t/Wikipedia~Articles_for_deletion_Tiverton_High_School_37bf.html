<p>IP-removed Prod. Beyond the bare fact of existence and the fact that a student died of meningitis, there's a lack of notability (tragically, a lot of students die of meningitis worldwide). There's also a dearth of independent sources available via Google <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - although personally I'd love to see the lot of them deleted, there seems to be a consensus that high schools are notable simply by existing. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 21:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an important school in its community, a specialist Visual Arts College and with some notable features. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I might have missed the significance of the computing thing in the material you've added (being very much not a computer person, it's possible), but the article itself seems to be more of an off-hand "Oh and by the way, this place also does its computing in this way" mention. The award looks more promising, but I can't get a good handle on precisely what significance it has. As far as it being a specialist school in a particular field, certainly in Australia that argument wouldn't seem to wash - is there an added level of importance in the UK in declaring onself a specialist in X or Y area? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good questions. In the UK micro-computing started with <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Micro_b28d.html" title="BBC Micro">BBC Micros</a> that developed into <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_OS_7a2b.html" title="RISC OS">RISC OS</a> and all schools had BBCs (or its <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acorn_Computers_090e.html" title="Acorn Computers">Acorn</a> successor). Always more reliable than Windoze (the windows interface is hard-wired into the operating system rather than being soft loaded as with Windoze) it had its fervent advocates. However, the mighty marketing muscle of Mr Gates squashed RISC OS and progressively schools switched across. Any school that still uses RISC OS machines (that are still being sold and developed) in a major way (and there are hardly any now) is a notable remnant of the past. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">Specialist schools</a> are an innovation whereby schools get extra funding if they show notability in a given area. To be fair, a good many secondary (high) schools now have this status but it still shows that they have significantly achieved in the given area. HTH. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 23:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as the specialist schools point goes, that's very useful to know. Here, the only system (AFAIK) is that a school needs to say "we're pretty good at X area" and have some classes in it. Admittedly, schools which do this for drama (for example) graduate a lot of people who end up working in drama, but there's more than a whiff of sel-fulfilling prophecy about the whole thing. Given that "a good many secondary schools now have this status", is it in fact viable evidence of notability? Where the computers are concerned, I'm seeing your point, but I'm not sure that that means the <i>school</i> in question gets its own article - why not just a mention in the article on the thing itself? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you follow the link <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">specialist school</a> you can read about them but being a specialist school is not, in itself, enough for notability. The way I look at things is this - we are not short of server space so why would we want to delete a high school article? Only if there is nothing interesting to say. Here, collectively, there is enough encyclopaedic content to make an article, ergo Keep. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 01:07, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, having a student of the school dying and using outdated computer equipment does not make a school notable. <i>all high schools are notable</i> is an opinion of some voters, but definitely not policy.

<li><b>Comment</b> - nothing outdated about <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_OS_7a2b.html" title="RISC OS">RISC OS</a>; simply that it is unfashionable. The notability criteria are "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject." and as the article now attests the school meets this taking the article <i>as a whole</i>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 04:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
