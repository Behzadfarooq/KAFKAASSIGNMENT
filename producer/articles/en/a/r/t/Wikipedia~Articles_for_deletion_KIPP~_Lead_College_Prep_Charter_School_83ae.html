<p>Articles <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Wilson_4afa.html" title="Brad Wilson">Brad Wilson</a> and BradsDeals have just been nominated for deletion. The largest part of this school article was about Brad Wilson. Following the deletions, the article has been edited to remove him. However, I have serious doubts that this school actually exists for these reasons: (1) The article itself has practically no information, not what one would expect from such a high octane institution. (2) The school's own website has clearly not been updated for many months (i.e. since before it was supposed to have opened last July). (3) The school's calendar on the website is empty. (4) The press article cited actually links to the school's website where it is presented as a PDF file, and (5) the articel itself only mentions TWO potential students. (6) And that article itself is from March 2006. Perhaps there is someone who has some local knowledge who could help with this. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 16:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> That Kipp is a "major national manager of nearly fifty charter schools" is an argument for having an article about Kipp not an article about this specific school. As for the "relevant, non-trivial independent reporting" do you have any that isn't minor puff pieces of the sort one always gets at schools and is not associated with Ball State? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:40, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. Let's worry about having a good KIPP article before we worry about an article for the eighteenth charter school in Indiana. <b>Delete</b> <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 18:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some interesting discussion points, but to go back to my original nomination - I simply want someone to verify that the school actually EXISTS. Its website suggests not, based on currency. Nowhere else that I have looked says that it is open (the KIPP directory merely says new in 2006, not that it opened). The quality of the KIPP programme is irrelevant (as a teacher, I personally have my doubts). I suspect this school was planned but never opened. SO again I ask, in hope, is there anyone in the area who can verify this one way or the other; if not <b>Delete</b> as non-existent. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 22:42, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I added links from Ball State University and the Indiana Department of Education that appear to confirm that the school exists. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Proving that the school exists or not would require original research, probably (and most reliably) a phone call to the Office of Charter Schools of Ball State University at 765-285-1336 or to the Indiana Department of Education. I can argue that, based on the evidence in the article, and based on the fact that I haven't seen any evidence that the school closed down or failed to open, it is more likely than not that the school exists. The school's web site being out-of-date is most likely just another case of "brochureware", where the site is created by a designer, uploaded to a hosting provider, and then neglected, in part because the organization that commissioned the site doesn't have access to the editing software or doesn't know how to use it. But <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a>'s suspicions could be correct. I would encourage someone to make a phone call or a visit to answer the question, and then the evidence can be reinterpreted in the light of the results of the phone call or visit. I think there are enough people who dislike charter schools and Ball State University's involvement with them that a crash-and-burn of any of Gary, Indiana's charter schools would be widely reported. That having been said, I think that a charter school that closes down because of mismanagement, fraud or politics ought to be written about so as to provide a better understanding of what can go wrong with charter schools in general. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 03:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
