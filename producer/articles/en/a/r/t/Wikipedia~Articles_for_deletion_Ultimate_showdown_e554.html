<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The author conducts an excellent 'defence' however, which almost persuaded me by itself. However, the consensus is clearly against him, presumably because this particular flash has yet to entrench itself in the internet psyche yet. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><del><b>Neutral</b></del>: Not long enough to warrant a dedicated article. If it were longer, and the Flash had been around longer, maybe it would warrante something...but then again, the random hunk of bad animation that is The Demented Cartoon Movie has its own article...why that, and not this? What's the difference?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep -- I'm the original author of the article and am in no way affiliated with the flash's creators.</b> , I made it as a genuine effort and am in no way associated with the people who made the flash. It has skyrocketed to the top of newgrounds, is being spread around, and has been hailed as one of the best flashes ever. It has probably over 30 references to American culture (if you watch the flash this will be very obvious). I was surprised that nobody had made an article for it already, so thought I'd start one. I obviously did not make it long enough or detailed enough. I _WANTED_ to mark it as a stub when I finished, but had not figured out how yet (I'm new). Just now, I had came back to see if others had added to it, and found this instead. I really do categorize this as in the same category as "all your base" and the star warz gangster rap as well as several other flashes that are so popular as to merit their own page. Are we to say that the Desperate Housewives TV show or the Colbert Report doesn't merit an entry just because it's still on? No. I looked at the deletion policies, and as far as I can tell, this should be marked as a stub and expanded. I'd really like to see it expanded and to see someone take the time to actually mark down all the references that are in it (American culture references). Everything from the back to the future car, to the terminator, to Bill &amp; Ted, to the Power Rangers, and Chuck Norris and Indiana Jones. I'm a chemistry PhD student, and I really don't have time for it - or rather, I don't have time for everything that I want to do. If you guys want to delete it then fine, I obviously can't do anything about it. But I think it's the wrong decision. I'm not sure if how I'm posting my "defense" here is correct or not. I couldn't see a vote box, but I guess editing this page is the right thing to do. And for the record, this is not one of my favorite flashes on newgrounds, it's not even in my top 10. But it's the only one that I thought merited its own article. Cynical Smirk refers to it as "Check out this Flash cartoon with more pop culture references than you can shake a stick at." I think it ought to have a proper article with links to all the pop culture references - including <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_on_a_plane.html" title="Snakes on a plane">snakes on a plane</a> which I hadn't even heard of and a friend explained it to me - because it's a reference from a movie that's not even out yet! And yet lots of people noticed that and commented on it. At any rate, you get the idea. I believe this deserves its own entry, it's not some random flash in my books. It's ranked as #1 in Newgrounds, and has had over 500,000 views even though it's only been out for 2 weeks. People have even suggested giving it its own award. I feel like I'm facing some sort of stupid culture clash, the "conservative right versus the radical left." Only this time it's a bias just because the link is from newgrounds. Or at least that's what it _looks_ like from my end. I believe the articles' only crime is not being marked as a stub. Which isn't the article's fault. It's mine, and yours. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshi_Starshade_743d.html" title="User:Ashi Starshade">Ashi_Starshade</a>. Note: just because something's new doesn't mean it should not have an article. And I also want to note that I didn't just sign up for wikipedia to make this. I've made perhaps 5 other edits before this (science and even literature related), some from before we had to create logins.</li>

<li><b>Keep pending end of growth (or merge)</b> - I've come across 3 or 4 mentions to this meme already across unrelated areas of the Internet (even one obscure mention on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopets.html" title="Neopets">Neopets</a> for goodness sakes, <a href="http://www.neopets.com/newfeatures.phtml?arr=2006-01-02" class="external text" title="http://www.neopets.com/newfeatures.phtml?arr=2006-01-02" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I think Google isn't quite keeping up, because it's growing very rapidly (see above: 583 to 14,000+ in four days). So let's just wait until it stops growing; if the growth proves to stop early, delete it at that time. --<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88<font color="#FF9966">^</font></a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF6633">-</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88"><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 19:58, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
