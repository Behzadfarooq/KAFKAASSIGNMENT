<li>Keep. Wikipedia would be a weak tool indeed if pages like this one on Shelley Powers weren't included. Vanity has nothing to do with it

<li><b>Keep.</b> It's awfully late at this point to start complaining about short biographical articles on popular bloggers and technologists.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Shelley's a well-known technologist and blogger who has written <i>Practical RDF</i> for O'Reilly along with several other computer books. She also, if I'm not mistaken, belongs to the group that created RSS 1.0. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcade_aa62.html" title="User:Rcade">Rcade</a> 21:34, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. She's a published author who has sold enough books, and that's sufficient per the guidelines, as Seth pointed out above. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">DoriSmith</a> 22:48, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - User Doug Pardee has less than 50 edits, but an edit history since 2003! (That must be a record for fewest edits per month for a still active account!) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 14:19, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states authors with sales of 5,000 merit inclusion. She has an Amazon rank of ~120,000. IMHO, all <a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a> authors deserve a Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 04:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I took the liberty of commenting on possible <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a> on this AFD and IMHO they are all real users: or someone is patiently taking months to build up sockpuppet accounts. I don't know who Shelley Powers is but she obviously influences "lurkers" on Wikipedia. Shelley, well done! <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 14:19, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Thank you, Samw. I'd like to say it's taken years of training to be able to do this, but in actuality, I've had this ability from birth.<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelleyp_2bd1.html" title="User:Shelleyp">Shelleyp</a> 15:24, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Samw: What you're seeing is a side effect of Shelley's large online readership and the fact that her entry is part of an ongoing dialogue about whether female technologists like her are adequately represented on Wikipedia. As one of the only voters you didn't consider a possible sockpuppet, I can attest that the votes here appear to be completely legit. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcade_aa62.html" title="User:Rcade">Rcade</a> 16:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Rcade, thanks for the explanation. Shelley, I hope you stay on Wikipedia and contribute your manifest writing talent. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 02:07, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. She is a well-known technology author, an articulate advocate for women's presence and visibility in technological fields, and a popular weblogger.

Akma
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - User Akma has had 6 edits, but an edit history since June 2005.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being a published author is enough, and all those other things only help her case. Paul Morriss
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - User Paul Morriss only has 1 edit, this AFD. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 14:19, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>; being called a "meat puppet" is probably not a pleasant first experience with editing wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I really don't believe that authoring a how-to technology book makes one a notable author. We might as well have articles for writers of toaster manuals. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 18:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - notability is debatable, but the visit from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">Meatpuppet Army</a> is making me hesitant to support the retention of the article. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 19:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> provides criteria for (among other things) published authors that clearly cover Shelley Powers' biographical article.
