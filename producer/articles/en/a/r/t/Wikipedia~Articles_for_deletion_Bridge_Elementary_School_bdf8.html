<li>So... if I start Wikipedia:Wikiproject Hairs on Haeleth's Head and create a big template with a stub for every hair on my head, will you support me in the inevitable deletion debates, please? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 20:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you think the hairs on your head have influenced enough lives that anyone would ever bother looking up the topic on Wikipedia, go ahead and try. Personally, I think schools typically have had students in the past and/or present, and it isn't too farfetched to think that any of those people might look up a school. Your example with a wikiproject on the hairs on your head is simply a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, and as such, doesn't stand to compare well against any well-established project. --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stephane Charette</a> 21:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is an inference on your part Nico... not explicitly stated in <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>. "Non-notable school" is just as valid a reason to nominate for AfD or opine delete as "clearly noteworthy subject" is for opining keep.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:01, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: What I said in reference to the nomination today by <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewspaper98_e465.html" title="User:Newspaper98">Newspaper98</a> applies to the articles nominated by <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix_Hacker_d488.html" title="User:Phoenix Hacker">Phoenix Hacker</a> as well. For less controversial topics, I have no problem with "non notable" as shorthand for why an article is being nominated for deletion. However, given the sharp divide on whether or not school articles are inherently encyclopedic and by what standards we determine whether a school article is encyclopedic, I would hope to see a much more substantive reason for the nomination of a school than simply "non notable". Given the lack of a firm policy on schools, it would be helpful to know why the nominator thinks the school is non-notable. I do believe that the nominations by Phoenix Hacker were made in <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">good faith</a>; however, all these nominations without a more detailed explanation of why they are being nominated verges on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. This editor is helping no one by the large number of nominations (s)/he has posted for AfDs on schools with the only reason being "nn" and the large number of {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}s (s)/he has placed on other school articles. I don't care if someone thinks keep or delete. It just seems that it would serve everyone better if the nomination set forth some reasoning for what should be expected to attract a lot of strong opinions. A more substantive reason for nomination would be particularly helpful for those editors who judge each school article on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article constitutes a directory entry. (It has grown a little during the discussion, but not enough to make it useful content. When nominated, the content was "Bridge Elementary School is a school in Richmond, British Columbia." plus the template for Richmond, British Columbia. All that has been added is directory information.) Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy, directory entries are explicitly forbidden; see subsection "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", item 7 "Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guide or a resource for conducting business.". Additionally, one of the expectations that Wikipedia has of every wikipedia project is that the project help build an encyclopedia, which means helping decide where to draw the boundary line between topics to cover and topics to exclude. Despite the assertion above that the article passes the <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> test, I see no test at that project; the word test doesn't appear on the page and I see nothing else on the page or its current talk page that amounts to a test of material worthy of inclusion. As to why Phoenix Hacker made so many of these nominations, a single user was mass creating these entries with nothing more than a single line of text. Mass creation of useless articles leads to multiple deletion discussions. As explained in the intro to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, it is the opinion of "<i>some [and by evidence at AFD, a large number of] editors that this is what is meant by</i> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information <i>(which is a formal policy). Many editors also believe that it is fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies).</i>" <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 04:05, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information and not a directory of schools.
