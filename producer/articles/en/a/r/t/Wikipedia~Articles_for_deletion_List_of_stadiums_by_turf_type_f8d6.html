<p>No one seems to agree on what exactly should be done with what was originally <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_FieldTurf_installations_a3eb.html" title="List of FieldTurf installations">List of FieldTurf installations</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_FieldTurf_installations_%282nd_nomination%29_8ec1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of FieldTurf installations (2nd nomination)">This AfD</a> in December reached the consensus to categorize. A few days later, after such was done, that category was <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_December_27_32dd.html#Category:FieldTurf_installations" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 27">listed at CfD</a>, which reached the consensus to listify. We ultimately ended up with two conflicting opinions from the discussions, and two articles listing FieldTurf installations (one which mimics the appearance of a category, created after the consensus on CfD; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_FieldTurf_installations_a3eb.html" title="List of FieldTurf installations">the other</a> which was the original, un-redirected after the CfD). I'm nominating these together. Hopefully we can decide whether to keep or delete this once and for all. I register no vote as yet. --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 08:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep Both</b> Okay here is my thoughts. First I run the <a href="http://www.mihsfbstadium.com" class="external text" title="http://www.mihsfbstadium.com" rel="nofollow">Michigan High School Stadium Site</a> as such I have a lot of original research available. Next I have links to a lot of the turf companies in the country. I do have an opinion that not all turf is the same, each company makes slightly diffrent turf. Some wear faster than others along with the way they are placed and what they use. My thought process is that we could provide a page for each 20+ turf companies that lists all of thier installations. Next we provide a link from the list of stadiums by turf to the individual company turf installation pages. The listing on the list of stadiums by turf should only be colleges and professional stadiums. Right now I would sign up to do this project but I am trying to finish out the Michigan Freeways and Highways. Once that is fleshed out I can then concentrate on this if everybody here is willing to end this debate. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihsfbstadium_80f5.html" title="User:Mihsfbstadium">Mihsfbstadium</a> 14:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete both</b>. If this material is really encyclopedic, as some have tried to point out, the material can be merged into the parent article for the material. If kept, are we also saying it is OK to have lists of stadiums by type of real grass? Or lists of stadiums by clay type? How about lists of stadiums by rodeo dirt composition? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>uhm your recent post here does not seem you understand what is going on. First the majority of stadiums use either Grass or Artifical turf unless its tennis and that is not what we are talking about. Second it seems to me you want to ridicule the lists that a lot of fellow wiki members put a ton of effort into. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihsfbstadium_80f5.html" title="User:Mihsfbstadium">Mihsfbstadium</a> 00:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
