<li>It's just a fantasy world, and not an especially notable one. I don't understand why anyone considers this even remotely encyclopedic. On one page I found, the creator says his newsletter is distributed to 960 "potential readers." Not sure what he means by that, but take that as an upper bound for his readership. Now take a look at your bookshelf (you have one, right?) Most likely every book on there has been read by at least ten times that many people, many of them probably by 100s or 1000s of times as many people. I ask you, is every book on that shelf worthy of its own article? And if not, why is this piece of fantasy worth an article? <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:01, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Very interesting. The previous, and quite recent, vote was archived on the talk page, sort of, because it was then immediately removed and a link created to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Fyksland&amp;oldid=3212814" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Fyksland&amp;oldid=3212814" rel="nofollow">this previous version of the talk page</a> instead. I don't see the point of all this. The archiving system of VfD needs some work IMO. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:39, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Assuming that the article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> is valid, and assuming the actual existence of this particular one (or any other for that matter) is verifiable, I don't see how we can do anything but <b>keep</b> this and similar. I have zero interest in the topic, but if it's real it seems valid enough, and Wikipedia seems a logical place for it. (It's very possible I've missed some critical prior points about micronations, though). <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 14:31, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's real as a micronation? Not as real as the people in the 'vanity' pages we delete. Or the garage bands. Or every single paper I've published in a journal or conference proceeding. Or the pets my relatives have had. Are we going to list not just every person who ever lived, but their pets, their hobbies, the items they worked on at work, the wallpaper in their houses, and any imaginary friend they made up as a three year old? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 16:48, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)

<li>The works of Tolkien may be fictional, but sadly he and Star Wars will always be more worthy of an encyclopedia than people like Rachel Clemons. Keep. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESome_cool_guy_3514.html" title="User:Some cool guy">Some cool guy</a> 02:30, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Comment: Jgm appears above to be assuming that everything mentioned in an encyclopedia article is <i><a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipso_facto.html" title="Ipso facto">ipso facto</a></i> itself encyclopedic. This could be called <i>The Principle of Inclusionism</i>, but I don't think it's agreed at all, and it's certainly not followed consistently. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:51, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, what I'm assuming is that <i>if</i> a phenomenon called micronations actually exists as described, that an article about an actual, particular one, with distinguishing factors, is perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 02:36, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete. From the "official" site: "Manufactured History This micronation retroactively created a history that stretches back thousands of years. Government and other aspects of the micronation have not yet been developed."?!? Places like Sealand at least accurately represent themselves as 'breakaway nations that no recognized government has bothered to challenge.' This place states as fact, the fiction that it is a member of the UN. Unrepentant POV. Soooooo DELETE. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 16:26, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. I vaguely remember this coming up here before. The article's create date was April 7, has it been recreated? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:08, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</b>

<li>Nope, not recreated -- somehow it survived the first VfD. Let's see how VfD #2 goes. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 01:29, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep, and put on Cleanup. Fyksland is not a micronation, but can be more accurately described as a rather complex fictional setting (situated on a hypothetical group of islands in the Northern Atlantic). <strike>In fact, if no-one rises to re-write the article, I think I'll do it myself.</strike> I have now rewritten the article to reflect Fyksland's fictionality.

<li>Keep - No consensus to delete when it was listed a few weeks ago. I don't see a good reason to relist it a couple weeks after it came off VfD. Is there any guidance on how soon you can relist an item that had no concensus to delete? - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">Tεx</a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="red">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">urε</a> 17:57, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not in the deletion policy, no. But then again it doesn't happen too often so I don't think it's been thoroughly thought through. That said, is the fact that it failed to reach consensus last time a good enough reason to keep it this time? Not, in my opinion... -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Graham :)</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">Talk</a> 19:47, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. I don't suppose the author's vote counts anyway, though what I don't understand is why is this back on VfD after 1-2 weeks after it's been removed frmo there.
