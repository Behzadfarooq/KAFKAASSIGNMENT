<p>Whether or not it was copyright, it was a lousy article anyway. I am happy to write a new one, alone or in collaboration with others who are interested in this field. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:09, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the future, please follow the directions on the copyvio notice (and do not remove the copyvio notice).

<p>Shouldn't there be something on the Greek art of the 2000 years since then, or at least pointers to articles on it elsewhere, given that this resides at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_art.html" title="Greek art">Greek art</a>? Perhaps <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_art.html" title="Byzantine art">Byzantine art</a> or modern Greek art or something, since I agree the term "Greek art" in English usage commonly refers to ancient Greek art, so this article should stay as is (modulo some pointers to other material). --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 10:23, Apr 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

But I eventually decided that <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_art.html" title="Greek art">Greek art</a> is the most commonly used term, since the following period is usually called <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_art.html" title="Byzantine art">Byzantine art</a> (an article which I am gearing up to write). I suppose there is modern Greek art but I know nothing about it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:24, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>i was under the impression korai were, atleast originally, non-nude. good job with this article. well-written, and i found few typos. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadanedwa_b002.html" title="User:Badanedwa">Badanedwa</a> 14:59, Apr 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes of course they were. The article says that the female nude was not acceptable until the 5th century. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:59, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Were the korai "of far less artisitic importance"? I know they were of less cultural importance - to the extent that they weren't as widely comissioned or produced as kouroi - but an obvious amount of work went into the clothes, particularly the geometric patterns on early examples, and on the hairstyles and jewellery on later korai (at least the few I've seen), which I think suggests they were artisitically significant. -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregg_9471.html" title="User:Gregg">Gregg</a> 07:50, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, that was a careless formulation on my part. What is of "artistic significance" is of course a subjective judgement made by art historians, not an absolute. It flows from the belief that the human form (the nude) is the highest form of artistic representation, and that therefore the kore is of less important since it made no contribution to the representation of the human form. The Greeks of course made no such judgements, and certainly not in the Archaic period. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:01, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where are the references to the sources used for material in this article? Without references and proper citation, it could simply be made up out of thin air. If it was in fact written from personal knowledge then it should still be confirmed with as many of the most reliable sources in the field as possible. This article is improving again, so it might as well be the best that is possible. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 14:47, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was written from the accumulated knowledge of an author (me) who has a doctorate in history, has been reading Greek history for thirty years and has travelled in Greece. Encyclopaedias are supposed to be authoritative references in and of themselves. When people read the Greek Art article in the Britannica, they don't find references, and they don't expect to, because they accept the Britannica as an authoritative source. Nor do they in Collier's or Funk &amp; Wagnall's (go check, I just did). At the Britannica they get a bibliography, at the others nothing but the author's initials. If Wikipedia is a genuine encyclopaedia, it shouldn't need references. (I agree the article could use a bibliography.) If you disagree with any statement in the article, you are free to edit it, then we can debate the point. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:19, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems surprising that you, an academian, would argue against references. The fact that Britannica or other encyclopedias don't list references and cite sources makes them less authoritative and reliable, not more. Why should we be restricted by what they do? Further, Brittanica is a physical, ivory tower institution that has a long history, all of which adds to their credibility. Wikipedia has none of that, and many critics feel that Wikipedia can never be reliable. The only way to counter that is with citing the best sources available. Think of it, without references a critic could claim all of the material is entirely made up, or at the least, that much of it is wrong. Why not head the challenge off at the pass and reference it upfront?</dd>
<dd>You say you are a PhD and authoritative, but anyone can claim that. If you really are a well known, authoritative source, then perhaps you could add your real name and qualifications as a reference in the article. If not, then it is better to stand on the most respected sources in the field. Of course your contributions are welcome, but properly referencing the article would make it even better. I am more than willing to help, but I have not the slightest idea what are the best sources in this field. You would be most qualified to decide that. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 16:18, Dec 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If Wikipedia lacks credibility (and I agree it does) it not because its articles are not footnoted liked undergraduate essays. It is because it allows far too many anonymous cranks to write and edit articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>While there is some merit to that position, it doesn't seem likely to change soon. And in any case not allowing anonymous people to edit won't entirely solve the credibility issue. It's not the panacea you seem to think it is. For one, lots of people that have PhD's are cranks too. So credibility is about a web of trust. Using trusted sources and citing them goes a long ways towards that. By the way, you use a lot of straw man arguments, undergraduate essays are besides the point. Journal articles and high level academic works are cited too, and for a reason. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 00:26, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia policy is however against signing articles, and indeed this is not "my" article since anyone can edit it.</li>
<li>Obviously we disagree about how encyclopaedia articles ought to be presented. I believe the Britannica (and all the other encyclopaedias I have ever used, which is a lot) are right in believing that encyclopaedias articles do not need footnotes, and you are wrong, but we will have to agree to disagree.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The curious thing to me is why. Brittanica and other encyclopedias that pay a staff are completely different from Wikipedia. That gives them an automatic credibility and Wikipedia will never get that without referencing. Even if you don't feel like doing it yourself, do you really think an article is not improved and more trustworthy and reliable if it cites and uses the best available sources, vs one guy's take on something? - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 00:26, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>If Wikipedia lacks credibility, no amount of footnotes will give it credibility. If I can make up my article out thin air, I can also make up footnotes. Do you check footnotes in other Wikipedia articles back to source? If I cited <i>Greek art: its Development, Character and Influence</i> by Robert Cook, would you check that such a book existed? Or that I had cited it correctly? I don't think so - if you had the time and expertise to do so, you wouldn't need an encyclopaedia. An encyclopaedia gains credibility only by publishing articles which people find through experience to be accurate. Wikipedia has a long way to go in that regard, but I am trying to make a contribution. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:12, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course references can be made up, but the point is it is much more difficult to both make up incorrect text and fake references than it is to just make up fake text. And having the references makes it much easier to either verify the material or that the citations are fraudulent. Yes in fact I do check that books cited exist and click on external links used as sources, or papers available online to check that it corresponds to the article. Not all the time but I do for some featured article candidates for example. Point is not every reader has to do that for an article, only one does if done thoroughly. That is a huge difference. If you cite a statement to a book and that is not in there it makes it very easy to cast a doubt over the rest of the material and at the very least make it known that a thorough review is required. If you never cite any statements to sources that is much harder and much less likely to be done. But like I said, it only takes one person knowledgeable about a subject and familiar with a source to call BS on a citation. Its not that hard for one person out of a 100,000 that read an article to go to the library and see if a source really stated that. Its very easy to see if a source exits. For example that book above carries <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0140146784</a> in one version and is available <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140146784/202-1096813-9651059" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140146784/202-1096813-9651059" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Additionally I see my local library has a copy that I could go get in about 5 minutes. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 02:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Wikipedia is in its infancy. One thing it has proven is that people will contribute material, much of it surprisingly valid. Eventually some or all of the pretty good part of the material can be put through a formal review process. That could involve checking the sources and verifying them thoroughly. In the meantime, well referenced articles are a big step. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 02:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I slightly edited the caption under the photo of the bronze sculture. It had said that the sculpture was definitely Poseidon; this is uncertain. Experts are reasonably sure that it is either Zeus or Poseidon, but are ultimately uncertain which is represented. I changed the caption to reflect this.--MS</p>

<p>He tossed out some remarkable 3D "compatible" images that really illustrate "ancient art" in a very effective way. He brags about all the edits he makes. This seems to be a person driven by "quantity" rather than "quality". He calls these images "horrible" without seeing them in 3D, which millions of student age people, are equipped to view. These are the "horrible 3D images". If you have even cheap paper glasses open these images and see a very impressive visual.69.109.42.36 04:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In general, few people would put 3D glasses on to read Wikipedia, which makes such images rather inappropriate for the main text (they are indeed quite a nuisance when you don't have your 3D glasses nearby). How about listing them at the bottom of the page inside a gallery tag? ... Looks like this... <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 13:33, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If they are go in a gallery they need proper captions to say exactly what they are of, from what period, in which museums they are now located etc. These captions are like something out of a children's magazine. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 16:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I think the 3D images ought to have a small thumb</b> They really look good, especially a macro shot I saw on the Sutton Hoo mask at the British Museum recently on line. My kids love to see dinosaur images in class with the glasses. The plastic ones work best. NASA is going to orbit the sun with two 3D cameras in a few months for 2 years. That will get a lot of glasses out there. Cybele 00:18, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an adult encyclopaedia, not an amusement for children. These are standard tourist-generic images, no better or worse than millions of others. They convey no useful information to readers, and they look horrible. I will continue to delete them from this article. Even if they are to go on a separate gallery page, they need proper captions. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:42, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm rather surprised at the elision of the Archaic period with the Geometric. If we're not going to make that distinction should we given some space to a justification of why every art reference book and historian of the period is wrong?<a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwospoonfuls_7e0d.html" title="User:Twospoonfuls">Twospoonfuls</a> 14:34, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sarcasm is a very tired and overused rhetorical device here. If you want to edit the article, go ahead. I have just reverted six months' worth of junk edits so if you actually know something about the subject you are more than welcome. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having said that, my (rather distant) recollection is that the geometric is a period of pottery, rather than of Greek art as a whole, and that chronologically it is a period <i>within</i> the archaic. Correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if that came across as pissy. The Geometric period is mostly to do with vase painting but there is decorative metal work from the period and, possible votive, terrcotta figurines. As for Geometric being a movement within Archaic I think it would be an ambitious thesis to suggest there's a stylistic continuity between the Dipylon master the Berlin painter - but I'd gladly hear it out if you are positing one. Therefore I don't want to start an edit war if we can't agree on such basic terms of reference.<a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwospoonfuls_7e0d.html" title="User:Twospoonfuls">Twospoonfuls</a> 15:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not positing anything. I was expressing an opinion on a subject I haven't read much on for some years. A quick look at a reference (Cook, Greek Art) suggests you are correct. He gives proto-geometric 1050-900, geometric 900-750, archaic 750-500, classical 500-330, hellenistic 330-27. Ancora imparo. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
