<p>Most importantly, though: <i>none of the supposed assertions of notability have sources</i>.

If I weren't such a Girl Scout now in the Wikipedia community, my wrists still stinging from the admonishments of those who don't enjoy my "rogue admin" activities, I would have closed this as a bad faith nomination. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 23:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article doesn't assert anything notable, however. What you say is false, anyhow. None of the things that actually look like plausible assertions of notability (the ones I put a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} by, to be clear) aren't there in the reference. This seems like a kneejerk remark to a thoughtful nomination.

<li>Insults are insulting. You shouldn't be insulted by a calm suggestion and discussion. I'm quite dismayed that you then chose to look through my contributions and deprod thre articles I just tagged seemingly indiscrimately, without giving a rationale or fixing the problem, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P.T.%27s_Revenge&amp;diff=80070043&amp;oldid=79542884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P.T.%27s_Revenge&amp;diff=80070043&amp;oldid=79542884" rel="nofollow">even deprodding an article that's written like clear vanity</a>: "<i>One faithful night of partying at the Sierzega household would provide the change they were looking for...A dear friend was given a SUPERB nickname, P.T..the rest is history...their memory is still alive and well in the hearts of the faithful</i>". I just met you, but I'm already tired of your incivility and disrespectfulness. Nobody, least of all me, is going to get really worked up over the result of this one AfD, but this is an encyclopedia, and you really need to start acting with the maturity that implies. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 02:39, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - Notable well known band /extremely notable/ in their field. The fact they're noted as a supergroup consisting of members from other big bands didn't ring any bells for you that they might be notable? A poor article doesn't mean it should be deleted, just improved. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd also appreciate your reasoning why you've prodded a whole bunch of related articles. Why are you doing this when it seems you don't know the subject matter at all? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:33, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In that case, which page do you think this article should be redirected to? It is clearly not independently notable, as that is the only assertion of notability mentioned, and the suggested remedy for those bands is to create an article, not a redirect. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:35, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article doesn't establish that, that's a problem with the article not a reason for deletion. Also see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: <i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable;</i> - members of other hardcore bands. I'd also appreciate to know why you're prodding articles of well known, established bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Movielife_cc77.html" title="The Movielife">The Movielife</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Is_The_Reason_8abe.html" title="Texas Is The Reason">Texas Is The Reason</a>. These aren't small obscure bands as a simple Google search will tell you. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:42, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is exactly the clause I was referring to myself, though you've taken it out of context. It finishes "<i>it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i>" In any case, the other prods I made were because they lacked sources and assertions of notability, but that's off-topic. I'm unhappy they were deprodded without an effort to fix the problems, but this case is different: it appears to not merit inclusion. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:02, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's notable because there are two members that have been in major bands - Rival Schools wasn't one person's a side project. Either way, I've made it pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. It took me one Google search but it's all moot now. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 01:35, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Schreifels_de95.html" title="Walter Schreifels">Walter Schreifels</a>. Sorry, but these assertions of notability are tenuous. It appears to have notable members, but I don't see anything that justifies the band itself having it own article; however, I also don't see why it shouldn't be content in the Schreifels article as a notable aspect of his career, with mentions of the group perfectly appropriate in the articles of other notable personnel connected with the project. <i>unimportant venting</i>: 1) Being rude is neither constructive nor appealing. 2) WP:OSTRICH does not apply when the article's claims are tenuous, and while I do think editors should attempt research before nomming articles for deletion, it is perfectly understandable that something worthy of an article does not always come across as such based on the article's content and resources found at the time of the nom. This appears perfectly good faith to me. GassyGuy 09:05, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's very difficult to establish notability of a short-lived, well known, influential band. Influence generally stuggles to get references, and a simple Google search won't find their popularity due to the game. Their CDs are sold all over the place though, and they're well known. The only way I could possibly establish their relative influence and popularity that is point out their Last.FM<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rival+Schools" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Rival+Schools" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> fans (different people playing one of their songs) are much higher compared to similar bands like <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla_Biscuits_0891.html" title="Gorilla Biscuits">Gorilla Biscuits</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gorilla+Biscuits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Gorilla+Biscuits" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rites_of_Spring_802c.html" title="Rites of Spring">Rites of Spring</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rites+of+Spring" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Rites+of+Spring" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, Quicksand<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Quicksand" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Quicksand" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planes_Mistaken_For_Stars_b250.html" title="Planes Mistaken For Stars">Planes Mistaken For Stars</a><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Planes+Mistaken+for+Stars" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Planes+Mistaken+for+Stars" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Million_Dead_28d4.html" title="Million Dead">Million Dead</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Million+Dead" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Million+Dead" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and several other large bands from the same genre, and Rival Schools only have one album. They're a popular band. This band isn't known as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Schreifels_de95.html" title="Walter Schreifels">Walter Schreifels</a>'s side project, it's probably his best known band, so it's inaccurate to redirect there. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 10:07, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It can be his best known band and still be covered in his article. I'm not sure why that would be a reason not to merge it. I trust you that they're influential, but I'm trying to work within <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the sources I've looked at just don't have any content that properly assert that this needs to remain as is. If you think Schreifels is a bad place to house the info, please suggest a better one. GassyGuy 10:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because people who look for information on Rival Schools are looking for the band, not a person in the band. There /is/ no appropriate place to merge it too, and that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> rule is intended for small obscure side-projects and early bands that appear before a band gets big but aren't as notable as the major band, which this _isn't_, particularly as the band is more well known than the person. Also, the article now meets WP:MUSIC as they internationally toured, it contains at least two notable members, and I'm also trying to show it has become one of the most prominent examples of the scene through Last.FM. I'm really struggling on show to show it is more well known, aside from the fact that I knew of the band before Googling and they are one of the best known bands in the scene, even if they were shortlived. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 10:37, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I'm trying to say is that, if you merge the band to the Schreifels article, or elsewhere, people get the same information, regardless of where it is housed. I'm not trying to call this a Schreifels side project, but at the same time, I remain unconvinced that it merits a standalone article and am simply trying to find a decent place to house the information contained. As it stands it appears this is heading towards a keep anyway, but, to me, it really doesn't demonstrate it terribly well and it doesn't seem like there's a good way for it to do so.

<li>The fact an article is rubbish isn't a good reason for deletion - that means it deserves a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} tag, because it isn't beyond salvation, and I'm not going to waste my time rewriting a page that might get deleted. I'm honestly completely stunned that people don't know the band and that this AFD is happening at all and the band /easily/ meets WP:MUSIC (or WP:BAND or whatever you want to call it) <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 16:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
