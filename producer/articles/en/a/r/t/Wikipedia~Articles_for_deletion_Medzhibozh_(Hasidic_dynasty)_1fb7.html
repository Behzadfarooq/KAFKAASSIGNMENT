<li><b>Keep</b> I added this article because I couldn't find one at all on wikipedia on Medziboz. All of Hasidus started with the Baal Shem Tov in Medziboz. I was looking to get in touch with the current Medziboz Rebbe and couldn't find it until I indirectly got to Zhvil, so I thought there should at least be some link and background on the Baal Shem Tov connecting this lineage. That information, and some of the rest which I added, is not found anywhere else in wikipedia. I do not think this should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosidFrumBirth_1288.html" title="User:ChosidFrumBirth">ChosidFrumBirth</a> 09:35, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. Here is what I have written to Meshulam: You should avoid this kind of move (the hasty nomination to delete) because <i>it's a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slippery_slope" class="extiw" title="wikt:slippery_slope">slippery slope</a></i> and could lead to the nomination for and deletion of similar articles about smaller Hasidic dynasties - by people who are not experts and don't care - with unintended consequences. Votes to delete are open to the world and you are inviting people who have no idea what this topic is about at all to cast a vote, which is very unfair and lacking insight. It seems that you may have been better off trying to add a {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_to_78ed.html" title="Template:Merge to">merge to</a>}} template or considered MERGING the material at some point perhaps and WAITED (at least a month!) to do so. You should also have first started a discussion at a number of places where people who know something about this topic could have given their intelligent input, such as at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Judaism_1a41.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EOrthodox_Rabbinical_Biography_Collaboration_of_the_Week_61ff.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Orthodox Rabbinical Biography Collaboration of the Week">Wikipedia talk:Orthodox Rabbinical Biography Collaboration of the Week</a>. Or you could have contacted other editors who deal with topics like this to solicit their views. This action of your is extreme and I do not condone it. I urge you to withdraw this nomination. Thank you.

<dd>It looks like merging the articles has become the best option. I will explain my only objection: Mezibuz (or, as we have spelled it here Medzhibozh) is a city that is significant to every Chassidic sect. By making an article identifying Mezibuz with one specific dynasty, to the exception of othes, is a problem. This is similar to what would happen if I decided that I was the King of Camelot, and had one of my 2 followers write a wikipedia article amending the Camelot page that read "after that while Lancelot thing, Meshulam became King of Camelot." Ignoring the accuracy of the claim (that is, assuming that the Zhviller Rebbe of Boston is also the Mezibuz Rebbe, and that this claim is not fraught with error), the claim is misleading. Mezibuz has a rich history that has nothing to do with a specific dynasty <i>that was established in Boston.</i> I feel that linking the Medzhibozh article to the Zhvill article gives too much importance to a figure who is essentially a lightweight in the Jewish world. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 19:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep as is</b> . I don't agree with Meshulam one bit. It's not Rabbi Korff's fault that he is a direct descendant of the Baal Shem Tov and that his grandfather, great grandfather, etc., etc. inherited the Baal Shem Tov's home and shul, but that does make him different from the other offshoots. Meshulam says Mezibuz has a rich history that has nothing to do with a specific dynasty -- so does Boston, so do many other places, but that doesn't preclude a dynasty that began there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither is it relevant that other dynasties have roots in Mezbuz, simply because the Baal Shem Tov was from there. There is a distinct line and separate dynasty here. Ignoring Meshulam's sarcasm, which is inappropriate if we are really looking for the truth here, Rabbi Korff did not unilaterally decide to become King of Camelot. The fact is that, unlike all the other dynasties and rebbes Meshulam would merge, his grandfather was actually born in Mezbuz, in the Baal Shem Tov's house, to a father who was the Mezbuz Rebbe and who inherited that house and title from his father, and he from his father, and back to Reb Boruch, the Baal Shem Tov's grandson. That is recognized and acknowledged by ALL the other Rebbes that I know of, including the Boyaner, Zviller, Skverer, Chernobyler, Foltichaner, Skolyer, etc., etc. who joined the late Talner Rebbe in strongly encouraging Rabbi Korff to become Rebbe and fill his grandfather's place, who view him as a major figure not a "lightweight", and who are obviously in a much better position to know and judge than Meshulam is, and it makes the Mezbuz Hasidic dynasty distinct. Meshulam's comments are insulting and show a bias and personal opinion. I don't know what happened between him and the Rebbe, or what he has against him, but this is just not acceptable and not a credit to wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosidFrumBirth_1288.html" title="User:ChosidFrumBirth">ChosidFrumBirth</a> 20:25, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
