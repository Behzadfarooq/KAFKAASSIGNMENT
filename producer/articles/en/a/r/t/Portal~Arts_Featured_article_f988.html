The building has stood atop the <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acropolis_of_Athens_8fe6.html" title="Acropolis of Athens">Acropolis of Athens</a> for nearly 2,500 years and was built to give thanks to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a>, the city's <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron.html" title="Patron">patron</a> <a href="../../../g/o/d/Goddess.html" title="Goddess">goddess</a>, for the salvation of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wars_76fa.html" title="Persian Wars">Persian Wars</a>. The building was officially called the <b>Temple of Athena the Virgin</b>, and its popular name derives from the ancient Greek word <i>παρθένος</i> (parthenos), a virgin. The Parthenon replaced an older building that had been destroyed by the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a>.

These survive only in part, but there are good descriptions of most of those parts that have been lost. Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, the Greek Government, with funding and technical assistance provided by the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, began a concerted effort to restore the Parthenon and other Acropolis structures.</p>

The style is recognisable not just by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but by its grinning <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask.html" title="Mask">masks</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putti.html" title="Putti">putti</a> and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity. The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1693.html" title="1693">1693</a>. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naive and parochial manner, having evolved from <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a> native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy. Around <a href="../../../1/7/3/1730.html" title="1730">1730</a>, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation of this style led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780s.html" title="1780s">1780s</a> onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassicism.html" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassicism</a>.</p>

For some, these daring and innovative <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballet_%28music%29.html" title="Ballet (music)">ballets</a> practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> miniatures.</p>
<p>Stravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conducting.html" title="Conducting">conductor</a>, often at the premières of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_Roland-Manuel_f3f2.html" title="Alexis Roland-Manuel">Alexis Roland-Manuel</a>, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled <i>Poetics of Music</i>. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of "expressing anything but itself". <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Craft_c55a.html" title="Robert Craft">Robert Craft</a> transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as <i>Conversations with Stravinsky</i>.</p>
<p>A quintessentially <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan.html" title="Cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan</a> Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_countries.html" title="Western countries">West</a> and in his native land.

It is a literature that includes extremes, for it encloses both <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Lost_ae40.html" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a></i> and the Earl of Rochester's <i>Sodom,</i> the high-spirited sexual comedy of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Country_Wife_1be8.html" title="The Country Wife">The Country Wife</a></i> and the moral wisdom of <i><a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrim%27s_Progress_ccb4.html" title="Pilgrim's Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>.</i> It saw <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">Locke's</a> <i>Treatises on Government,</i> the founding of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a>, the experiments and holy meditations of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Boyle_f1c3.html" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>, the hysterical attacks on theaters from <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Collier_dda1.html" title="Jeremy Collier">Jeremy Collier</a>, and the pioneering of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_criticism.html" title="Literary criticism">literary criticism</a> from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dryden_c542.html" title="John Dryden">John Dryden</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dennis_9400.html" title="John Dennis">John Dennis</a>.

<p>The dates for "Restoration literature" are a matter of convention, and they differ markedly from genre to genre. Thus, the "Restoration" in drama may last until 1700, while in poetry it may last only until 1666 and the <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Annus_mirabilis.html" title="Annus mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a></i>, and in prose it might end in 1688, with the increasing tensions over succession and the corresponding rise in <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodicals.html" title="Periodicals">periodicals</a> or not until 1700, when those periodicals grew more stabilized. In general, the term "Restoration" is used to denote the literature that began and flourished due to Charles II, whether that literature was the laudatory <a href="../../../o/d/e/Ode.html" title="Ode">ode</a> that gained a new life with restored aristocracy or the <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">eschatological</a> literature that showed an increasing despair among Puritans, or the literature of rapid communication and trade that followed in the wake of England's mercantile empire.</p>

He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">baroque</a> period, important as a portrait artist. His two visits to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> while part of the Spanish court are well documented. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he created scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece, <i><a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Meninas_3f5e.html" title="Las Meninas">Las Meninas</a></i> (1656).</p>
<p>Starting in the first quarter of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">nineteenth century</a>, Velázquez's artwork proved a model for the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realism_%28arts%29.html" title="Realism (arts)">realist</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionism.html" title="Impressionism">impressionist</a> painters, in particular <a href="../../../%C3%A9/d/o/%C3%89douard_Manet_2a86.html" title="Édouard Manet">Édouard Manet</a>.

It was based on Heyward's novel <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Porgy.html" title="Porgy">Porgy</a></i> and the play of the same name that he co-wrote with his wife Dorothy. All three works deal with <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> life in the fictitious <i>Catfish Row</i> in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina_d5d8.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a> in the early 1930s.</p>
<p>Originally conceived by Gershwin as an "American folk opera," the work was first performed in various forms in the fall of 1935, but was not widely accepted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> as a legitimate opera until the late 1970s and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">'80s</a>: it is now considered part of the standard operatic repertoire. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> is also regularly performed internationally, and several recordings of the complete work, including Gershwin's cuts, have been made. Despite this acclaim, the opera has been controversial; some from the outset have considered it <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>.</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../s/u/m/Summertime_%28song%29.html" title="Summertime (song)">Summertime</a>" is by far the best-known piece from the work, and countless interpretations of this and other individual numbers have also been recorded and performed. The opera is admired for Gershwin's innovative synthesis of European orchestral techniques with American <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a> idioms. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> tells the story of Porgy, a crippled black man living in the slums of Charleston, South Carolina, and his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her pimp, and Sportin' Life, the drug dealer.</p>

Unsurprisingly, most of the early poetry written in the colonies and fledgling republic used contemporary <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_poetry.html" title="English poetry">British models</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meter_%28poetry%29.html" title="Meter (poetry)">poetic form</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Diction.html" title="Diction">diction</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28literary%29.html" title="Theme (literary)">theme</a>.

<p>Toward the end of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a>, consideration of American poetry had diversified, as scholars placed an increased emphasis on poetry by women, <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African Americans</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanics</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicano_poetry.html" title="Chicano poetry">Chicanos</a> and other subcultural groupings.

<p><b><a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_action_cinema_3ab1.html" title="Hong Kong action cinema">Hong Kong action cinema</a></b> is the principal source of the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_Hong_Kong_9796.html" title="Cinema of Hong Kong">Hong Kong film industry</a>'s global fame. It combines elements from the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_movie.html" title="Action movie">action movie</a>, as codified by <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_the_United_States_4fa8.html" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a>, with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_culture.html" title="Chinese culture">Chinese</a> storytelling and aesthetic traditions, to create a culturally distinctive form that nevertheless has a wide transcultural appeal. In recent years, the flow has reversed somewhat, with American and European action films being heavily influenced by <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Hong_Kong_e060.html" title="Culture of Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_genre.html" title="Film genre">genre</a> conventions.</p>
<p>The first <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> action films favoured the <i><a href="../../../w/u/x/Wuxia.html" title="Wuxia">wuxia</a></i> style, emphasizing mysticism and swordplay, but this trend was politically suppressed in the 1930s and replaced by styles in which films depicted more down-to-earth unarmed <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_fu.html" title="Kung fu">kung fu</a>, often featuring folk hero <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wong_Fei_Hung_cdca.html" title="Wong Fei Hung">Wong Fei Hung</a>. Post-war cultural upheavals led to a second wave of wuxia films with highly acrobatic violence, followed by the emergence of the grittier kung fu films for which the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw_Brothers_8f1c.html" title="Shaw Brothers">Shaw Brothers</a> studio became best known. The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s_in_Hong_Kong_1f37.html" title="1970s in Hong Kong">1970s</a> saw the rise and sudden death of international superstar <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a>. He was succeeded in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s_in_Hong_Kong_89c2.html" title="1980s in Hong Kong">1980s</a> by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Chan_8b3e.html" title="Jackie Chan">Jackie Chan</a>—who popularised the use of comedy, dangerous <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunt.html" title="Stunt">stunts</a>, and modern urban settings in action films—and <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_Li_c6bf.html" title="Jet Li">Jet Li</a>, whose authentic <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_martial_arts.html" title="Chinese martial arts">wushu</a></i> skills appealed to both eastern and western audiences. The innovative work of directors and producers like <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsui_Hark_8660.html" title="Tsui Hark">Tsui Hark</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Woo_8471.html" title="John Woo">John Woo</a> introduced further variety (for example, gunplay, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triad.html" title="Triad">triads</a> and the supernatural). An exodus by many leading figures to Hollywood in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s_in_Hong_Kong_6ab2.html" title="1990s in Hong Kong">1990s</a> coincided with a downturn in the industry.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_Baroque_5feb.html" title="Sicilian Baroque">Sicilian Baroque</a></b> is the distinctive form of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque_architecture.html" title="Baroque architecture">Baroque architecture</a> that took hold on the island of <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, off the southern coast of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, in the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">seventeenth</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">eighteenth</a> centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask.html" title="Mask">masks</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putto.html" title="Putto">putti</a> and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity.</p>
<p>The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parochialism.html" title="Parochialism">parochial</a> manner, having evolved from <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a> native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engraving.html" title="Engraving">engravings</a> that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_architecture.html" title="Neoclassical architecture">neoclassicism</a>.</p>
<p>The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_order.html" title="Social order">social order</a> of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, it was in fact governed by an extravagant and <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egocentric.html" title="Egocentric">egocentric</a> <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.</p>

<p>The history of <b><a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_theatre.html" title="Irish theatre">Irish theatre</a></b> begins with the rise of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> administration in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> at the start of the 17th century. Over the next 400 years this small country was to make a disproportionate contribution to drama in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>.</p>
<p>In the early days of its history, theatrical productions in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> tended to serve the political purposes of the administration, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments was staged. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> equivalents and performers and productions from the British capital frequently found their way to the Irish stage. However, most Irish playwrights from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Congreve_%28playwright%29_ed0f.html" title="William Congreve (playwright)">William Congreve</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bernard_Shaw_f7b2.html" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> found it necessary to go abroad to establish themselves.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, theatres and theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of indigenous writers, directors and performers began to emerge. This allowed many of the most significant Irish <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dramatists.html" title="Dramatists">dramatists</a> to learn their trade and establish their reputations at home rather than in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> or the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
