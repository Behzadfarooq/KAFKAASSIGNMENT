<dd>An excellent summary of the issues, Alex. I rather like ASBs, but I completely agree with your proposals that a) they should all be landscape rather than portrait, and b) they should go at the bottom of the page. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EALargeElk_ecec.html" title="User:ALargeElk">ALargeElk</a> 16:54, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that, given oblong boxes, they should go at the top, as that is really where they visually look the best. Beyond that, I think I agree with the proposal in general, and can see the case for broad boxes as better than oblong. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:37, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While they would look good at the top, or rather at the right border of the text, putting them on top would intrude badly with the legibility of a text. I keep my browser window at about 800 width, and I use the standard skin, which means I have the menu on the left. If there were boxes at the right side of the text, there would not be too much room left for the text, and if there are pictures or tables in the text, it would lead to horribly looking pages. Also, users looking for a link in the boxes would have to scroll back when they finished reading, which most probably would just not do; therefore the box might simply be wasted. And they would detract from the text itself, even if they don't interfere with the text too much (in a different page setup, most likely).<br />
Which is why I proposed that the boxes should go to the bottom. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 06:56, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only time that they should go at the bottom of the page, is in situations where there can be more than one project claiming an article. Article boxes, or what ever you want to call them, which clearly add to the comprehension of text by the public by classifying the article clearly belong on top to the right and below the introduction paragraph. I would propose that images in articles should go on the left so as not to conflict with the boxes. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 17:05, 9 May 2004 (UTC</dd>

<dd>What about the other important contexts of an article which don't have a box? They don't become less important because some people don't want to follow the latest fad, or because there are just one or two articles relevant anyway.

<p>Since Alex asked for feedback, here's one Wikipedian's two US cents:</p>
<p>I just happened on the article for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, &amp; was a bit concerned about the proliferation of boxes as the bottom of the page. These refer to series on Europe, the European Union, NATO, &amp; OECD. Now, I'll admit that these are all germane to the article on Greece, but they looked incongruous to me for these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Needless repetition</b> At a glance, in these 4 boxes, Belgium is linked to 4 times, &amp; Austria 3 times, neither of which has much to do with Greece.</li>
<li><b>Incongruous Associations</b> In the first box of this group, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, there are 4 articles linked under "dependencies". I struggled for a second to understand just how "Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, &amp; Jersey" could be seen as dependencies of Greece -- then realized that although they are subdivisions of Denmark &amp; the UK that, they have identities clearly recognized even by other nations. Yes, I admit the failure to understand was on my part, but I can't help but feel this failure was forced upon me, &amp; that the box should have been better constructed.</li>
<li><b>Structure</b> So even if you ignore my other two gripes or whinges, there is still left this sense that I have over four blocks of data that takes up a lot of space, but doesn't deliver the user much information for all of that space; couldn't we find a way with PHP &amp; the Wikipedia software to integrate all of these links into one box that provides links to the European Union, NATO, &amp; OECD, their flags, &amp; all of the member states? Now that would be very cool, &amp; be something we can wave in the faces of proprietary online encyclopedia manufacturers, &amp; challenge them to top.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will the last item come to pass? I have a sense that the developers are working hard over existing problems, &amp; that my suggestion justifiably may never reach the top of their to-do lists, yet <b>if</b> this integration could be done, I'd guess most of the resistence to the use of "series boxes" would vanish quickly. And I hope I'm not just presenting another off-teh-wall idea here. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:38, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My biggest problem with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> (Besides the fact that I don't like Greek food) is the painful homogeny of color at the bottom of the page. I think the boxes themselves are all quite well designed. Are there a lot of them? Well, yes. But I blame Europe more than series boxes for that. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 03:36, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am fairly certain that it is not impossible at all to have similar boxes below any country in the word; the USA are part of NATO and OECD, too, a box about all countries in North and South America could easily been done (it probably exists already) and there are certainly one or more pan-american organisations, too. You are right, though, that four links instead of four boxes would do just as well, or maybe just the "Europe" box and three links — even thought these boxes are series boxes instead of ASBs. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 06:42, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither. I guess that there has already been a lot of debate about them, about which I don't know too much. Probably regulating them somewhat would be a good idea, some articles are already rather boxed, so to speak. Probably my policy about ASBs would be at least adaptable, so if somebody who knows the previous debates about them wants to do that, feel free. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 22:48, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>My US 2 cents worth:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think that ==Content: What should NOT be in an ASB?== is not clear, or perhaps I disagree. I agree that an ASB shouldn't have a huge list of articles. I find some of the geographical ASBs to be ludicrously large and overcomplete (see, e.g., <a href="../../../c/a/l/Template%7ECalifornia_daef.html" title="Template:California">Template:California</a>). However, I think that it is a good thing for an ASB to have a <i>link</i> to a "list of" article. I'll hold up <a href="../../../f/o/o/Template%7EFooter_SolarSystem_b2d4.html" title="Template:Footer SolarSystem">Template:Footer SolarSystem</a> as a positive example --- it has a list of the 10 most prominent <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_System_ac3e.html" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> articles, and then links to two more "list of" articles for experts to browse through. I believe that the "What should NOT be in an ASB" section seems deprecate this, but it may just be unclear.</li>
<li>I'm guessing that the thought behind requiring a project for an ASB will discourage random boxes. My fear is that people love random ASBs so much that we'll then be deluged with random WikiProjects! But, since <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, maybe this isn't a big issue.</li>

<p>Some <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">people</a> may have a hard time understanding <b>proper box heirarchy</b>&#160;: In a case like <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>, which has a very detailed list of <i>subfields within biology</i> there is no need to have a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> box there. If its the top link ("articles in the FOO series"), then if it is to have a box, it will have a MORE GENERAL ONE - one that links to higher categories. Biology, then would have a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sciences.html" title="Sciences">sciences</a> box leading to other equivalent and related. Also, lets call these classification boxes, not series boxes - these arent linear - they are paralell, or related links.</p>

<ul>
<li>Top level articles should have a higher level classification box. Use the same <a href="../../../c/l/a/Wikipedia%7EClassbox_9673.html" title="Wikipedia:Classbox">Wikipedia:classbox</a> if articles fit within the same classification. Some articles may fit under more than one category.</li>

<dd>high all! just wandering by. This is a debate that gotta be had. I have a little background in information systems... so contributing some terminology may speed things along. a <i><a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a></i> is a form of what maths people call a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graph.html" title="Graph">graph</a>. A graph is a series of <a href="../../../n/o/d/Node.html" title="Node">nodes</a> (or wikipages!) connected by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Links.html" title="Links">links</a>. The links may or may not have a direction (parent-&gt;child) or may be directionless <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling.html" title="Sibling">siblings</a> (see also <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_network.html" title="Semantic network">semantic network</a>). Hierarchies may commonly be either type of (aka classification) or part of (meronomy&#160;?sp). (This is a bit esoteric, but people often get lost in the type/part distinction: a tree may be <i>part of</i> a forest but it is a <i>type of</i> plant .... or a tree has branches, leaves and roots as its part, or gum tree or pine as it's types )...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>anyway to keep it simple the following six words are simple enough (egs for tree and Greece), and may aid clarity:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>parent</b> (either Forest or Plant -- Europe or Country)</li>
<li><b>sibling</b> (grass, Turkey)</li>
<li><b>child</b>
<ul>
<li><b>sub-type</b> or <b>type</b> (gum tree)</li>
<li><b>part</b> (leaf, root -- Crete, Athens)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>related concept</b> (chain saw, paper -- Ouzo, Greek)</li>

<p>Article series boxes (ASBs) <s>and the better concept of list series namespaces (LSN)</s> are there to benefit the public at large, rather than the egos of editors. As the WikiProject on Buddhism put it: project boxes <s>namespaces</s> are there to <i>promote better coordination, content distribution, and cross-referncing between articles</i> belonging to a specific project. Depending on the project an ASB could work, but on projects like Buddhism and Alternative Medicine a <i>List</i> <s>LSN</s> definitely makes a lot more sense where the subject is allowed to grow without forcing an ever larger project ASB <s>namespace</s> upon the respective articles.</p>
<p>In short, ASBs <i>listing specific articles</i> is just plain poor hyperlink document design in my humble opinion. ASBs should rather utilize <i>Lists</i>.</p>
<p>Next, I would suggest that you check out <a href="../../../i/n/f/Wikipedia%7EInfobox_113a.html" title="Wikipedia:Infobox">Wikipedia:Infobox</a>. Selecting an unique project color and then sticking to it would only help the public use these project ASBs <s>namespaces</s> in articles where there is more than one ASB <s>namespace</s>. In many respects, multiple project ASBs <s>namespaces</s> in articles will be replacing those <i>see other</i> linked lists so often found at the bottom of articles. Having every ASB <s>namespace</s> light blue in color would only serve to confuse the public.</p>
<p>In short, over use of <i>blue boxes</i> is just plain poor hyperlink document design in my humble opinion. -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 16:47, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On a minor note, I just want to point out that you seem to be misusing the phrases "<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENamespace_6ef8.html" title="Wikipedia:Namespace">namespace</a>" and "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProject_namespace_034e.html" title="Wikipedia:Project namespace">project namespace</a>".

<dd>I see what the problem is now. It was my mistake. Beyond infoboxes, custom messages, talk namespaces, and project namespaces there is yet another term called an ASB. Just think that people were complaining about the placement of the CAM ASB, and I did not even know that it was our first ASB rather than just another version of our ...&#160;!!! -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 19:16, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If I had to consider all that garbage, I would be neuroic without an operation project in under 2 weeks. If it was not operational when they were developed, the chances are that <i>all</i> the working WikiProjects will never bother using the next generation of technology.

<dd>Categories are not going to replace article series boxes, because ASBs have <i>selected</i> articles in them, which is something no category could nor should do.

<p>This concept reminds me of the days when some professions were <i>not</i> allowed to advertise their profession. Even today, the public is supposed to magically pick the best physician out of a mob of possible choices. And, if they managed to chose the wrong doctor, it is all their fault. Oh! If only they had chosen the correct doctor! They would never have gotten themselves into their present mess.</p>
<p>Well, surprise, surprise, surprise ... ASBs came into existence out of the necessity for better navigation. If Wikipedia had a better lightning fast search facility there would indeed be no need for ASBs. But, until that time ... ASBs are the <i>answer</i> rather than the <i>problem.</i> -- <a href="../../../m/r/-/User%7EMr-Natural-Health_8c72.html" title="User:Mr-Natural-Health">John Gohde</a> 20:08, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I occasionally see people adding [edit] links to navboxes and other templates, but I can't remember seeing any discussion on the subject. Personally, I'm against including them at all. Why? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of navboxes changes very seldom; only when articles are added, deleted, or renamed.</li>
<li>The content of navboxes isn't simple text, it's code. It usually requires some technical knowledge of HTML and/or wikitext. It's not meant for the casual Wikipedia contributor. If you know enough to edit the navbox's content, then it's easy enough for you to find the template without an [edit] link.</li>
<li>Although article sections' [edit] links are integral to encouraging Wikipedia content contributions, navbox links are not. Thus, they constitute superfluous visual elements, and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I'm reticent to arbitrarily remove the [edit] links that people have gone to the trouble of adding, without having some consensus to back up my deletions (so please add some consensus to this discussion).</p>
<p>I've developed an improved way to display a navbox [edit] link. Please have a look at <a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_Russia_a7a7.html" title="Template:History of Russia">Template:History of Russia</a>. [edit] links inside the navbox either looked like another navigation item, or they add a big ugly chunk of padding to the box. So I put an [edit] link underneath, <i>outside</i> of the navbox, by using a table caption with "align=bottom" applied to it. Much less obtrusive. If you <i>must</i> have an [edit] link, consider doing it this way.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to make the edit link without the little "external link" icon next to it? <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael Z.</a> 06:31, 2004 Dec 20 (UTC)</i></p>
