<p>This list defies NPOV, No Original Research, and WP's standards on Notabilty</p>
<p>First of all, the word "Unusual" is highly problematic as it is a very subjective word, on par with "good", "bad", and "normal". A death that may seem unusual to one person may not seem so to another, and even within different contexts of data may lose its seeming unusualness.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths generally viewed/cited as unusual", we still would be doing original research, and this would still be only presenting a biased view.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths refered to as unusual", all the remaining entries will be sourced, however, these will be hard to find, and barely representative of the subject, and be mostly lifted from published personal opinions. (Although this option will satisfy verifiability).</p>
<p>And if we were to change this article to focus soley on statistically unusual deaths, the whole article will have to be rewritten to include rare diseases, rare instruments of destruction, etc,etc. In addition, what aspect of the death and in what context will we look at look at to declare it statistically unusual? (Of course, this will violate NOR)</p>
<p>And lastly, the subject of the list itself, "unusual deaths" is hardly notable at all. It may often pop up in trivia books (which often repeat many myths and unverifiable factoids), but this subject, by itself, does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.</p>
<p><br />

<li>“”Keep”” but perhaps with more specific criteria. The previous discussions are pretty comprehensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meets notability criteria for lists under WP:BIO: “Instead, the list should be limited to notable people: those that already have a Wikipedia article or could plausibly have one, per this guideline.” Re: Sensationalism. Listing Isadora Duncan’s death as “unusual” may be more emotionally-involved than listing it as “road accident.” That makes it more challenging but no less valid. Actually supports NPOV: “representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.” If the published sources perceived the death as unusual, the encyclopedia should respect and reflect that fact, just as is done with list of deaths by date or by cause. For instance, Toilet-related Injuries are real and the subject of medical research, and the article includes a section on Famous Toilet-related Deaths and as a theme in popular culture. Re: Litvinenko death. It's unusual because poisoning by polonium is not common and was perceived as a notable way to go. Canuckle 06:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, basically, you're saying we should change the article to be about Deaths refered to as unusual, of notable people? Although this will be verifiable, it still is a very narrow group defined by trivial criteria, and we would have to parse through biographies and text books and news pieces to find the authors' actual reference to the death as "odd", "strange", "quirky", "unusual", etc, as using anything else to gauge the authors' opinion would lean towards original research. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 07:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Specifically, "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not automatically mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia." The list of deaths is interesting, certainly; I enjoyed reading it. But the information in it is collected together not because it addresses a topic that is itself notable, but rather because it has entertainment value. To me, this means that <s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a></s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> applies.

I don't think it's accurate to call this a stray link -- this argument is common enough in AfD discussions, and is certainly a legitimate argument for deletion, though you may well disagree about whether it applies here. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 13:52, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The list has 35 references, and most of the deaths are certainly by unusual means. The normal editing process can via consensus delete any which are too common. There is no reason to limit it notable people who died unusual deaths. Since the persons share the feature of diying unusual deaths, the list is not indiscriminate. Similar lists have long enjoyed a place in such reference works. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that editors should decide which deaths are unusual and which are not? This would violate NPOV, because it would be declaring what's unusual from the perspective of ourselves. And our judgement of a death as usual/unusual would be original research. As I've said before, references would only validate an entry if the author expressed explicitly that the death was odd. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 16:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is not too hard of an exercise to find a reference wherein a reliable and independant commentator will say the a British noble dying from the effects of a red hot poker being stuck up his rectum is an "unusual way to go." That would satisfy your worries about it being "original research" by a Wikipedia editor thinking that to be an unusual way to go. Googling shows that this particluar article has been widely and favorably cited on other websites, so readers of Wikipedia besides those arguing here for keeping it have apparently found it useful.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I see no properly appropriate reasons for the deletion of this article. Firstly, it's well-referenced , most of mentioned-deaths are based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Secondly these deaths totally deserve <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, for example <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Wilhelm_Richmann_e918.html" title="Georg Wilhelm Richmann">Georg Wilhelm Richmann</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>, whose have particular section about their deaths on their main articles . Thirdly, the conception of "unusual" is "not" assessed by the editors themselves, all the deaths they write in the article are,widely believed to be "unusual" by a significant group of people, which is indicated by a long list of references from different collected sources . Thus, it's not <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> nor <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">completely original research</a>. However, we should clean up a bit, remove several "not very notably unsual" and "lack-of-referenced" ones instead of deleting the whole article. <b><a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppleworm_070b.html" title="User:Appleworm"><font color="red">Apple</font></a><a href="../../../a/p/p/User_talk%7EAppleworm_94df.html" title="User talk:Appleworm"><i><font color="green">•<big><sub>•w•</sub></big>•o•<big><sub>•r•</sub></big>•m•<big><sub>•</sub></big></font></i></a></b> 17:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is an interesting list, and I've read this one before, but I can't disagree with the nominator on this one. Articles with subjective words in the title like "Unusual" unfortunately have subjective inclusion criteria, and pretty much by their nature POV. It does amount to a source of trivial information, and doesn't have any real inherent notability, either. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The ambiguous nature of the list makes it OR/POV pretty much by default.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The only real problem with this article is the criteria for unusualness, which (like inclusion of items in hundreds or thousands of other list articles) is handled adequately by editorial consensus. A consensus of editors applying common sense does not equal <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in the sense meant by the policy. (If it does, most of those list articles should be nominated as well.) Other than the inclusion criteria, the article is reasonably good in that it requires the subjects to be notable persons (including people famous for the specific manner of their death) with existing articles about them, and requires attribution of the facts involved. Alternatively, if the article is not deemed worth of keeping in article space (although reading this discussion I see no consensus for deletion), it could be moved to project space <i>à la</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_unusual_articles_5196.html" title="Wikipedia:List of unusual articles">Wikipedia:List of unusual articles</a>. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 20:36, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>This is a weak argument. Name one other list where "editorial consensus" on someething as subjective as "unusualness" preceeds inclusion of an item. Remember, "common sense" is <i>not</i> as common as you think. What if all the editors were from Japan, and a notable person died of a heart attack? Or there was a famous Maori who died of infection from female circumsicion? Or if someone from Latin America died from an accident related to <i>Susto</i>, a psychological disorder primarily seen in Latin America? North American editors would definately agree that it would be unusual, because it's unusual to them.</li>
