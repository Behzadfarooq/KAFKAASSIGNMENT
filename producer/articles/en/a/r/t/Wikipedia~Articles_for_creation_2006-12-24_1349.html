<p>Ali Murhudu (full name Qalli Bix Immurnihdu) was the commander of an elite division of the Turkish Army invading <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> during the Great Siege. He personally killed over 400 soldiers whilst he was fighting in Malta. He was captured by the Maltese Militia during the attack at Fort St.Elmo and imprisoned in the Corradinio Prison. He allegedly escaped by hypnotizing the guards (making them fall asleep) and somehow manage to make a dog bring him the keys (this part is a legend). He then ran all the way from Corradinio to Mosta. Whilst in Mosta he single-handedly defeated the entire group of Maltese Militia stationed at Fort L-Gharbi. He spent about 5 days fighting in Mosta, after which he then ran to the seaside town of San Giljan and sent a message with a Turkish spy who was stationed there to Fort St.Elmo (which by now was under Turkish rule) informing the Turkish army that he had managed to escape and was on his way there. The Turks rejoiced at this news, it was a great morale booster and they had the courage to take on Fort Xriha (opposite Fort St.Elmo) and after 2 days, Fort Xriha was conquered by the Turks. After about three weeks on his own, Ali decided he had devastated the central part of Malta long enough so he (allegedly) made his way to Birgu (capital city of Malta at the time) by hiding in the back of a cart that was transporting pig carcasses. Once in Birgu, he swam across the Bormla canal to Fort Xriha and was re-united with his unit. Ali Murhudu was killed three months later during a training exercise when he was jogging on the Fort Xriha bastions, tripped on a loose rock and fell to his death. Although hardly mentioned, Ali Murhudu was one of the most important soldiers in the Turkish army during the time of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Siege_of_Malta_69ca.html" title="Great Siege of Malta">Great Siege of Malta</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-24_1349.html" title="Edit section: Tim Jordan, II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tim Jordan, II</span></h2>
<p>Like many other great musicians, Jordan's flame was extinguished too early. On December 13, 2005, Timothy Anderson Jordan, II, took his own life <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/14852" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.punknews.org/article/14852" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. To many he was the life of the party or the charismatic guitarist at the show, but to his friends and family he was a hero and a brother.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Early Life</b></p>
<p><br />
Tim grew up in the small farming community of Camden, AR. His father, Tim, Sr. was a contractor. Tim was always encouraged by his dad to pursue the family business or sports, mainly basketball. Tim was a successful high school basketball player and had a promising future. However, along the way music found his spirit.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Altar Ego</b></p>
<p>While in college at Ouachita Baptist University, Tim met Jarred Smith and Aaron Lunsford (now of As Cities Burn). The three had an instant music connection and formed Altar Ego, a pop-punk Christian outfit. However, tensions arose between Smith and Tim, and Tim exited the band as they were cutting their first demo. A few of the songs did feature Tim on guitar.</p>
<p><br />
<b>School or No School</b></p>
<p>After the split from Altar Ego and Ouachita Baptist University, Tim found himself at a neighboring university. While there, Tim began to find himself as a musician. Not feeling like school was for him, Tim withdrew and sought refuge at home working for his dad. With pressure from his mom, Tim found himself in school once again at a local community college. This would be Tim's 2nd completed semester at school (the first being from OBU). However, at the end of the spring 2001 semester Tim left this college and enrolled at a local tech school to pursue the family business. This would be his fourth school in two years. He had given up on music as a career.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Higgins Switch</b></p>
<p>In the summer of 2001, Tim attended a church camp for high school and junior high school kids as a worship leader in one of the smaller groups. While there he would meet his next opportunity for musical success. One night while walking into the main conference area, Tim noticed a guy with vampire red hair. Tim being the charismatic person that he is approached the red headed guy and asked what the deal was. His answer was that he was in a band. This intrigued Tim and he had to know more. The two spent the whole night discussing life, music, spirituality, and the possibility of Tim auditioning as second guitarist for the band. Two weeks later Tim found himself in the small Eastern Arkansas town of Wynne in a mini-storage unit auditioning for a band called Plumbline 34. Soon after Tim found himself packing a few of his belongings and moving to Wynne to live with bassist Allen Winkler, the one that had convinced him to tryout for PL34. The band was made up of vocalist Brad Branham, guitarist Eric Wade, bassist Allen, and drummer Matt Hagler.</p>
<p>With a new member and a new sound came a new name. While returning home from tour one night, the band was stopped by railroad crossing arms with no train on the tracks. A Chinese fire drill ensued. However, vocalist Brad stayed in the car to meditate on possible name changes. He opened his eyes and saw a sign, literally. Higgins Switch was born.</p>
<p>The band continued to play locally and regionally seeing mild success. Moreover, it was apparent to everyone that their live show was worth seeing with their coordinated jumps, crazy guitar throws, dynamic dancing, and spitting on the members of the band, all mainly influenced by Tim. However, in the fall of 2002, just one year after becoming Higgins Switch, the band called it quits to pursue school and private lives.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Green Olive Tree</b></p>
<p>After the split of Higgins Switch, Tim sought out one of the most talented bands in the area, Green Olive Tree. Co-founding guitarist John Dodson had just left the band. Tim saw this as an opportunity to join an already established band. He was right. For the next year, Green Olive Tree toured the country and gained the respect of many national acts on Tooth and Nail Records and The Militia Group. At the time the band roster was Chris Latimer – vocals/guitar, Andy Greenfield – bass/vocals, Tim Jordan – guitar/vocals, and a revolving door of drummers, including former Evanescence drummer Matt Outlaw (now of India). However, after a year of constant touring and seeing little commercial success, Latimer broke up Green Olive Tree.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Welton and Number One Fan, etc.</b></p>
<p>With two of his former bands gone, Tim once again found himself a man without a country or a band for that matter. However, due to the connections he made while with Green Olive Tree, Tim was able to find a place with the Fort Smith, AR outfit Welton. A four piece rock/emo group signed to Snapdragon Records. The group was again another well established group. Snapdragon released one Welton Ep that was split with the band The Response. Such songs as “Typecast Letters” were included on the EP. But like Tim’s previous projects, Welton soon ended.</p>
<p>For the first time in his career, Tim’s phone was ringing with offers. He accepted a gig with a mildly well-known group called Number One Fan as their touring keyboardist. This gig allowed Tim to showcase his other talents besides just playing guitar. After finishing several tours with NOF, Tim parted ways in pursuit of something more permanent.</p>
<p>During both the Welton and NOF projects Tim always managed to find time for friends, family, and other endeavors like India (Chris Latimer of Green Olive Tree’s current project).</p>
<p><br />
<b>All-American Rejects</b></p>
<p>What he found was the biggest career move he would pursue yet. Through the connections he made via his other projects, Tim was invited to audition for the widely known All-American Rejects as their touring keyboardist. This would enable him to meet great musicians, industry professionals, and play on David Letterman all of which he achieved in under a year. At the end of the 2005 Van’s Warped Tour, Tim left AAR to join the up and coming Mississippi band Jonezetta.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Jonezetta</b></p>
<p>Tim met Jonezetta through his best friend Aaron Lunsford of As Cities Burn. Tim and Lunsford were former band mates from the early Altar Ego days. Tim met ACB while playing with Welton. He stayed friends with both them and Lunsford and even convinced ACB to audition Lunsford when original drummer Bryan Dixon exited the band.</p>
<p>Tim officially joined Jonezetta as the fifth member of the band in the summer of 2005. The band moved from Mississippi to his private, secluded lake house in East Camden to finish the debut album for Tooth and Nail Records. On December 13, 2005 at the age of 24 Tim took his own life.</p>
<p>On December 22, 2006, in Little Rock, AR at Juanita’s Cantina As Cities Burn, Jonezetta, India, and The Evidence all paid tribute to Tim. All the profits went to a suicide prevention organization. Tim’s memory will always live on in the hearts of the people who love him.</p>

<p>62.37.130.202 10:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC) Roy Newell, American abstract painter, was born in Manhattan Lower East side on May, 10th 1914 and died on November, 22th 2006 in New York. His paintings show great coloured rectangles in agreeable chromatic harmony. He took part in the Group of American Abstract Expressionists and was also a founding member of 8th Street Artist Club, which also included de Kooning, Aeshile Gorky, Franz Kline and Philip Pavia.</p>
<p>He was not a very prolific painter. The number of his works is less than 100, because he constantly repainted the coloured areas with new colours, until he was satisfied with the result, which seldom happened. For this same reason, he sold very few of his paintings. However, his works are part of the collections of important museums: the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Seymour Hacker, the New York University Art Collection, the de Kooning Estate and Edvard Leiber among others.</p>
<p>Due to his particular way of life, he never got involved in the promotion of his art neither got much economical benefit from it.</p>

<p>Markus N. aka Dj-Arcane - born in Soldau (Poland) - was fascinated with the techno culture. At age of 5 he moved to Germany with his parents and his brother. At the beginning it was very hard to understand anyone, but after a short time he found some close friends. They were very keen on Hip Hop music. Markus liked it as well. But some time later he found out that Hip Hop culture is not enough for him. He discovered techno.Everything started with famous Thunderdome series. Rave Base and other Techno Cds came along. Some time later he discovered "Schranz" and found out that the search for "the music of his life" is over. He bought a turntable set and started to mix. 2 years later Markus published his first mix: "Schranzbox". It appeared to be one of the most spectacular schranz sets to date. Great marks made him practice even more.Markus has made many connections with some of the biggest Schranz djs in the world. Many people around the World recognize him as one of the hardest track spinners todate! Dj Arcane has invented his own style to show people what techno is really about.</p>

<b><a href="http://www.babylon-x.com" class="external text" title="http://www.babylon-x.com" rel="nofollow">Babylon-X.com</a></b> was the first sex-relatet website to become world famous. This was due mainly to that it had explicit footage of Princess Diana, and that it was the most advertised sex-site in the mid and later 1990's. Babylon-X prides itself by being one of the oldest sex-sites on the web today.</p>

<p>Bobby Daniels is a famous musician that resides in Wallington. He is sometimes known to be spotted "straight edging" around the back of the Esso garage on the high street, but this could not be proven. He is more metal than most people and enjoys a good blast of Slayer's "Seasons In The Abyss" and a glass of milk.</p>

Crellow Chutneys, Relishes and Condiments is a small UK based company, situated in a small kitchen in Cornwall. It produces many different products, ranging from a normal chutney to a lovely fruit cheese. Crellow works from a house and does not sell at the HQ but sells to retailers across the South West of England.</p>
<p><b>A bit about the makers.</b> Michael is a retired farmer who has been blind since his 21st birthday, he is the one who thought about this to start with, using vegtables from his large patch. Deborah, his loyal wife is in charge of th "PR" department, organises retailers and the accounts, having been the farm accountent on Michael's old farm.</p>
<p><b>The Name</b></p>
<p>The Name of the business was a long time on coming, at first when producing for 1 small cheese shop it was not officaly a company and was lablled as "Micheal's Chutney". When the business grew it became "Slow" but as "Slow International" was large export agency, it threatned a law suit so we had to think of a new name and that was "Crellow" named after a small estate in the rural depths of Cornwall.</p>

<p>ARSAMES is a thrash death metal band from Iran (Mashhad) , formed in 2002 by frontman Ali Madarshahi (the drummer) and Hamid Yousefi ( the guitar player) who were the oldest metal fans in Iran.</p>
<p>Arsames really began to develop it’s true potential with a new talented musician Ali Sanaie (the fastest bass player in Iran!!)</p>
<p>We started creating and writing songs and practicing them at the same time.</p>
<p>The members of the band at that time were:</p>
<p>1-Ali Madar Shahi (drums)</p>
<p>2-Hamid Yousefi (guitars)</p>
<p>3- Ali Sanaei (bass)</p>
<p>But the necessity of another guitar player to enrich the melodies in our songs was obvious. so again another talented musician the Great quitar Player and our Best friend Ali Azhari joined ARSAMES and he filled the empty space in our songs beautifully.</p>
<p>Right now, we have some pieces of music that we are eager to release as an album.We want to dedicate the album to all Iranian metal fans and to show our friends in the other countries that Iran is a great country with lots of talent and potentional.</p>
<p>We are determined to prove that this kind of music is beyond the borders and are not designated to any geographical region in the world (especially the western countries) in contrast; Eastern music with its heavenly melodies can modify thrash death metal music to one of the best pieces of music in history.</p>
<p>We are a thrash death metal band that respects social policies of its society</p>
<p>we just want to make music!!</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Early Critical Mass</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Formed in the early 70's in Miami, Florida, <b>Critical Mass</b> brandishes their version of melodic power pop from roots in The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The Stranglers to The Beatles and Cheap Trick. The band's first self produced demo, a two song 45 of <i>"Silver Screen"</i> backed with <i>"No One Left To Blame"</i> released in 1978, has become a sought after example of Florida's first punk band. Underground punk aficionados craving rare unheard late 70's punk rock can find copies on eBay commanding hundreds of dollars. Ryan Richardson of BreakMyFace.com calls it a swamplands gem". Since its inception Critical Mass developed a reputation as the band to see as well as hear. Band founder and singer songwriter <b>Mick Fazz</b> became famous for not only rocking crowds with eclectic mixes of strong original material but also performances of tunes by “The Sex Pistols“, “The Stranglers“, and “Jethro Tull“, material considered very unconventional for bar bands of the day. Fazz also became famous for his captivating on stage persona and in crowd antics including being chased by the nightclubs chef with a meat cleaver as he ran through the audience with a T-Bone hanging from his mouth. After a couple of years of self promoted concerts, gigs at local Big Daddy's night clubs and sending out tapes by the dozens interest soon followed.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Mass showcases at Tramps NYC</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The band began playing showcases for major record labels like Capitol, RCA, RSO and MCA. These showcases included a gig at <i>Tramp's</i> in New York City arranged by legendary Beatles promoter <b>Sid Bernstein</b>. This showcase led to a debut album deal with a five album option on MCA records. Recording began at Chris Squire's Studio in England in the fall of ’79 with production by Onward US, a company jointly owned by radio mover and shaker <b>Lee Abrams</b> and Yes bassist <b>Chris Squire</b>.That album, ”It's What's Inside That Counts“, layered Mick Fazz's melodic vocals and the dual-guitar assault of Mick Fazz and Dave Owen for a classic power pop, or what might then have been considered New Wave-ish, sound with a hard rock edge and pop songwriting components.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">"It's What's Inside That Counts" on MCA</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The album was released on the MCA label Oct 3, 1980. The group spent the rest of that year and much of 1981 touring. Critical Mass then changed its band line up as guitarist Dave Owen and drummer Mike Barone left the band, with bassist Henry LaPlume staying on board. Added to the line up were Frank Prinzel and Tom Vasquez respectively. Prinzel having been a previous member and part of the 1978 two song 45 quartet which had included Tom McWilliams on drums and Al Schwartz on bass.</p>
<p>This iteration of Critical Mass did some touring and headed into Criteria Studios to begin recording material for a follow up album to <i><b>“It's What's Outside That Counts“</b></i> .</p>

<p>Critical Mass was paired with the sibling production and engineering team of <b>Ron</b> and <b>Howard Albert</b>. Atlantic and Polydor records had expressed interest in the band but the music scene was changing and the hard edge of punk and new wave was succumbing to the more processed sound of hair bands and Sade. The band produced some respectable offerings but alas, the “industry” wasn't biting.</p>
<p>Over the years the Critical Mass line up has varied widely with the one consistent ingredient being the creative mastermind Mick Fazz. Now based in the Orlando, Florida area, "The Mass" has been gigging and recording off and on for years. Mick Fazz had partnered with local radio personality Mark Samansky on several projects and in addition, stepped out with an innovative project called <i>“The Basements”</i> , a musical trio consisting of only a drummer (Phil Fleetwood) and two bassist's one being commanded by Fazz who handled the vocals as well.</p>

<p>The Critical Mass lineup as of January 2007 features Frank Patterson on Bass. Frank has been playing in the Central Florida area for about 20 years. The bulk of that time as a guitarist and bassist for Jill Towers &amp; Heat. One of the most popular bands in Central Florida during the 80s and 90s. The drummer for The Mass is Phil Fleetwood, who's background includes The Generators, a band that recorded 3 albums and was featured on the nationally released Breakout USA CD. Issued by The Westwood One Radio Network, the project featured the top 15 unsigned bands in the country in 1991.</p>
<p>After a quarter century Mick and the Mass are releasing another self produced offering entitled, <i><b>“It’s What Counts That’s Inside“</b></i> . The project is a result of a partnering of Mick and former Mass alum Frank Prinzel. Using the resources of the Internet as a vehicle to once again present Critical Mass’ music to the world, "It’s What Counts That’s Inside" serves up more of that hard rock edge and pop songwriting style in a scorching, head banging, moshing, frenzy.</p>

<p>Lambda Iota Society, the oldest local student society in the nation, stands as a notable part of Burlington's and UVM's history.</p>
<p>The Lambda Iota Society was formed in 1836, at the University of Vermont, by a group of 13 students in protest of a campus ban on smoking. Members were Byron-esque poets and fledgling writers. It is the oldest local fraternity in the nation. They are also known by the name the "Owls".</p>

We could dump the 'Mission' and 'Corporate Outcomes' sections - that would get rid of the worst of the problem - but there isn't much left after that. An article with a detailed history section (when &amp; where was it founded and by whom - how did it evolve into what it is today), some information on staffing levels and equipment, what vehicles they use, how many fire stations and where they are - and some photos of nice shiney red fire engines would be really great though. Is it worth creating this as a two sentence + infobox stub? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</i>.<br />
