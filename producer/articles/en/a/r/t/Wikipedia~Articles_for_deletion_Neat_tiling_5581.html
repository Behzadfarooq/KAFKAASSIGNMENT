<li><b>Comment</b>: see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Interlocking_puzzle_c468.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle</a> for a detailed comment on why the original VfD proposal was not well made. The example of <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Burr_puzzle_4f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle</a> should have served as a caution that you overreached your mandate.<br />
<br />
To recap what I wrote on your talk page, suppose there are three types of articles:
<ol>
<li>My Stupid Book (mystery novel), a spam page</li>
<li>unsolved mystery novel</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_novel.html" title="Mystery novel">mystery novel</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>then pages of type 1 above are obvious VfDs, pages of type 3 are not (generic term), while pages of type 2 are debatable: is "unsolved mystery novel" a generic term and subcategory of "mystery novel", or is it a neologism coined by the user? The point is, that's precisely the sort of thing a VfD is supposed to sort out: people research it and Google it and present their conclusions in a VfD vote. The current article in question <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neat_tiling.html" title="Neat tiling">Neat tiling</a> seems to be of type 2 above: is it a neologism invented by Karl Scherer, or is it a generic term in general use among the puzzle-solving community? Such a VfD debate can now take place at last, on this page.<br />
<br />
However, you presented your original Vfd in a careless way, or perhaps even a deceptive way if you had done it deliberately: you listed only pages of type 1 above in the VfD itself and buried the pages of type 2 and type 3 within a very long listing (200 articles!) on a completely separate page (never mentioning them on the VfD page itself) that most voters probably never looked at. It was just flat out wrong to lump pages of entirely different categories into one humungous VfD whose presentation incorrectly implied that all the pages to be deleted were of type 1 above (obvious deletion candidates).<br />
<br />
This was a procedural error in the original VfD —it is questionable whether a page was duly deleted if it was never even mentioned on any VfD page. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:20, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You would have claimed a mandate to delete <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">Burr puzzle</a> too... you only failed to do so because you accidentally didn't notice it the first time around.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. When I click on your '"neat tiling" minus Wikipedia' link above, I get 61 results, not 35. Nevertheless, it is possible that you may have a point that this could be largely a neologism proposed by Karl Scherer. Perhaps other more neutral eyes could judge this. When I did a Google search I didn't do the "minus Wikipedia" refinement. I believe you are wrong in the other cases, however (the ones that are the subject of the other VfD). -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:36, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Google Is Not Science (tm), nor should it be the centre of VfD. 35/61 - either way, less than 100 is 'not much internet presence'/'usually has different name'.

<ul>
<li>Curps, I read the VfD, and I think you're mistaken -- Neat tiling clearly appears on the list attached to the VfD, which was discussed at the time. Even if you are correct, though, the right thing to do would have been to list Neat Tiling on VfU and discuss the procedural flaws there. Instead, now we're caught in a twisty little maze of procedural violations, all different. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes it was, everyone was pointed to the category in the 3rd of the 3 opening paragraphs, the issue of whether all the items in the category counted as well as those in listed in the list that was "includes <b>but isnt limited to</b>" was discussed <i>at length</i> in the VFD itself, and the result was delete ALL. And it didn't go through WP:VFU so re-creating it is an abuse of process, and it should be speedy re-deleted. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 15:48, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nandesuka, appearing "on the list attached to the VfD" (actually, an entirely separate page) is not the same as actually appearing at the top of the VfD page itself. Many voters undoubtedly never even looked at that page, and took their cue from the writeup at the top of the VfD page itself, which, intentionally or not, only listed egregious spam pages and failed to explicitly mention pages like <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neat_tiling.html" title="Neat tiling">neat tiling</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_puzzle.html" title="Lock puzzle">lock puzzle</a>, etc. This was procedurally flawed: the process was biased in a way to delete pages that in many cases would have survived their own individual VfD (as <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Burr_puzzle_4f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle</a> and the ongoing <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Interlocking_puzzle_c468.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle</a> show). So as I've said I don't believe the original VfD validly applied to this page. But fair enough, to avoid procedural snafus I'll use VfU for such cases in the future. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because the article contains totally original research - it is called "continuous tesselation" because it is "continuous" and a "tesselation", in the same way that a "red cow" is called that because it is "red" and a "cow", but that doesn't warrent the article [[red cow]] existing. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You can't assert something has been made up on the spot, and has a 'correct mathematical term', that's patent nonsense. To continue your daft analogy, if you were to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cow_with_calf.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cow_with_calf.jpg" rel="nofollow">one of these</a> and go round telling people the 'correct biological term' is <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_cow.html" title="Red cow">red cow</a>, they'd all think you'd been having too much 'energy' drink. There might be correct names for things that <a href="../../../u/n/u/Ununhexium.html" title="Ununhexium">don't exist</a>, but there certainly aren't correct names for things that haven't been thought of. But seeing as people have been tessellating for thousands of years, I doubt very much whether this definition was first used by a C20 puzzler. Ask for deletion on grounds of notability by all means, but strike 'original research' and your speculation over the naming because you're misrepresenting the case. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 01:26, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's the artificial classification that is made up. In the same way that classifying cows by colour was made up on the spot. Ununhexium is just latin for 116, it's not a name, its a placeholding definition, and the correct biological term for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cow_with_calf.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cow_with_calf.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> is more likely to be <i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Bos.html" title="Bos">bos</a> rufus</i> [although it isn't that either]. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 09:37, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and move to <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge-to-edge_tiling.html" title="Edge-to-edge tiling">edge-to-edge tiling</a> or merge into <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tessellation.html" title="Tessellation">tessellation</a>. Grünbaum and Shephard, <i>Tilings and Patterns,</i> W.H. Freeman and Company, 1987, which I consider the most authorative references on the mathematical theory of tilings, defines <i>edge-to-edge tilings</i> on page 18. This addresses Ril's concern that <i>neat tiling</i> is a neologism. I don't care that much about the other concern, that it was undeleted improperly: our goal is to write an encyclopeadia. I could not find <i>neat tiling</i> nor <i>continuous tessellation</i> in either MathSciNet or the book, so I'm curious where Ril got this term from. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:35, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sometimes different groups use different jargon for the same thing. What most of the world calls GMT or <a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>, the US military calls "<a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu_time.html" title="Zulu time">Zulu time</a>". It's possible that puzzle hobbyists use a different term than mathematicians, which could be solved by using redirects. "Edge-to-edge tiling" gets about 60 Google hits (none with "Scherer" or "Wikipedia" in them. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 15:23, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> -- The concept may deserve insertion into <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tessellation.html" title="Tessellation">tessellation</a>, but I doubt very much that the name is used by anyone other than the original poster.

<li><b>Delete</b> for two reasons. Firstly, it was deleted in accordance with a vote on VfD. I'm as unhappy about the mass listing on VfD as other people are, but since it's clear that there's no clear consensus, we should follow policy and take it to VfU first. (In fact, it would be nice if some admin (<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a>?) could go through <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_list_f54f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games/list">Ril's list from the mass deletion</a>—I'd like to acknowledge -Ril- for making the list available, since it's been helpful in the ensuing discussion—and look for other articles which aren't the Zillions spam they were accused of being, to list on VfU.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the article is no more than a definition and consensus seems to be that the most standard terminology is not <i>neat tilings</i> but <i>edge-to-edge tilings</i> for which we have a standard reference (Grünbaum and Shephard). (By consensus I mean both <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a>, above, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Myers_adb9.html" title="User:Joseph Myers">Joseph Myers</a> in <a href="../../../t/i/l/Talk%7ETiling_17f7.html#Terminology" title="Talk:Tiling">Talk:Tiling#Terminology</a>.) It doesn't seem that we'd lose a great deal by deleting the article. When we have an article on <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge-to-edge_tiling.html" title="Edge-to-edge tiling">edge-to-edge tilings</a>, then we can put in a redirect—because I'm sure I <i>have</i> seen the term <i>neat tilings</i> in a recreational mathematics book, and besides, redirects are cheap. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 11:25, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with rename/merge option, as per <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a>, and request that he includes his citation (with cleanup ideally!&#160;:) in the article in preparation for the event. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 16:30, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jitse.
