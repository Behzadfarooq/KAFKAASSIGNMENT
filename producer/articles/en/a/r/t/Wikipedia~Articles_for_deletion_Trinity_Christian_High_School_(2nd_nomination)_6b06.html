<p>Look I am sorry but this School is not notable, plain and simple. Just because it is a school does not make it notable. A google search for this School, gets a low return. What is returned is a list of multiple different schools by this name. Yes, it is a school, unfortunately this does not make it notable. I informed people on both sides of the last AFD. Colleges have been deleted off of Wikipedia for lack of notability. Simply put this school does not need an article. So I say:</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Due to the recent changes, I have changed my vote. I would like to see a little more concrete info on the school but this article has changed from a stub with a logo into a real article almost overnight.

<li><b>NOTE:</b> This has to be one of the more staggering examples of bad faith I've seen on Wikipedia. The previous AfD ended in one of the more resounding keep votes I've seen for a school, yet here we are again with an attempt to get rid of it.

<dd><b>note</b> - first off, I was simply informing them even five people is not stacking the vote, is it stacking the vote to inform people that their is an election? no I did not inform all of those that voted to keep for they already made themselves known by removing the template. (though I did inform most) Also during the last vote, as I stated before the overwhelming reason for keeping it was because it had not had a lot of time to grow, a year is plenty. Yes there are verifiable links but that does not make it notable. Also, the fact that I am doing this has [nothing to do with my leanings one way or the other. I attended a non-notable highschool, it is not listed on wikipedia it does have verifiable sources though. I am so sorry if it seems that I was attempting to stack the vote. I simply was informing people that it was up for vote.--<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 02:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> The statement by the nominator that "Hello I know that you patrol non-notable articles and I thought I would bring this article your attention this article is up for deletion again and you can vote on it at the following page:" was aimed at individuals with track records of deleting such schools. I didn't see any efforts aimed at identifying any individuals who might differ from your opinion or might endeavor to improve the article in question. As stated at <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECanvassing_8b86.html" title="WP:Canvassing">WP:Canvassing</a>, <b>"disruptive canvassing, even if it seems to be within guidelines below, is never acceptable."</b> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> How is that disruptive? Votestacking is sending out "mass" messages. <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a> specifically states that notifying a small handful of editors who share your tastes and philosophies on a topic is permissible as Friendly Notice. I've weighed in on several school AfD's, but the editor I mentioned above has never contacted me about one (which incidentally neither surprises nor distresses me). I'm sorry, I understand (and respect) that you are passionate about this subject matter, but we all still need to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not attempt to chill those with different opinions by inaccurately accusing them of violating policy. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 03:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>ok look</b>- i knew that he or she (i am not sure which) knows a lot about the standards (i do not). I argued against that person when I came accross them many times. I did not tell them to vote against this article. they have voted for things to stay in some cases. I simply informed them because I do not know all the standards, besides they deal with Colleges not schools as a standard so they do not directly relate to this article. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 03:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>also</b> - i informed people on both sides of the argument, those for it help by adding to the article so it is better. I only am looking for this article to either be something of value or non-existent, either works for me. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 03:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The nominator has made efforts to cover the damage, but it's clear that the initial attempts at votestacking, all of which used the greeting <b>"Hello I know that you patrol non-notable articles"</b>, were aimed squarely at deletionists. Those notified after the canvassing issue was raised here received an abridged message that avoided the rather explicit push for deletion. That such votestacking occurs on both sides is a great reason to report both individuals, not to ignore it here. The attempts to trivialize this are quaint, but do nothing to address the core of the efforts to encourage individuals to vote in one direction. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECanvassing_8b86.html" title="WP:Canvassing">the policy</a>? Unless you can cite to "mass" contacts in this regard, your allegations continue to be off base and unfair. Until then, the only person who might be reportable here is <i>you</i>, for attempting to silence opposing views and/or alter the tallying of votes here by hurling false allegations at somebody you don't agree with. You even manage to criticize the editor for taking your advice and contacting people on the other side of the issue. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 03:38, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The nominator has covered his tracks as I see it, by contacting other individuals after the violations was pointed out. As I have pointed out, the nominator changed the "push" wording for those less likely to be deletionists. Your threats are entirely baseless and idle. We'd all be better off if you would explain to the nominator the potential damage he has done, rather than trying to use threats. The facts speak for themselves, and the claim that these are "false allegations" is a knowing effort to ignore the evidence provided. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:55, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Now you're accusing <i>me</i> of violating policy? I didn't threaten you, I merely pointed out that you are incorrect and that if anybody here is violating policy, it is you. I know you have reviewed <a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a>'s contrib history, just like I have, and that you know there were only <i>five</i> talk page posts before you suggested that he contact people on the other side of the issue (which he then did). <i>Five</i> talk page posts is not votestacking per <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECanvassing_8b86.html" title="WP:Canvassing">WP:Canvassing</a>. The only "damage" MJHankel has done here is bring more people to the discussion who may disagree with your position. Nobody has done any <i>actual</i> damage here except you, as you have taken perfectly acceptable conduct from an established editor and couched it as something improper using only vague references to policy. Now poor <a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> is left feeling compelled to explain his conduct when it was completely compliant with WP policy. Well, this has been fun but we're too far off topic, and I think any further comment would be redundant as well. But, as always, I'll offer you the last word. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 04:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>please</b> Let me be as clear as I can. I was not attempting to do something wrong, I was not attempting to sway the vote, and I was not attempting to assert my opinion. I was informing (those that were few) about this Afd, so they would know (the others would follow), I was attempting to get results one way or another as fast as possible. I did later inform all for three reasons, a. I was intending to partially, earlier but had to get off the computer, b. I wanted results one way or another and I knew that informing both sides would allow the improvement of the article, c. I wanted to do exactly what you wanted me to do. I know very little policy, and that is the only reason I informed the other person of this they patrol article that lack notability and they know what to do (for or against). I am not mudslinging here. and I am sorry that I came accross as corrupt, I was only doing what I could. I am sorry that I have caused you distaste with me. I had no perrogitives in mind other than to get results. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 03:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While the wording is hard for me to understand, I will take you at your word that the initial attempts were not aimed at swaying the vote. I sincerely hope that your efforts to contact others caught had been planned in advance and not after pointed out here. If you do attempt to contact others about future AfDs, I strongly encourage you to avoid any wording that can be interpreted as encouraging votes exclusively in one direction. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:55, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Automatic notability of schools is not, as far as I am aware, policy or even an official guideline. It's just an argument that keeps getting trotted out, but it has never been formally agreed upon.

<li><b>Keep</b> - In addition to the overwhelming result of the previous AfD in favor of retention of this article, and the patently inappropriate votestacking going, on, there are ample sources demonstrating notability, several of which have been added to the article. If you're going to use a Google search as a justification to delete, try doing it without the words "(2nd nomination}" in the title.

<li><b>Keep.</b> <i>Any</i> currently open high school should be included in the Wikipedia. The article itself looks fine to me.

What then are <i>objective criteria</i> for inclusion or exclusion of a high school and why does a school with the <i>Christian</i> in its name have special scrutiny here? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 02:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

I am a Christian so that is a moot point. I simply started this discussion because the reasons to keep are a little week. After one year the article has grown ownly slightly. I have no problem with keeping this article if it had any real established notability. For goodness sake the attendence and faculty numbers are not even listed. This is easy stuff to find. My big problem is that the article itself has done nothing to save itself (it lacks the basic info for a school, it lacks much info at all). --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 02:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia's standard objective criteria for determining notability is showing that multiple non-trivial independent reliable sources have discussed the subject.

<dd>if the school is notable, then it should be kept (i see no other potential problems with the article). there is clearly much disagreement over what constitutes a school's being notable. in the absence of clear guidelines relating specifically to schools (as in many cases <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is very general and does not address the intricacies related to creating articles about schools), i find it justifiable to assert the school's notability based on its functioning existence, as, apparently, do a number of other editors. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 03:02, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no consensus that schools are or are not inherently notable, as evidenced by the many school AfDs closed with 'no consensus'. However, the state championships earned by this school's sports program appears to make it sufficiently notable for inclusion. Two more things: 1) I moved Lil Miss Lubbock from the school awards section to Notable Alums and Students as this is a personal award, not the school's, and 2) As I have noted above, informing a few people known to be interested in a subject area of a pending AfD is considered perfectly acceptable "Friendly Notice" pursuant to <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECanvassing_8b86.html" title="WP:Canvassing">WP:Canvassing</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> This school doesn't have the top Google hit for "Trinity Christian High School", and as the nominator says, there are many schools by this name, so it is unjust for this school to exclusively have this page on Wikipedia. The company that owns and controls this school and seemingly many other schools must at the very least have its own page on Wikipedia before one of its schools of little-to-no significance has a page. Being "well-referenced" is not a reason for a page; I could easily make a well-referenced page about myself with tons more detail than this school's page. Many high schools win state championships, and what this school has won is a very exclusive competition for Christian private schools, not a state championship. --Ndickson 03:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> The article makes explicit claims of notability for the school, in its winning a few dozen state championships, once all of the relevant article are added. That there are other high schools with a similar name is a great reason for disambiguating the title, but a spectacularly poor one for deletion.

<li>That's not what's at contention here, it's notability that is. What I see for assertions of notability are an award granted by a newspaper based in Lubbock Texas, quite a number of athletic achievements, and two students who have some claim to fame: a pro baseball player and a local beauty pageant winner. Maybe the sources of these are reliable and verifiable (which, by the way, I do not contend is what is at issue), but I still question the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the school. Not saying that it's not good (really, it is), but I'm not entirely convinced that this meets Wikipedia's notability standard. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 21:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A) For the most part, the article in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115967101" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115967101" rel="nofollow">current version</a> meets the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> policy by refraining from original research and using secondary resources. The only unsourced statement is that school opened in '79 but noone graduated until '91.</dd>
<dd>B) From the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline: <i>"Notable is defined as 'worthy of being noted' or 'attracting notice', but is not synonymous with 'fame' or 'importance'."</i> . The school attracted the notice of various newspapers when it won state athletic championships, and the article now references these news stories. The national level of fame or importance the school earned by winning these awards does not grant or remove notability as because notability <i>"is not measured by editorsâ€™ subjective judgment."</i></dd>
<dd>C) The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Wikipedia%7EPlaces_of_local_interest_4265.html" title="Wikipedia:Places of local interest">Wikipedia:Places of local interest</a> essay states that if a place is not notable to stand on its own, it should merge into its city article (<a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubbock%2C_Texas_5ed1.html" title="Lubbock, Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a> in this case). The resulting merge would cause an imbalance of information on Trinity Christian High compared to other schools in the education section.</dd>
<dd>Those reasons being said, the article was indeed unreferenced and stub-length at the time the deletion notice was posted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115912570" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity_Christian_High_School&amp;oldid=115912570" rel="nofollow">view that revision</a>), and would have qualified for merge or deletion. Schools should be held to the same notability requirements as other places unless a guideline or essay for schools is formed to state otherwise.

<li>Sorry, Dennisthe2, I don't understand the relevance of what you pointed out to what I said. And I hope you're not confusing "inherited" with "inherent" ("involved in the constitution or essential character of something&#160;: belonging by nature or habit"), both Librarianofages and I believe that all high schools are <i>inherently</i> notable.

<li>Surely, per <a href="../../../a/l/l/WP%7EALLORNOTHING_ed9c.html" title="WP:ALLORNOTHING">WP:ALLORNOTHING</a>, this cannot be the case. Many high school (secondary schools in the UK) are obviously notable, but many can easily be dealt with via a section in the entry for their locality. In the UK there are nearly 5,000 secondary schools - it is not credible that all can be notable. We would end up with a collection of stubs saying "School A is a secondary school in town B. It was founded in year C and has D pupils." <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 21:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm going to write a userspace essay on this soon (and I'll inform you on your talk page), but I would say that some reasons for notability would be (a) excellent performance, abhove and beyond what would be expected (b) alternatively, very poor performance involving the threat of closure, etc (c) some notoriety not related to education, which produces secondary sources (d) A long and easily notable history. (There are probably more). I don't think you can possibly create well-written WP articles on all high/secondary schools, without them merely being clones of each other.

<li>The school is not subject to A7 (and therefore not eligible for a speedy deletion), because they make an assertion of notability. Whether that assertion is up to standard...well, that's why we're here. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 16:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition to which, a school is not a "group of people" and therefore does not fall into this category in the first place. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>...well, you could <i>probably</i> pull <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but that's a stretch. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course a school is a group of people, what else would it be? So schools are in fact subject to A7. And having read this "article", I can find no assertion of notability in it. â€”<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 19:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The assertion is that they <i>say</i> it's notable and provide some references. There are plenty of admins who will tell you the same thing. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>An additional note, a school - an educational institution - is more a facility to <i>contain</i> a group of people (the students), and its faculty. Like I said, it's a stretch, but <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> would be closer to the truth for this purpose. The "group of people" would factor in if you were working with the student body. With no assertion whatsoever, A7 would work for sure (and I would have probably beat you to the punch =^_^= ), but with those links, it's going to be removed. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nothing they say asserts the school's notability, though. They only assert (and show with references) that the school exists. Thus the school is verifiable, but there's still no assertion of notability in the article itself. â€”<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is true, but the quandary we're in is that A7 expects that there is positively no assertion whatsoever - including references that don't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. If we have links, or something more than, say, a note from the author's mother saying it's notable, then the A7 falls out. At least, that's my experience. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A school is not a group of people. It is an institution in which people are educated. There is a big difference. That criterion is intended to cover things like random gangs or groups of friends, not institutions which have permanent buildings. These desperate attempts to extend A7 to anything you want it to cover are ridiculous. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:34, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
