<p>A webcomic, hosted on keenspace, found <a href="http://fractuslux.keenspace.com/" class="external text" title="http://fractuslux.keenspace.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This group is worldwide and is one of the most significant groups in the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy (game)</a> hobby, but by WP's standards it's just another online game-related group, and doesn't have Google or Alexa evidence of notability. If I used the arguments of some AfD voters, the <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> criterion "is of interest to a community" would garner this article my "Keep" vote. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good point, and that raises the question of whether the community is itself of note then, and deserving of an independent, encyclopedic article (which in this case I don't think is the case). <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 23:04, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The Diplomacy community definitely <i>is</i> notable and article-worthy. First play-by-mail historical game, first game hobby to spawn hundreds of fanzines published nationally and internationally, championships in nearly twenty nations, a long-established world championship convention (not just an online tourney calling itself "world championship"), organizations that provide real functions and not just chat forums, coverage in mainstream media, and so forth. Favorite game of Walter Cronkite, John F. Kennedy, and Henry Kissinger, although that might not be so notable a point. It's far more notable than most of the MMORPGs whose adherents think they should have their clans and forums and hacker-groups listed in WP. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Very interesting.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the ship were larger, perhaps it would be notable, but we're not even talking about a large oil tanker or cruise ship. It's only 96 feet long and has a total crew of 4 people, smaller and fewer than some fishing boats. The number of ships that of that size or larger over the last few centuries is enormous. Also, "Victoria Star 2" gets only about 30 unique, non-porn search results, many of which are spam sites. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>My "keep" votes aren't always to be interpreted as "keep as it is forever and don't ever try to merge it". If we had an article about the cruise company which owns the Victoria Star 2, I would be all for merging this ship and any other ship belonging to it in with that article since it provides more context. Information about a shipping companiy's ships is in my view relevant information which should be included in some form, preferably in the company article (which I don't think we have now). For now, I think the best thing is to let the article stay until we <i>do</i> get an article about the ship company. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:14, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> - This is an art site that has not been updated for a few years. It is a website. An article for <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Farley_c81d.html" title="Patrick Farley">Patrick Farley</a> already exists. Would an article on David Hockney's website be deleted? What about The Chapman Brothers official site? Yes, because, like this one they are none notable sites and would fair better as part of the artist's article. What about <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfrapp.html" title="Goldfrapp">Goldfrapp</a>, their website has been through several iterations and has been given an MTV award. I've read articles in music magazines talking about their website. But if I listed www.goldfrapp.co.uk on wikipedia, it would be deleted, stating that <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldfrapp.html" title="Goldfrapp">Goldfrapp</a> already exists. This is the same, but because it has been classed as a webcomic, the guidelines on websites becomes putty. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 12:52, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Answer. The electric sheep site is an Art site completely dedicated to the Art of web comics and it was last updated January 20th 2005. The fact that the last time a comic on it was updated was in 2003 does not make it less relevant. It is the repository of all of Farley's Web comics that were praised by Web and print sources, which you can check by googling Patrick Farley and electric sheep and by reading Scott McCloud's book and other publications. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 04:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Effort has been put into this article, that is true. But this webcomic, found <a href="http://www.raincannon.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.raincannon.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is just none notable, with an alexa rank of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.raincannon.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.raincannon.com/" rel="nofollow">over 2 million</a>. Alexa can be a red herring, but for a rank so low, it can be safe to say that this webcomic is not popular. A google search did not bring up anything which would make this website more notable than the others. Another note, is that the main contributor to the article is <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoellevand_51a1.html" title="User:Joellevand">User:Joellevand</a>, author of the comic. Also, check the newpost on the front page of their site, asking viewers to click on webcomic toplists. If this were notable, they wouldn't need it.

<li>Hello. I'm Stephen Frizzle, the creator of the word. I googled knunder earlier to see how it was doing, and 'lo and behold, it's been added on Wikipedia! I was also a bit shocked to see I had "new messages" telling me I'd be blocked from Wikipedia if I was to edit any more pages. What's <i>that</i> all about?! It mentioned something about sharing the same IP address as another user. The only suggestion I can say is the fact I'm using a college computer. It sickens me to think that somebody from the college is deliberately associating the word with acts of anarchy such as this.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, this bet I'm having is going pretty well, and I like to thank people for going on the site and (possibly) using the word occasionally. Perhaps one day, this article will exist, and it will tell the story about how I managed to force a word into the language. It'll be quite a story to tell in years to come. I'm going to ask politely if you would like to keep this "nonsense neologism" on Wikipedia. I know it won't help me in any way, shape or form, but it'll be proof that the word is being recognised. Proof that it is being used.<br />
I shall leave now, and await what the future of knunder looks like on this wiki. Thank you. -- <a href="http://knunder.tk" class="external text" title="http://knunder.tk" rel="nofollow">Friz</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. All the uses of the word "knunder" in print seem to be about the creation of the word "knunder" as a neologism; I don't see evidence that it is being used on its own as a regular word. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I'm putting a report together with all the emails I'm getting from people using the word across the country. From Primary Schools in Scotland to a workhouse in Australia. At my least count, over 5,000 people were using knunder (and that's just a guess from the facts I've collected through emails). -- <a href="http://knunder.tk" class="external text" title="http://knunder.tk" rel="nofollow">Friz</a></li>
<li>Hello, Pro-Knunderers and Anti-Knunderers! Wordsmith Friz here; just a short note to say that primary school teachers all over Britain are telling their young pupils to "put their chairs in the knunder". I'm warping a generation of 4-year-olds! Also, the word is going to be used- in context- by a few D C Thompson publications (such as <i>The Weekly News</i> and <i>The <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beano.html" title="Beano">Beano</a></i>). At my lastest count, there are now 30 ways to use the word knunder, either as a noun, verb, preposition or adverb, and there are over 6,000 people who know of the word, or are using the word. Watch this space! -- <a href="http://knunder.tk" class="external text" title="http://knunder.tk" rel="nofollow">Friz</a></li>

<li>Take out the non-neutral first-person content, and one is left with practically zero content, except for a vague indication that this is some form of cushion.

<p>My 11-year-old son added this page because he had just been given a Cushtie. He did not, repeat not, copy anything from any advertising blurb, he wrote it entirely himself. I accept that it may not be appropriate for Wikipedia (I am a fan) but please don't judge so harshly. He was attempting to reproduce the type of article he has seen in Wikepedia, he was unaware that Cushtie is not a "real" thing.

<p>The result of the debate was No consensus, several of the votes offered rewrite as an options which was done, so along with the 2 keep votes makes this stuck in the middle.

<li>I support the idea of a sequel trilogy. Originally, Lucas decided to stop making Star Wars films after <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. Contrary to what the media says, there is still a chance for a sequel trilogy. The sequel trilogy would star Ben Skywalker as an adult. It would take place about a decade after the Dark Nest trilogy. There can be up to three sequel trilogies. If there are to be 15 episodes total, Episode XV would take place in 203 ABY. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 08:52, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Contrary to what the media says, there is still a chance for a sequel trilogy.</i><br />
Unless and until someone adds some sort of proof of this claim to the article, it's unverified speculation. (Plus, given Lucas's track record, I think it's <i>exceedingly</i> unlikely he'd make a trilogy of movies based on EU canon.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 09:05, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The sequel trilogy does not necessarily have to be based on Expanded Universe canon. The earlier facts state that it would take place after all Expanded Universe canon, ranging from 40 ABY to 203 ABY. The Dark Nest trilogy, the latest in the Expanded Universe canon, takes place in 35-36 ABY. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 06:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would never believe that damn Supershadow for a second.

<li>You say "facts" twice, but the only source you have cited is a dubious secondary source that doesn't cite primary sources for this speculation, as far as I can tell.

<li>Wow, that's insanely obscure, but it looks like it's there. (Page 141 of the appendices PDF from the linked timeline page, for anyone who wants to check the timeline page). Well, in that case, the speculation/conjecture needs to be trimmed, primary sources need to be tracked down and cited, and this probably needs to be merged (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_speculation_29e1.html" title="Star Wars speculation">Star Wars speculation</a> seems like a logical merge target).

<li>Yeah, the guy who wrote that knows obscurity very well, as his timeline shows. I believe this page needs to be here to let everyone know that Lucas has in fact, based on his own former statements, planned to do such a trilogy, or triloggies at one point. Since he now denies he even considered such a thing, I thought it might be interesting to create a page using his own words against him. I don't knoiw if this would be considered speculation, except for the part about the name of Luke's son. This is more of construcing a basic storyline, based on Lucas' words. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 11:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The enitre purpose of the article is to give the reader a good idea of what he had in mind and let people know that he lies when he says he never even considered doing such a trilogy.

<li>The problem is that the only facts here (as opposed to conjecture) are that Lucas was planning to make some sequels (the number varying, depending on the source and the time he was interviewed), and that he broached the subject of having Mark Hamill play an "Obi-Wan-type character." Other than that, nothing is verifiable (and a chunk of it was borderline fanfic and copyvio, and has been removed), so there's no real verifiable claim about what such movies would have been like if they had existed.

<li>Here's basically what I want to do with this article: I want it to tell only the confirmed, verifyable facts first, in a section of its own. Then, based on these facts, I want to, along with help from others, construct the logical story based on these facts, noting that it isn't the actual story, just an approximation of what it would have been. The only time I will bring in the EU is when mentioning Luke's son, which I will use the name, "Ben," which has been established in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Jedi_Order_2a13.html" title="The New Jedi Order">The New Jedi Order</a>. I will have a section showing proof of other sequels he has had in mind, but don't need their own page to be mentioned. I will then have one mentioning what many fans have considered the sequel trilogy in their minds (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thrawn_Trilogy_2a95.html" title="The Thrawn Trilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a> for example). Finally, I will need to move the page, in order for its name to be consistant with the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_trilogy_%28Star_Wars%29_fa5c.html" title="Original trilogy (Star Wars)">original trilogy</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prequel_trilogy_%28Star_Wars%29_0cc7.html" title="Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)">prequel trilogy</a> articles. I hope this explains to you and everyone that votes and is involved with this issue what exactly I <i>plan</i> to do. The way it is in its current form isn't nearly what I had in mind. It was just a quick thing I created last night, without expanding it. If it survives deletion, though, I <i>will</i> expand it, becuase I strongly feel the subject is notable.
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry if you have serious plans on this one. "What he had in mind" is absolutely not a criteria for inclusion even if verifiable. Think about it. Every script that makes it to the talking stage of studio consideration could be included. Every plan or future desire of a notable person, subsequently scrapped, could be included. Every agreed upon role for an actor, declined at the last minute, could be included.</li>
<li>"Construct(ing) the logical story based on these facts, noting that it isn't the actual story, just an approximation of what it would have been" is absolutely a no go. I—and I'm sure not just I—would delete it in a second. It would actually constitute OR for one thing and the criticism about speculation would only be stronger. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't got time to disentangle all of this. I will say only this. I'm not much of a Star Wars fan. I saw the first movie, then entitled simply "Star Wars," in 1977 on its first run in Boston and walked out before the end because I was getting just too irritated with winged spacecraft developing lift forces in a vacuum. Anyway, I certainly read interviews at the time, and in fairly mainstream places, possibly Time Magazine?, explaining that it was actually the fourth in a projected series of nine films. I've recently wondered when the seventh, eighth, and ninth will be coming out. Apparently Lucas has now backpedalled on this. Information on <i>what has been said when</i> about this third trilogy is legitimate, and ought to be included <b>somewhere.</b> This is a legitimate <b>topic.</b> I can't speak to whether the information currently in the article is well-researched or not. The article cannot be a reconstruction by a Wikipedia editor of what the third trilogy might have been. However, if a series of well-sourced, verifiable quotations from Lucas and others can be put together in such a way that the reader can construct a plausible storyline for him- or herself, that would be IMHO perfectly legitimate. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's exactly what my goal is. And in response to another editors comments that every author's screenplay or failed production should be listed if this one is, well, that's not exactly so. The talk of a sequel trilogy to <i>Star Wars</i> has been around since the late 70's. The talk of such a thing happening really habven't ceased. <i>That</i> is what makes it notable, the fact that people have known and discussed it for so long. I suppose I couldn't construct the story, but maybe explain, based only on what he has said, what was going to happen in these movies. And, by the way, the man who created the star wars timeline I list as a source is certainly not dubiou, as one said. His timeline is over 1,000 pages, as seen in the PDF, and he has worked it constantly, since 1997. He is sort of a Star Wars historian. Things he has in the timeline, are likely to be true. Also, he happens to be a high school history teacher with a intense interest in chronology. So his project is a pretty trustworthy source. Now, I won't actually construct a story, as in a plot summary, like the movie articles do, just basically what were to happen. I hope to do it in a similar format to the articles for the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prequel_trilogy_%28Star_Wars%29_0cc7.html" title="Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)">prequel trilogy</a> and the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_trilogy_%28Star_Wars%29_fa5c.html" title="Original trilogy (Star Wars)">original trilogy</a> articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 19:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Excellent summary by Dpbsmith.

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>retitle</b>, maybe to Star Wars Third Trilogy or something a bit more useful. The fact Lucas planned a third trilogy is an historical fact dating back to around 1977-78 if not earlier, and considering the cultural significance of the Star Wars films, I think it's worthy of its own article. Any speculation regarding plot, etc. should be restricted to statements made by Lucas, though. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:19, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, by all means rename it if it needs renaming.

<ul>
<li>Looking at your example I don't see it as analogous given that it was an up and running project for two years. Granted, "It doesn't exist until it exists" is a touch didactic but it <i>does</i> have something to do with the validity of the topic: <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copland.html" title="Copland">Copland</a> "exists" as a scrapped project that reached a significant level of development, which is not the case here. "The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy was a film trilogy originally to be made by George Lucas" is arguably inaccurate. "The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy was a twinkle in the eye of George Lucas that fans really want to be made and really want to speculate about here on Wiki" has more truth. I can think of very few cases where we've opened the door to things that were never or are not now extant, and I think the bar should be high (i.e., <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a> makes sense). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>A sequel trilogy was not sprung from fan fantasies, Lucas said on multiple occasions to several sources in the late 70's abd early 80's that he had plans for such a trilogy. No, it will never be made. On numerous occasions he has firmly stated he will never do another trilogy after this prequel trilogy he just finished. I'm arguing that since he did at once confirm such plans, and people like Gary Kurts have claimed that he even saw outlines for the stories, it is farely notable to eb put on here. We can't forget Lucas' statements in the 1994 release of <a href="../../../s/p/l/Splinter_of_the_Mind%27s_Eye_f449.html" title="Splinter of the Mind's Eye">Splinter of the Mind's Eye</a> where he said "I reallized my story would take a total of nine films to tell." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 18:09, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Remember, the rule per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is to meet just one criterion out of the list, not all of them simultaneously. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:58, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
How is this page hurting anyone or irrelevant? It isn't a joke entry or offensive, it's just an unobtrusive bit of information about an actual band.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has many pages about non-professional websites, so why should a band be disqualified? I've regularly tried to find information on unsigned bands, that I've seen play, and it would have been useful if there were on Wikipedia. Surely the more information available to people the better.</p>

Since the film itself is of marginal notability (it is probably most notable for being a critical and commercial failure), its characters are certainly not notable enough for their own articles. I informed the author that he should do something about them (my suggestion, which I still recommend, condense to a paragraph each and add to the main article or one on Characters in the film Glitter or something similar).

<li>Don't delete. Either keep, merge to the movie article and redirect, or create a new article for all the characters together and merge them all there. For the other characters my personal preference is the last, but since Billie is the main character I might favor an outright keep here. I suppose there's a lot you could say about how Billie's story is semi-autobiographical, that kind of thing. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:07, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You could indeed. In addition to an article on <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>, you can and (to my mild surprise) do have a whole article on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Foster_Kane_1584.html" title="Charles Foster Kane">Charles Foster Kane</a> (a better title than the somewhat recursive Citizen Kane (character in Citizen Kane)). But there are reasons for this: people have said a lot about C F Kane, and it has often been claimed that Hearst's recognition of himself in Kane is what, via Louella Parsons, blighted Welles's career: no trivial matter if true. Anyway, <i>Citizen Kane</i> is in a different league from <i>Glitter</i> (which admittedly has a more comely star) and of much greater and more lasting interest. If people want to write at huge length about the real-world precursors (etc.) of the characters in humdrum Hollywood flops, they're entirely free to do so, on other websites. Nobody is begrudging <i>Glitter</i> an article, and WP is of course not paper -- but hard drive space isn't unlimited either. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

This article is the only one existing for an entity not directly affected by the Tsunami, and its singular existance skews the overall perspective of wikipedia too much in one small direction.

<li>From your declaring that Norway was directly hit by the tremors and/or the tsunami, and therefore it deserves <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Norway_3803.html" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">its own article</a>, it's pretty obvious that you're twisting some facts to fulfill your targeting on Hong Kong-related topics on Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 10:14, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

Once again, your <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> with regards to others' targeting on certain topics has played a bigger part then it should in your editorial judgement, hence again raising questions on your claimed "fairness" and "maturity" in wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Instantnood" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Instantnood" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. When I voted in this article, I did so on the simple reason that the earthquakes effect on HK is marginal at best compared to many other countries/territories without seeing a need to create a similar article. What is written for this article can easily be had in others. I did not notice the existance of an article for Norway until you pointed it out, which I found was an unfotunate occurance as I am afraid individuals (like yourself) would then take it as an excuse to create similar articles on every territory on earth no matter how small the effect actually is.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 10:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see. We have (yet another) instance of instantnood refusing to accept any responsiblity whatsoever in any contentious issues concerning wikipedia. All of a sudden, I am now being portrayed as a "troublemaker" who caused the above exchange single-handedly. Suddenly, instantnood's role dissapears completely from view. Do I need to clear my name? Hardly, because I dont attempt to shun responsiblity the way instantnood does, almost like its an inborn habit of his. I am more then willing to say that I felt ashamed that I was participating in this kind of low-level exhange in a page like this. If I hadent felt this sense of shame or guilt, I wont be asking him if he felt the same way. I call this exchange a soap opera, because it reads embarrasingly like one. Who is blaming who for "staging a soap opera", whatever that means? I suppose he dosent seem to feel any remorse based on his ceaseless attempts to be a real pain anywhere in wikipedia, even in a page like this? --<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>From this response, I could only conclude that either it confirms his chronic inability in accepting responsibility (he practically ignored what I just said and insisted he was still innocent), or he has some difficulty in comprehending the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>.

<li>I see. I remember this strategy before. When an article/category which instantnood wants to keep is nominated for deletion, he gets every other related article/category nominated too, in his bid to swing the votes around in his favour, even if other similar pages may be far more deserving to remain. This is becoming yet another example of instantnood's constant manipulation and gaming of wikipedia rules/mechanisms, and I do hope other wikipedians and admins may take note of this.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article or a category should be deleted, the same reasons would very likely be applicable to other similar articles or categories. How much similarities do the articles share, and whether such similarities merit the same or similar action, are to be decided by the community. Each wikipedian can make her/his own decision, don't think votes can be swung or manipulated. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> IMHO that nomination is very close to violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, wether or not other nations have seperate articles should have no impact on wether or not this article about Hong Kong should be kept. I'm actualy a little supriced Germany or Sweden (and others) doesn't have seperate articles, they lost a lot of people too and probably raised simmilar debate and critisism as we had in Norway about how to handle major disasters involving our citizens abroad. The lack of or exsistence off other articles should have no bearing on wether or not this should be kept or deleted. If it contains information beyond what is in other articles it shouold be kept, otherwise it should be deleted, simple as that. Deleting it just because Hong Kong was not directly hit is just as bad a reason as keeping it just because Norway have a simmilar article. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> 14:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Length of an article may or may not be relevant in deciding whether an article should be deleted. If the two articles share substantial similarities, and if the arguments mentioned in this page are readily applicable other similar articles, it would be better to assess them together. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Article length is an often-used criterion in deciding whether an article is deleted or not, and it is a relevant criterion in this instance, since its length does not justify its existance when its information could fit into other articles easily.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:58, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article has now been reorganised and expanded. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 19:32, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> on expanded article: The only significant expansion we can see in this article is the "Responses of the government and other organisations" section, which quite unfortunately is simply non-relevant to this article which talks about the <i>effect</i> it has on HK. The only other non-dorectly affected country article, <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Norway_3803.html" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway</a> makes no mention on relief efforts at all, as all these should be in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_5a2b.html" title="Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. As for the section on Impact, which should be the gist of the article, it again suffers from exagerated comments, not surprising since we have members here fighting to keep it around and make it appear "significant" enough. The reduction in travel to the region affects the entire global tourism industry, and there is nothing notably different in this text. The humanitarian response and show of emotional care is to be expected in any civilised society. Anyhow, saying "Thai and Indonesian culture is highly visible in Hong Kong" is itself debatable, besides the question of just what kind of and the extend of its impact it can have on HK itself. To sum up...what has actually been contributed to the article besides the obvious?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 19:51, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the comments. Agree the article needs further improvement. In fact some of your comments are also applicable to the Norway counterpart. Response are results of the effect. The Norway article talks about impact too. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:42, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Humanitarian efforts as a result of the "effect", if any, will have to directly addressed to the reader, or else no one is going to make this assumption. Does the degree of "effect" have on the amount of $$$ donated internationally? Please illustrate. The Norway article talks about impact, and rightfully yes it should, because this is mainly what an <i>effect</i> is all about. It does not, however, devote a sizeable chunk of its text on humanitarian responses thou, and there is no reason for it to.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 23:52, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>These were all recipes that have since been transwikied to the Cookbook at Wikibooks. At the moment they tell us absolutely nothing at all about the item in question except that it is what its name says it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lettuce soup</b> is a soup.</li>
<li><b>Minestrone alla Casalinga</b> is minestrone.</li>
<li><b>Tarragon sauce</b> is a sauce.</li>
<li><b>Ham sauce</b> is a sauce.</li>

<li><b>Neapolitan anchovy sauce</b> is a sauce.</li>
<li><b>Neapolitan soup</b> is a soup.</li>
<li><b>Mushroom sauce</b> is a sauce.</li>
<li><b>Mirepoix sauce</b> is a sauce.</li>
<li><b>Soup alla Maria Pia</b> is a soup.</li>
<li><b>Soup alla Lombarda</b> is a soup.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone can expand any of these into at least a stub discussing the historical and/or cultural relevance of the food in question, I'll retract my nomination for that item.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> all as A1. <s>This is what I call "article-creation vanity." They provide no information that isn't in the title.</s> Unlike some other food articles, these are not of any particular cultural significance, and if expanded would probably be no more than cookbook entries, which are not suitable for Wikipedia. If anyone thinks I'm wrong about that, then they should still be speedied but should then be entered as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_requests_537c.html" title="Wikipedia:Article requests">requested articles</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Delusions of Grandeur is right - the films aren't listed on IMDB because you can't buy them - they are amateur films with copyrighted music, so delete the film articles as well. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:07, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Do not Delete</b> I checked with the Novim Production company which is involved with Mike Sajecki. Something Anything in fact is available for public sale if you go to the website. It has licensed music and does not violate any copyright issue. Delusions of Grandeur was shown in independent theatres and colleges in the northeast US. However there was difficulty releasing for public sale on home video because of a problem with a licensed song from Peter Frampton. They are working with the artists lawyers to negotiate terms. They do wish to have the DVD available, even if it means omitting that song. On the issue of Imdb.com, they immediately submitted credits for their production. However, they say it will take a few weeks to be processed. Mike Sajecki is a relevant director following in the footsteps of Vincent Gallo. Mike has established a local celebrity in his native Buffalo, as well as pockets of interest in Toronto, New England any many of the college towns of the Northeast. The 2006 film from him will be submitted at several national festivals. He hasn't submitted at the elite festivals yet because he hasnt had the popularity then that he does now. -Rich 3 October 2005 (UTC)<small>(<i>preceding comment by</i> 128.205.238.183 (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.205.238.183.html" title="User talk:128.205.238.183">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.205.238.183_0e63.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.205.238.183">contribs</a>) )</small></p>

The article has relevance to existing articles in the database (including <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Watson_5f7d.html" title="Liam Watson">Liam Watson</a> (which seems to have been already deleted), producer of number one 2003 album <i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant_%28album%29.html" title="Elephant (album)">Elephant</a></i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>). As such, I believe this article should not be considered for deletion. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">JDW</a> 10:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are guidelines on what is and isn't notable at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Notability_and_Music_Guidelines</a>. While I have nothing against the band, they need to be more famous before they can be included in the Wikipedia. Thye may well be as notable as the White Stripes next year, but not now. Liam Watson was deleted because its sole content was an image; if what you say is true then there's scope for an article about him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:03, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable</i>. Their manager Chris Gentry was in Britpop band <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a> who were very famous in the mid-90s. The manager is most definitely a member of the band. Another member of the management team is Howard Gough, manager of <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope_Of_The_States_d7d0.html" title="Hope Of The States">Hope Of The States</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/m/Komakino.html" title="Komakino">Komakino</a>. The stuff about Liam Watson is true and was already mentioned on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>' entry. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">JDW</a> 11:11, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case I'd definitely start a new <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Watson_5f7d.html" title="Liam Watson">Liam Watson</a> entry, with more content than one photo. I'm personally unconvinced that Menswear count as 'extremely notable' and that they justify having The Rumours in. Howeve,r I'll now wait for the views of others. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:15, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I have that Menswear album (Nuisance) and as I remember, Menswear were very famous in 1995ish for being the architypal britpop band - they were signed because they simply looked the part! I'd say Gentry's link to this is enough to warrant this rumours article, but with those links to Watson and the White Stripes I personally don't think there's much doubt this band deserves an wiki-article. --Harlem4 11:59, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that's a point of view, but one that would certainly carry more weight with me if you had edited wikipedia before other than to make that point. Please bear in mind that using sock-puppets on these pages is very much frowned upon. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 12:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that's very fair. I read those guidelines you posted above and my interpretation is that there's a case for this. I suppose it is just a matter of interpretation. I have edited Wikipedia before but forgot my sign-in details and had to re-register. My main reason for suggesting the Menswear thing was grounds for it was that I do actually have that album! And I don't have <i>that</i> many albums...--Harlem4 12:14, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough. There's a procedure somewhere for having previous edits attributed to you. I'm sure an administrator will be along in a minute who will let you know what it is. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 12:19, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The band doesn't meet the requirements, and Menswear didn't exactly bestride the UK musical scene like a colossus.

<ul>
<li>Oh yes, I'd consider from the description of Q Sheet that a track on the cover is more likely to be promotional advertising than a sign of notability. We're not in the business of predicting which newly promoted bands will achieve wide airplay and commercial success and which ones won't. If we were good at it, we'd be in the music business... <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:05, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article</i> - although you seem to feel that none of these criteria have been met, I'd say that firstly it's entirely one's opinion that estimates the level of notability (referring to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a> at the moment). With this in mind, and coupled with the genuine level of integration with existing relevant articles, I feel this is reason enough for the article to remain. Besides which, it's only a matter of months before the <i>guidelines</i> will be <i>unequivocally</i> met. QSheet is not an advertising gimmick, it is simply an indication that the band in question have already had a release into the industry, and with their notable management and production team, there's little question they're going to make a big impression over the coming year. Further, I don't see how the comment concerning the prediction of of wide airplay and commercial success is relevant. If that were the case, I'd have sent in one of their tracks. It's not an audition, it's an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 13:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>192.94.94.105 12:57, 5 October 2005 (UTC) Tintin, According to the legend, there are 7 namboothiri manthravaadam family illams that had been created by Lord Parasurama. A few are Kaattumadam, soorya kaladi, kalakat,panthalakkottath, kalloor, pullancheri. Probably you have not heard because of the pronounciation of the word KALAKAT in english(some people read it as the house name of famous kunjan nambiar, probably thats a draw back of english language.) There are treatments for "Baadha Ozhippikkal", "Apasmaaram" etc. Earlier this family had Ayurvedic treatments too. Later down the lane of generations it wasn't getting carried over and it ended with late Sreedharan Thirumump. More stories are still there to be updated. Collecting data. Hopefully this article might be usefull to put light on other namboothiri families who are maintaining the same status. More info can be obtained from the famous book, aithihyamala, the garland of legends...</p>

<li>I would have normally abstained from a topic that I know so little about. But since the others are in no better position than me, I guess I have to vote. I have no reason to doubt Myashu's honesty or earnestness but still, since there is no opportunity to verify the contents and as the article needs a lot of rework, I have to go for a <b>userfy</b>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>To Myashu</b>&#160;: Userfy is not the same as delete. It means that it will be moved to your userspace, ie, to wiki/User:Myashu/Kalakkat Illam. You can continue working on it. Once you have completed writing, we can make it more encyclopaediac, and translate all the Malayalam words to English. I can do that for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As Curps mentioned above, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> is critical for articles in Wiki. So see if you can find references to your <i>Illam</i> in encylopaedias like <i>Akhilavijnanakosam</i>, <i>Sarvavijnanakosam</i> or <i>Visvavijnanakosam</i>, <i>Aithihyamala</i>, newspaper articles, or any book on Kerala heritage and add data from there. If <i>Kalakat Illam</i> has an article of its own in any one of these three encyclopaedias, that alone should be sufficient to make it eligible for wikipedia.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I still don't understand what makes every railway station notable. Wouldn't that require us to write thousands of articles in order to have an article about every railway station in English-speaking countries, let alone the whole world? Couldn't the same concept be applied to, e.g., post offices or malls? What sets railway stations apart from other buildings that makes them particularly notable?--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 19:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question of whether we <i>should</i> have an article is different from the question if we <i>can</i> have an article. I don't believe that we need to have articles on every railway station in the world, but when such station articles come, I think we can keep them. Regarding shopping malls and post offices, I think there is some disagreement among Wikipedians, personally I don't find them very notable because what is in them are very mundane, ordinary thing (shops, offices and paperwork). One might argue that a railway station also is mundane, but for some reason there are several rail enthusiasts while there are very few shopping mall enthusiasts (i.e. people interested in the mall itself). Several webpages endeavor to provide info on various stations, which illustrates that there are several people interested in such information. One might also argue that many of these station articles will be little more than stubs and should be merged with the railway line (which I think most would agree, are inherently notable). I have some sympathy with that view, but merging in a railway station which lies on more than one line can be quite awkward. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:13, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is informative in regards to the present anti-Christianism, and is proposed to be deleted by the same users who vote to keep neologies such as "Common Era" on Wikipedia. Also these same users propose to delete "The Holiday" article, thus being the only other article (besides this one) in which I have created, and revert every single edit I make in regards to Christianity, therefore I am assuming they propose to delete this article only because I have created it. However, since Wikipedia has sadly equipped morons like those folks as Administrators, there's really nothing that can be done to cease this ludicrous activity. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> 18:13, 3 October 2005 (UTC).

<dd>A term like "Common Era", which has been in use for a century, and gets over 366,000 Google hits, is hardly a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:21, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>And this article actually includes the Common Era debate, which you have just ADMITTED is not neology. As for the anti-Christmas portion, there has long been hostility against Christmas because it is an exciting holiday in which obviously not everyone can enjoy. Let's not forget that Hanukkah only became popular because of Christmas (it's only a very minor holiday on the Jewish calendar), and Kwanzaa was only created in 1966! to provide an alternate late-December holiday for non-Christians and non-Jews. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> 18:29, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jordain, I see now there's a history of editing disputes between yourself and Jayjg. However, I do honestly believe Jayjg is correct in this case: quite simply, the term "Terminology alteration" is outside the scope of Wikipedia because it is a neologism and original research - unless you can demonstrate otherwise.--<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 18:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you believe this to be a neologism, would you also classify "Common Era" as a neologism? If not, what exactly is the difference? On the page of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">Political correctness</a>, there is an sub-article defined as "Religious inclusiveness", which is what the Terminology alteration page was once called. Should it be renamed to this? Or maybe you should also vote to delete the Religious inclusiveness portion of Political Correctness, which <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> himself edited, but did not motion to delete. It's the exact same material as here! <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> 18:39, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Obviously, every term was a neologism once. However, the point is that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> is well-established outside Wikipedia, but there's no evidence that "Terminology alteration" is well-established outside Wikipedia, and makes me think someone's come up with the term for the sole purpose of doing an article. Now, to be honest, Wikipedia's "policy" on <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> is actually just a guideline, but in this case the complete lack of precedent for the use of "Terminology alteration" means the article of this name shouldn't exist.--<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 18:54, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This page could be considered as a form of political correctness, but I don't think it should be deleted. Moved or renamed, yes possibly, but not deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> 18:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In Germany, as in China or India, I believe that it does make sense to order churches in this manner, due to the dialectical nature of the nation.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this "information" is completely useless. Most of these churches have a nationwide presence anyway, and most Germans avoid using their local dialect in formal situtations like going to church. The local dialect of the town where the church happens to be headquartered is utterly irrelevant. And above all, the two concepts brought together on this page have <i>nothing</i> to do with each other! We might as well have a List of supermarket chains in Germany by average annual rainfall of corporate headquarters. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 06:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b>. Angr, has the avoidance of using local dialect at church <i>always</i> been the case? If not, this arrangement might be of use to someone doing historical research. The reason I ask is that I know there is at least one Church in Illinois where services are conducted in some obscure German dialect, presumably a carryover from when the church founders came over from Germany in the 19th century.
<ul>
<li>Probably not, but this information would not be of use to anyone doing such research, because it's based solely on where the church today happens to have its seat. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 07:56, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a crime. First it has four long paragraphs saying the golden mean is something in mathematics that is much celebrated, <b>without the slightest attempt to even hint at what it is</b>, even getting into a poet's view of the matter without having attempted to inform the reader of what it is, which would be very easy. A different article, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>, already gives a very clear account of this concept. Then it goes on to a section on the Pythagorean theory of music, which is not even tangentially relevant, but looks (very) superficially related only because it deals with ratios in esthetics. The rest of the article doesn't look as if it informs the reader of what the golden ratio is either. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:54, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> (not actually a vote, since I expressed myself above): Looking at which pages link to this execrable article, I find two entirely distinct topics, both sometimes called the golden mean. Maybe this should become a disambiguation page. Or redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> with a lower-case <i>m</i>, now a redirect page to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>, and make <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> a disambiguation page? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:07, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So I take it you don't like the article? I'm voting <b>Conditional Keep</b> on the basis that this has been flagged for attention for 1 day (by the AfD nominator) and now is being AfD nom'd. I agree that the article is a complete mess of random topics and is in need of some serious editing, but you cannot expect that to happen in 1 day. If after 30 days this article doesn't get updated into a coherent article with a point, I agree it should be deleted, but for now I'd say let the article have on last chance to be cleaned up.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*Well, <b>keep</b> the article title, if only as a redirect, and perhaps after moving it to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">Golden mean</a>? AFAIK "golden mean" is a legitimate synonym or near-synonym for "golden ratio" and a plausible entry term. The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article is heavy on math and light on aesthetics, philosophy, etc. The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> article is, uh, completely free from math and heavy on rather soft aesthetics and philosophy. I'm not enough of a classicist to judge its quality. And I haven't combed through the rest of Wikipedia to see how much of the material here is adequately treated elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllotaxis.html" title="Phyllotaxis">Phyllotaxis</a> is just a stub! But I don't see deleting all the content in this article. There needs to be some kind of refactoring and redistribution of its content, quite possibly deleting some of it, merging some of it elsewhere, and quite possibly leaving nothing but a redirect. The Pythagorean stuff needs to go elsewhere or just go. What sort of musical interval is 1.618? A minor sixth and change?

<li>I agree that the Golden Ratio article is much more concise. I vote to move the few unique bits from the Golden Ratio article to the Golden Mean article.

The confusion, which is not of our making, is that the outside world uses <i>golden mean</i> ambiguously: sometimes in its philosophical sense (above); other times as a synonym for the <i>golden ratio</i>. <i>Golden ratio</i>, on the other hand, is unambibuous: it refers only to the subject of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article, which is another reason that the articles <b>should not be merged</b>. The Wikified solution for dealing an ambiguous term is <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a>, and that is <b>part</b> of the solution for this article. Indeed <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a>, who made the first post on this page (does that mean he is the one who nominated the article for deletion?) raised much the same point in a comment following his original post. The <b>rest</b> of the solution is (1) to delete from this article all discussion of material that is treated in the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article (and treated much better there), with an appropriate cross-reference on this page to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> as another meaning of <i>golden mean</i>; and (2) to edit what is left of this article, dealing solely with the philosophical meaning, to improve its quality. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinell_cdfb.html" title="User:Finell">Finell</a> 10:49, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article title itself, since I think the term really is frequently used with that capitalization.</li>

<li>Hope for a <b>quick edit</b> of the article to remove anything obviously erroneous or less useful than <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a>, and clarify whatever relationships there are between the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Mean_6c87.html" title="Golden Mean">Golden Mean</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a> articles.

<li><b>Merge (if necessary) and Redirect</b> Golden Ratio is a good article, but I call it the golden mean (or the <b>Golden Section</b> at times.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In addition to the above, I know that Aristotle uses the idea of the "golden mean" as the point of virute in his <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomachean_Ethics_1419.html#The_Golden_Mean" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>. One example: He describes courage as the virtue being at golden mean between cowardice and fool-hardiness. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 04:15, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There needs to be better disambiguation between this article and Golden Ratio/golden mean. A new introductory paragraph should be put in to make clear the different uses of 'golden mean' (not just mathematical term), and its relationship with 'golden ratio' and perhaps difference from 'golden rule'. I agree with the above comment that more work on the philosophical section needs to be done too. Perhaps some of the sections should be merged with appropriate articles--golden ratio seems a good target for this--but in general, the article still needs work but should be kept. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 14:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't sound like a serious complication. It can all be dealt with as normal editing. But we might as well start tabulating just how many pages should be involved. I just checked and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Section_4d75.html" title="Golden Section">Golden Section</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_section.html" title="Golden section">Golden section</a> both redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a>. Good. And <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi.html" title="Phi">Phi</a> is a dab with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a> as the first alternative. Also good.</dd>
<dd>I think we need about two separate articles, with math in one and philosophy/classics in the other. Not sure which one aesthetics best belongs in. I don't think it much matters whether there's a "central" disambiguation page, or whether each of the two articles has a short, pithy cross-reference to the other. What matters is that a reader searching for any of this stuff should be able to type in any of these terms and find what they're looking for. And that the articles be good.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllotaxis.html" title="Phyllotaxis">Phyllotaxis</a> should be woven into this web, too.</dd>

<p>Badly titled page, it should be called "The Dover Castle" to avoid collision with a page on "Dover Castle" (the castle in Dover, not the pub. I've moved the pub's page to "The Dover Castle" and want to remove the old page PeterArnold 19:44, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't agree with where the redirect points. I would suggest that a fortification involved in the defence of England for centuries is more important than a pub in Leicester. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 20:35, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>AFD is not the place for this. Deletion is not involved in solving this problem. PeterArnold and <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> both apparently want the redirect to point to <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_Castle_27de.html" title="Dover Castle">Dover Castle</a> instead of to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dover_Castle_ff60.html" title="The Dover Castle">The Dover Castle</a>. The answer is just to edit the redirect, then. No administrator privileges are required. Indeed, one doesn't even need to have a user account to be able to do this. There's not even a disagreement as to where the redirect should point (for which the article's talk page would be the place, not AFD). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:10, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> both to "Dover Castle" (the castle). The pub is non-notable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_pmk_ab75.html" title="User:Andrew pmk">Andrew pmk</a> | <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_pmk_6096.html" title="User talk:Andrew pmk">Talk</a> 00:45, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem is that there are two pages: "Dover_Castle" (the fortification in Kent) and "Dover_castle" (the old page for the pub that currently redirects to the new page for the pub). I feel that it would be cleaner to delete the "Dover_castle" page rather than redirecting it to the fortification page. For the moment I have redirected the "Dover_castle" page to point to the "Dover_Castle" page. PeterArnold 07:11, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another issue is that a search for "Dover Castle" finds the fortification page but a search for "dover castle" finds the redirection page. I would say this is another reason for deleting it. PeterArnold 07:11, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Maria Flor is a notable Brazilian actress, as she is the star of the movie O Diabo a Quatro <a href="http://www.adorocinemabrasileiro.com.br/filmes/diabo-a-quatro/diabo-a-quatro.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adorocinemabrasileiro.com.br/filmes/diabo-a-quatro/diabo-a-quatro.asp" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. A not notable actress never would achieve a star role in a cinema movie. Her role in the movie Quase Dois Irmãos is also important for that movie, see this <a href="http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/264988/review.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/264988/review.jhtml" rel="nofollow">movie review, explaining Maria Flor's role</a> and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424374/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424374/" rel="nofollow">IMDB link</a>. Also, she had notable roles in both <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malha%C3%A7%C3%A3o.html" title="Malhação">Malhação</a> and Cabocla. So, the article should not be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> star actress. I'm sure there are "dozens of young actress" like her in Brazil. But, there are 186 million people in Brazil, and a large number of actresses (lots more than "dozens"). So if, as the nominator suggests, she's among mere "dozens", that wouldn't be bad at all.

<li>It's not a neologism, the term being in widespread and frequent use for decades as shown by the source citations on the page.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a> is not "traditionally Christian." As far as I know, Christmas trees are not mentioned in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. If I'm wrong, please provide a citation. Our article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas trees</a> discusses this in detail and suggests that the practice either originated as a pagan custom, or as a nonreligious celebration originating in 18th-century Germany (which was objected to by at least one priest specifically as <i>not</i> being Christian).</li>
<li>Even if it were considered offensive, the appropriate remedy would not be to delete the article, but make sure the article is neutral, by providing proper, well-sourced material showing to whom it is considered offensive. The article <i>already addresses</i> the differences of opinions between Jews in some detail. I am not aware of any widespread objections by Christians, but if there are, please provide <i>properly sourced</i> commentary for inclusion in the article.</li>
<li>I don't see how <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> applies, because nothing the actions and procedures surrounding this article were disruptive to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The article was discussed in AfD very recently. In its present form, it received fourteen keep votes and no delete votes. (For some reason <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordain_c8a5.html" title="User:Jordain">Jordain</a> did not vote in the first AfD, even though it is clear he or she was aware of the article.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:52, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It should not be moved to "Jewish Christmas tree" for the following reasons. Unlike <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah_bush.html" title="Hanukkah bush">Hanukkah bush</a>, "Jewish Christmas tree" <b>is</b> a neologism. This term is not used to any appreciable extent. Our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a> call for the use of the most common term; this is "Hanukkah bush," not "Jewish Christmas tree." This specific question of whether the article should be entitled <a href="../../../h/a/n/Talk%7EHanukkah_bush_4bf6.html" title="Talk:Hanukkah bush">Talk:Hanukkah bush</a> on whether the article title should be <i>Hanukkah bush</i> or <i>Jewish Christmas Tree</i> resulted in four fairly strong opinions, all to the effect that it should remain at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah_bush.html" title="Hanukkah bush">Hanukkah bush</a>, and no dissenting opinions. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:51, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Sorry, but you can't delete something just because the idea is offensive to you. If that were the case Wikipedia would comprise one article and it would be about something totally generic like <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a>. As for the article itself, I am judging it on its current incarnation. A quick look around the internet shows that there are a few examples of a Hanukkah bush in the manner it is described in the article... enough that I'm willing to let it stand for now, though it is scraping the edge of non-notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Daka has touched the hearts of many, and the stomachs of many more. To suggest that Daka is a "non-notable" dining hall is ridiculous. For the chocolate-chip cookies alone, Daka will be forever remembered by those who dine there. Until it can be proven that Daka does not have the greatest cookies in the world, it deserves mention in Wikipedia. --Norfty 21:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a current student of WPI, I would like to say the DAKA makes by far, the best chocolate-chip cookies ever. Also, it would be a great help to incoming students if they could read about the dining hall as described by current students, and most will be living on campus, and eating at the dining hall. As to the comment about your living room being notable, I've never heard anything about your house, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who have heard about WPI. I vote to save this page. --KurtWivagg 21:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> All of these people commenting to keep are, not surprisingly, accounts created after I nominated this for deletion, and even identify themselves as students of WPI (freshmen I'm guessing -- sorry couldn't resist) and are obviously biased and just joking around anyway.

<li>I'm really not sure here, but I don't think there's one overall "President of India" award. The term is probably an umbrella term designating several awards of varying level of achievement. I couldn't find any governmental web-site mentioning such an award anyway. I also verified that Ratchagar wasn't awarded any of the Padma awards for 2005. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbarish_2d40.html" title="User:Ambarish">Ambarish</a> 08:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Schreuder doesn't seem to be notable and neither do the organizations he is involved with. However, that might be because the organizations' names are different in Dutch.
