<li><b>Keep</b>. HorsePunch- The website is differenciated from the "zillions" of other gaming sites/forums because of its strict mobile focus. It fills a specific online niche that very few (no one else?) is focused. Not all websites can or should be gauged solely on their google rank. Modojo is very relevent in the ever-growing mobile gaming scene. Cell phone gaming is EXPLODING in popularity, and I don't know of any other site that examines in so closely. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.254.35.179 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.254.35.179_998d.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.254.35.179">contribs</a>) 2005-11-03 01:36:49.</small></li>

<dd>Mysekurity's search omited several articles outside of Modojo linking to itself such as the Business Week and Sports Line articles. On a related note, doesn't the fact that highly reputable publications such as the LA Times and Business Week cite Modojo make it all the more noteworthy? It also makes Modojo the subject of national media attention outside of the Internet, which means the website meets 2 of the 3 requirements to be a notable website (according to Wikipedia's policy, it only needs to meet 1). <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> 06:02, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm not sure what, exactly, my search was, as looking through my Search History on Google brought up no real indicator (the search looks to be indeed 76100). I'm not sure why the descrepancy happened, but in any event I'm sorry. I'm not an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionist" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionist">inclusionist</a>, and personally think that Wikipedia doesn't really need articles on sites such as these, but I think I'm willing to let it slide. I'm going to be neutral on this, because I'm not really sure of the merits of having an article on this site (why not have a history page on the forum?), except to drive traffic. What normal encyclopedic article, may I ask, would link to this site?

<dd>First, I would like to establish some credibility for this website. It isn't made by a bunch of people sitting at home on their computers (not to say that's a bad thing, several websites with entries here are made in that sort of environment). Modojo is a real business that takes in revenue. Look at the business's address: 268 Bush Street in San Francisco. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;&amp;q=%22268+Bush+Street%22+San+Francisco%2C+CA+94104&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;&amp;q=%22268+Bush+Street%22+San+Francisco%2C+CA+94104&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a> can show you that hundreds of reputable businesses are located here, including the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Game_Developers_Association_3adb.html" title="International Game Developers Association">IGDA San Francisco Chapter</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now to answer the bigger question of why Modojo deserve its own entry on Wikipedia. It's already been established many times on this page and on the talk page that there are other, less notable websites with entries here, so I won't go into that again. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states three requirements for websites. Modojo meets all of those except for the Alexa ranking, which is understandable seeing how it's a newer website. However, Cloudchaser Media, the company that the community derives from, was in the top 10,000 during 2001. Even if you omit that fact, this website is still notable according to Wikipedia's standards.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, you bring up a good point about if this still merits a Wikipedia article. I can see how people who are unfamiliar with the website can easily dismiss its entry on Wikipedia because it does look like blatant advertising. Please look at the current article again. The vast majority of the text deals with the history of the community, not the main website (the idea of creating an entry here was to tell the story about the history of the community, not a seven month old website). At its peak, the community had over 11,000 members, and during highly publicized events such as E3 and the Game Developers Conference, it's common for there to be HUNDREDS of active users on the website at the same time. The current record is 544 members who were on the forum simultaneously on 02-07-2005, which was around the time of a big announcement that is escaping my memory at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This community has a long and interesting history, and it's a story that many people here (even if you omit the meatpuppets) think should be told. Why should this be on Wikipedia instead of a page on the website? I think it's for the same reason that every other of the 800,000 articles on Wikipedia should be here. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia of everything notable. Over the years this community and all the websites it has been associated with has had several million viewers. It's part of the Internet's history. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> 22:08, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. In addition to the citations in news media mentioned by Jtrost, Modojo's official industry contacts make them seem noteworthy. Also, the history is interesting enough on it's own - even to someone like me who had never heard of the site before today. 63.224.187.10 04:39, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
