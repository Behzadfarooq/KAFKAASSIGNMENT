<li><b>Abstain.</b> Apparently he was legit, but I can't determine how notable he was. RMA verified that he was once a student of Daniel K.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many do not know who this man was especially novices. This does not make his contributions less valuable. He was the victim of chauvinism in the 60's &amp; '70's (and I dare say to this day!) because he was a homosexual, something not tolerated in a testosterone laden genre such as the Martial Arts. Many who learned from him would then disavow him because he was homosexual. Be that as it may, some today are now willing to use his name and system to promote themselves which is a great shame. At any rate...He was a high level instructor in Pai Lum Kung Fu who was a direct student (grandson)of Daniel K. Pai. He taught Pai Lum Kung Fu to those who are now masters in said system, such as Mike Kaylor, David L. Smith, and Robert Schoolnick. He was also promoted to instructor rank under one of the most famous Escrimadors, Angel Cabales. He trained some notable persons including Bruce Juchnik of Kosho Shorei Kempo, Mark Bober of T'ien Lung Tao, Glen Kwan of Genkido Kempo, and many others. He died of a heart attack as a complication of AIDS, as no one can die of AIDS istelf. The Chi Lin System(s) are still being taught in Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California, and Ontario Canada. While the entry is not a great one it is nontheless an important one and needs some work. Maybe we could work on it to fit Wikipedia better instead of just backhandedly deleting it?! AnDruidh</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Do not redirect. It's hopelessly misspelled and nobody is going to look for it under that title. It's true that we don't have an article on Central Missori State Univerity. But we do have one on <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Missouri_State_University_9f6c.html" title="Central Missouri State University">Central Missouri State University</a>. Let's put this article out of it's missori. P.S. I've now put everything that I think needs to be said in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Missouri_State_University_9f6c.html" title="Central Missouri State University">Central Missouri State University</a>. What I put in the article is <i>not</i> a merge from this article but written new-from-scratch so deleting this one creates no GFDL history issues. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:20, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article doesn't really have anything to do with the University itself. It's about a radio mast that <i>will be</i> constructed there. This seems to be a part of a much larger series of articles linked to from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>. Almost all of the masts have a little stub with the mast's height, geographical coordinates, ownership, and FCC registration. Don't know if all those things are <i>useful</i>—or if they all wouldn't be better off merged into a table in the main article. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 03:19, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whoever put in the substub-under-the-misspelled article name didn't research very carefully... it <i>seems</i> that the mast <i>has been</i> built—at least, a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility in Syracuse occurred in 2003.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete - redundant with new mention in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Missouri_State_University_9f6c.html" title="Central Missouri State University">Central Missouri State University</a> and there-linked FCC database which is more likely to be kept up to date.

<li>By the way, shouldn't we merge those <i>several hundred</i> of mast stubs back onto the main article? I can see the purpose of the main list, but not of hundred stubs reading "&lt;name&gt; is a guyed mast for TV transmission at &lt;place&gt; at &lt;coordinates&gt;. &lt;name&gt; was built in &lt;year&gt; and is &lt;height&gt; high." <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 16:06, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> the whole lot. All the information in these scores (hundreds?) of articles could be condensed into an equally-informative table in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>. If there is any additional worthwhile information about particular radio masts, those select few can have linked articles. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 16:21, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>What? Are the deletionists still conducting this sick campaign against masts? All tall structures are intrinsically notable. This one serves an area of twenty thousand square miles, an area larger than Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, or Rhode Island. In fact, it's larger than New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island combined. And it's hundreds and hundreds of feet tall! It must influence the lives of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people. Surely this is more important than some minor character in Harry Potter. <a href="../../../f/a/e/User%7EFaethon387_82c2.html" title="User:Faethon387">Faethon387</a> 02:19, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is not deletionist, it's mergist. Ten and I are suggesting that the stub articles may be more useful if formatted together in one big table. That way, I would be able to find the latitude and longitude of several masts in one centralized location. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:40, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

<p>This article is one about a low ranked Sumo wrestler, who is unknown generally (assuming he exists). It is possibly self promotion. In my view wrestlers who are top ranked and well known should be listed.

<p><b>Delete</b>. This article is full of POV and is as pointless as creating articles such as Turkey pride, Greek pride, Japanese pride, Chinese pride.

This is a kind of vanity which Wikipedia defines as "the excessive belief in one's own abilities". At worst it cn also be called a kind ofnarcissism, which Wikipedia defines as "a pattern of thinking and behaving in adolescence and adulthood, which involves infatuation and obsession with one's self to the exclusion of others". Not that self-respect is bad, but as far as Korean pride is concerned, it is a kind of extraverted pride that is not really different than something like white pride which believes in the inherent superiority of oneself or one's race over others. The issue of Korean pride is also a valid complaint by foreigners who deal in the academic and business worlds in Korea." <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 21:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not perfectly acceptable to let your rant on a talk page spill over and become an article, which is what has happened here. Your Korean Pride article is in effect just a continuation of your endless theorizing on the Hwang Woo-Suk talk page. It is, in fact, <b>original research</b>. Your article is not a properly sourced scholarly article fit for an encyclopedia; rather, it is an amalgamation of your theories of "Korean group-think" and "Korean hierarchy", which you use to explain the Hwang situation. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 08:30, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Korean inventions and discoveries exist. Korean pop culture exists. Seoul's economic and cultural dominance in Korea exists.

<li>This is NOT a racist article. Anyone can check over my user history and see that I have made many and deep contributions on the topics of Korean culture, food, and history, all of them factual and neutral. If anyone calls this article racist, they should stop making the fallacy of such a general comment and precisely point out which part or parts it is that they are referring to. As it now stands, it has a balanced structure, exploring both positive and negative aspects of the very real topic of "Korean pride", which people who have had dealings in Korea and/or with Koreans end up talking about, because it can be a source of consternation for them and at times even ends up affecting international relations. For people who need a reference, there may be comments like these in internet cafes where foreign English teachers in Korea frequently make them, though they may be deleted rather quickly. I suggest people explore such forums to get a taste of what this phenomenon is all about. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 03:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>The final domino to fall will be "Korean Pride," when Koreans fully confront Hwang's fraud.</i></p>
<p><i>But in the words of Joseph Steinberg, "South Koreans have to learn to . . . replace pride . . . [with] confidence. "</i></p>
<p><i>How do they do that? Cho Se-mi suggests that (among other things) Koreans should "pursue excellence." I'd add that they should strive to be honest in, e.g., their pursuit of a university degree, where honesty would entail actually doing the work required rather than plagiarizing so much. The problem lies not just in academics, of course, but also in the Korean business world, whose level of dishonesty foreigners constantly complain about.</i></p>
<p><i>I also think that Korea needs to develop a culture of discussion, and that would entail a flattening of the hierarchical social system to enable juniors to openly question their seniors.</i></p>
<p><i>But that will take a while.</i></p>

<li>This topic may be <b>controversial</b> but strictly speaking it is no more "racist" than Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a> for example. Moreover, people who try to compare the inherent national pride of X country with Korean pride are making a generalization which is inherently illogical. What this article does is try to point out the special characteristics of a phenomenon that both Koreans and foreigners consistently refer to and has big impacts on Korean society, and to delete it would mean the censors win, which is against the spirit of wiki as well as free and progressive thinking for that matter. Moreover, denying the existence of the phenomenon does not do the Korean people any good either, because the next step in the evolution of Korean consciousness and society is to confront this problem and discuss it and perhaps even find ways to deal with it, which presumably would end up with the betterment of all. It has especially come to the forefront because of the Hwang affair, a situation (if you think about it deeply) many say was brought about by Korean pride on the part of Hwang (his desire to make Korea a research hub and also Nobel Prize considerations) and even him using it to keep all of his underlings silent. Remember, it was the head of the Mizmedi hospital, Roh Sung-Il, who first blew the whistle, and not any of Hwang's underlings. In a free and open society, for soemthing like this you would think there would have been a whistle-blower from within the research team ranks, at least anonymously. And yet there wasn't. The interesting question is, what kind of a hold does one have to have on his subordinates to commit such a fraud? There is the hierarchical power structure to be sure, but motivations of national pride had to have come into play as well. This is why discussions of Hwang will inevitably bring up the issue of Korean pride, which makes the topic not only real but also relevant these days. It is only logical to begin discussing it. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 06:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you, and the probelm with finding links for this kind of thing is that it's not something that English speakers will speak about often with any great depth of knowledge because it's probably a tad politically incorrect to do so and can be miscontrued as some kind of hate ranting.

<dd>This is <b>not</b> the same as Korean nationalism, because it's possible to not really care about the country of Korea per se but at the same time have pride in being Korean or thinking that Koreans are superior in some way. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrahasis_30fb.html" title="User:Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a> 08:19, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Korean Nationalism" and "Korean Pride" are two different ideas. For example, in many Chinatown, Chinese who does not have Chinese nationality and does not endorse the current Chinese government still have high regards in the culture he or she passes down. I don't think this is "nationalism" but "pride". Right now, most Koreans do live in Korea, but for those living outside and not having Korean nationality, is it improbable for them to not to have the same mentality? If Korean immediately becomes "un-Korean" once he or she loses nationality and leaves Korea, then we have to argue whether the only thing binding them together is "nationalism" and that Korean entirely lacks "pride". Certainly Korean has to have both "nationalism" and "pride" and both has to be distinct. -- <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 05:03, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Note that he has created a article on such a village. Like Mel, I don't think we need to be especially solicitous towards this new user. His contributions to date consist of outright vandalism of several articles: replacing entire sections of articles with the word "ALLAH", replacing random words in several articles unrelated to Islam with the word "muslim", etc. He also created three articles, all incoherent: this one, an article about a very small village in Saudi Arabia, and an article entitled Laughter of Allah. The first two are now on VfD, and the third was redirected to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>. It may be that the grafitti and vandalism were sandbox activity and that it was cluelessness rather than malice; but one has to bend over backwards to be that charitable, especially since he claims to have experience on the Arabic Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:58, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now thats a good point. As hard as the author(s) tried (and I can tell they tried pretty hard), the article isn't NPOV on the subject. It presents it as a cult's method of indoctrination.

<dd>I've refined the opening definition to make it clear that the term love bombing is meant to refer to an <i>insincere</i> (or at least deliberately <i>exaggerated</i>) show of affection, and that it commonly applies to a <i>group</i> of people acting <i>in concert.</i> I can't tell whether Dr. Margaret Singer actually originated the term, but she appears to at any rate have been an early user and popularize of the term, so I added something about that. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:56, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A short-lived British pop duo. In 1978 they released a single which got to number 3, and then they released a single which got to number 39, and then they released an album which did not chart. As with Susan Fassbender, <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissing_the_Pink_0b97.html" title="Kissing the Pink">Kissing the Pink</a> or <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finitribe.html" title="Finitribe">Finitribe</a> they influenced nobody, were not innovative, changed nothing, and their most popular single came and went in a flash. Personnel consisted of Julian Marshall, who went on to play session piano for David Cunningham's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Lizards_2878.html" title="The Flying Lizards">The Flying Lizards</a>, and Kit Hain, who did not. Hain has written a short history of the band here <a href="http://www.stereosociety.com/body_kithain.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stereosociety.com/body_kithain.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which actually reinforces my satanic desire to wipe her life's work from Wikipedia. Three and a half thousand hits on Google <i>but</i> these seem to consist almost entirely of (a) automated lyrics and discography sites and (b) inventories of 'rare records' websites. Of the first hundred of Google's search results, apart from the aforementioned link not a single page is actually <i>about</i> the band; there are a few which mention one or other band-member as being 'once part of Marshall Hain', but nothing about Marshall Hain itself. The reason for this is that there is nothing to know. Apart from the nitty-gritty of song titles and track times I have encapsulated the entirety of their being in the first sentence of this writeup. The information might belong in individal pages for either Marshall or Hain, but they haven't done much of note either; and the article for The Flying Lizards is sadly a mess. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 17:00, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has no information about Mary Ann Smith other than alderman, is not necessary and even if embleished, does not improve Wikipedia. (VfD comment left unsigned by User:24.17.255.164 at 09:58, 28 Feb 2005)</p>
<p>There is now a very clear concensus that Chicago alderman are not inherently noteworthy. In that case then, are they notable enough that they warrant their own redirects? In this specific example, a Google search for "Mary Ann Smith" -Chicago results in over 14-thousand hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Mary+Ann+Smith%22+-Chicago&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Mary+Ann+Smith%22+-Chicago&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Given the ambiguity here, should this particular redirect be kept or deleted?

<ul>
<li>I'm pretty indifferent. If a notable Mary Ann Smith appears we can change the redirect into an article on her. As it is nothing links here, and I really doubt people will be searching for this alderwoman (anyone typing in the name will probably just as likely be looking for another person with the same name), so the redirect is pretty useless, but pretty harmless. Very marginal keep. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:23, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In my opinion, <b>very common names should never be redirects</b>. Instead, a disambig page should be formed. There must be tens of thousands if not millions of Mary Smiths, Mary Ann Smiths, Mary Anne Smiths, Marianne Smiths, etc etc etc. A quick Googling reveals an actress, an artist, a Scottish musician, an Eastenders character, a children's book character, and a 1932 movie called <i>Alias Mary Smith</i>. This is ripe disambig material here. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:13, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Before we start making disambiguation pages for names for which we don't have articles, we should ask ourselves how many of these other Mary Ann Smiths are in any way encyclpedic. Basically any name is going to had by more than one person, and we don't go making disambiguation pages for everyone. And since this page is titled "Mary Ann Smith" we don't want to mention every Mary Smith who doesn't have an "Ann" in her name. I checked the "Mary Ann Smith" actress, and she's credited with 4 roles, none major (some without names), in minor films. Not exactly encyclopedia material. Looking at a few others on google makes me less than convinced that we're missing articles here, What would a disambiguation page say? "Mary Ann Smith is the name of a whole bunch of people. Wow. Look at this. We have an alderwoman, an actress, some PhD, looks like a secretery or two, teacher, some sort of business executive or something... Man, alot of Smiths named their kid Mary Ann..." Because I'm not sure how much more you can say without other articles to link to. And I really don't see articles being made for most of these people. When another Mary Ann Smith turns up on wikipedia we can make a disambiguation page. There must be thousands of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Thompson_9420.html" title="Sam Thompson">Sam Thompsons</a> in the world, and we don't have a disambiguation page there. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:29, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, did you read the article? It's a redirect. I don't see how one can merge a redirect. Right now the question is should the name redirect to the aldermen page, or should it be deleted.

<p>Note from article creator:<br />
Wow, that's some fast turn around time. Anyway, I made the article because there was an empty link to it on the <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widdershins.html" title="Widdershins">Widdershins</a> page. I was considering posting Brown's poem "Childe Rowland To the Dark Tower Came", but was unsure if posting the entire content of a poem, albeit one in the public domain, was appropriate. To wit, if you think the article should go, I recommend removing the link on the Widdershins page.</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Lear_d511.html" title="King Lear">King Lear</a>; could also redirect to the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Browning_8d53.html" title="Robert Browning">Browning</a> poem <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childe_Rowland_to_the_Dark_Tower_Came_ff20.html" title="Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower Came">Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower Came</a>; it could also be made into an article about the English fairy tale from which the Shakespeare lines come (in ballad form; the editor of my Riverside edition believes these lines are from a lost ballad). Here is a source on the fairy tale: <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/eft/eft22.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/eft/eft22.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Childe Rowland gets a respectable number of Google hits. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 00:52, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this, but if the <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widdershins.html" title="Widdershins">Widdershins</a> article is anything to go by, then there's potential for a good article under this title. For that reason I do not think it should be a redirect. Maybe put it on requested artciles (because we all know how effective <i>that</i> is). And to the anon above, welcome to wikipedia. Posting the entire content of a poem is not encouraged in wikipedia. If the poem is copyrighted then it's very bad, but even if it isn't (as in this case) it belongs in another project, Wikisource. I don't know much about wikisource, my wiki involvedment is limited to pedia, but I'm sure someone can help you out if you're interested. We would welcome an article on said poem here, with a few excerpts, but not the whole thing.

<li><b>Keep:</b> The thing that sets Wikipedia apart from bog-standard off-the-shelf encyclopaedias is its up-to-date info on things that a normal encyclopaedia can't afford to document. This article does have some importance as one of the earliest Internet phenomenons, but the fact that it has bloomed into something worthy of discussion is reason enough to have it. Fads only get forgotten because no-one keeps records of them: Wikipedia has accepted pages about far lesser known fads, because deep down we know that if you don't know what something is, Wikipedia will more than likely have the answer.

<li>I'm still trying to understand what the criteria are for inclusion as an article--does anyone who gets on a ballot anywhere merit an article? What about write-in candidates? "Big" offices only, or local administrators? My thought is that the individual needs to have done something distinguished to merit an article about them personally, rather than a larger organization in which they operate. If the point is to document minor parties and small political movements (and I wholeheartedly agree that is a good use of Wikipedia), isn't her involvement be better covered on the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_fac1.html" title="Socialist Workers Party">Socialist Workers Party</a> article, or in articles on other movements in which she's active? By the way, didn't mean to imply that the claim of her Senate Candidacy was false, only that I hadn't confirmed it, since that wasn't the crux of my objection to the entry. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 18:00, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Firstly, I am not advertising Linpedia.org at all. The articles was written in a Neutral Point Of View for encyclopedic values. No where does the article intensify or stress, the project, if anything it gives credit to Wikipedia, “The project reflects the ideals of Wikipedia”. If this type of article is advertisement, then lets have a vote to delete the following articles: Microsoft, Google, Apple, Mac, Linux, BSD, Apache, Gaim, Atari, and so on. If this page is removed, it will be because currently it might be unimportant to readers. But isn't that a NPOV problem? In truth, it can be very important to new Linux users or some one who might want to contribute to a free project to better and pass knowledge on a topic.</li>

<li>It may be written in an NPOV style, but its mere <i>existence</i> is an advert, given that the site only came into being earlier this week.

He would stretch a piece of flexible wire about a meter long so that it ran between the poles, hang a little tag of paper on it, and connect a car battery to the ends.

<ul>
<li>I disagree that it's distortion, though perhaps you're right that I should have held off until the page was deleted (sorry to say it, but I'm pretty confident it will be). I still think most programmers will disagree with the statement that the compiler is a metaprogramming tool, which is a strong argument both for the deletion of this page and for rewording the metaprogramming page. I can understand where you're coming from, and I agree that a compiler is a metaprogramming tool in a <i>loose</i> sense. But your POV and my POV don't really matter for something like this. (And forget about NPOV... it'd be useless for the articles to be riddled with "Some people think this and other people think that and some people think this article shouldn't exist at all anyway.") - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 04:51, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I basically second that. A C++ compiler can be used to do template metaprogramming, but that's not what this "example" is. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 05:19, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can understand your sentiment, but do recall that NPOV itself is a non-negotiable policy. As far as I can tell, this is definately metaprogramming from the point of view of an assembly programmer. <i>However</i> I'd be willing to change my mind, if it turns out that the definition given by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaprogramming_%28programming%29.html" title="Metaprogramming (programming)">metaprogramming_(programming)</a> is wrong or lacking. In any case, IMHO this is not a job for VFD, but rather for cleanup.

<dl>
<dd>OK, the whole POV issue aside, which upon reflection probably indeed does not belong here in VfD, the only use of this page, which is admitted within the page itself, is to isolate a really long assembly listing. I would think that including only a few sample lines and noting that the entire file is over 200 lines long is sufficient, which, if this can be agreed upon, removes any argument for the isolation of that content, and therefore removes any argument for the existence of this page, which is why it's listed on VfD rather than being discussed through talk pages.

Unfortunately, my version of gcc was ignoring the "optimisation" flags I'd set to get somewhere near to that result. I talked it through with one of the gcc crew and it turns out that this is in fact deliberate, and is actually normally a useful feature. (Except for me that is, Hmph! )</dd>

<li>Hmm, could have done that, but when I read about things I'm always insanely curious as to what an example might look like. So I was shamelessly catering to "people like me"&#160;;-).

<li>But what the page describes isn't really metaprogramming. Metaprogramming is really writing a program that writes code, not using the compiler to generate code. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 21:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider for a moment, what's a compiler? Right, it's a program. So what you're saying (<i>"metaprogramming is really writing a program that writes/generates code, not writing a program that writes/generates code"</i>) doesn't make sense at all. Did you mean something else but make a thinko while typing? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a>
<ul>
<li>No, I don't believe I did make a typo, and you did not copy what I had wrote verbatim. I shall clarify. Metaprogramming, as far as I can see, is <i>writing</i> a program <i>whose intended output is code</i>, not <i>using</i> a compiler that generates code. A program that prints "hello" and is compiled is not metaprogramming, but a program that prints "int main(void) {printf("hello") return 0;}" is. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 05:40, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're still missing the point. You <i>don't write</i> the compiler, you merely execute it. Executing programs is not programming. Writing programs is. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 08:28, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, and generally the person who uses a compiler is somebody other than the one who wrote it.&#160;:) Isn't the bullet nesting level here enough, by the way? - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 20:07, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is really a pick-one-definition-and-stick-to-it sort of discussion. The problem is we should use whatever preexisting definition out there, when there may in fact be none. The issue with using a definition that includes compilation to machine code as metaprogramming means that <i>all</i> programming is essentially metaprogramming, and that essentially sullies the word because then it has no real meaning. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 22:08, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps it's better to say that much modern day programming <i>depends</i> on metaprogramming at some point or other. You're not nescesarily doing it yourself. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 23:13, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>With the definition of metaprogramming extending to compilers, <b>all</b> programming is metaprogramming. The term "metaprogramming" then becomes meaningless. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 04:13, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I don't necessarily agree that "all programming is metaprogramming", if that's what you mean&#160;;) I wouldn't agree that compiler writers are doing metaprogramming, for a few reasons, unless they are using the compiler to write compiler code.

<li>OK, I never heard of this guy until now, and I have no idea of just how much of an internet phenomenon he was, but there is clearly a precedent for the inclusion of major internet phenomonena in wikipedia. Reading this page and looking at the photo it struck me that this guy really reminds me of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a>. Is there any evidence that he was the inspiration for that character? If so then maybe merge and redirect there? <b>No vote</b> as of now, but I'm curious about this. Anyone have any information on this? Am I off my rocker? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:19, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose only Borat's creators know for sure, but my guess is no. Their countries of origin are different, for a start, and Borat's most prevelant characteristic (anti-semitism) isn't something associated with Mahir. They do have some similar physical characteristics, but I think Borat is more of a reference to a stereotyped foreign guy (like a less-cute Andy Kauffman's "foreign man") than a reference to any specific person. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:33, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't call anti-semitism Borat's most prevelant characteristic, at least not in the beginning. I think it sort of grew as Cohen realized how useful it was in what he was doing. Anyway, it wasn't just his appearance that got we wondering, but the "I like sex" thing as well. Their countries are different, but I know Cohen chose Kazakstan because he was pretty sure he wouldn't have to worry about running into someone who was particularly familiar with that country. A google search leads me to believe that I'm not the first to make the connection, but there is no evidence that Borat was directly inspired by Cagri, so maybe merge a few sentences into the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a> article and <b>redirect</b>. He's already mentioned there. That would mean losing the great photo, but we can live with that. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:53, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This <i>is</i> a major Internet phenomenon. This guy spawned the "I KISS YOU!!!" thing; Googling that yields over 100,000 hits.

<ul>
<li>Come on, now... do you really think every time the 3 common words "i kiss you" appear next to each other on Google, it's a reference to Mahir? I think not. If I run the same exact-phrase search, more than half of the result on the first two pages are obsviously not Mahir references, many are merely part of "can I kiss you" or "may I kiss you", etc. If I add "mahir" to the search query, the number of results drops more than 90%. Besides, even if he coined a minor internet catchprase, does that necessarily make him encyclopedia-worthy? "Have A Nice Day" is a far bigger catchprase, and I doubt that whoever made it up has an entry (and rightly so). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:42, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, no, but the name of whoever created "Have A Nice Day" was not linked to the catchphrase itself, whereas the name of "Mahir" spread along with "I KISS YOU!!!" If we had a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_memes_8f8a.html" title="List of Internet memes">List of Internet memes</a>, I'd say it could be merged there. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:44, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that's a really good idea. Internet memes are a bit like local politicians and others who tap-dance around the notability line: a fairly large number of people don't think they belong in an encylopedia, but enough people care about them that they can't be entirely ignored, either. A list would satisfy both groups. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:57, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D'oh! Chalk that one up to lack of caffeine. I must have been thinking that "I kiss you" is ungrammatical/uncommon enough to only catch what I was looking for... anyway, where do you get a 90% dropoff? Google for <i>"i kiss you" mahir</i> returns 32,000 hits. I stand by my claim that this is a well-known enough meme to have its own article. If not, well, it's time to put up stuff like <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a> for VfD as well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 15:55, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmm, now that's <i>really</i> strange. I get 10,900 for <i>"i kiss you" mahir</i> and even if I remove the quotes it only goes up to 13,800. It idn't Safe Search, either, because that's turned off. I dunno. I probably would support a VfD for Badger3, even though I personally find it amusing.

<li>As his heydey was apparently 6 years ago, a google search now would not reflect how popular he was in his prime. The guy who popularized Mahir's page claimed he got 500,000 hits in two weeks, which is quite a lot. Also Mahir's page counter which has only been active since 2002 (still 3 years after his initial popularity) has a comparable number of hits, which is still a lot for a personal web page. I'm not a good judge of exactly when an internet phenomena is really widespread enough to warrant inclusion, so I'm still wavering on this one, but I think we do have to look to what other such things are included in wikipedia, and compare. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:11, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Human memory is of course fallible, but I am sure beyond any shadow of doubt that this topic has been previously nominated. (I am not as sure of the decision.) The fact that there is no evidence in the article history is, unfortunately, not proof that a nomination never took place. 1) I can not say for sure that this topic was previously created at this exact title. It might have been a slightly different transliteration of his name. 2) It was long enough that it might have been prior to one of the database failures that took out some history files. Regardless, I still can't find a copy of the prior discussion. Unless someone else can, it's probably moot. My own vote is not based on the prior discussion but on my assessment of the current relevance of his impact.
