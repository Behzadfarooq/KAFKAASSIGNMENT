We <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Icosihenagon_38f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Icosihenagon">already went through this for Icosihenagon</a>, and this one contains no more information than that. It makes statements like "angles on a regular decemyriagon measure almost exactly 180°" which is inexact, and is also listed in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> (via a simple formula to compute the angle). It gives an etymology which isn't even right (it lists "polloi," which isn't a part of this word), and finally it says that it is possible, but complicated, to produce one with a compass and straightedge, which <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructible_polygon.html" title="Constructible polygon">Constructible polygon</a> leads me to doubt most severely. So, all of the info that this provides that isn't in the main <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a> article is dubious at best. We ought to delete this one. If people think that having the measure of the interior angles explicitly listed is important, we can just add a column to the table in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygon.html" title="Polygon">Polygon</a>. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 01:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The statement about the angles is true, to a greater or lesser degree, for all polygons with a lot of sides, and is not specific to this polygon.

So we have a dictionary definition of a neologism containing only information about something that's not the subject of the article.
