<li><b>Merge</b> as suggested by Black Falcon. The existence of such allegations is widely noted in reliable sources, and has much more potentially lasting importance than an episode summary for your favorite TV show. Labelling an article with this title suggests endorsement of the allegations, and is difficult to write and maintain in NPOV fashion. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This may not be exactly according to the rules, but it is a clear case of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, because it cools down edit conflicts. Given the heat of the conflict, it worked out well that we have these current events in separate articles. I voted "Rename", rather than "Keep" because the name does not exactly mirror the LTTE article names, so I assume it should contain the word "attributed". — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 02:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> ..The whole article is based on weak logical fallacies and on the pure hatred that user has against anything srilankan.. WE already have 2 articles related to human rights in Sl, and why on earth we need seperate one for STF&#160;? Do we need seperate articles for human right violations by Prabhakaran, Human right violation by Pottu amman,Human right violation by Anton balasingham,Human right violation by Sea tigers, human right violation by LTTE police etc..this is rediculous&#160;!! The whole argument is based on some Invidual actions taken by some STF individuals..hoｗon earth we generalize this and accuses STF&#160;?!!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>if you still dont get it let me explain ..
<ul>
<li>if a german tourist engaged in act of paedophilia ,can we create an article name "Human right violation by germans"?</li>
<li>If a american soldier rapes a japanese lady, can we create an article name "human right violation by US army"?</li>
<li>If an indian　soldier steal something from a shop,can we create an article name "Human right violation by the indian Army"?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If NO is the answer for all above questions,how on earth we say some actions by the STF personals should be categorized as "human right abuses by STF"&#160;??
<dl>
<dd>editor should prove GOSL or the Higher ranks officers of STF were personally involved or directed these actions..if not, this should be immediately directed to a place in the dustbin.finally wikipedia should not be a place to express your personal vendetta .</dd>

<dd>notable? Also, simply packing an article with such accusations, none of which have been proven, and most of which have been done by indivudual soldiers, just dilutes Wikipedia and needlessly opens it up for abuse.</dd>
<dd>Also, take a look at the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Army_6d69.html" title="US Army">US Army</a> article. It doesn't contain any mentions of massacares or such. The IDF article just has a section titled <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html#Criticism" title="Israel Defense Forces">critisism</a>, which is more than acceptable. Wikipedia is not a place to list every single such accusation. We can't just do a Google search and copy everything that comes up onto Wikipedia, which appears to be what has happened here. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><b>talk</b></a></font> / <font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><b>@</b></a></font> )</sup> 04:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first doesn't give enough details (e.g., where the shootings possibly provoked). The second and third are hardly noteworthy. Essentially, after all is said and done, I probably <b>deleted &gt;80% of the text of this article</b> pre-merger. I <i>do</i> believe, however, that the text of the intro and disappearances sections should be kept (perhaps as one section). I can be swayed on the "Extrajudicial killings" section, but that's probably more a matter for the article's talk page. I am in favor of having a more general section titled "Criticisms" that lists general facts (like the disappearances and the book qutoe) rather than specific sections. If you like, by all means do so. I decided to do the merger so that potentially useful information would not be lost, but I ended up deleting most of it myself.

<li><b>reply to Black Falcon</b>- First a big thank for spending your time in helping to make this a better article..Hats off to you&#160;!! BUT certain issues still remain to be solved..I would say immediately.As you have correctly pointed out the whole abuses section was made by just one editor ,who posses an extreme hatred towards anything SriLanka..The whole thing is a copyvio and thoroughly unencyclopedic ..Some of these accusations such as threatening a union leader is absolutely not notable..<b>Even if its true, how on earth we accuses the whole STF for that&#160;??</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole Extrajudicial killings" section ,as you have correctly pointed out must go to a place in the dustbin..We can keep the disappearance part,as it ,true or not, directly accusing the STF ..And it should be under a category, like "criticism" just as the IDF article..IF raiding the TRO is a crime, then raiding every single Al-Qaeda cell is a crime..TRO is a proven pro-LTTE organization and <b>regular raids should be carried out in order to safe guard the innocent people of SriLanka</b>..SL have certain rules such as emergency laws, to combat terrorism and using them cant be categorize as "Abuses"..If you read the points i made earlier, this article could create havoc here..The whole wikipedia may go crazy if maniacs start making "Abuses" articles ,insulting every single institution in the world&#160;!! If someone from the <a href="../../../n/h/k/NHK_c31c.html" title="NHK">NHK</a> sexually harass a lady ,can we create an article name "Suxual abuses by NHK employees"&#160;??.Common sense says we Cant..But this article gives us the impressions, WE CAN..thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 06:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree. No matter how well-sourced a statement is, and no matter how reliable and neutral its source, it should not be kept if it is irrelevant or trivial. I've made three changes so far: (1) I renamed the section title to "Criticism"; (2) I deleted the "Abuses of rights" section -- one threat and an instance of a raid are hardly sufficient to condemn an entire institution; (3) I deleted the 9 Oct. 2002 shooting incident as the circumstances of the shooting are not made clear in the source -- it may have been an accidental shooting, a provoked shooting, etc. Criticism of an institution should, as you note, refer to a pattern of behavior by its members. The disappearances section makes such a claim (responsibility for 5% of disappearances over a period of 9 years). As you note, it's truthfulness is not at issue--it is verifiable and that is all that is needed and relevant. As for what's left of the "Extrajudicial killings" section, I am considering a way to trim it down because, even putting aside POV concerns, it just reads awkward and disconnected from the rest of the text. I will watch the page over the next week or so to see if POV is reintroduced into the section. Thank you for your comments and your acknowledgement.

I hope you will make adjustment to the "Extrajudicial killings" too..As this,you have correctly pointed out,make no sense at all.Also, thanks for promising to keep an eye on this ,for a while..I have the feeling that, this editor might pop up soon and start messing this article again.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 05:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't know who started this article or why, but I don't want to automatically assume that it was a bad-faith creation. He or she may have simply thought that this was enough information to merit an article of its own. I have added one more sentence to the "Extrajudicial killings" section but really can't think of any other changes in the absence of additional sources. As per your concern above, I have noted at the start of the subsection that the examples given are of "extrajudicial killings involving <i>members of the STF</i>" (emphasis added), and thus not necessarily sanctioned by the STF itself (this last part is implied, but to write it in might violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). I am currently working on topics related to other countries--Iran and Yemen--but will periodically check the STF article for potentially NPOV material (given that the STF is an active organization, I suppose unsourced accusations might even be libelous). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlack_Falcon_2e2e.html" title="User talk:Black Falcon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Black_Falcon_e059.html" title="Special:Contributions/Black Falcon">contribs</a>) 05:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
