<p>Here are some good reasons not to delete it: first, the Society has been written about many times in mainstream publications; second, it has been listed in various listings of international organizations since its founding in 1982; third, it is the oldest and best known of the "ultra high IQ" organizations.</p>
<p>Size alone is not a good indication of "encyclopedic" nature in this case, because the nature of the Society limits its size. A better criterion would be "utility." Currently the entry is referenced several hundred times per day. That qualifies it at as a useful entry.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not a member of the Mega Society though I spent two years trying to join it. There is shamefully little work being done in the area of high-range psychometrics (above 4 SD) and the founder of Mega is one of the few experts in the field. Now you might well think that the concept of g, general intelligence, is not valid, and that therefore not only high-end psychometrics but all psychometrics that attempt to measure IQ are not valid. But many reputable scientists would disagree with you. It is not in the category of, say, astrology. Since you (hopefully) wouldn't dream of deleting the article on IQ, why delete one of the few societies pioneering its use and measurement on the far right tail of the bell curve? Brian</li>

<dd>Well, provide with some citations about the worthwhile scientific research this society is conducting, and then the article ought to be able to stay.

<dd>The criteria for notability, and indeed the notion that notability is even relevant, have been hotly debated. I notice that some of the debate concerns inclusion of college fraternities.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mega is not a large society, but the idea that there's only one active member refers to the so-called "Mega Society East," founded by Mega member Chris Langan (not Langdon). Langan insisted that his society was the real one but not even one other member of Mega went along with him and he lost a court decision and is now prohibited from using any form of the name "Mega Society." He also lost an ICANN arbitration regarding Mega Society domain names. Details can be found on this page: <a href="http://www.megasociety.org/about.html" class="external free" title="http://www.megasociety.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.megasociety.org/about.html</a> . The real Mega Society has many active members, as is obvious when one examines recent issues of *Noesis*. As for Langdon being a bigot, his jokes pages contain jokes about many different ethnicities, religions, etc. Categories include: Arab, Horrid Nursery Rhymes, Black, Interbreeding, Misc./Mixed Ethnicities, Buddhist, Irish, Polish, Celebrity, Jewish, Polish/Italian, Chain Letter, "Johnny," Polish Pope, Christian, Knock Knock, Redneck, Commercial Parodies, Lawyer, Scientology, Dead Baby, Lightbulb, Sex, Dyslexia, Mexican, and Space. It would be pretty exhausting to hate all of these groups. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.126.182.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.126.182.196_a941.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.126.182.196">contribs</a>) 22:27, July 15, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Mega Society has a number of members other than Kevin Langdon, as can easily be ascertained by looking over recent issues of *Noesis*. I *can't* tell you what test I took to get into the Mega Society because the founder of the predecessor 606 Society (6-in-a-million cutoff), Chris Harding, didn't explain the basis on which he invited members. Members of 606 were grandfathered into the Mega Society when it was founded. However, as the limit of what can be measured with reasonable precision is somewhere around the 606 qualifying level the difference in cutoff levels is academic. Mega does the best it can to select members at its nominal cutoff level. It may be that the actual cutoff is a few points lower; that's the price you pay for pushing the limits of psychometric science. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Langdon_c518.html" title="User:Kevin Langdon">Kevin Langdon</a> 08:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Commment</b> Does it strike you as strange that this person is looking down his or her nose at IQ 150 (the one in a thousand level)? This IQ elitism is characteristic of Mega Society member and sore loser Chris Langan. In fact, when several Mega members took the Mobius Test, by Edward Cyr, an extremely difficult test, I got the highest score and Ron Hoeflin was just one point behind me. The objection to my compilation of jokes is irrelevant and absurd. The study of jokes is as valid as the study of any other sociological phenomenon; I am not endorsing prejudice and the butt of many jokes which stigmatize whole demographic groups is not the group stigmatized but those who stigmatize them (as in certain jokes about Blacks which really target the intolerance of rednecks). --Kevin Langdon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.82.9.59 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.82.9.59.html" title="User talk:66.82.9.59">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.82.9.59_f6cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.82.9.59">contribs</a>) 15:38, July 16, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>This quotation is extracted from a longer section in which Hoeflin is arguing that biological evolution is an ongoing process. This is the same point that Nicholas Wade makes in his new book <i>Before the Dawn</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-59420-079-3</a>). While I don't persionally agree with the argument, there are scholars who do. However, how did we get to discussing whether the Society is "scholarly" anyway? The original reason given for deleting the article was that the Society was not "notable." This ambiguous criterion was then defined as requiring that the Society has been discussed in the "mainstream" press. That criterion has been satisfied. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 00:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This commentary confused the action of the California Board of Psychology against what it saw as "the unlicensed practice of psychology" with *Omni's* lawsuit. I don't know where the $30,000 figure came from, but *Omni* sued me for *a million dollars* after I received an overwhelming number of answer sheets in a very short time (the test was taken by over 27,000 people after appearing in the April 1979 issue of *Omni*), most of them within the first few months after publication. I had problems with my computer (they were even more buggy back then) and it took me many months to catch up with my backlog. When I did I supplied *Omni* with a list of testees and they verified that I had, in fact, gotten results to most of them (some had moved during the period of delay); the lawsuit was settled and I didn't have to pay a dime (I'm sure glad they didn't get my million dollars&#160;:-) ). The cost of scoring was $2.50. How would you like to have to open all those envelopes, input the data from each answer sheet, score all these tests, and mail out results and interpretive materials for $2.50 a pop? As for the California Board of Psychology's objection to my IQ testing activity, it's unconstitutional. The First Amendment's right of freedom of assembly guarantees very-high-IQ people the right to form societies and select members any damn way we want; we sure can't rely on the standard tests to select at our target level. The abusive language above indicates that HowlinWolf has some kind of axe to grind. It should also be noted that his accusation of fraud is libelous. --Kevin Langdon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.126.182.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.126.182.196_a941.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.126.182.196">contribs</a>) 22:27, July 15, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Just to be clear, are the citations I've provided insufficient to establish "notability" because (1) the publications cited are not "mainstream", or (2) I did not provide issue dates, or (3) I did not provide enough citations, or (4) "notability" is not established by citations. I can deal with each of these, but I'd like to know where the deficiency lies. Also, as should be pretty obvious by now, the society is certainly "notable" in that a lot of people are very interested in it, which the members will agree is not always a good thing. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 01:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The answer to your question is #2, 3, 4, and 5. Saying that you are aware of an article in such-and-such magazine is not enough. Show us the article. However, even if you did tell us which articles in which issues of the magazines you listed mention the Mega Society, I still doubt that would be enough. Just because it's in a magazine, even if it's mainstream, doesn't make it notable. We are an encyclopedia, not a magazine, and our standards are just a tad bit higher. Mentions in magazines are a factor in determining notability, but only one factor. Which brings me to #5, which granted you didn't apply an actual number to. Another factor for determining notability is whether "a lot of people are very interested in it" -- although again, interest alone is not enough. But I'm curious as to why you say it "should be pretty obvious" by now that a lot of people are interested in it, because it's certainly not obvious to me. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 01:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is a broad enough sample of "mainstream" to establish "notability." As for Google News, many "notable" organizations will not have generated news articles in the recent past; a search for "mega society" in Google Groups returns over 350 hits and in Google proper over 9000. Finally, we can determine that several hundred people view the entry each day because several dozen people follow the link to the Mega Society home page. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 04:36, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to contradict yourself when you appeal to a common sense notion of "smartness" and yet in the same sentence deny the existence of intelligence. However, this probably is off the subject of whether the Mega Society entry should be deleted; maybe we should move the discussion to sci.psychology.theory or comp.ai or you can email me directly. The only relevant point seems to be your use of the term "homebrew" which implies "slipshod" which is simply not true; Hoeflin (and Towers, and others) have done an enormous amount of first rate work in assembling and norming these tests. The details can be found here (<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html</a>). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 13:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Uh, if this is part of a campaign by Byrgenwulf and Jeffire against Langan and the CTMU (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe_7557.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe</a>), they should know that Langan and the Mega Society had a major falling out years ago (resulting in a court battle over the rights to the name "Mega Society").</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, it is not appropriate to call for evidence of notability on the talk page of an article and then put that article up for deletion in less than an hour. The Mega Society has been written up numerous times in the media. It is probably the best known high IQ society, after Mensa. Anyone looking into IQ societies and high IQ tests will immediately encounter references to it. I personally have known about it for 8 or 9 years. (And for the record, I have no association with it whatsoever.) Because Jeffire and Byrgenwulf have acted so hastily, who could possibly have time to track down offline articles from numerous periodicals over more than two decades before the vote is completed? I'm certainly far too busy in my personal life to do so in a few days.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my experience, thoughtful Wikipedians do their own searches for evidence of notability and discuss their results on the talk page of an article, and only then bring it up for deletion when there is clearly no evidence of notability. On Wikipedia, editors bringing an article up for deletion have a responsibility to give valid reasons why they think the material is not notable, not simply claim it appears to be not notable. They also have a responsibility to allow time for an appropriate discussion; with a less-trafficked article it would be easy to band together and rush into delete it before those in the know even have time to find out about the vote. This is not a race to delete; this process should be handled with care and deliberation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly encourage Byrgenwulf and Jeffire to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. In particular, you need to understand the important difference between <i>notable</i> and <i>famous</i>. Just because an organization is obscure, does not mean it is non-notable. In this particular case, the Mega Society is highly notable for anyone wanting to know more about high IQ subculture. That is the appropriate context in which to analyze the Mega Society's notability.</dd>

<dd>In a formal debate the judges would quickly cross out arguments not backed up, but here we are not judges but editors, and this is not a debate but an encyclopedia. Our job is to improve the quality of the article or seek out convincing data that it should be deleted, not rush to cross out what wasn't done right in the first place because someone else should have done it right. We all always have the burden of backing up our own actions, especially deletion of an entire article. This is the only way of gaining consensus and preventing our actions from being undone by other editors.</dd>

<dd>It is entirely appropriate to list an article for deletion if one suspects non-notability <b>and does research or engages in discussion on the talk page to bolster their suspicion</b>. I have seen great care taken in removing mere references to obscure topics in an article, let alone an entire article itself. Mature editors do their own research into a topic before bringing it up for AfD. If you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> you will see that it clearly states non-notability is ambiguous and that if you use NN as a reason for deletion you must carefully qualify your reasoning. Jefffire and Byrgenwulf did not qualify their reasoning, and they are the ones who decided to bring it up for deletion (in less than an hour, a page that had been around for 2 years and was ineligible for speedy deletion).</dd>

If the article is not well-trafficked a group of individuals desiring deletion, by random chance alone, could easily overwhelm the debate during a time in which proponents of the article are absent. That is precisely why those bringing an article up for deletion have an obligation to do <i>their own</i> research into the notability of the topic instead of brazenly bringing it up for deletion. —<a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 06:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"It is entirely appropriate to list an article for deletion if one suspects non-notability <b>and does research or engages in discussion on the talk page to bolster their suspicion</b>."</i> This is patently false. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#The_policy" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states, "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending on one's POV), Wikipedia is not the U.S. courts system, and one is not innocent until proven guilty. The onus is on editors wishing to include the material to show why the topic is notable, not for those who wish to delete it to show why it is non-notable. Nevertheless, Byrgenwulf (in his follow-up comments) as well as myself and William Pietri have shown why we believe the Mega Society is non-notable; other editors have stated why they believe it is notable, although IMHO it is not enough.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>This deletion debate horrifies me. When I read 1984, where anyone whom the ruling elite didnt like was made an "unperson" and all records of him erased, I thought, thank God that's fiction. When I read about the old Soviet Encyclopedia, and how anyone who fell out of favor had his article (as well as his life) deleted, and all users were sent a letter by the NKVD telling them to cut that article out of the volume, I thought, thank God I dont live there. But this is chillingly real.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to my horror.</p>
<p>1. I have devoted my life to halping the ultra-high IQ societies gain the credibility they deserve. I first heard of the Mega Society almost 20 years ago, thanks to a cover story in New York magazine. Some of its members became famous, just by being accepted. It is as respected among us as MIT or Harvard are in the world at large. To find that there are people out there who have never heard of it is as shocking to me as when I moved to the Midwest and found people who have never heard of Wordsworth or Rodin. It means that perhaps my life so far has been in vain.</p>
<p>2. I was at first skeptical of Wikipedia, and the whole notion of a grass-roots internet encyclopedia. I've edited a few entries over the years, but I hesitated to devote much effort to work which could be deleted by the first vandal who came across it. But as time passed I became a believer. The thing worked. But now, in the one area I know about, I have seen just HOW it works. Nameless, faceless, ill-informed accusers can at any time delete an area they object to. They pretend to be a democracy but must out of necessity be an oligarchy. And, since no group of a few hundred people can know everything, they must out of necessity be ill-informed about most of the subject matter they consider for deletions. It's a sad (yet almost humourous) blend of Kafka and Joseph Heller. It doesnt much matter now. Wikipedia is young, and one of many souirces of information. But what happens when it becomes the gold standard? What happens when it becomes the Mega Society of the information world?</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Thanks for allowing comments. There appears to be very little advantage to deleting information and some benefit to keeping it. Why restrict the knowledge or information, unless patently fradulent? Editing, of course, is desirable, as with all submissions, but deletion actually subtracts value from Wikipedia, and retaining it can only add to it. I know nothing of Langdon, but if he is a fraud, or a racist, or the second coming of the Messiah, publish that information and the controversy in the Mega article. In fact, if he is all those things, it actually adds weight to it's inclusion, in order to keep Wikipedia readers well informed. Should we eliminate comments on Enron, or the NSDAP? It is all information, and it's relative value is it's accuracy, not it's politics, legal compliance, recent impact, or obnoxious opinions. Thanks again for soliciting comments!

<li><b>Comment</b> in response to Tox, who states, "In this particular case, the Mega Society is highly notable for anyone wanting to know more about high IQ subculture. That is the appropriate context in which to analyze the Mega Society's notability." This is wholly untrue. In order for any topic to be notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, which Wikipedia is, it needs to be notable <i>period</i>, not notable just for people wanting to know about high-IQ subculture. A group of 25 people with extremely high IQs does not make a notable club. A group of 25 people with extremely high IQs that <i>does something</i> might, depending on what that something is. Some of the people wishing for this article to be kept stated that the group does some scientific research, but never explained what that research was. Magazine articles used to establish notability must do exactly that--<i>establish notability</i>--not just prove existence. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no such thing as being notable <i>period</i>. Values are subjective, so "notable" is in the eyes of the beholder. These "eyes" change as one descends into the bowels of an encyclopedia written above the eighth grade level. For example, here is a sentence extracted from today's featured article: "The only important British honours over which the Prime Minister does not have control are the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thistle.html" title="Thistle">Thistle</a>, and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merit.html" title="Merit">Merit</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Victorian_Order_8658.html" title="Royal Victorian Order">Royal Victorian Order</a>, which are all within the 'personal gift' of the Sovereign." This is a fact that is "notable" only to (some) citizens of the UK. But this sentence is entirely appropriate in the context of an article on the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. What is "notable" depends upon the context in which the article is likely to be looked at. In the Mega Society article's case, this context is likely to be the context of high IQ societies. I take it as established that the existence of the Mega Society in that context is "notable".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The new requirement that the <i>activities</i> of the society be "notable", as opposed to the <i>existence</i> of the society, strikes me as pushing an already ambiguous standard further into dangerous territory. The assembly of the society required bootstrapping over a period of years starting with <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a>. Science has been defined as the process of "torturing nature for her secrets" and the study of many phenomena is best done where these phenomena are extreme. This is why we build high energy particle colliders, for example. Hoeflin and Langdon are pioneers in the area of testing for high intelligence, an area that traditional psychometrics largely ignores because there is very little economic incentive to explore it. Sometimes we need to look over the horizon a bit and go beyond immediate economic value. Assuming that intelligence is an important thing to understand, they are trailblazers in a potentially fertile area. The society is notable because it is <i>possible</i> in the same way that climbing <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Everest_bc8a.html" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a> is notable because it is <i>there</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 00:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allow me to refer you to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)</a>: "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of <b>activities</b> are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source." This requirement is not new, it was first posited about 6 hours into this discussion when Byrgenwulf said, "Well, provide with some citations about the worthwhile scientific research this society is conducting, and then the article ought to be able to stay. Until then, it hardly meets criteria for notability."</dd>

<dd>The criterion about <b>scope</b> in the context of the proposed criteria for organizations in the essay on notability is clearly intended to exclude purely local organizations like my Boy Scouts troop. The scope of the <b>activities</b> of the Mega Society is international in that it (1) has members in more than one country, and (2) publishes a newsletter that is distributed to more than one country. One of the Wikipedia articles that I've contributed to is <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Cove_State_Park_ccdf.html" title="Crystal Cove State Park">Crystal Cove State Park</a> which is as far from international as it is possible to get. Nonetheless, no one is suggesting it be deleted. However, this is descending into mere wordplay. I've read the essay on notability and I think it is quite clear that the Mega Society is notable as defined in that essay.

<li><b>Comment.</b> NORTH's concept of notability clearly concerns importance. However, importance and notability are not synonymous. Both notability and importance are subjective, but their respective sepectrums do not line up. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> discusses this to some extent. There are plenty of things that are notable but unimportant. For instance, if I overheard a conversation about so-and-so who died and clearly perceived this was some famous person, but did not hear enough information to acertain what they did, I might come home and look that person up on Wikipedia. Not being a fan of most team sports, if I were to find out it was a basketball player, I would find that person unimportant, however, I would clearly understand why they were notable and listed in Wikipedia. And, one of the major reasons they would be notable is that you are likely to hear their name and (if you don't know who they are, you need somewhere to look them up). That is why the importance of the topic itself is different from the importance of having the topic in Wikipedia. Notability is much more closely related to the importance of having the topic in Wikipedia than the importance of that topic in the grand scheme of things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The same applies to the Mega Society. If they do absolutely nothing and have no important impact on society that doesn't matter so long as you are likely to encounter their name and need a place to look them up. Since they have been in major periodicals multiple times over the last couple decades, that is a definite possibility. Furthermore — and this is where context especially plays a role — if you were to research high IQ subculture (and/or measurement of high IQs) you would immediately encounter the Mega Society, the Mega Test, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Langan_efd6.html" title="Christopher Langan">Christopher Langan</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Vos_Savant_486a.html" title="Marilyn Vos Savant">Marilyn Vos Savant</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a>, Kevin Langdon, and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Hoeflin_3419.html" title="Ronald Hoeflin">Ronald Hoeflin</a>. I know because years ago I got interested in the subject and upon looking around the Web I quickly encountered all of those topics. Since high IQ subculture, including high IQ societies, is a notable topic, and the Mega Society is a highly notable element of that subculture, it becomes important to understanding the subculture itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NORTH, you keep harping on the argument that Wikipedia being an encyclopedia negates the desire to have an obscure topic in it. There are reasons not to have an obscure topic in a 20th century encyclopedia, but not a 21st century one. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia_Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia." title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia.</a> The reasons to leave the Mega Society out of a 20th century encyclopedia are fairly obvious: the physical constraints of searching through, carrying around, and storing a paper encyclopedia. Since with Wikipedia we no longer have those constraints, we can and definitely should include topics that are less obviously notable on a grand scale, but are highly notable in notable contexts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The obscurity of a topic makes an article on it more useful, rather than less useful. The less likely you are to know about a topic, the more likely you are going to need an article on it. The relationship between obscurity, notoriety, and importance of a topic, and expected information return from an article gets quite complicated (and would probably be highly interesting research on the information content of Wikipedia and its resultant utility). The ideal topic for a Wikipedia article (as far as information return is concerned) would be a maximally obscure, maximally notable, and maximally important topic. That would entail a topic that you have a high probability of not knowing about, that you have a high probability of encountering, and that has a high level of intrinsic information (ie its effect on the world is great). Of course, in the real world these parameters are going to affect each other and this post is already too long for an AfD to look at the interrelationship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Suffice it to say, Wikipedia becomes useless if you can't catch the tail end of an NPR piece, see a reference to some organization in someone's CV, or thoroughly research the various aspects of a specific topic (ie high IQ subculture or Canon's example of the British Prime Minister). I want a Wikipedia in which I can do so. What use is Wikipedia if I can only look up what I would find in a 20th century encyclopedia? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/x/User_talk%7ETox_d43e.html" title="User talk:Tox">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tox_85eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tox">contribs</a>) 05:45, 17 July 2006 GMT.</small></dd>

("Mega Society" = 9,100 google web hits.) The Wiki article receives a steady stream of hits. That passes the notability test in my eyes. As for many of the other claims here, such as whether it performs scientific activity, its membership level, the validity of its entrance requirements or of the concept of IQ in general: these are simply irrelevant issues.

<li>Number of members is irrelevant, given the one-in-a-million qualification level.</li>
<li>IQ is not bogus. If IQ is bogus, then how come that people we perceive as "smart" typically achieve high IQ scores, while the people we perceive as "dumb" typically achieve low scores? Pure coincidence? I don't think so.</li>
<li>The only (relevant) controversial question here is the quality of the test used for admission, i.e. 1) does it really measure intelligence, and 2) is purported one-in-a-million cutoff reliable enough.

<dd>Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. Its capacity is unlimited and, thanks to search engines, little-used entries do not clutter things up. That's why, as far as I know, notability has NEVER been an accepted criterion for deleting an otherwise valid article. Notability is not always immediately apparent. This is especially true of an organization. One of its members might later become famous, and it would be of great interest to historians to trace the people and ideas who were formative influences on him. An article about an organization to which he belonged could be of immense value. It is far from improbable that Mega might one day have famous or influential member. Also I should note that the criteria for notability of organizations are badly defined, if at all. (It's an ongoing project.) Take a look at all the college fraternities that have their own articles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities</a> Are they notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> 4.156.123.210 18:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC) This discussion, itself, is evidence of the notability of the Mega Society in the context of high-IQ groups and high-range psychometrics. May-Tzu</li>

<p>Keep. Criticisms of the officers/founders are not relevant to the issue of the validity (and historical or current "interestingness" ) of an entry. Mega Society is a well-recognized entity with a history and with meaning within the high-intelligence organization world (HiQdom), and deletion of it would not serve informational goals. Similarly, deletion would set a worrisome example, if done for political or personal reasons. Norming/admissions standards are evolving (for the most part) with all HiQ groups, and the fact that some people might be grandfathered into organizations where according to current practice they could not gain admittance is an issue germane to the groups themselves (and not really of external concern). I see no value in deleting the group from Wiki and many strong reasons for retaining it.--M Stewart<a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstewarthm_a3e5.html" title="User:Mstewarthm">Mstewarthm</a> 18:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - Why, after the initial reasons fell flat, were others so desperately attempted?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here (for reference) are those initial reasons: [a] "Appears to be a non-notable society. I am informed there are only 25 members" (Mr. Jefffffire)</p>
<p>[b] "seem like an advert" (Mr. Beowolff)</p>
<p>Then a Mr. DaturaS complained: "Wikipedia is not here to perpetuate a farce"</p>
<p>Mr. DaturaS further complained: "Strong Delete Totally bogus "society" with only one active member"</p>
<p>Then he added: "Langdon is a known fraud"</p>
<p>Also: "This is about no one other than Kevin Langdon"</p>
<p>Then this from a Mr. HowlinWolf: "No qualified members as far as I can tell."</p>
<p>Then Mr. NORTH jumped in: "Delete per nom and Byrgenwulf; it is a non-notable club" [This can't be because of the small membership, which was the initial "reason," so this must be a different "reason."]</p>
<p>Then came Mr. GWO: "Homebrew high IQ society of no notability."</p>
<p>And then there's a Mr. William Pietri: "I can't help suspecting there's some vanity involved here."</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There must, however, be some sort of discretion upon which diminutive societies/groups warrant some sort of inclusion into Wikipedia. Furthermore, our use of the word "notable" is erroneous. A 25 member bookclub is not notable. Conversely, a highly exclusive IQ society that discriminates at the 1/1,000,000 level is. What the naysayers have been arguing, is whether the society has been previously noted. That is irrelevant. Particularly in our culture, where psychometrics is an established field, the most elite HIQ Society is noteworthy or "notable". <a href="../../../c/d/i/User%7ECDiPoce_76c9.html" title="User:CDiPoce">CDiPoce</a> 19:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>At this point, I'd also like to point out to the "closing admin, and anyone else in power who might be keeping an eye on us", that the naysayers have succumb to ad hominems to refute the validity of the Mega Society entry. Heck, if they could at least SUSTAIN one single argument that even challenges the Mega Society and its qualifications for a page in Wikipedia, I'd give them some credibility. All we've been subjected to is them lamenting the importance that IQs have historically received in society. Their inept arguments seem flat-out petty, to be quite honest. <a href="../../../c/d/i/User%7ECDiPoce_76c9.html" title="User:CDiPoce">CDiPoce</a> 00:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) Is it "notable"? "Notable" means "worthy of being noticed, important", but the context is undefined and the words used in the definition are themselves ambiguous, subject to diverse interpretations.</p>
<p>Who might be interested in examining (and "examination", by definition, requires "taking notice") information about the Mega Society? "Examining" the group, its members or its claims does not mean doing so unquestioningly; it merely entails finding the information interesting/useful as data or conceptually. Interested parties might include:</p>
<p>Those interested, advocationally or professionally, in "high end" intelligence testing; this includes parents of children whose minds remain unchallenged in typical gifted programs, and educators/psychologists who specialize in assessments of and research on the extremely gifted. Many widely used IQ tests have ceilings at or below around 150 IQ (aside: If Kevin Langden did score "only" a 150 IQ, he may have done so on one of these tests); for the most part, this is all that is pragmatically needed, but such instruments fail for a small sector of the population. With the internet making homeschooling and distance university studies more feasible, determining which students might benefit from an educational plan outside the school's usual offerings demands higher priority. If the student is an adolescent, one may need some testing geared towards adults....an area where the ability and motivation to measure at the far right end of the bell curve has been (for various practical reasons) minimal. Even if the tests used by Hoeflin, Langdon and others are flawed, the theoretical constructs underlying these tests may be of interest to researchers in high-end psychometrics; better high end testing could emerge from a synthesis of methods and philosophies.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been an interest in how the extremely gifted develop, function in the realms of work/intimacy/internal fulfillment, over the lifespan; there has also been an interest in whether other, ostensibly unrelated, mental and behavioral traits are more common in those of particular intelligence at various points in the lifespan. Hollingworth, for example, wrote extensively about the social difficulties and correlated later personality traits in a cohort of profoundly gifted persons followed from childhood through maturity. Lewis Terman conducted similar research, and Grady Towers has summarized the findings in several articles (google his name!). Several researchers have looked for correlations between Jungian personality type and IQ, and found that the percentage of introverts increases as one moves up the IQ scale. A Polish psychiatrist, Dubrowski, interests a number of adult "gifted persons", due to his research linking developmental potential to innate mental traits (called "overexcitabilities"). High IQ groups (even ones with few members) may be *worth examining* for those interested in personality/behavioral/philosophical traits associated with varying degrees of giftedness; those interested in such correlations psychologists - but also, a growing number of adults trying to "come to terms" with how their own giftedness may have affected their childhoods and contributed to deeply entrenched attitudes during adulthood. Reading autobiographical statements in high IQ society journals, and (moreso) "reading between the lines" of less personal articles, may give interested parties greater insight into the personalities of the extremely gifted.</p>
<p>Grady Towers' article "The Outsiders" is a great place to start - and he culled some of his info (which basically supported Leta Hollingworth's claims) from members of the ultra-high-IQ societies.</p>
<p>For such people, I believe that the Mega society is "worth noticing", important - and thus, notable. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESol.delune_b60c.html" title="User:Sol.delune">Sol.delune</a> 00:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)sol.delune</p>

<p>In April of this year, Mega Society’s founder, Dr. Ronald Hoeflin, was interviewed for over five hours by CNN for a one-hour special on genius. This documentary will probably air (on nationwide cable television in the U.S.) in September. It is probable that some discussion of Mega Society will be included in the final edit when it airs. To verify, I suggest contacting CNN’s Susan Mittleman, who is a producer with CNN's medical unit and conducted the interview. Bryan Vare 04:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. NORTH (and possibly others) are equating notability only with what a person or organization does. This is an erroneous equation, though perhaps understandable since most people and organizations are notable because of what they do. However, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Wadlow_1478.html" title="Robert Wadlow">Robert Wadlow</a> is notable only because he was the tallest (confirmed) man to have ever lived. His notoriety led to his fame. Similary (and contrary to what NORTH said) <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_vos_Savant_bc35.html" title="Marilyn vos Savant">Marilyn vos Savant</a> was notable because of her intelligence. Her notoriety led to her fame which led to much of what she did (such as her PARADE colum).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Mega Society is notable because of what it is, not what it does. Indeed, its many listings in the popular media are not direct evidence of its notability, but rather that it <i>has been noted</i>. The fact that something has been noted shows that there are people who believe it is worthy of note, which is the definition of notable. Whether you think the Mega Society is worthy of note is not the point. It is whether enough people think it is worthy of note. Popular media attention is one of the best indicators we have about large numbers of people considering any topic, including the Mega Society, worthy of note. If enough people consider a topic worthy of note, then a Wikipedia article becomes useful. —<a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 09:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are no qualified members and faulty admission criteria so article is misleading. The editor has an IQ well below the criteria they require (150 v. 180).

Hence, matters of inclusion or exclusion are decided entirely *subjectively*, by personal fiat of those who rule. An encyclopedia is more useful than a cult. - May-Tzu</p>

<li><b>Comment for Closing Admin</b> Several people have said that they pitied the closing administrator. Instead, I feel envy. This is a great opportunity for him or her to make a contribution to Wikipedia that far exceeds this individual case. My dad was a professor of administrative law and from the time I was a kid he drummed into me three things that make a fair decision under administrative law different from an arbitrary decision by administrative fiat. They are notice, hearing, and (perhaps most important) reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. <b>Notice</b> As it now stands, the parties affected by a deletion are not told about it. They must learn about it by chance. Yes, these parties may well have a POV. But they are also uniquely qualified to provide relevant information. And uniquely injured by an incorrect deletion. 2.<b>Hearing</b> The deletion procedure does indeed provide a good hearing, provided people are aware of it. Thank you for that. 3.<b>Reasons</b> If the closing admin writes up a short statement of reasons for his or her decision, this will help guide future administrators in future cases. As I understand it, there is no clear policy on notability. It may be applied differently in different cases, and whether or not something is deleted will depend on who the admin is. If reasons are given in this case, they may be used to guide future cases. Not as binding precedent, but for guidance, and, over time Wikilaw will evolve. Thank you and good luck.

<dd>Hi, Brian. Thanks for commenting. I appreciate your concern, but this isn't a trial; it's a discussion where we try to come to agreement. With certain exceptions for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living people</a>, the effect we have on article subjects is not a criterion we consider while editing. Instead, we focus on serving our readers. It's also important to understand that Wikipedia works through consensus, which is very different than the adversarial model of the western legal system. Respect for precedent and law is also not part of the culture, as you can see from the encouragment to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> and our spirit of eventualism. I hope that helps. To find out more, you might start with <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">the Five Pillars</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This may have been possible in the early days but I dont think it is now. Norbert Weiner once wrote that the limit of a small self-governing community where everyone knows each other and can reach consensus is about 100. You cant know every editor and I'm sure not every editor knows about this decision. You might well be a self-organizing system, but if you make a mathematical model of it, you might find that model predicts articles being deleted and then undeleted in an infinite cycle.
