<li>While the site itself is not the subject of much discussion in magazines, some of the various artists who associate themselves with the site have had their works featured in Japanese and Australian magazines including the creators of Marioween/Blue Twilight and Halo Zero, both of which were either displayed in magazines or on gamespot. Also, the article promises to feature a history of the community concerned with the site, so clearly the purpose of the article is NOT advertising. Both of the titles I was discussing earlier are distributed through channels that aren't directly associated with the site and both titles offer reference to the site in question... which makes it qualifiable under part III of the notability for webcontent. --DimensionWarped 04:28, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Regardless to whether the site is discussed at length or not, content created with relation to the site is distributed by largely recongnized media sources. That fits the rule. If you question that reasoning against deletion, then I'll have to question your reasoning for insistance that this isn't a notable site.--DimensionWarped 05:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To those who are simply saying "delete," state your arguments as to why, in particular, where it fails the Wikipedia standards test. In other words, substantiate your claims. Otherwise, you have no argument. My Arguments for non deletion: As mentioned, this site has been the launchpad for various notable projects as mentioned and is one of the most active fangame communities still around, and it has gone through quite a bit. Many other communities have come and gone, such as Zelda Fangames HQ and Megaman Fangames HQ, but despite the attacks on the site and its community which even took it down from the internet for a while, and demonstrates a fangame community which thrives on just that. Again, many have tried, but they have failed many times. SFGHQ again has a decent amount of success stories, such as the above mentioned games, compared to the other fan game communities, including the much larger Mario Fangame Galaxy.</li>

<li>Shadix here, it would be nice if you guys would at least give us a chance to put our article together some. SFGHQ is rich in history and remains one of the larger franchise Fangaming sites out there. There is also quite a bit of useful information that can still be put on it. -Shadixep 05:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I wholly support the non-deletion of this article. As previously stated, the article is a work-in-progress and just because you, as a non-Sonic fangamer think the site is non-notable doesn't mean it actually isn't. It's THE most active Sonic fangaming site to date, the longest-running and is associated with the Mario Fangames Galaxy as well as the Sonic Stuff Research Group (when it was on Emulationzone.org) and also is rich in history. As far as non-notable goes, I think you haven't had a toe in the ocean that is fangaming and really either didn't research it at all or only had a little look at it. --<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESuspchaos_6cd5.html" title="User:Suspchaos">Suspchaos</a> 06:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It goes without saying that people involved with the site would believe that the site is rich in history. That doesn't make it notable in a general-interest sense. Claiming that those in favor of deletion "have no argument" doesn't help your case at all. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though not mentioning your case at all and just saying the site is "non-notable" doesn't give you a case to argue either. We have mentioned few of SFGHQ's history which you have obviously overlooked in your quest to see this page removed. I must also mention, according to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> linked to.

<li>All that really matters is that it meets the criteria for notability. And it meets that criteria, so I really don't see how there can be any further argument on it. Atlus meets the criteria for notability simply for articles on games they produced. The magnitude-ignoring assumption there is that if a product of notability is affiliated with a group, then that group is in itself notable. And people, this isn't a bloody vote. It's a debate on notability. Either state legitimate reasons or don't state anything at all.--DimensionWarped 08:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't delete it. Everybody has their own opinions as to what and what isn't notable. And just because a few people (who interpret the rules incorrectly and to their advantage) find it useless doesn't mean it is. Perhaps you should just ignore it if it is so useless to you. It obviously isn't useless to others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.130.145.169 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.130.145.169_5925.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.130.145.169">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>"Cruft" is an old programmer/hacker term for something that is only important to a select group of people (well, actually it refers to old junk code in a program, but that's another story). So, "Gamecruft" means only gamers would be interested in this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm torn on this one. This site has been around for an eternity and has been very influential in the creation of many notable fangames, but as a website I don't believe it's notable. Only 4,690 results from Google on "SFGHQ", the common abbreviation. Even less for the full name of the website in quotations. The fact that the article itself is a stub, and a rather bad stub at that, doesn't help. Also, note that you're going to get meatpuppets lured in from this forum topic here: <a href="http://sfghqmb.com/showthread.php?t=495" class="external free" title="http://sfghqmb.com/showthread.php?t=495" rel="nofollow">http://sfghqmb.com/showthread.php?t=495</a> -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 22:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not trying to ruin anyone's parade, but policy is policy. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Accounts_created_by_brand_new_users_acting_together_.28.27meatpuppets.27.29" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Meatpuppets</a> are highly discouraged, especially in cases of AfD discussions. I merely linked the relevant topic so it would be understood that there would be a lot of meatpuppets and why. If you'd like to consider that elitist, you may go ahead. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 00:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Policy dictates that the use of such a word is ill advised. If you want to talk about what is highly discouraged, maybe you shouldn't be partaking of the discouraged yourself. I'll assure you that no one from that topic is getting involved here unless they would do so upon their own personal discretion. It isn't some board full of nothing but pitiful flunkies.--DimensionWarped 06:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> DimensionWarped, I have in the past been a SFGHQ member, and no offense to you or anyone else, but all forums, no matter the notability, have their fair share of "me too" bandwagon hoppers. Simply being linked from a current forum topic is going to lead to people seeing the AfD and clicking on it. I prefer all information to be put forth out in the open, so I linked the forum topic and explained the situation so everyone knows as many facts as there are to know. After all, if the site truly is notable, linking a forum topic and saying a few meatpuppets are posting won't make any difference on the consensus. I will note that I'm perfectly happy to change my vote if I see evidence to the contrary, but currently all I see is "A bunch of popular fangames got their start here", which I don't see as notable in of itself. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 08:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Which of these: <i>online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> is it distributed by? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I guess gamespot fits into the category of online magazine, though I'm not certain exactly. They do broadcast, but it would be hard to give them a specific label. There are also some appearances of titles in tangible magazines.--DimensionWarped 16:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the fact that notable games may have come from the site and that notable people have been involved with it is frankly irrelevant. My last name is the same as previous winners of Scottish Chess Championships, but that doesn't mean that I should have my own article. The fact that the site is old doesn't mean that it's notable, either. This fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> because no coverage has been about the site itself, only games that used the site as a "staging ground." There is no notability by proxy here. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 18:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
