<li><b>Comment</b> Not even wiktionary has the swadesh lists independent from each other. They group them and even have language family comparison pages. Would that be more encyclopedic? It would then be more than a list of words and could even be accompanied by analysis. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a href="../../../a/e/u/User_talk%7EAeusoes1_4901.html" title="User talk:Aeusoes1"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></a></span> 18:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The point is that it needs to be more than lists of words and lexical data. I don't see how reorganizing the lists in any way will accomplish that. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 18:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Now if they put it in IPA, it would demonstrate very clearly the differences and similarities between the different languages. This is the point of Swadesh lists. If we made a wikipedia page for different language family swadesh lists, then this deletion wouldn't be nearly as controversial. Language comparison isn't inappropriate for an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. These are not incipient dictionaries, but limited (207 words) samples of languages using a widespread standard. As <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroquant_ee33.html" title="User:Croquant">Croquant</a> notes, these are subpages of articles, and are encyclopedic in nature: they are language samples. And is the fact that I'm a professional linguist relevant to mention here? It's what we'd put in an encyclopedia of the world's languages, and is 'very ill suited to moving to a dictionary', which is something quite different.--<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 17:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's odd that you'd say they're ill-suited to moving to a dictionary, when Wiktionary has already some of these lists itself. I don't understand what noting that they are subpages has to do with anything; that doesn't make it encyclopedic. Note how the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> article is now, with a prominent pointer to the Swadesh list on Wiktionary. It is more appropriate there. These are still lists of lexical data, for which consensus already exists against inclusion, and which is not encyclopedic. Wikipedia is a <i>general</i> encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 19:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, whether wiktionary has them or not is not really the point. Dictionaries are open-ended volumes which give a range of meanings, instances of use, parts of speech etc. Word lists are not there for people to learn the definitions of certain words, but as a basis of linguistic comparison, which is not the purpose of dictionaries. Language pages have a variety of samples of the language itself, and cover areas such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, so I do not understand why lexis should be moved elsewhere. The very strength of the Swadesh lists is that they are standardised. But rather than putting them within the article itself, because of their size it is better to have them as subpages. So I think the Swadesh lists are better kept within Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 07:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a strawman argument. You need to familiarize yourself with Wiktionary, (see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Appendices" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Appendices">wikt:Category:Appendices</a>), for a start, before you propound on the purpose of dictionaries: we're not concerned about those, but about <i>Wiktionary</i>. Rather than asserting that they are inappropriate dictionary articles (you'll want to see <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion">wikt:Wiktionary:Requests for deletion</a> to make that argument), please assert why they <i>are</i> encyclopedic. If you assert that is because they are language comparison (which still doesn't explain why it's encyclopedic), this doesn't make sense: these are stand-alone word lists, and they don't engage in comparison. The irony being that Wiktionary's Swadesh lists do make comparisons. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I don't know much about wiktionary. But my point, to summarise what I put above, is that Swadesh lists are composed of a small amount of lexical data, which is appropriate to demonstrate the lexis of the language, just as it is appropriate to have data on other linguistic areas. And in some cases it might be good to have combined Swadseh lists to demonstrate a language family: an argument could be made for that. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 09:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point should <b>not</b> be the relevance of Swadesh list pages <i>per se</i> in an encyclopedia, but there relevance in the whole set of an encyclopedia article dealing with a language. Due to editorial constraints, such an article may be built from various parts&#160;: main page and sub- or related pages. You can't fairly separate sub- or related pages from the main part of the article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroquant_ee33.html" title="User:Croquant">Croquant</a> 08:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
