<p>Granted, you make several good points.</p>
<p>Ted is neither a household name nor remotely as popular as other internet memes, like Chuck Norris, Mr. T, or David Hasselhoff. However, I first submit his YouTube channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TedJesusChristGod" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TedJesusChristGod" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as evidence upon his behalf, and additionally argue erroneously and irreverently that if I myself had 587 actual returns on Google, I would feel like an internet meme.</p>
<p>Additionally, and more likely to be of any persuasion, I admit that my little article on Ted is in no way authoritive or complete. However, I do think Ted holds just as much weight as the Longniddry railway station and its article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longniddry_railway_station" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longniddry_railway_station" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Yet, Longriddry railway station receives a stub alert and invites Wikipedians to improve it and make it better, while mine is, after epochs of hard keyboard labor and toil, proposed for deletion in under two minutes. And I know how important Neomphalida are, and why they deserve their own Wikipedian article, I'm just proposing that maybe, since Ted is (probably) just as famous - if not more so - as Neomphalida <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomphalida" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomphalida" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> are, that he be allowed to remain. Believe me, if I had any information which I could use to flesh out Longniddry railway station's article, I would hasten to add it, but alas I do not. Instead, I am merely trying to add yet another article on a person who can be, on some not insignificant level, considered a "religious (potentially weirdo cultist schizophrenic?) figure".</p>
<p>I know, it's that eternal argument about Wikipedian censorship, but I'm willing to argue that Ted Jesus Christ GOD is just as worthy of a short Wikipedian article of approximately 10kb in size as anyone else already listed on Wikipedia's article of people who have claimed to be Jesus Christ (which I did not add, may I add)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_claim_to_be_Jesus_Christ" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_claim_to_be_Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for Ted to finally have his own 15kb article? He's listed on several already. I for one consider him to be just as valuable to Wikipedia as Matayoshi Jesus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matayoshi_Jesus" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matayoshi_Jesus" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>I'm just thankful that my article on Australian Green Tree Ants is still going strong.</p>
<p>Your humble servant,</p>

<dd>It's not really censorship as much as the fact that <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neomphalida.html" title="Neomphalida">Neomphalida</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matayoshi_Jesus_a7d7.html" title="Matayoshi Jesus">Matayoshi Jesus</a>, etc. have been documented in external sources, while the subject of this article has not. (Answers.com is a Wikipedia mirror and doesn't really count.)

TJCG himself in an open letter about his life and his short autobiography, confirming most of the article: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tedjesuschristgodallinone/BRIEFCurrentPublicRelationsforTed.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/tedjesuschristgodallinone/BRIEFCurrentPublicRelationsforTed.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>TJCG on his goals, 40 days and 40 nights experience, and Satan's temptation with his saving by angels, which also demonstrates his writing style and details his theology, all on one page. Granted, hard to read, but chocked full of (way too much) information. Chapter 1 of 37 (as of today).<a href="http://www.tedjesuschristgod.org/TrueEnoughThirdTestamenttoBibles/TedisNOTfalseTedisTRUE!_Book1/TedisNOTfalseTedisTRUE.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tedjesuschristgod.org/TrueEnoughThirdTestamenttoBibles/TedisNOTfalseTedisTRUE!_Book1/TedisNOTfalseTedisTRUE.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Third party review of TJCG <a href="http://www.insolitology.com/religious/iam.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insolitology.com/religious/iam.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. But I guess that doesn't matter. You can browse the other two, I'll cite them and others as sources now to appease any and all moderators.</p>

<dd>I thought you'd like to know that I fleshed out the article with extensive sources from Ted himself, virtually corroborating every statement. Sorry I neglected to do it before.

<dd>I thought that it was okay to use self-published sources as long as its in conjunction with an article on the same person. Such as Ted's website for a Wikipedian article on Ted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<p>Self-published sources in articles about themselves</p>
<dl>
<dd>Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it, and where the material is one of the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>relevant to the person's notability, or, if the material is self-published by a group or organisation, relevant to the notability of that group or organisation or not contentious, such as basic biographical information. All information of a self-published nature should be looked at with a critical eye</dd>

<dd><b>About self-published articles as sources:</b> Please take it in context. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> goes on to say:</dd>
<dd>it should also be:
<ul>
<li><b>not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing</b>;</li>
<li>about the subject only, and does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject;</li>
<li>subject to verification by other sources.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Self-published material should always be reported as the POV of the publisher, and <b>not as general fact</b>, until such time as there is independent corroboration of that material. The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all.</dd>
<dd><b>In general, if a self-published source is reliable, then other reliable sources will cite it, until then, it should be avoided.</b></dd>
<dd>Hope this helps.<a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapetite526_7dbe.html" title="User:Mapetite526">Mapetite526</a> 21:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Delete</b> due to lack of notability and lack of reliable sources. I concede that the article is surprisingly well written. However Wikipedia policies don't leave much uncertainty about what to do here. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:39, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
