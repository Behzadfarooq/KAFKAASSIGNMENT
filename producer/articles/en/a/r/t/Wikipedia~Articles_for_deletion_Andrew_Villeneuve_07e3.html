<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 5 keep as is (one of which was opened since the VfD nomination and is discounted as a possible <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">Wikipedia:sockpuppet</a>), 2 keep as redirect and 9 delete (two of whom took the time to say they would also support the redirect). Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, this decision defaults to keep.</p>
<p>Reading through the arguments and supporting links (and filtering out the personal attacks on both sides), I find myself agreeing that, to the extent that Mr Villeneuve has attained notability, it is right now almost solely derivative from his relationship with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Defense_0ae3.html" title="Permanent Defense">Permanent Defense</a>.

<li>Barring further material, I'm going to stand by my vote. It seems that most of Mr. Villeneuve's notability comes through <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Defense_0ae3.html" title="Permanent Defense">Permanent Defense</a>, and that he could be addressed in that article. Look at this article: it contains very few details about Villeneuve himself, and a lot of material about the group. Please don't take this as a slur; just as a comment that perhaps the material covered here should be put elsewhere. I'll change my vote if this article is rewritten such that it is clearly about Mr. Villeneuve, rather than Permanent Defense. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 17:52, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You did not respond satisfactorily in my view. You further disparaged the man and treated him quite contemptuously. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He led an important aspect of opposition statewide to an initiative that would have seen the installation of over 18000 slot machines in Washington State. He succeeded against well-funded, well-organized opposition. This seems clearly notable by any measure, he was quoted representing the opposition in the Seattle Post Intelligencer<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/165437_vsoundoff19.html?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=293" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/165437_vsoundoff19.html?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=293" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The Permanent Defense article reads like a political pamphlet but that's another story. Villeneuve is clearly an important player not just in local politics but statewide and like him or not he warrants an article, with more facts and in more neutral form than the Permanent Defense article. It really should stay. I can help perhaps by adding to it, no one could allege I am sympathetic to his views, I'm not. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a>
<ul>
<li>I suspect Libertas's vote has less to do with the subject matter than the fact that s/he is upset with me over several unrelated disputes (see <a href="../../../l/i/b/User_talk%7ELibertas_0781.html" title="User talk:Libertas">User talk:Libertas</a> for details). If Libertas had any knowledge of Washington state politics, s/he would understand that Eyman's latest initiative seriously unpopular almost from the beginning, and that Villeneuve's efforts (which, again, I support) had little to do with its overwhelming defeat. The only well-funded opposition to 892 came from the tribes. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 06:52, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Radicalsubversiv makes another personal attack in order to diminish my position. I am more familiar with Washington politics than he might think. The initiative received 35% support did it not, hardly dead on arrival. I acknowledge others worked with Villeneuve, particular public sector rent-seekers who wanted to keep the taxes flowing. But to deny Villeneuve's role in it seems churlish and is most probably some nasty internal left dispute within the happy community of Washington liberals and marijuana activists. Radicalsubversiv misuses his role here to prosecute outside battles. I think he protests too much about supporting Villeneuve. I smell a rat. You're wrong about the funding sources btw, but why let facts get in the way of your story. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a></li>

<li>Abstain. Hard to tell whether the man is notable in own right rather than just as a part of a campaign. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">User:Libertas</a>, you seem to be using vfd to pursue a vendetta against another user. Not appropriate. I especially dislike the suggestion implicit in your argument above that since dissension is common on the "Left" no leftist can be trusted to comment on any left subject. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> 12:11, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Given your user page discloses an interest in British trade unions and revolutionary theory, you would indeed know. Please recuse yourself from this decision, left-wing activists, justice must be done and seen to be done. This is indeed a vendetta deletion proposal, it shouldn't be happening at all. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertas_b65c.html" title="User:Libertas">Libertas</a>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and given that it also tells you I live in Birmingham in the UK I'm unlikely to be deeply involved in Washington left politics, wouldn't you say? I see absolutely no evidence that this was nominated in bad faith. The subject of the article is indeed 'of dubious notability' in that his notability outside of the group of which he is a member is questionable. You have not, despite all your contributions to this "debate", provided any evidence of personal animosity between the nominator and the subject. Even if you did it would scarcely make a diference as radical has commented on the <i>article</i> and its merits, as has every other contributor. You on the other hand have continually cast aspersions on other users and made ridiculous ad hominem attacks on users who differ from you in politics. You are bullying other users. Please mend your ways. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> 13:03, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You deliberately left out the citation for the quote.

<li>I deliberately left out nothing, he is clearly a prominent community activist and was first cited in the piece with a very long quote.

<li>Not just that Gamalie, but a minority of users are claiming that because you vote <b>delete</b> it must be some conspiracry against left activism. I find such a stand by Libertas for example to be particularly insulting, I am neither left nor right and I dont believe politics should be involved in the VfD process. I still havent been convinced Villeneuve is notable enough for inclusion, plain and simple as that.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipaedia should err on the side of inclusion. If the article is biased, rework it, but minor American political activists seem like fair game to me.
