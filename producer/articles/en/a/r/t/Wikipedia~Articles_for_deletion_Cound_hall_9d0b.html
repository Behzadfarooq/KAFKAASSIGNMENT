<li><b>Comment</b>: Is an early 18th century manor in Shropshire less notable than the concrete platforms and staircases at the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanhill_railway_station.html" title="Jordanhill railway station">Jordanhill railway station</a> in Glasgow? BTW, it seems that <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Cartland_2bf3.html" title="Barbara Cartland">Barbara Cartland</a> probably lived there for some time. At least her first husband, Alexander George McCorquodale, owned the place at the time of their marriage in 1927 (<a href="../../../o/d/n/ODNB_ace9.html" title="ODNB">ODNB</a>). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 17:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>May I draw your attention to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> - the second sentence of which reads, "Comment on content, not on the contributor". Your comment about Jordanhill railway station is clearly a comment on me as the contributor. <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 21:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am sorry if you take it that way, but I actually thought of the Jordanhill railway station (as another UK structure, and since I happened to look at it again the other day when reading <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact" class="external text" title="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact" rel="nofollow">this article</a>) as a useful comparison, without having looked at your userpage. If a railway station is inherently notable just for being a railway station, even one (as far as I understand) without any actual building, I don't see why a 300-year old manor couldn't be notable just for being an old manor. I question the consistency in including one and excluding the other. You are welcome to address that point. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 11:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've already warned one contributor about a personal attack and I don't want to warn a second. I don't know the first thing about architecture, but I saw an article, it looked in a delapidated state and didn't assert any notability. Now that the article has been improved, fair enough, turns out it is notable. And we now have a better article for all the debate. Tell me, whose time was I wasting? <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 21:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not entirely necessary to accuse everyone of personal attacks, you know. Notwithstanding that there over 6,000 Grade I listed buildings (according to our article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_buildings.html" title="Listed buildings">listed buildings</a>), this one <i>is</i> more notable than a minor railway station, irrespective of who wrote what, and it <i>would</i> have taken less time to wikify it than list it here.</li>
<li>I am rather surprised that you think an article on a substiantial country house could be a candidate for speedy deletion, as a vanity article.</li>
<li>Most articles have a habit of improving over time without being listed at AfD. In my experience, most manage to improve <i>without</i> being listed at AfD. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did not suggest it was a vanity article. I was suggesting that the article didn't assert its importance. Since it's not a band, group of people, or such, I didn't think the criteria applied - and I was right.

<dd>I am not having a go at you personally - I am commenting more generally. A7 refers to "Unremarkable people or groups/vanity pages" - I suppose an article describing the limited merits of my modest home would be vanity, but this is clearly nowhere near that.

<p><b>*Keep.</b> The article now clearly asserts the importance of the building by stating that it's a Grade 1 listed structure. This is the top listing classification used in England, and all Grade 1 buildings are notable for that reason alone. There are few enough of this quality in the country not to worry about swamping Wikipedia with large numbers of articles.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 12:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
