<p>The Astral Knights are fictional characters in the video game <a href="../../../t/h/e/Bomberman_64%7E_The_Second_Attack_e08e.html" title="Bomberman 64: The Second Attack">Bomberman 64: The Second Attack</a> The Astral Knights are the elite fighting force of the B.H.B. Army, they are Baelfeal, Behomes, Ashtarth, Zhael, Molok, Zoniha, and Bulzeeb. They were originally the elemental knights and fought for peace, justice, and truth throughout the galaxy, they were created by the goddess Mihale to combat the "Demon of the Dark Sterthoth", After the defeat of Stertoth they left to explore the galaxy, eventually Sterthoth returned by possessing the body of a pirate named Rukifellth, he brainwashes the Elemental Knights to become the Stral Knights. Sterthoth planned to "drap the galaxy in darkness" and the knights assisted him with this. They needed the elemental stones to perform this goal, although the elemental knights were assigned to protect and watch over the stones they didn't have them by the time they were brainwashed, they created the black hole to suck in other planets and find the stones, eventually they had found the elemental stones of water, wind, electricity, earth, light, and shadow, but they still lacked the fire stone. Eventually they found the stone, it was being held by an intergalatic space traveler named Bomberman, the B.H.B. army captured Bomberman and attempted to bring the stone to Baelfeal, but Bomberman broke out of his prison and when Bealfeal confronted him Bomberman defeated him. The Astral Knights were suprised upon the news of his defeat, most of them were amused at having a "diversion" over guarding there elemental stone, Bomberman then encountered Behomes, prior to there battle Behomes learns Bomberman's name, Behomes loses the fight against Bomberman, then asks Bomberman if he knew of the power of the elemental stones before being shattered in a icecikle. The Astral Knights note that Bomberman is indeed a formidable opponent, except for Zhael and Zoniha who mock the defeated knights weakness, claiming if they couldn't defeat Bomberman they "weren't fit to be knights". Ashtarth then confronts Bomberman, Ashtarth displays more honor then the others and proceeds to fight Bomberman in a fair fight, upon his defeat he wonders how he could lose to him, then claims he lost in fair combat and gives Bomberman his elemental stone, Bomberman is skeptical but eventually takes the stone, Ashtarth then laughs at Bomberman and the elemental stone transforms into a bomb, Ashtarth then yells "The elemental stones are the reason the Astral Knights exist! Did you thing I would give up mine so easily?! You may have defeated me... but it is I who has the last laugh! Ashtarth then falls to the ground dead, Bomberman panics momentarily then throws the bomb at Ashtarths body destroying it, exposing the true windstone, which Bomberman takes. Meanwhile the Astral Knights note they have never fought an enemy who defeated three of them before, and start to get more serious about dealing with him, Zhael and Zoniha continue to mock the defeated knights and claim that if they were they were to fight Bomberman he would be horribly defeated. Bomberman next encounters Zhael, as compared to the other knights who attempted to go straight to the fight Zhael attempts to trick Bomberman into giving her the stones, Bomberman is about to give them to her when Lilith (another traveler that was caught in the black hole) exposing Zhael's deciet. Zhael proceeds to electrocute Lilith till shes almost dead, Zhael, irritated attacks Bomberman, but she loses the fight and realizes that mocking the defeated knights was a mistake, Lilith stands back up and tells her she lost, angered Zhael attempts to kill her with another electrical attack but a shield appears around Lilith confusing Lilith, Zhael however realizes that the goddess (mentioned near the begginning of this artical) has manifested in Lilith's body, Zhael dies realizing that the others were right, that Bomberman should not of been underestimated. The Astral Knights are at this point concerned as now four of the seven knights had been defeated. Next to encounter Bomberman is Molok, Molok is respectful of Bomberman and his strength and they fight, Molok loses and asks Bomberman what, or who he fights for. Bomberman says he dosen't have a reason and Molok claims "You cannot fight... without a reason!" Molok then claims he has given to ramblining in his old age, then performs a suicide attack, attempting to being them both into the lava below the arena they fought on, Molok dies in the lava but Bomberman is saved by Lilith who knocks Bomberman into a doorway. The Astral Knights are now only two, Zoniha priding herself as the most powerful of the Astral Knights claims she would defeat Bomberman, Bulzeeb claims that if Zoniha could defeat Bomberman he wouldn't "...last a full minute against me!" Zoniha is next to fight Bomberman and asks him if he was bored fighting "all the other weak knights" and claims she would stuff Bomberman and keep him as a trophy. Zoniha however loses the fight with Bomberman, as she tries to question how she lost the mocking tone being directed at her angers her and she summons a huge ball of light in an attempt to kill Bomberman along with herself. The attack ends up being stopped however by Bulzeeb, Zoniha questions Bulzeeb saying that Bulzeeb had "lost his mind" Bulzeeb declares that only he had the right to defeat Bomberman to settle the score, Zoniha realizes Bulzeeb had met Bomberman before and knew about him from the start, Bulzeeb then kills Zoniha with a black hole. Stethoth is angered by Bulzeeb's betrayel but believes that someone like him who desired nothing but power will be neccessary in the univirse he would create. Later Bomberman encounters Bulzeeb and Bulzeeb declares that the rematch is long over-due, they fight and when it looks like Bulzeeb has been defeated he reveals he was only using a fraction of his power, before he could continue the fight however Lilith appears and tries to talk Bulzeeb into giving her his shadow stone, Bulzeeb says he would never give up his shadow stone thanks to the power it gave him, Lilith reveals that she has completly allied herself with the goddess and that as his right as an elemental knight Bulzeeb must give her the stone, Lilith then reminds Bulzeeb his true name, Regulus. Bulzeeb pauses for a moment, then declares that "That name no longer has any meaning for me!" Bulzeeb claims he was able to resist the brainwashing but went along with Stertoth for the power he could grant him, now that he had the shadow stone he didn't need to follow Sterthoth anymore, Bulzeeb gives bomberman his shadow stone then warns Lilith that "What the goddess says is true... may not always be the whole story." confused Lilith asks him how to find the truth and Bulzeeb responds "follow no one! just as I do!" after saying this Bulzeeb flys away declaring he would face Bomberman again. In the meantime the goddess possess Lilith. Bomberman again meets Bulzeeb on the B.H.B. Warship to find that Bulzeeb had been defeated by Sterthoth in single combat, Bulzeeb grants Bomberman all his reamining power then tells him not to be killed as they still had their fight to finish, Sterthoth notes that what Bulzeebs saying indicates that he would still be alive, Stetthoth then states "Alas, it is not to be, goodbye Bulzeeb!" upon these words Bulzeeb is sucked into a black hole. Bomberman defeats Sterthoth, defeats the true form of Sterthoth, then the goddess possessed Lilith appears and fuses with Sterthoth creating an angel, upon defeating the angel all the Astral Knights are ressurected but now, they have returned to being Elemental Knights. They declare "The Astral Knights have been defeated, but long live the elemental knights!" They assure Bomberman that if the universe is again threatened, they would return but this time, as a force of good rather then evil. Bulzeeb declars he would continue his training until he is the strongest in the univirse, when he is addressed as "Bulzeeb" he corrects them and says "My name is Regulus!" he departs soon afterwords.</p>

<p>Insert non-formatted text here</p>
<pre>
The BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Championship was made as the Main Title of   
Border City Wrestling. It is a title that has specifically been held by 
wrestlers who are currently very active in the Indy Circuit and can only
defend the title on very rare circumstances. That is why many of the    
more recent champions have held the title for long periods of time.

<p>Korea International School (K.I.S)</p>
<p>KIS is a young school, with dynamic students and staff, not to mention incredible facilities. The school's focus is on preparing global leaders for the 21st century: well-rounded individuals who can share their knowledge and skills in collaboration with others to help make this world a better place.</p>
<p>KIS' rapid growth has proven that we are headed in the right direction. Nestled in the green hills just to the south of Seoul, our new campus and its facilities truly are breathtaking. The Pangyo campus will allow us to provide not for only students’ academic needs, but also for their needs in and wants in athletics, art, music and drama.</p>
<p>KIS is a K-12 college preparatory international school with high academic standards. K.I.S has been selecting new teaching staff with the utmost care during our expansion. The admissions standards have been getting more rigorous each year. KIS can provide the necessary tools that will be required for our students’ success in the future.</p>
<p>History of K.I.S</p>
<p><br />
On February 27, 1999, the Korean Ministry of Education authorized an establishment of Korea International School (KIS), with Soon Il Chung as Founder. KIS is the manifestation of Mrs. Chung’s recognition of the growing need throughout Asia for academy-quality, English-medium college preparatory education.</p>
<p>The vision began to become a reality on August 21, 2000, when KIS opened to students in kindergarten through 6th grade. Following successful inauguration of the K-6 curriculums in academic year 2000-01, grade 7 and 8 saw their inaugural year in academic year 2001-02. Grades 9-12 were added in 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, and 2005-06. The brilliance of KIS’s history lights the way for its future. Perhaps the most important development on the KIS horizon is our new campus, in the Pangyo/Bundang area, south of Seoul. Over 45 million US dollars was invested for this state of the art facility.</p>
<p>KIS’s goal is to earn its reputation among students, parents, and the international education community as a premier academy, first in Asia and, in then, throughout the world.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Kill The Young</b> is a three-pieces indie-rock/post-punk band from Manchester, England. They are three brothers, aged from 19 to 27. Tom Gorman is the Lead Singer/Guitarist, Dylan Gorman is the Bassist, and Oliver “Olly” plays Drums/Backing Vocals. They have already performed more than 450 gigs over the last 8 years.</p>
<p><br />
They were discovered at In The City Music seminar by a French label, Discograph, and signed to it last year. While they were playing a label gig in Paris, they were spotted by Dimitri Tikovoï,who decided to produce their first album. Tikovoï also works with Placebo. This record was mixed by Flood.</p>
<p>Their main influences are Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Police, Bob Dylan and Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>The provocative band’s name is way of expressing the excessive pressure which weighs down young people of modern Western society, where they are asked to grow up very quickly, thus spending less and less time to be young and reckless.</p>
<p>The band released its eponymous debut album ”Kill The Young” in the UK in June 2006 and in France on October 2005 and made a French tour which finished on October 21st 2006.</p>

Kosmas the Aetolian</p>
<p>Ag. Kosmas Aetolos (the Aetolian)</p>
<p>Kosmal Aetolos was born in 1714 in Mega Dendro, Aetolia, son of an Epirote father. He received his basic education in Zigditsa near Mt. Parnassos, and later studied at the Athonias School of Mt. Athos, where he became a monk.</p>
<p>He believed that religion and education would save the Greek nation from annihilation. For this reason he went to Constantinople and, with the help of his elder brother, Chrysanthos, who was a teacher at the patriarchal school, he obtained the relevant permission by the Patriarch and started preaching.</p>
<p>Kosmas Aetolos travelled around Epirus, especially Northern Epirus, from 1768 to 1779. His activity was a catalyst for the search for national self-knowledge. Father Kosmas turned against the Turkish oppression, blamed the unequal distribution of taxes by the nobles, took care for the establishment of hospitals and the relief of poor people and orphans; but mostly, he strongly contributed to the establishment of schools for the preservation of the Greek language and culture.</p>
<p>The Turkish authorities arrested him in the village Kolikontasi, outside Berati; he was hanged near the river Apsos, in 1779. A monastery was established later at this site, consecrated to Ag. Kosmas.</p>

<p>Alex Wipper was born in Minnesota. He currently resides in the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities. He is best known to Internet Wrestling fans as Alex "The Original Fan" Wipper. He was the author or The Fan's Persepctive! and Syndicated. He wrote for over 20 wrestling-related websites during his tenure as an Internet Columnist. He found his way to the mainstream IWC as a winner of Wrestlezone.com's Wannabe contest by beating out notable-1Wrestling.com writer Jim Forzese. He called Wrestlezone.com his official online home until leaving that decorated site for the (literally) greener pastures of TheBalrogsLair.com (now known as TBLWrestling.com). He wrote there for several months before heading into semi-retirement. He returned briefly for TNAWrestlingNews.com until, once again, returning to Wrestlezone.com.</p>
<p>He's known as one of the more famous internet wrestling writers within the last 5 years (along with Jim Forzese, Scott Stover and Marcus Cygy.</p>
<p>Despite the contributions to the IWC, he is currently retired and has stated that he "will not be returning".</p>
<p>His most notable interviews were with Steve Corino, Mike Tenay, The Stro, Shark Boy, and Big Vito.</p>
<p>Trivia: He worked for AWA Superstars before resigning from his position before officially starting his job. Alex Wipper is also locally-known as a writer for the Monticello (Minnesota) Times. He had a long-running rivalry with Doug Nunnally (Co-Owner of TheWrestlingVoice.com) lasting into his retirement. It went so far that he was actually banned from 15 websites that Nunnally had "pull" with. Alex actually ran his own website, Wipper's Wrestling Site, through a free Yahoo! host until it reached its bandwidth use for the month and was shut down by the host. He never reopened the site but, Wrestlezone.com writer Euan Conway credits Alex for helping him start his writing career.</p>

<p>This device has been in existance for a while now, but I do not see any mention of it on Wikipedia -hence this note.</p>
<p>Electronic Dog fences are usually Fences that operate using radio signals to define a perimeter that the dog is limited to. The perimeter is identified by an underlying metallic cable that is put into the ground at several meters below surface during installation.</p>
<p>The collar with a receiver is fixed to the dog as the usual collars are and a transmitter sits inside the house in any general location. The transmitter transmits a signal to the receiver and the boundary and when the pet goes near to the underground fence, it is warned by a beep and then treated by a small veterinarian approved electric shock. After a while, the dog will know its limits after the learning process is completed. The dog, however, continues to wear the collar which is not cumbersome to become a concern. The success of this device is overwhelming and is in common use today.</p>
<p>The product is usually registered for warranty purposes and the collar if seen on a dog in the certain area can be tracked back with some limitations to the owner using the company records.</p>

<p>The pair of Brazilian rap and funk-melody singers , former-office boys Claudinho (Cláudio Rodrigues) and Buchecha (Claucirlei Jovêncio de Souza) reached fame in 1997 with the song “Quero te Encontrar”, in the record “A Forma”. They created a style of music and choreography imitated by other pairs of Mcs. The repertoire is basically romantic, far from the social critiques which are characteristical in most of Brazilian raps and funks . Other successes had been “Só Love”, "Fico assim sem você", "Nosso Sonho" and “Xereta”. In July of 2002, the singer Claudinho , who was only 26 years old, was a victim of a fatal automobile accident when he returned from a show in São Paulo.</p>

<p>Allen Walker is the main character of the manga series D.Gray Man, published and distributed by VIZ Media. The story is set in a fictional nineteenth century England, it focuses around Allen and his adventures regarding his mysterious deformed right arm/weapon.</p>

<p>Allen Walker is a slightly abnormal 15-year-old boy with no living family having appeared in the story so far. The only "family" having appeared at all is Allen's adoptive father, Mana Walker. Allen cared very deeply for him, so when he died, Allen was overcome by grief. D.Gray Man's main villain, the Millenium Earl, appeared to Allen and inquired whether he would like Mana resurrected. Allen agreed, and the Millenium Earl brought Mana back...as an Akuma. Akuma are the spirits of the deceased who's loved ones refuse to let go. Their bodies are always in constant pain and they serve only as near-mindless weapons for the Millenium Earl's eventual world takeover. Therefore, after seeing his father in such a state, Allen used the exorcist's weapon embedded into his deformed right arm to kill Mana.</p>

<p>Allen was born with a deformed right arm. In it, though, is a piece of Innnocence, a special anti-akuma weapon wielded only bestowed upon those destined to become exorcists. The weapon allows him to destroy the tortured souls embedded in Akuma, thus destroying the Akuma and freeing the soul. His weapon also allows him to see the soul inside an Akuma, thus letting him find them among a crowd of humans.</p>

<p>Allen now belongs to a society of exorcists with similar talents. All have pieces of Innocence, but they are not all who they seem or eager to halp Allen. He may have teamates for his exorcising missions, but he must face his destiny alone...</p>

<p>Jimmie Fletcher is a Country Music singer and West Texas Music Hall of Fame inductee. Jimmie first recorded for Mercury and later on Winston. He toured with most of the members of The Grand Ole Opry and at one time played regularly in Mexico. In San Angelo he had daily radio shows, and by choosing the best talent available through the years for his band, the Drifting Ranch Hands, Jimmie provided dance music for the large crowds that followed him. Jimmie made a music career out of playing just two clubs in San Angelo, "The Dixie" and "The Boots &amp; Saddle". In the 70's, Jimmie ended his successful music career playing seven years at the famous "Ramblin Rose" in Llano, Texas. Jimmie Fletcher's origonal releases include "<i>Take a Look at Me</i>", "<i>Things You Didn't Mean</i>", "<i>Whats Wrong With You</i>", and "<i>No Quittin' Place</i>".</p>
