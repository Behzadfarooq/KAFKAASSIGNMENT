<dd>This comment is a little misleading: if this were merely a matter of conformal mapping then it wouldn't change the number of nearest-neighbour contacts. Furthermore search on cond-mat arxiv in just the current year led me to 74 papers on packing problems. Moreover, I see no compelling reason presented by people who voted to delete (except for those who did this with the partial information that packing problems reduced to sphere or circle packings). <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBambaiah_bac4.html" title="User:Bambaiah">Bambaiah</a> 08:38, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Limits are not that easy. I challenge you to find a formula for how many circles can be packed in a square of size <i>d</i> by <i>d</i>.

<dd>Given a circle of size <i>c</i> then (((2<i>d</i>-(2+root(3))<i>c</i>)<i>d</i>)/(square(<i>c</i>)root(3))). General case is that HCP is most dense, so HCP. First consider tiled situation - circles with superscribed hexagons, determine number across square, also determine number down square (these are not the same as hexagon is not 90 degree rotational symmetry), this gives number of tiles total. There will always be fractional tiles at the boundary, so subtract them. Boundary wraps so this is easy. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 22:54, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But the optimal pattern is not always hexagonal. For instance, if the circle has diameter 1 and the square is 2-by-2, then you can fit 4 circles in the square, but only three if you insist on a hexagonal pattern. Returning to the VfD, I note that the American Mathematical Society lists "Spreads and packing problems" as 51E23 in their Mathematics Subjects Classification (<a href="http://www.ams.org/msc/51Exx.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ams.org/msc/51Exx.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).

<li><b>strong strong keep</b>. Wire puzzles are interesting, notable, eminently wikifiable. They deserve a page to themselves. Merging with disentanglement puzzle misses the point: wire puzzles appear in literature (can't quite find it right now but I think it was <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Potter_a85d.html" title="Stephen Potter">Stephen Potter</a>), have uses in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/u/Frustration.html" title="Frustration">frustration</a> management), appear in discussions of <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topology.html" title="Topology">topology</a>, all in ways unique to wire puzzles. There are notable companies that specialize in wire puzzles. One nearly cost me my sanity when I was a boy. What kind of <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolerance_%28engineering%29.html" title="Tolerance (engineering)">engineering tolerances</a> are necessary to make a wire puzzle?

<li>I'm not sure that I believe you. I think what you are referring to is the game where people have to avoid touching the wire, which is a different thing entirely. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 06:33, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>reply</b> Hi Ril four tildes. What do you mean you don't believe me? Which bit don't you believe? I can dig out the Stephen Potter reference. The puzzle I'm referring to is sometimes called the "twisted nail puzzle". The "avoid touching the wire game" is totally unrelated. I repeat: which bit don't you believe? regards, <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinh_3ed9.html" title="User:Robinh">Robinh</a> 07:16, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>reply II</b>. Hello again Ril four tildes. Me again. Right, I understand why you don't believe me. The problem is that there are two different types of wire puzzle. The first type, as discussed in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_puzzle.html" title="Wire puzzle">wire puzzle</a>, involves the <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topology.html" title="Topology">topology</a> of the system. The type I was thinking of has two twisted <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nail_%28engineering%29.html" title="Nail (engineering)">nails</a>, which cannot be separated unless held at precisely the right angle, and gently eased apart. This type (AFAICS) isn't mentioned on <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_puzzle.html" title="Wire puzzle">wire puzzle</a>. Maybe we should make a page called twisted nail puzzle and everyone would be happy. Come to think of it, I'll do it at lunchtime today.

<li><b>comment</b>, good points, but I think that if merged it will allow the section to expand naturally until it becomes too big for that article, at which point it will be moved out into its own.

<li><b>reply</b> Hi Slike2. That's fair enough. I'm afraid I don't regard myself as sufficiently knowledgeable to add material. Not right now anyway. But I do plan to do some research on the topic.

<p>Mostly procedural, filling a redlink on the Vfd page. That said, any article where the external links vastly outweigh the internal content gives me pause. Looking at the contrib's <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> page has deep concerns about edit wars and POV editing.

<p>After some controversy at the Ali article, Mustafaa added a sentence saying that Shi'a Muslims claim Ali was born in the Kaaba. This was not enough for Striver, who has created this inane and un-encyclopedic article. I think the sentence in the Ali article is enough. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:09, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps I don't agree with Mustafaa? Perhaps if there's any discussion of this issue, it should be in an article with a different name and a different format? The article's title is POV, in that it assumes the matter to be proved. The article's format is bad, in that it's your usual list of hadith, without any argument, explanation, background, anything. And I don't think it's OK for you to just wipe the VFD template off the page in question and assume that this settles the matter. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is not Wikipedia's mission to provide unchanging article URLs to which external websites can link without needing maintainance. In particular, WP's purpose is not to serve as an authoritative reference for a topic which has no verifiability except millennium-old oral traditions. <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, explaining the (largely-theological-BS) dispute between factions. If this point were a major reason that Sunni and Shi'a Muslims are killing each other in Iraq and elsewhere, then I would support a stand-alone article on the topic, but not a "list" of two people with dubious (and mutually contradictory!) verifiability. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:12, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vanity page? Definitely not remarkable, 6 Google matches. On the other hand, not everything is on the net, and the article is self-contained, complete and well written.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Vanity of non remarcable music group. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Marianocecowski</a> 15:11, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> ¿Non remarcable music group?. It's the group that initiated the genre that later made bands like Ráfaga become famous worldwide. The group itself is not famous, but at least you can link it from the glamorous cumbia article. This band used to have a web page, years ago when they were a little famous in their region. The legacy is the music they invented, not the band work itself. It deserved, at least, to be a link from "glamorous cumbia". Remember that some people and some places are not so computerized. I'm not related to any person of the band. Even more, I never got the chance to talk to them. I don't live near their area. On the other side, it's true that I was and I still am a fan of the band and that I like their music. But people that reads the glamorous cumbia article perhaps want to know about the creators of the genre. Another example: Nobody remembers the group Smile, but it invented the style that Queen took to become famous. So, let's see if I explained myself: I don't want to argue, and I do not want to bother anyone. But this band deserves at least a link from the article of the musical genre. It's not vanity. It's history. Thank you. <i>User:200.73.180.22</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a lower-class band from a country where net access is not as widespread as US- and Euro-centric Wikipedia POV seems to consider normal; it's far less likely to be indexed by Google. It certainly achieved some notoriety in its time; I don't think its being a local phenomenon precludes listing it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaragui_2f04.html" title="User:Taragui">Taragui</a> 07:24, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Allmusic is not aware of them and Google has limited records. As a contemporary band that has supposedly released a number of albums, one would think that there would be more than six Google hits. Google indexes what is present. Argentina has a reasonable internet presence. I suspect a hoax with little verifiable information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. First. Most bands and singers in <a href="http://www.fantasticobailable.com/gruposysolistas.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fantasticobailable.com/gruposysolistas.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> are not on allmusic.com, while all of them exist with varying degrees of sucess in the argentine cumbia scene. The fact that the site of one of the main venues of the cumbia scene in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> lists those bands makes me think they're rather on the "sucessful" section of "varying degrees of success", so I think the "is not in allmusic.com" argument to be faulty. Second, cumbia is a very low-class musical expression in argentina, a country which has around 50% of it's population living in poverty -hence no access to internet, let alone upload some page about some lesser known band-, so I consider the "no references on google" to be faulty too in this case. On a side note, the author seems too eager to put this thing here, and links the bands article to pages that shouldn't (ie: <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia.html" title="Cumbia">Cumbia</a>, see <a href="../../../c/u/m/Talk%7ECumbia_9872.html" title="Talk:Cumbia">talk:Cumbia</a> for why I consider a lesser known band of Argentine Cumbia shouldn't be on that article). I don't know the band, perhaps because I hardly know the scene, but -personally- I wouldn't even consider including this article on wikipedia. On the other hand... <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">meta:Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits</a> turns my opinion into <i>Keep</i>, sadly On a last comment, to User:200.73.180.22: <i>Nobody remembers the group Smile, but it invented the style that Queen took to become famous.</i>, Smile turned into <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html#Origin" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>, they're not unrelated. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 06:09, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I had 4.910 hits of Google, not 6. Here is the direction. <a href="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But when looking for "gauchos pesados" I had 72 hits (<a href="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=</a>). Try it if you want. 72 hits is enough for a band of a genre that is not very computerized. Google standards should be lower for less computerized places. On the other hand, I think people who remember this band is computerized, because, as I said on the article, glamorous cumbia was not for lower-class people, but for upper-class (take the example of Ráfaga, the best exponent of the glamorous cumbia genre, for which I made an article too). To say glamorous cumbia is a lower-class music is like saying that The Black Eyed Peas is a lower-class music in the United States. Everyone listen to them. And the same with Eminem. And another thing: don't be fooled with the statistics, because it may be true that 50 percent of people in Argentina lives in bad conditions. That is in the ugly zone of the country. But in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and all the provinces of the South, people has a lot of money. Take myself for example: I don't have more money than all the people I know, but everyone in my town (including me) has everything (internet with a high connection, flat TV, DVD with home theatre, a nice house with garden and a swimming pool; and everyone has a third grade or university degree (I'm a publicist creative) and speaks at least spanish and english (I speak portuguese and italian too). But I'm not a millionaire. It's simply that this is the status in the richer zones of Argentina. So don't pay attention to the news that shows tha bad parts of the country. We're not mixed with lower-class people. They have their own provinces and cities, and rich people or people who lives well we have our own cities and towns (in my case, a private neighbourhood). So stop talking about Argentina like it is Camerun, Rwanda or Afganistan. It's not like this. Is a country formed by immigrants from Europe. And a great country, indeed (at least half of it).</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article neither forcefully promotes the club in an advertising capacity, nor would it qualify under the claim of vanity (the definition of which being: excessive pride in one's appearance or accomplishment). This page neither brags nor boasts of CCR's accomplishments, nor offers ANY side of opinions, therefore unbiased. CCR is an important faces of College Republicans that played an important role in the most recent CRNC election process, the main contender for the Chair position of which being from our state, and CCR's past Chairman (Michael Davidson). The pictures posted could only be misconstrued as vain if Frank Sinatra's mug shot could be considered a photo shoot. Portraits are an efficient way to illustrate the organization's leadership, just like <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a>'s page shows, as does <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

California College Republicans is a state federation that is on the forefront of the College Republican national organization; as is such, and what with the dealings of CCR's in the national College Republican playing feild, the California College Republican wiki-site has total justification for its existence. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Quiggle_ccfa.html" title="User:Kelly Quiggle">Kelly Quiggle</a> 10:12, 13 July 2005 (PST)</li>

<dd>As far as Gamaliel's question, it is in fairly decent usage mainly by media.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. His organization is more notable than most student groups, more than many nationwide student groups, but its political-activism function does not make him a "notable politician". The article does make a bit of claim to independent notability at the end, crediting his leadership for increased influence by the group in 2004 USA elections, but I feel this overstates the case both for the group and for Mr. Gourley. If broader media recognition than the Reagan Award can be verified, then keep the article on the basis of that specific notability, not just because he spent time as head of a big student group.

<li><b>Very STRONG Keep</b> This is ridiculous. This is the latest of a string of College Republican articles to be deleted. This national organizations IS notable and therefore its leadership and prominent state federations ARE notable. If the accomplishments of people like Mr. Gourley don't speak for themselves I am not sure what would. Why is this level of scrutiny being applied only to GOP groups? I don't see any push to remove the article on Scott Peterson or other trash articles like the one on Jennifer Wilbanks, which are definitely NOT encyclopediac. If anyone outside of the arrogant cybernerds with the audacity to label the College Republicans simply "a student group" saw the incredible influence they have on Republican politics as noted and the high-profile nature of the campaign to elect their leaders (i.e. Gourley's) nature of College Republicans do, they'd be as appalled as I am.

<li>Sir, the gentleman from NY has a point.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike>. How is this not notable? It's a huge part of Western culture for villains to have stereotypically villianous laughter!

<li>I change my vote to <b>move</b> per Morwen. Evil laugh is a better article name. We probably don't need each spelling as a redirect, but I don't think they'd hurt.

<li>As with Radiant!'s note that the evil laugh expression (mwhahaha, etc) has many variations, as long as we mention some variation of it in the article readers should be able to find it through the search function, thus the proposal to delete the remains appeals to me.

Google for "interracial dvd", and Google gives you an estimated 818,000 hits. I could go on, but Wikipedia is not a porn search engine.

The FBI is mentioned and a link with an article on hacking includes a passing mention of this group, but this doesn't constitute notability and isn't worthy of a Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 10:19, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b>: You have a right to your family's biographical data. Wikipedia does not have a right to the copyrighted contents of a published reference work without proper citation of that work.

<p>Will rewrite later and post.</p>
<p>thankyou--do you suggest i re-write the entries or site the reference work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally I would rewrite of all the articles, rather than a citation added to them. The general test applied for a fair use claim is the percentage of the work that's copied, versus the percentage that isn't. Adding a citation leaves the copied material intact, and obviously copied. Rewriting it will change the format, even if the data is the same as presented in your source (which you should still cite). It may also let you add some biographical detail that's not present in your source, which would further differentiate your article from the source. You might want to create a custom template, since there are a lot of Seelys, it seems.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwarren_49e7.html" title="User:Kenwarren">Ken</a> 20:13, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have re-written all of the entries. How long do i have to wait for approval? Several of them are marked for copyright infringment, which i no longer believe is the case, since i have written them mostly from memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Per the copyright violation notice, if you've rewritten the articles and placed the rewritten versions in the correct location (temp pages under the main article) they'll replace the notice when it's cleaned up. There's a seven day waiting period for this. In the mean time, continue to maintain the articles in their current location; if you need to link to one, I think you would link to the main article.<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwarren_49e7.html" title="User:Kenwarren">Ken</a> 21:20, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is mainly a long, highly subjective list of cities that the creator of the article thought were intellectual centers. There are no clear criteria for inclusion on the list, and it's highly biased toward the modern U.S. (e.g., both Cambridge, MA and Boston, MA are listed, and both Berkeley and San Francisco).

<li><b>Keep, but modify</b>--I agree that there should be some criteria. For example, list could become a table with Place, When, Why.

<dd>There are several pages that link there, but I think they were all links put in by the anon who created the article. The reason I came across the article in the first place was that the anon added a link from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">Freethought</a>, which wasn't even appropriate, IMO. I also don't think it's realistic to hope for the article to be improved. If you look at the edit history for Intellectual center, it was created today by an anon, and since then, the only edits have been by me and <a href="../../../z/e/i/User%7EZeimusu_cf6b.html" title="User:Zeimusu">User:Zeimusu</a>, both of us pointing out that there were problems with the concept. I don't see any evidence that there are people who are willing to improve it, and I also disagree that the concept is worth salvaging. I don't see how adding "why" information would help, since there are no agreed-upon, objective criteria for deciding what qualifies for the list.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 17:40, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The description of the list is all-inclusive, and the criteria seem too subjective and not well known (it smells of original research). I would dispute that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> are intellectual centers, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens%2C_Greece_0172.html" title="Athens, Greece">Athens, Greece</a> seems more reasonable to describe that way. The criteria are so weak and therefore the quality of the list that just about any notable university, school, library, forum, or meeting place that ever existed in the world is an intellectual center. I say those should go into separate, independent lists. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 12:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> -- why would anyone want to delete this list? I agree that it does need MUCH WORK, but if you all delete this you page are crazy. This is what Wikipedia is all about -- pounding out a compromise instead of getting all delete happy. As for the bias someone mentioned, that's not true because in the US there are quite a few MAJOR intellectual centres so it makes sense that they should be on the list. &lt;&lt; since there are no agreed-upon, objective criteria for deciding what qualifies for the list. &gt;&gt; Uhhh, read the heading and that tells you the criteria -- it must be or have been an intellectual centre sometime in the course of history. That's not a muddled criteria at all! --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerlin_Stark_0278.html" title="User:Berlin Stark">Berlin Stark</a> 07:29, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wordforge kicks butt and takes names and all you who want to delete it can kiss my Rebel dick! Save WordForge! It's small but it's growing. At the very least fold it into TrekBBS's screen. They may have more "members" but that doesn't make them at all more important.</p>

<li>I did very seriously consider this myself. However, looking into this, the club does have some mention on BBC sports pages. Also, loooking at e.g. the Category Scottish football clubs, a fairly large number of British junior football teams already have entries, we could end up doing a hatchet job. I suppose as Wikipedia is not paper we could set the threshhold fairly low in this case.

<li>Don't worry, Wikipedia can be a bruising place at times. I probably did some silly things myself when I was 14. I've seen some adults do stupider things than this on Wikipedia. I don't think you can delete the article yourself, but if you accept that it should be deleted we can treat it as a <b>speedy delete</b>. I'm not sure if an article on your football team would be OK, but if you write a reasonable article on the league they play in, or your school, or the town where you live that would probably be OK, although I'm afraid I can't promise anything. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 10:36, 2005 July 15 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was recently nominated and just closed (by me). The previous nomination received little attention (two and a half votes) and I therefore closed it as "inconclusive" (and so default to keep).

<dd>Not nonsense, check the news, independance was just declared and the whole area is pretty confused. There are police outside my building now trying to keep people calm. The legislature voted with a 2/3rds majority to seceed from the union. Details as to why are still kind of vague, and a lot of people are fleeing the new republic for Indiana and Wisconsin.

<li><b>Comment</b> Quite correct, YOu.&#160;;-) I didn't fully explain what I meant. My reasoning (shared by many Wikipedians, AFAIK) is that Wikipedia should have two general categories of things:
<ul>
<li>encyclopedic material(i.e. the article and Category namespaces) and</li>
<li>material that helps us to <b>write</b> the encyclopedic material (i.e. the policy and guidelines pages, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a> pages, the Template namespace, the User namespace(so we can communicate in public with each other regarding writing the encylopedic material) and the Sandbox(as a place for new users to try out the mechanisms we use to write the encyclopedia)).</li>
</ul>

<li>Wikipedia:Sandbox/Poetry does not fit into either of these categories, and it <b>has</b> a specific place dedicated to it(the Poetry Wikicity) against which the only argument presented is that it is "too hard to find".</li>
<li>Regarding that argument, I think most people would be *much* more likely to look for a place to read and write Wiki Poetry in the list of Wikicities, or as a link from the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a> article(which I've just added), than to look in the place for newbies to try out the editing tools, i.e. the Sandbox. A subpage of the Sandbox is about the one of the <i>least</i> easy-to-find places I can think of. So I don't think the claim that the Poetry wikicity is "too hard to find" holds much water. And nobody has presented any other arguments against the Poetry wikicity. I hope this is a more complete explanation of my reasoning. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">JesseW</a> 02:12, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Understood, but I stand by my vote. As I've said on the VFd's of other sections of the sandbox, if there is a "theme section" of the sandbox, it is an extension thereof for people to test editing by writing poetry (not that they can't in the regular sandbox, but I still see nothing wrong with it as an extension of the sandbox. <a href="../../../y/0/u/User%7EY0u_cdd9.html" title="User:Y0u">Y0u</a> <a href="../../../y/0/u/User_talk%7EY0u_b9f5.html" title="User talk:Y0u">(Y0ur talk page)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Y0u_da57.html" title="Special:Contributions/Y0u">(Y0ur contributions)</a> 17:57, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, this discussion is getting quite long, but it's interesting, so... <i>"my vote"</i> - I didn't see that you voted - did you mean to? The idea that this page was a "theme" section of the sandbox was one I had not considered - it describes itself, and seems to be generally understood, as <b>permanent</b> (both in it's existence, and in the existence of the content on it (only as permanent as any wiki page, of course)), located in the Sandbox simply so they could escape scrutiny.</li>
<li>The idea that it represents a sort of "themed area" for test edits is one I had not imagined. While on the face of it, this seems fine, when looked at carefully, it makes no sense. The content of test edits, by their very nature (as tests of the editing software and formatting options), doesn't matter, and so the idea of having themes for them is fundamentally contradictory. Thanks for the discussion! <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">JesseW</a> 02:20, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>P.S. As I think on this more, the idea that these subpages are a place for the same sort of test edits found on <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a> makes less and less sense. The Sandbox is blanked (other than a simple header) every few hours - do you really believe that the people who put in all the time and effort to create the layout of Wikipedia:Sandbox/Checkers(which I liked so much I copied it myself so the work wouldn't be lost if the page was deleted) would be OK with it being blanked out after a few hours. And if you claim that the checkers layout should be considered part of the Sandbox header - making the edits involved in making the moves the ones that are "test edits" I would point out that getting those edits right is <i>quite difficult</i> and would probably be beyond the skill of those who would be using the real Sandbox page. It just doesn't fly. Nice idea, though. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">JesseW</a> 02:33, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately, Wikipedia has to consider the notability of the things it has articles about. It is difficult to claim notability for a website that does not yet exist and which has only a hundred-or-so active members. There are many fora out there with many more than that. Once the site has become properly notable, the article can be recreated. You may also want to read about what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a> — specifically, it's not a webdirectory. I've marked the votes above as a common practise to point out to whoever closes the VfD that these users <i>may</i> have been created specifically to support this vote.

<li>"Wikipedia has to consider the notability of the subjects of its articles"? That sounds like an excuse to keep the scope of the wikiproject as small as possible. Notability is purely relative. Within its own sphere, TRE is most definitely notable, and I'm amazed by the fact that any informative, non-biased, well written article would be so widely opposed just because a few of you cling to rules. Wikipedia is a very promising outlet for education, perhaps even better than a library, and to think that you would discriminate against something solely because it's "not-notable"? What if no one was interested in Quantum Physics either? Would you stamp an nn on it and give it a delete too?--Encyclopediac 02:25, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Non-Wikipedia references to "CS" abound on websites and discussion forums about hyperhisrosis and ETS surgery.

<p>CS is not nonsense. Severing any nerve will cause the organ, gland or muscle controlled via that nerve to malfunction. This is no different for the autonomic nervous system. A surgical sympathectomy can and does cause the sympathetic nervous system to be divided into 2 distinct regions, one dead and the other hyperactive. This makes perfect sense to anyone knowledgeable about human physiology.71.129.158.210 04:45, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>CS is no hoax, though the thousands of sufferers certainly wish that it was.</p>

<li>Friend, ETS seems to be real, but these sites do not appear to mention "Corposcindosis" at all. Now, I have <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_palsy.html" title="Cerebral palsy">cerebral palsy</a> myself (which is very real), but if someone invented a symptom of that disorder called "Corposcindosis", it wouldn't merit an article. Understand, if this is real, no Google hits is a valid reason for thinking it isn't -- nothing personal. Please sign your contributions with four tildes if you wish to be taken more seriously. Again, nothing personal, but anonymous users here are legion, and their claims are suspect. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:54, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note also that the article's claim that "Corposcindosis" was coigned in 2005 is prima facie evidence that an article <i>under that name</i> doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../e/t/s/ETS_e4ea.html" title="ETS">ETS</a> very well might. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Did not mean to be anonymous. I'm songboy1234. Xoloz, with due respect, your analogy to cerebral palsy is not apt. No one has "invented" a symptom. The symptoms are real, predicted by physiology, and well documented in the published medical literature, (not to mention by thousands of oral histories on many forums). The charges of "hoax" and "nonsense" are utterly without foundation.</p>
<p>The charge of "neologism" does have merit. I coined the term. However, you must understand the situation to understand why the doctors will never name this disease. The doctors are CAUSING this disease. A much better analogy would be to lobotomy. A particular mental/emotional syndrome was caused by pre-frontal lobotomy, yet to my knowledge it was never named, a linguistic injustice if ever there was one. Instead, doctors busied themselves publishing "studies" which "proved" that lobotomy is safe and effective. Corposcindosis is a specific example of autonomic neuropathy, but it requires its own name. It is definable, diagnosable, measurable, it is specific, it is real, and thousands are suffering.</p>
<p>I submit that waiting for doctors to name this disease constitutes a profound irresponsibility to the language. 71.129.158.210 04:45, 17 July 2005 (UTC)Songboy1234 05:01, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Once the community affected largely acknowledges the name, and it has been around for a few years, then it will be eligible for inclusion.

<li>This term is completely bogus. Some unhappy ETS patients have an axe to grind about the side-effects of their surgery, so they are appropriating Wikipedia in order to advance their cause, both in this and in the ETS entry. The results of ETS are not clearly known, making it a controversial procedure, and it should be stated as such. But ETS side-effects are only "now known as corposcindosis" by the author of this entry and possibly some of his fellow conspirators. "CS" is in fact a common abbreviation of compensatory sweating, and this is a term widely accepted by the both the medical and lay community. "Corposcindosis" is a neologism created with the sole purpose of underhandedly denouncing ETS. It is a biased and deceptive term that is in no way encyclopedic. The side-effects are real; the term is not. (No vote. I nominated the deletion.) -BF (Note: I tried to delete this comment but I guess we're not allowed to do that. I don't mean to downplay the sufferings of these people or to hinder their cause. It's the method that I disagree with, and I think this is an inappropriate entry for Wikipedia.)</li>

<li><b>Delete on condition</b> that sources are not identified, and accuracy disputes are not clarified. In other words, if the article is cleaned up, identifies sources, and accuracy disputes are corrected, keep, otherwise, delete. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 14:36, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>I must admit that I was not aware of the "neologism" rule as I authored the article. I think this is clear, as I innocently took credit for having coined the term in the article itself. Based on that criticism, I now agree the article should be deleted until such time as the term (or a different one of the same meaning) comes into wider use.</p>
<p>However, I feel compelled to straighten out BF on a few matters. Yes, the term "compensatory sweating" was coined by surgeons and is widely used, often interchangeably with the more correct terms, "compensatory hyperhidrosis" and "reflex hyperhidrosis", which are also used by surgeons. All current terms referring to this side effect are speculative, because no one knows what causes it. An accurate term would be "surgically induced hyperhidrosis". But we know for certain that the term "compensatory sweating" is a euphemism, and is medically incorrect, because the sweating referred to is excessive. Wide use does not necessarily mean accuracy. Truth is ultimately what we're after.</p>
<p>The syndrome caused by ETS surgery, which I have named Corposcindosis, is a manifestation of the PRIMARY effects of the surgery, in addition to the SIDE effects, an important distinction.</p>
<p>Referring to me as a "conspirator" is a disgusting libel. What purpose is attempted by it one can only guess. In one breath, BF rants " 'Corposcindosis' is a neologism created with the sole purpose of underhandedly denouncing ETS" but in the next breath admits "The side-effects are real". The purpose of the article was to document a syndrome which no one (not even BF) denies exists, not to "denounce" anything. If factual information reflects badly on a medical procedure, so be it.</p>
<p>Now, BF - please, in great detail, would you please elucidate any factual errors on the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endoscopic_Thoracic_Sympathectomy_e498.html" title="Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy">Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy</a> page, or the soon-to-be-deleted Corposcindosis page? Edit them in, or make me aware and I will do so. But otherwise, will you please retract your false statements alleging "appropriating Wikipedia in order to advance their cause". That statement is beyond the pale.</p>
<p>My only "error" was coining a new term, one which badly needs to be coined. The scientific evidence supporting the thesis is beyond question. Songboy1234 05:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not going to give you great detail because I don't want a point-by-point argument with you. My dispute with the ETS article is not so much the facts, although I think the negatives are over-represented, but the loaded language. What I meant by deception is that it isn't neutral. And I do apologize for using the word "conspirators," a loaded word if there ever was one, as well as for the entire comment, which as I stated before I tried to delete, but someone undeleted it. It was written with emotion rather than objectivity, as I believe the two entries were. I just find that a prospective ETS patient is always stuck with finding a middle ground between biased (although technically "true") statements by surgeons and biased (although technically "true") statements by angry patients. They both err by omission. The objective, neutral "truth" about ETS needs to be out there, but the current Wikipedia entry isn't it. I suppose I could try to edit the page, but I don't want an editing war. I wish you good health, and I'm sorry that my comments came off so personally, but that's my last word on this. -Bruce</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
And there you have it for all to see. Bruce, BF, comes on, nominates the page for deletion, makes horrific personal accusations, states that another page is biased, and that it is being appropriated for some "cause", says there is "loaded language", that it "isn't neutral" and yet . . . offers not ONE WORD supporting his assertions. What loaded language? He doesn't say. Biased how? He doesn't say. Negatives are "overrepresented". What does that mean? If you have a situation where factually there are more "negatives" than "positives" then negatives SHOULD be overrepresented.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. A majority wanted deletion, quite a few wanted BJAODN (which suggests they consider the content unencyclopedic but of some amusement value). While I'm tempted to interpret the BJAODN's as delete votes, I think there's the germ of an encyclopedia article here, and BJAODN does not necessarily imply deletion; it's a comment on content. There is some concern that the existing content may be a copyright violation, and this should be addressed in the appropriate place.
