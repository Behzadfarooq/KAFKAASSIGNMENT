No idea why it was AFD'd, ask User:Andyru. Just listing it properly. kotepho 18:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC) This article was nominated for deletion before when I was extremely new to Wikipedia. The argument was not presented well. Please take a look at the following discussions: [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman</a> ] [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1</a> ] [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church</a> ]</p>
<p><b>Delete:</b> user Williamo1 (and his socks) are using this article as a personal soapbox. Look at the edit history. Any person just diving into this issue is going to be immediately horrified at the past of Roy Gordon Lawrence. However, nobody on Wikipedia ever cared about him before Williamo1 first created the page. It was created in a manner to portray public informance (seems justified)... however, quickly has turned into a personal vendetta and soapbox for him. Williamo1 seems to be using this as a sex offender registry, tracking the whereabouts of this person. He pays no heed to the fact this man has changed his lifestyle form his past and pokes fun as his current life as well as tried to descredit the church he attends by suggesting all sorts of crazy things (saying he won't cooperate with police etc.) This article either needs to be deleted to remove the soapbox (which only Williamo1 cares about), or at least its history should be deleted (kept as current) and Williamo1 and his IP should be banned from further edits (I don't wish to edit it either). Note that nobody in Wikipedia cared about this subject matter except Williamo1 (and myself) -- though a few people have stepped in to help control the POV editing by Williamo1 and another stepped in to help format the article better.

<li>Note: I recognize that relisted this as AFD may (at first glance) seem like the wrong approach -- at it may be. I tried RFC once, and had no response (though I wonder if I did it correctly). Please have a look at the links I listed above... it does take a little time to understand the soapbox allegation -- with a little looking you'll see exactly what I mean. Advice appreciated -- I hope I've stated things clearly enough, as a first glance at this issue won't provide you with enough info to see where I'm coming from Andyru 17:26, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What specifically are you talking about? Given the volitile nature of this article, you'll have to specify (with a link), which version you're referring to, regarding "perjoratives and POV". I beleive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Gordon_Lawrence&amp;oldid=46043393" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Gordon_Lawrence&amp;oldid=46043393" rel="nofollow">the current version</a> deals strictly with facts, at the expense of being very concise, and not fully elaborating on the broader controversies (old and new) and public policy debates triggered by the person (old and new). Generally, we don't delete articles because old versions had problems. Also, I can't tell from your comments if you're seriously suggesting List of known paedophiles and their current addresses or if that was sarcasm (in any event, I wouldn't want such a list here). Sorry in advance, as I'm sure I misunderstood/misinterpretted some of your comments. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:53, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, but also because the subject is simply not notable enough, per <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a>. If we are to debate honestly the merits of retaining this article, it has to be on the basis of notability. This man's notability ultimately derives from acts he committed 15 years ago. I don't see national or international press coverage of these events; I don't see wide or constantly maintained press interest in this individual and, although I note <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a>'s point about paper -v- Web, I don't see widespread Internet coverage. The fact that the subject held a responsible position when he committed crimes may interest or titillate us, but I do not believe that it confers notability. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 15:01, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you don't feel there was *sufficient* national coverage. But surely you acknowledge there was national coverage. You're statement "<i>I don't see national or international press coverage of these events</i>" seems to ignore coverage in a national magazine, as well as newspapers from Alberta, BC, and Ontario. That is national coverage. Again, I'm fine if you don't think that's sufficient. But you're making a literal mistatement. It's also offensive to suggest this is done to "<i>titillate us</i>". Read the article. There's no "titillation". And yes, I concede your point that in 1991 there was not "<i>widespread Internet coverage</i>" (I don't see how you note my point, then seem to miss it). Can I ask you if you actually read the cited offline news stories (which is necessary to have a basis for the opinions you expressed)? Again, I got no problem with people deciding this is not notable, in their opinion, but I object to what I see are factual errors expressed.. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right - I should have been more specific and stated that I didn't see any <i>significant</i> national coverage. My point about the Internet is that it is reasonable to expect a greater Internet presence for anyone notable enough for an online encyclopaedia - no matter when the events happened. I don't believe I suggested the article was designed to titillate people, and I'm afraid I disagree that it is necessary to read the offline news stories to express an opinion on the notability of this individual. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 17:05, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm quite fine with you deleting this article. But, I seriously hope you would agree that there are many other articles, that are supported largely by offline sources, which very much warrant inclusion, and are of great value (note: I'm talking of other articles here, not this one). Some of the best references for articles are still on paper. The fact we're online in no way means we should hostile to offline sources. In fact, the offline sources are often more reliable than online ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:25, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Under the notable people in Wikipedia it define notoriety as "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." Based on the news coverage of this guy, I would definitly say he has notoriety. I say keep because what is there now is basic public knowledge of events that were considered quite newsworthy. So long as it stays neutral, let it stay. What he did was pretty horrendus.

This only goes to further prove my point in the nom, that nobody cares about this outside the scope of two churches which split. Hence, my original vote to delete off of this encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems both notable and verifiable. AfD is not the place to bring up problems like this. I would encourage all of those who were heavaly involved with this article in the past to voluntarily walk away from it and never look back. —<a href="../../../%D0%B0/_/_/User%7E%D0%90_9fd1.html" title="User:А">A</a> 20:26, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Have I understood you correctly&#160;? You want the people *involved* with this to "walk away"&#160;? Presumably, they are the ones likeliest to know the *facts* in this instance. Do I take it that, while they are doing so, and thereafter, you will yourself enter into an undertaking that neither personally nor through others will you in any way edit the page, so that "the rest of us" can be sure that the Wiki entry (if this clears AfD) remains unbiased and objective&#160;? -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a>

<li>It seems that you have. There is no embargo on facts. If those involved were able to locate and cite the sources in the article, others will be able to as well. If this is not the case, you need to ask yourself if you are in fact performing original research. —<a href="../../../%D0%B0/_/_/User%7E%D0%90_9fd1.html" title="User:А">A</a> 03:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Admin Request:</b> if a strong enough consensus is not reached (to delete the article) by end of voting, would it be possible (as per the nom) to at least delete the history of this article and leave it under its current (neutral) state? If there is a IP/userid specific edit restriction for an article... it may also be useful here. As you can see, even the AFD page becomes a subject of nonencyclopedic nonsense. Yes, I'm a part of it, but I'm on the side of getting it OFF Wikipedia (which I think is good). So, I will voluntarily ask that I be one of the banned editors (if this article survives AFD) Andyru 14:32, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This subject is verifiable and well within the bounds of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability. Whoever said "delete per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>" please cite your guideline for deletion. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 15:06, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
