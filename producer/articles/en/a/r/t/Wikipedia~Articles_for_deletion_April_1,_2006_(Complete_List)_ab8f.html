<p>This article contains the non-notable pranks that don't quite make it into <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a>. But since these pranks are <i>non-notable</i> and the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> article contains a message stating all non-notable pranks will be deleted, the pranks here should not belong in any article. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 04:38, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> What, by definition, is notable? This, in itself, could be a debate argued for every article on Wikipedia. If we look at the supposedly notable website pranks listed in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a>, a great ratio of them are rather techy/geeky web sites that probably tend to be visited frequently by the same folks who visit Wikipedia. (Certainly, WE'RE not the end-all-determiners-of-importance in the universe, as much as we would like to be!) The web is transient by nature, more so with these one-day internet pranks that we're trying to preserve for all posterity. If we choose to note any of these brief incidents, we should list them all. I advocate that we have a sampling of the most prominent pranks at <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> and retain the rest at April 1, 2006 (Complete List).

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia isn't exactly hard-up for hard-drive space. The article is not hurting anyone and I've directed at least two dozen people there because they've specifically said to me, "Gee, I wish there was a place where I could see a list of all the April Fools jokes pulled today." In other words, the article is useful, harmless and it's hardly taking up space desperately needed for another article on obscure anime. Keep the article. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 200.77.30.205 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.77.30.205_a951.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.77.30.205">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and Clean up</b> The thing is, I haven't (nor has anyone else) scoured this list to check to see if any of the items in here are notable. I moved all the items from <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> here and then copied a few of the notable ones for Internet back over. I agree that after the process of determining notable pranks for April Fool's Day 2006, this page could be deleted if people feel it should be, but for now, I think it is important to keep. <a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZebov_acbd.html" title="User:Zebov">Zebov</a> 04:41, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you think a particular entry is noteworthy that others don't agree with, discuss it on the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> discussion page. The problem is, when there are thousands of entries, it's hard for people to find the more noteworthy ones. <a href="../../../z/e/b/User%7EZebov_acbd.html" title="User:Zebov">Zebov</a> 05:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that any of the ones left are noteworthy, (though Im sure a few are) but that's not the point. I don't see the harm in keeping them on a seperate page forever, even if a million people didn't see something, a few may have and want a record kept of it. The Move Content isnt saying that a blogs joke should go between gamefaqs and slashdot, or even anywhere near it, but I don't think the blogs joke should disappear because not everyone in the world saw it or cared. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia that might not be viewed by more than 10 people ever. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be here. 68.1.59.30 05:18, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Definite Keep</b>, I personally don't see peoples problems with keeping this page. I mean, it gives somebody something to do just looking through all the jokes for the day.

<li><b>Definite Keep</b>, This is a great article that records some humorous events in Internet history.

<li><s><b>Comment</b> Since the consensus (much to my surprise) seems to be that all of these events are in fact worth keeping (does that equal "notable"?), perhaps a <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> is order? The problem I have here is that we have two different articles that are on the <i>exact same thing</i>; that sounds like a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">fork</a> to me. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 05:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li>Never mind that last comment; I just can't advocate keeping this article. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 05:53, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Out of curiosity, why are you averse to it existing as a fork? Or in a "less notable pranks" section on the main article? It's not making anyone click on the unimportant pranks, just listing their existence, for anyone that may be interested. There are tons of articles that stretch out into infinity where only a few of the people that read them will ever delve into the wealth of knowledge they possess... I say if it fits, and any one person wants it on wikipedia, (which, I'm guessing each of these qualifies), and it doesn't violate any policies, it should stay. (btw, whoever may eventually tally the votes. I voted above, so ignore this) 68.1.59.30 06:16, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Alright, the forking certainly applies here, however, I don't think the repository of links does. That section specifies the links as detracting from the article, for example on an actors page where the page has 3 lines and then 18 links to fan sites on the actor. In this case the article is the collection of links. Even if you removed all of the links, the mere fact that a site had a hoax should gain it an entry of some importance if someone is willing to write it. The only difference between this page and the real page seems to be the popularity of the sites, and with the votes so far, I'd say a majority aren't happy with the current popularity cutoff.68.1.59.30 06:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the popularity part is the biggest issue, as I noted in my vote below no prior years specify the pranks as notable only, appparently any prank someone felt like listing was included. This year's list is much larger but this seems to be because this year has seen far more pranks than prior years. One example on this whole notable/non-notable thing: On the main page the entry about Yahoo! saying they were buying all of Web 2.0 is listed. On the complete list page it lists right under that same entry two Web 2.0 companies who went along with the prank and posted a fake news item on their websites that they were being bought by Yahoo! Personally I've not seen that type of collaboration much before (actually never personally) so I think it's highly notable. I could add it to the main page but the thing is: who decides what's notable and what's not? Maestro4k 06:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excellent note! I just gave a look at some of the previous years entrys, and there are some incredibly low traffic site pranks on some of them.

<li>The previous years didn't have NEARLY this many entries. The thing is, at what point do you NOT include a prank?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I like April Fool's jokes, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a massive collection of mostly non-notable links. Someone should go through this and <b>merge</b> <i>notable</i> pranks to the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1%2C_2006.html" title="April 1, 2006">April 1, 2006</a> article first, of course, but we shouldn't have a listing for every single website that pulled a prank this year. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 07:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Keep</b>. The current version of the main page seems to have some Internet pranks listed that seem less significant than some of the ones of this ancillary page, judging by the apparent prominence of some of the web pages mentioned. I have no problem with a two-tier system of major pranks relating to well-known sites, companies, etc. (e.g. such-and-such being bought out by Yahoo!) with the rest relegated to the "complete list" page. However, I would strongly object to the idea of removing the complete list entirely. This is a very interesting document of the day's ephemera, many of which will no longer be viewable in the next day or two. A written record of what <i>was</i> out there on April 1, 2006 should be of continuing interest to people who encountered or perpetrated some of the pranks, with renewed interest as people gear up for April 1, 2007. Whether the listing is merged or retained on a separate page, further sorting of the long "uncategorized" section would be helpful, and probably not all that hard to accomplish. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 08:58, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is just to follow up a bit on the discussion since I posted the above. I'll grant that what happened on a blog with 25 readers is less notable than, for example, Google Romance. I will further admit that I naively added a reference to the former before reading that one is not supposed to do that with one's one work. If a "complete" list (or as nearly complete as possible) is desirable, that one line belongs here anyway; if not, it should go. <b>However</b>, such a marginal case is not emblematic of everything that's been removed from the "notable" list and relegated to this one. I see, for example, that the NPR story about the fake product the iBod has been removed from the main page. If a five minute story on a national news program isn't notable, then nothing is. In addition, I have no doubt that many of the Internet references that didn't make the cut nevertheless were significant and of continuing interest to specific online communities. To suggest that this entire second entry is merely a link farm, based on the occasional reference to someone's blog, is a straw man argument. If it makes anyone feel any better, links can be removed to defeat any promotional purpose - but the list itself should be preserved as a historical document. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 03:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is stupid. Firstly Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, which means it should include things that are likely to be noteworthy not only now but in the future too. Nobody in 5 years (or even minutes) time will care what some non-notable website did on April fools day 2006 - they will care what major sites and other media did. Secondly, it would be very interesting to see how many of the people voting have some relation to an entry on the page - I would suggest that the only way for the closing admin to fairly determine the outcome of this discussion is to only count votes from unbiased Wikipedians (i.e. registered users with a reasonable number of contributions) who have not added entries to the page concerned. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 12:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>What evidence is there that it's being used as a promotion tool for websites? And how would being linked off of one single page on Wikipedia (that's likely not going to get very much traffic after a few weeks until next year) actually <i>benefit</i> a site? It'd take a lot more links from many pages to achieve any real benefits. Maestro4k 22:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course it's being used as a promotion tool - people are adding links to their own sites with for the sole purpose of increasing traffic to them. I've seen this enough times on Wikipedia to recognise when it's happening. Having your site linked from Wikipedia, even from a single page, can bring a lot more traffic and affect search engine rankings pretty dramatically. Go look for youself at voters' contributions and see how many have added to the article. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 00:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally I can't predict the future, so I don't know what sites will be notable 5 years from now, how do you? I'm quite certain that people of almost any past era would be quite surprised at what we find interesting about their societies today, and we should keep that in mind. I'm an amateur historian and when I've done research with primary and secondary sources in the past even the tiniest of details can be utterly fascinating. I'm not sure offhand if April Fool's Day was celebrated 100 years ago but if it was I would LOVE to know what types of pranks were pulled, even the minor ones. Just because it seems silly or trivial to you today does not mean it will be seen as silly, trivial or non-noteworthy in the future. Also, please remember Wikipedia's policy of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assuming Good Faith</a>. Suggesting that Keep voters are biased certainly isn't in the spirit of that policy. Maestro4k 22:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but there's a big difference between this and historial data: firstly there is not much data about April fools day 100 years ago - if there was, then you probably would only be interested in the notable stuff. Secondly, nobody will ever convince me that someone 100 years in the future will care what some website which was around for a few years without ever gaining popularity did on April fools day 2006. I'm also not saying that everyone voting keep is biased: I'm saying that a not-insignificant percentage of them are (and no doubt some delete voters too), as is clear from the number of unregistered and newly-created-with-no-contributions users voting. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 09:51, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You missed a very key point in what I said -- we can't see the future, how do you, I or anyone else know what will be considered notable in the future? We don't, and can't without a time machine. To (futily) address your point about people in the future caring: you'd have likely been hard pressed to convince many people during Shakespeare's time that his plays were notable since they were designed as popular entertainment. Nowadays we consider them absolute classics but it's quite likely that Shakespeare himself never thought of them as such, time changes perceptions on things, even jokes. Finally I can't speak for any other newly registerd voters but I personally registered because I felt it was important to tie a name to my vote. I have edited several times in the past (mainly to correct grammatical errors and such) but never felt it was worth registering just for that. Even so I don't think any of the voters are voting because they're biased, astroturfing or trying to stuff the ballot (to mention all negatives suggested so far). I think they're voting what they feel is correct even if they disagree with my stance. Maestro4k 22:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shakespeare's not a good example, since his plays attracted significant audiences during his time and he was well regarded, thus making him notable enough. In any case, Wikipedia's stance on issues like this are well known: if something isn't notable <i>now</i>, it doesn't get into Wikipedia. If and when something becomes notable, it can be included, but not before. To suggest that <i>nobody</i> here is making a biased vote is very naive: this happens a lot on Wikipedia and I have no doubt that plenty of the voters here have added links to sites they're involved with to the page (maybe some have even been directed here from those sites to vote for the page to be kept - this happens a lot too). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 00:46, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Juan Manuel at Buenos Aires <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.216.208.194 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.216.208.194_ee5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.216.208.194">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is just like cataloging anything on the Internet, which Wikipedia is already doing in many other areas.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As I noted on the Article's talk page, this page should be kept for the simple reason that it's just as encyclopediac as the other lists we have going. If we take down this list, then we'd have to take down the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cancelled_video_games.html" title="List of cancelled video games">List of Cancelled Video Games</a> and other such lists for the same reason, yet those lists have lasted since their creation. -- <a href="../../../x/g/a/User%7EXgamer4_9ca4.html" title="User:Xgamer4">Xgamer4</a> 14:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep or merge</b> I echo the sentiments of many above.

<li><b>Strong Merge</b> It's good to be able to find the whole list easily.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> This is, at best, cruft, and at worse, a very silly shot at giving the "non-notable" AFJs their own article.
