<li><b>Leave as separate entry</b>. As a standalone term in use, this does warrant it's own distinct encyclopedic entry. I agree on the desire to avoid duplication, but this article can have redirects within it to articles such as 'History of Ireland', 'History of Britain', etc... and thus would not create duplicate articles. The term's very existance is as a politically-neutral alternative to 'British Isles', so a redirect would be an insult to users of the term (such as myself). <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 15:03, 12 August 2006</li>

<dd>I don't believe any insult is intended, Pconlon! Redirects are a courtesy of Wikipedia in order to facilitate searching/finding pages and to avoid duplication of effort which requires updating of multiple articles with the same information. Perhaps a way to alleviate your concerns would be to address the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> article directly, more strongly emphasizing your concerns in the label at the top, or by discussion on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles</a> talk page. I remain by my Redirect vote, however, but certainly with no insult intended or implied. After all, I created <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Isles_0d4f.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Isles">Anglo-Celtic Isles</a> and believe it is a legitimate term, which is mentioned in the other article along with several other alternatives names for the Isles. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsoxyl_4f54.html" title="User:Isoxyl">Isoxyl</a> 14:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks Isoxyl, I appreciate that an insult wasn't intended, I just wanted to highlight that a 'redirect' would nonetheless be insulting (if unintentionally so)! My firm belief is that every term should have its own entry; when it is an alternative for another, more commonly used term, links within it to the lengthy text in the other article (to avoid unnecessary duplication) are reasonable enough. A 'redirect' effectively says: 'No, you're wrong to use this term - you should use this one instead'. Given the length and breadth of the discussion so far on the 'British Isles' naming controversy, you can see why this proposed redirect will only get some people's backs up. Could you reconsider your support of the redirect proposition? Respectfully, <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 16:27, 12 August 2006</dd>

<dd>I guess I don't look at redirects as telling anyone to use any particular term that they like, only that several terms are in use for the same thing. After all, no one seems to be arguing the Anglo-Celtic Isles are actually a different PLACE than the British Isles. It seems that if we redirect to one article of whatever name, and make note of all alternative nomenclature, and then explain what the Isles ARE, we are giving a good encyclopedia entry for the Islands themselves. I believe that British Isles is the most commonly used term, and therefore is a likely candidate for where the article should reside to serve the greatest number of people. But that does not mean that I don't agree that the term is vehemently opposed by some (including some in this debate). I still think that a well-written warning at the top of the article might satisfy those are insulted by this circumstance. Perhaps even list some of the alternative nomenclature right at the top? "British Isles, also known as the Islands of the North Atlantic, etc.etc."? I don't want to silence anyone... I think if the British Isles article contains the relevant FACTS about the Islands as well as an explanation for alternative terminology (it does, although perhaps these could be fleshed out), and there is a redirect from alternative nomenclature, then the encyclopedia works, and allows everyone's terminology to be useful. However, I do believe that IF there is enough in Anglo-Celtic Isles to warrant its OWN article then it should be left as such. At the moment, that doesn't appear to be the case... It appears to be an academic alternative term for BI, one in concurrent use with BII and IONA. Actually, <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a> is a good example of what I mean, because it is an article which seems to justify its own existence by having extra information about its use which is not needed on BI. ACI doesn't appear to be that way, its use is documented within the BI article. Despite this, I am willing to consider other alternatives, perhaps:

<li>My prime reaction is <b>Delete</b> unless the author can add some citations of its actual use. The British Isles is a well accepted term. This seems to me to be a 'political correctness' neologism. If the author can show that the term has significant use, a short article would be justified, but this should consist merely of an explanation of the term, and a series of internal cross-references (without the sub-category). The largest island is 'Great Britain', not merely 'Britain', which in turn implies that there must be other islands. Furthermore, the earliest record of the name is (I think) in the work of the geographer Ptolomy, who recorded a tribe called the 'Pritanni', who were (I think) in Irleand.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Is Wikipedia and <i>Encyclopedia</i>, or is it just a <b>POV-Pushing</b> instrument where the strongest <b>gang</b> wins. Now suppose a reader wants to inquire as to what <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Isles_0d4f.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Isles">Anglo-Celtic Isles</a> means, then where is he to find out, if not on WP.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The term clearly exists. There is no reason why an article explaining that this term exists should not exist, once it is adequately sourced. Once it doesn't simply duplicate the main article (i.e., becomes another <i>British Isles</i> article under another name — one of them is bad enough!)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The term "British Isles" is a product of British nationalism, dating no earlier than 1621. The term is one of their nationalist myths used to contextualise Ireland within the framework of their nascent British state, and thus make it easier to legitimise the conquest of Ireland. It is no more and no less than this. The very fact that British posters are so passionate about imposing this name, and Irish posters are so animated about resisting it, testifies to the inherent political nature of the phrase. Consequently, the attempt by British posters to tone down their irredentist nationalism by feebly claiming it is a "geographic" term is <i>persistently</i> insulting. There is no rational reason why the terminological creations to support that state's political claims to Ireland should subsume every other name for "this archipelago" (and as Mel Forbes has shown numerous times, there are many such alternative names). <i>There are many more views of the world, including the minor matter of what the natives in Ireland think</i>. Ireland is not a British Isle, and the Irish people do not perceive themselves to be British. Trying to eliminate the existence of Anglo-Celtic Isles and place it under British Isles is entirely about what Edward Said observed was the coloniser's central impulse to control the representation of the native. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 12:47, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree that A-C Isles is used enough to warrent a mention in British Isles (indeed, I have helped add it), but not its own article (issues of duplication aside). --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 05:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Mel - the relevance of whether this term is used is irrelevant. As stated in the definition of 'neologism', 'Neologisms are words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities'. I do not want the term to be excluded from Wikipedia - it has its place, as a paragraph in British Isles. For me, it is baffaling that the page Anglo-Celtic Isles exists. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 05:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strrong redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. Not only does this article describe a term that already exists (British Isles), but its also very POV. The phrase is barely used, other than by a minority of paranoid people of a certain political persuasion, and does not describe the ethnic makeup of these islands very well at all - it makes assumptions based on popular myth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's an example of the aforementioned paranoia, coupled with ignorance: <i>"The term "British Isles" is a product of British nationalism"</i>. The term <i>British Isles</i> can actually be dated back to around 300 BC - much, much earlier than the start of the consolidation of the kingdoms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The very fact that <i><b>some</b></i> Irish editors are so passionate about imposing this name new invention testifies to the severe political brainwashing some people have been subjected to since the 18th century. The correct phrase (British Isles) is merely disliked (or detested) by some small-minded bigots who seethe and froth at any notion of a connection with 'Britishness' that they become too blind to see the term in its correct context. They confuse it with the modern national description, or citizenship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are indeed other terms which people use to describe these islands collectively, and any that have notable usage should also be noted in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">article</a> itself. I don't see the point in creating individual articles for each alternative phrase that is, or has been, created, when an article exists which has the title, not only of the original milleniums-old description, but the most widely known description.</dd>

<dd>El Gringo on this issue reflects the views of the <i>vast</i> majority of Irish people who not merely do not regard themselves as British but take offence at anyone presuming they are. You are absolutely entitled to your opinion, just as French monarchists are demand a return of a king, and American anglophiles are entitled to regard themselves as British. But do not act as though you are anything more than a very small minority, not even a large minority, much less a majority.

<dd>I wouldn't say it was anywhere near a "vast majority" of Irish people that particularly share El Gringo's views on the matter. For a start, of a population of some 5.7 million, roughly 1 million could be considered at least nominally unionist. That's more than a sixth of the Irish population. Unionists are unlikely to take offence at the term. There are also, I would suggest, a large number of people who do not take any offence at the term simply because they really couldn't care less.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> Robdurbar, you still argue that you don’t understand why this article exists at all…well, if someone comes across the term ‘Anglo-Celtic Isles’, wants to find out what it means and types it into Wikipedia, they should expect to be taken to a page that explains it. Having a redirect will not do – the viewer would just be taken to the ‘British Isles’ page and will probably scratch their heads in bemusement. Reference to ACI in the BI article is deeply buried and they surely wouldn’t find it easily. If you want a redirect, you should have ACI clearly stated in the Introduction…as it once was. You wanted it removed from the Introduction and I relucantly accepted this modification (in the interests of consensus achievement and conciseness). <b>With a redirct I believe would come the requirement to have ACI referenced explicitly in the BI article introduction. Is that really what you want?</b></p>
<p>Also, just a correction for Mal who still, incredibly, believes that people who reject the term ‘British Isles’ and use ‘Anglo-Celtic isles’ instead are a ‘minority of paranoid people of a certain political persuasion’! Fact is that the clear majority of Irish people (inhabitants of the island of Ireland) reject usage of the term; I am not paranoid nor of a ‘certain political persuasion’ if that implies any sort of extremism. Argue against the scale of rejection of the BI term until you’re blue in the face and you won’t alter it. Being Northern Irish, you should welcome anything that removes the political divisions standing between you and your neighbours – ‘Anglo-Celtic Isles’ is wonderfully disconnected from political implication…and you can still have a UK passport if you want too! Reading your views is as depressing as listening to an Ian Paisley speech in the hope of hearing something reasonable, balanced, sensitively worded and free of hatred. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 18:20, 14 August 2006</p>

<dd>You say that a "clear majority of Irish people [...] reject usage of the term". However, being an Irish person who has lived on Ireland all my life, I can tell you that I am not at all convinced that this is necessarily the case. And even if it were, that is still not a valid reason to create two basically identical articles which merely have different titles.</dd>

<li>As I stated above in my recent reply, I think your comment, Pconlon, is a potential compromise: redirect to BI, but have <b>ACI referenced explicitly in the BI article introduction</b>. This may be the beginnings of compromise.

<dd>Though I generally agree with your comment on the Irish view of Brtisih Isles, I don't see why Anglo-Celtic Isles should be treated any differently to, say, 'Northern European Isles', 'These Isles' or 'Britain and Ireland'. To list all these in the intro would be clumsy and would violate <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>(although having some sort of graphic lisiting them all may work in some way... I'll have a think on that and get back at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles</a>). Though I agree that some users would be confused to come to a differently titled article - this does happen already with other redirects from sub-issues to main articles. Put simply, Anglo-Celtic Isles is the same thing as British Isles. Wikipedia is not a dictionary and so only has articles about a word or phrase in itself if it is notable in a wider context. As Anglo-Celtic Isles is barely notable (a dozen or so google results, no web of knowledge results etc.), it certainly does not deserve its own entry. As great as our two countries our, I don't think their location deserves two articles. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a difference Rob. <i>Britain and Ireland</i>, etc is a generic term. <i>Anglo-Celtic Isles</i> is a formal title that is used. It exists as a term.

<dd>but more than anything else - more than my belief that having an article entitled Anglo-Celtic Isles simply breaks policy, all political assertions aside - I simply don't see how an article on Anglo-Celtic Isles could ever expand beyond 2 paragraphs maximum, and that's with describing every single use of it. I do not deny that it exists as a term - and I did mention other terms such as 'Northern European Isles' or 'that part of the World that calls fries chips' - but it is in such minor use. As a university student I benefit from access to a number of journal databases, such as Web of Science and EBESCO, and making a number of searches with different combinations (w.g. isles or islands, with/without hyphen) <i>I have failed to find more than half a dozen uses outside of Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/</a></i> (whiich uses it just to mean the islands of the United Kingdom anyway). As a result, I think it can only ever exist as a page that replicates the content of British Isles and includes one further paragraph, which could easily and justifiably be included in the British Isles page. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please. You're- the lot of you- merciless. I cannot think of a more politically POV term than 'British Isles'. Apparently there is a very long history of the British looking down on the Irish as intellectually inferior- going right into very recent times, especially in the financial institutions. How apt that the same people who are pushing their British colonial nomenclature on top of us are also insulting our intelligence by claiming the entire thing is not representative of British rightwing/unionist prejudices. In this you are, collectively, pathetic. Britain has persistently produced the biggest tribal drumbeaters in all of Europe in the past 400 years.

<dd>Mal, all I can think of are the lines of the John Lennon song, "Imagine". But he left out some vital lines <i>Imagine there are no Protestants, or Catholics if you try, no-one to shoot or drum for, it's easy if you try</i>. MelForbes 20:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. All readers: please cease <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and return to the matter at hand. I don't care whether men, women, or purple sheep are debating this AfD, nor whether they English or Irish purple sheep. It seems the only thing that this request for discussion has really generated is attacks from one side or the other. Can we try to look at this from both sides, and come to an agreeable middle ground? I would humbly ask all participants to come back to the discussion without venom or rancor. Let's lay out what is acceptable and not acceptable to both "sides".

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Agree with <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsoxyl_4f54.html" title="User:Isoxyl">User:Isoxyl</a>. There are some silly attacks being made, and some outrageous assertions. The "vast majority" of people on the island of Ireland are well capable of recognising a geographical term as being just that and the term is very much in common usage in Ireland. No problem with the neologism 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' being mentioned in the main article with a redirect, but including it as an article in it's own right?

<p><b>Further reasons to Keep Article</b>. I'm all for focussing on the matter in hand. I have finally inserted into the article a nice (verified) reference I've had for a while. This is not a duplication of anything in the BI article. There are more (non-duplicate) additions to come. Isoxyl, I'm glad you agree with my point that, if a redirect route were followed, it should come with a clear reference to ACI in the BI article Introduction...something like: 'Alternative terms exist in limited use, such as 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' and 'British &amp; Irish Isles'. The trouble is that several users (most probably contributing to this page too!) strongly opposed this. They argued either that the term didn't really exist (clearly not so!) or that usage was so limited that they didn't think it deserved the prominance of an Introduction reference. As long as this ACI article exists, and as long as someone wanting to read about it can type the term into Wikipedia and be taken to THIS article, then I'm able to reluctantly accept keeping the BI article intro as it is. The additional, non-duplicate information in this ACI article shows that this is <b>not just a dictionary-type entry</b>. By the way Bastun, your view about the BI term being purely geographical and 'very much in common usage in Ireland' is far from correct - this is ground we've covered/fought over long ago!!

<dd>We'll have to agree to disagree on that one, Pconlon - I'm pretty sure if I went out on to the street now (in Dublin) and did a vox pop asking "What do you call the big set of islands west of France?" it'd be pretty much 50-50 between "The British Isles" and "Ireland and Britain" (in whatever order). It's simply a geographical term, like the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Sea_b87a.html" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a> (not the Anglo-Celtic Sea...) or the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> (not the Franco/Anglo Channel).

<dl>
<dd>In addition, having actually read through "Foster's The Global Etiquette Guide to Europe, Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success, Part One: Western Europe" (I presume this is the new reference you're referring to), it doesn't actually mention the 'Anglo-Celtic Isles', but rather "Be especially careful in the terms you use to refer to your colleagues from these Anglo-Celtic isles." From the context, it is clearly <b>not</b> intended as a replacement term for 'British Isles' and it is disingenuous to suggest that it is. I would have serious problems, in any case, using this as a verifiable source, as even a cursory read of the article shows many historical and cultural inaccuracies - the Celts only arriving in the islands circa 300BC, the Normans arriving <i>before</i> the Saxons, (Unionist) Northern Irishmen who would describe themselves as 'Britons' (rather than 'British') and 'casual Friday' not having reached these islands to name just a few. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 11:26, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The main question here is the extent to which there should be separate articles for the names of things, people, places, events rather than the things themselves. Encyclopaedias deal with things &amp;tc; dictionaries with words. The growth of articles around words and names has to be restricted as much as possible otherwise the encyclopaedia will become unusable with multiple articles about the same things. You don't have to look very far to see the amount of energy that some people will put into naming disputes to appreciate the problems that will arise if articles are allowed to blossom whenever there is more than one name for a single thing &amp;tc (see <a href="../../../r/%C3%AD/o/Talk%7ER%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata_name_9df9.html" title="Talk:Río de la Plata/name">Río de la Plata/River Plate</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/u/Talk%7EAluminium_Spelling_5b52.html" title="Talk:Aluminium/Spelling">aluminium/aluminum</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_%28soccer%29_c1f8.html" title="Talk:Football (soccer)">soccer/football</a> and almost anything else concerning any sort of football, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Talk%7EDerry_d5f7.html" title="Talk:Derry">Derry/Londonderry</a> &amp;tc &amp;tc &amp;tc). "Anglo-Celtic Isles"'s only purpose is to be a synonym for "British Isles", it has no life or history of its own independent of this, and the same material in the British Isles article could be exactly duplicated there. It is a terrible precedent. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 14:49, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion</b>. This discussion is so cluttered and convoluted as to be very difficult to follow at this point. (This may be against policy on an AfD page, but....) Here is my suggestion based on reading the work so far: Allow a little more time to improve the article by those interested in doing so. Is there some way to put a timer on this? If the article does not improve to where it justifies its own existence (ala <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a>, then we can merge/redirect to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> at some arbitrary later point? Agreed that we don't need a million articles documenting different names, but as long as it links to BI and provides good points for its unique existence, I'm willing to tolerate it. Thoughts on the suggestion?

<dd>The article contains much that is unverified or plainly inaccurate, e.g., "The Anglo-Celtic Isles is a term <b>increasingly</b> used..." - it's <b>lack</b> of use has been demonstrated in this debate. The "controversial term 'British Isles', due to the latter's unacceptability in Ireland and among some Scottish and Welsh nationalists.[1]" What Scottish and Welsh nationalists, exactly? We have one source for this... The only other 'source' for verification in the article - "The populations inhabiting the archipelago have been referred to collectively as 'Anglo-Celtic cultures' in mainstream literature.[2]" has been debunked both on the article's talk page and in this AFD. Lastly, "The term is used in particular in academia and has begun to be used, alongside, or as an alternative to, British Isles in many library referencing systems. Its usage however is relatively small to date." is self-contradictory and unverified - <b>what</b> library referencing systems? Remove all of the unsourced/inaccurate material and you're left with nothing to base an article on. Still in favour of a delete or redirect - but if the above concerns can be addressed then the article can always be re-created later, following existing Wiki protocols. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 00:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in agreement too of course on the encyclopedic (rather than POV-pushing) nature of Wikipedia. I accept some of the comments on wording inaccuracies in the article (e.g. 'many' vs. 'limited use to date') and will look at these in a moment. A thorough search for the best references to back up unverified points will take time and I'm alas only able to dedicate pieces of time to this (I'm not retired like some here are I imagine). Bastun, I assure you that there wouldn't be a 50/50 split between 'British Isles' and 'Britain &amp; Ireland' in a straw pool on the streets of Dublin. The points made about the 'Irish Sea' and other areas of water are interesting, but overlook the long, long period political/military turmoil that has affected life on British and Irish soil - which baggage the stretch of water between the two islands thankfully lacks.</dd>
<dd>The people presently working on this article are well aware of the existance of the 'British Isles' article and of the need to avoid duplication. I certainly have no plans for an alternative history of the archipelago or anything of that sort. <b>Can we please now remove this deletion/redirect tag and leave the article be?</b>, so those of us who use the term and want it properly and fairly (I stress this) represented can get on with improving it. Wikipedia is about sharing knowledge and should be an unrushed, even enjoyable, pursuit. We should somehow keep this discussion though - where would it be best placed in this case?

<dd>I think we should let this run and have the wider community have its say - I'm glad its attracted a few new faces to the issue.

Thus to claims that this is widely use, I'm afraid I just don't believe that it is. On that basis, and on my understanding of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, I stand by my opinion that the article's content should be <b>delete</b>d and the page exist as a <b>redirect</b> to Brtish Isles. That said, if this debate comes out as 'no consensus' - as I suspect it might - then I'll be happy to leave the issue. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've since removed some of the hyperbole and added back in the 'unverified' tag, but the only checkable reference to the use of the term leads to a website which quotes a ballad apparently written in 1914. Now, pretty much any song will be found in several places on the net, but that's the only place where that particular one can be found.

<p>People, this is not an exercise in 'getting the vote out'!! It will be petty indeed if each side went about calling in 'numbers' to support its position...which is where this is going. No one is saying that this term is in widespread use, however it is verified and is used by some, myself included. This debate is about a term that is not just concidentally used in place of another - rather it is used intentionally as an alternative term on an extremely sensitive subject. A redirect would be an insult to those of us who so use it. A suitably worded reference to it specifically should I believe be placed in the British Isles article introduction...it would be essential in the case of a redirect in my view. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 23:52, 20 August 2006</p>

<dd>Nobody is denying that this term is used on occasion. I have yet to hear a convincing case that this means it should have its own entry. It is an alternative term for the archipelago, but there are many others - "these Islands", "IONA", "UK and Ireland", "northwest European archipelago", "West European Isles", "Britain and Ireland", "Western Lands", "British Isles and Ireland", even "England" to some dumb tourists. Should each of these have an entry? Or should there be one entry for the archipelago that discusses all the alternative names in a section within it? That is the question to be answered. If we go down the one entry route, as I and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> suggest, I would question the practicality of including each of these alternative names, and an explanation of their origin and use, in the intro--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 23:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Um. Verified? According to the discussion that's been going on the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAnglo-Celtic_Isles_5ca8.html" title="Talk:Anglo-Celtic Isles">talk page</a>, it's not verified at all. Despite the extravagant claims of academic use, library use, and so on, none of these references have materialised. There is one ballad on a webpage, with no corresponding printed reference (and bear in mind that all of the searches I list below would return hits for this ballad, were there any to find); there is an academic text that uses the phrase "Anglo-Celtic isles" (small i); there is a tourist's guidebook that uses the phrases "Anglo-Celtic cultures" several times and "Anglo-Celtic isles" once (again, small i). Use of the adjective Anglo-Celtic cannot be considered substantiation of the proper noun "Anglo-Celtic Isles", even if the noun attached to the adjective happens to be "isles".</dd>

<dd>Here's a summary of the research I've done to try and substantiate this term. Please note that my Cardiff Libraries subscription does not entitle me to view holdings of any Irish newspapers; perhaps one of the Irish editors could do a corresponding search?</dd>
