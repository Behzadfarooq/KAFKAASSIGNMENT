<dd>You are right...but still NO! This article cleary gives out details, through Sonic Titles timeline. You can see/tell from "sonic R" characters that are dead, from past games. althouhg it needs more work, because it looks like a "Stub" to me. Sonic The Hedgehog Characters is also good, I like the way the contents is laid out, but There is a difference,. Sonic The Hedgehog characters that have died &amp; Sonic The Hedgehog Charcaters, if this articles is much improve, it will be worth it to stay This article explains it all, but with less details, it makes this article look like cheap I don't know if it is a delete: Yes or No: I will say No...Waiting for others, for their thoughts &gt;x&lt;ino 01:11, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok if you want to delete it Fine! But the Sonic The Hedgehog characters needs more improvment &gt;x&lt;ino 15:07, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it's not like it hurts anything by being here. You might say there's no reason to have it because the info is in the character articles, but there's no reason not to have it either. Here, the info is all brought together, and besides, other characters might die in future games. If you aren't interested in what it has to say, just don't read it, don't delete it and ruin it for others who are interested. I've said it before and I'll say it again, do deletionists want to read the entire encyclopedia? <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 17:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, they don't and who says they do? Just because an article doesn't "hurt anything" doesn't make it something that should be included on Wikipedia. You could argue the same thing for practically every article that goes through afd. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information.

<ul>
<li>No, you can't argue that for evey article on afd. If it's a hoax, a chunk of garbled gibberish nonsense, a vanity page for some loser like me (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chris_bensko_a781.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chris bensko">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chris bensko</a>, not one of my finer moments), an attack page, an ad, or original research, then bring down the 16-ton weight. Otherwise, there's no real need to delete it. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 22:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ah, but they're not "hurting anything by being there". Which, by your logic, should prevent them from being deleted. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 19:12, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, they are. Attack pages are a form of trolling; original research is, for good reason, against Wikipedia policy; hoax articles, by definition, are full of lies; ads, vanity pages for losers like me, and garbled gibberish tarnish Wikipedia when people do random article searches and find it. This article is not a troll page; it is not original research, all the information is from verifiable sources; it is not a hoax; it is not an ad for the games, a string of garbled gibberish, or a vanity page about the contributor, nor does it tarnish Wikipedia in any other way. Yes, it covers information that can be found in other articles, but here it brings it all together. True, few people will be looking for it, but you'd be surprised at some of the things people want to find out. By its very nature, Wikipedia has plenty of room for minor or obscure topics not covered in the Britannica...topics like this. If you are not interested in the topic, just don't read the article. There may be others who want to see what it has to say. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 22:36, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Geogre, obviously "die" in this context means "die in the story" of the games.

<dd>Fancruft means crappy blather articles written by hardcore fans of the subject with excessively detailed information (they also have names for sub-genres like gamecruft, bloggercruft, and even Simpsons-cruft). As this article is not especially crappily written and is not excessively detailed (it just has the simple info of which characters have died), it really isn't fancruft. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYeltensic42.618_b2d1.html" title="User:Yeltensic42.618">Yeltensic42.618</a> 00:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
