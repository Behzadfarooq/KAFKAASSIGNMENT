<li>RETORT BY ARTIST: Firstly we seldom use our forum, so not very scientific of you. Second if you google Fabricari, this webcomic shows up as the most relevant result. It has a readership of 5000 unique readers a month and growing. This is significant as the comic is not even a year old and already more read than many established comics on the list. We'll be back.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Yeah, I know that Eric Burns carrys some weight in the webcomics community which is why I mentioned it. But it's also that it was only a single blog posting by him that I found, had I found multiple ones I probably wouldn't have nominated it.

<li>Delete. With respect, google may be a poor way to determine the suitability of a subject for encyclopedic treatment. For example, a porn star of absolutely no social, historical, artistic, scientific, political, or economic significance can easily get more google hits than, say, a 17th century thinker who was historically important in his time, and about whom there is an embarrassment of sources and references with which to write an article. In the case under discussion, I have some trouble seeing how the good gentleman merits an encyclopedic entry. He worked in the MPA for many years and now has his own consulting company—this is a fine thing, but to be the subject of an encyclopedia article there must be sufficient notability such that multiple independent source works are available upon which one may base the article. This article, however, reads like an advertisement you might find on a website—which, as a matter of fact, is exactly what it is. It's from <a href="http://www.wmurrayassociates.com/bios.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wmurrayassociates.com/bios.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>his</i> website</a>, and as that is not licensed under GFDL, it's a <b>copyright infringement</b>. All of which is almost sweetly ironical: there is a good chance this page was written by the subject or someone who works for him—ie. we're dealing, ladies and gentlemen, with a piece on an anti-piracy motion picture suit who's being advertized for free on WP via a copyright infringement—possibly of his own doing. WP is not a venue for free ads, and until something of encyclopedic merit can be written about Mr. Murray, this page needs to go. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>08:39, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most dormitories are non-notable.

The only source for the dormitory having inspired the movie is that an article in the college newspaper says it was "rumored" to have done so. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Also, as to <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelium_f92f.html" title="User:Steelium">Steelium</a>'s earlier points: Comments 1 and 4 are irrelevant and seem like violations of the Wikipedia rules about not engaging in ad hominem attakcs. As for Comment 2, are you advocating the censorship of comments regarding possible meatpuppetry/sockpuppetry/stuffing? Let people look at the evidence and decide for themselves. Now as to Comment 3: "Real place at top three University in Canada" - so? by this standard we would have literally hundreds of building and dorms that would need to be added. "1000s of people have lived there" - same problem as before. "at least 2 famous people are associated with the building" - again, hardly a big deal, and while John Candy may be the famous, the other individual is not at all. "major movie satirizing contemporary North American college life was inspired by events at this Hall" - This has already been dealt with by Metropolitan90, so let me just add that many colleges and dorms at colleges claim to be inspiration for animal house. " Building has 45 year history" - 45 years is hardly a long enough time to contribute to noteworthiness. "There are FAR more articles that should be recieving more attention for deletion than this one, this article is pretty innocuous" - this is simply irrelevant. If there are articles you feel should be deleted then nominate them (please however refrain from engaging in revenge AfD, they are seriously frowned upon). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as there is no solid evidence that it is the inspiration for Animal House, and even if that were the case, it would only be worth a mention in the Animal House and/or McMaster University article. That a famous person, John Candy, lived there is not exceptional. Medium and large universities that have been around for a while are bound to have famous almuni who stayed in the dorms, but that does not confer notability them, or even much to the university. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:09, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Halls of Residence, University Colleges are important places and there are many articles on WP about them. To those people who want to delete them, I ask you to be consistent. There are about 11 articles on Halls from this university alone. They have links from the main university page. This is just one. If it is worse than the others and it is indeed a poor article, it can be improved. If you want to delete all of them, then give reasons why Halls are not notable. I finally suggest that WP will be the poorer without good NPOV articles on Halls and Colleges so prospective students can look at them as an alternative to the POV articles from the university concerned. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:19, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, the other co-writer, Harold Ramis brought his inspiration from his days at Washington University in St. Louis.

<li>I've edited this Wiki in attempts to bring it up to your standards. I've wikified it to the best of my ability, adding links to many terms and words within the reading. Also, I've added more background.</li>
<li>Regarding the very common comment that this Wiki is original research, or unverified claims, I do not belive this is true under your standards. If you take a look under the references section, you'll see that this research is in fact published in a number of reputable journals, which is your guideline for distinguising between original research and a valid entry. The statements that this Wiki is referenced to "unpublished articles by the author of that page," and that the author is "citing his own unpublished papers" are not true, once again, please take a look at the references.</li>
<li>Of mention to the Stage and Hierarchical Complexity page, it is probably a better idea to just delete that one (which has seemingly already been done), and instead just link that term to Hierachical complexity.</li>
<li>And finally, in response to comments that this Wiki may be difficult to understand for the lay person, I will disagree, and simply say that as far as I can tell this Wiki is about as understandable as any other scientific or mathematical entry on Wikipedia.</li>

<p>First of all, "Articles for deletion" is wrong place to discuss such issues. This page is already overloaded, and, as you correctly noticed, the article was created by a not complete idiot. So the proper place to start questioning is article's or author's talk pages.</p>

<li>Give AKA Link Communications the google test and check out the web site? company sure isn't fake, i should know i spent 4 yrs of my life building it. As for Spam Cube we can't give it the google test now as it is a startup co. Few weeks though you should see some notable consumer watchdogs cover the product. I have an interview with computerworld next week. Maybe that would help? not sure what else i can say? Let me know if you need anything else&#160;:-) BTW: Only thing public thats verifiable now about the Spam Cube is its trademark (<a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78411511" class="external free" title="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78411511" rel="nofollow">http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78411511</a>) litigation going on with hormel vs spam cube, inc (very funny might i add hormel is claiming the term spam has killed their brand haha) lawsuit is costing $120,000 (ask any law student or lawyer wikipedian on the cost of TTAB trials they will verify) and we have 11 patents pending with the USPTO on the Spam Cube's technology. Not sure if you guys are familiar with patents but normally patents go for $10,000 - $20,000 each. Theres no BS here.

<li><b>Reply</b> I understand they are scheduled to go on a tour this year of the Western U.S. and U.K, but until that actually happens, this is crystalballism and (at least in my opinion) not relevant. Having been involved with a number of bands over the years, alot of things can happen to derail a planned tour. As for their previous tour, can you provide specific information about it? I've seen general info that they "toured canada" but again, having been involved with bands I know people who have claimed (to music press) that they just completed a "tour of the midwest" when they played 3 shows in Grand Rapids, MI; Toledo, OH; and South Bend, IN... all in podunk bars. I need to see evidence of an actual tour. As for exclaim.ca, I know it's tied to the magazine... but that doesn't necessarily confer notability back to the website. Were they featured in the print edition?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:50, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not being Canadian, I have no clue if they were featured in the print edition, not that it makes much of a difference notability-wise. I've added a link to their tour history to the article. I'm hoping you'll change your mind on this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 19:03, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does make a difference notabilitywise to me. Looking at their past tour schedule, they've played bars and a community center. No concert venues from what I see. This just doesn't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to me. Sorry... But on the bright side for you, right now this appears destined for "no consensus".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see what's so difficult about this. If conclusive proof of their notability can be offered to satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> I would have no problem changing my view and I'm sure Isotope23 wouldn't either. But I haven't seen this evidence and I'm starting to believe it doesn't exist. Without stronger evidence, you seem to be simply fighting for this article from the emotional standpoint of its creator. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 19:24, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I actually have a pretty vested issue with deleting articles about notable bands, which happens far too often in our haste to get rid of "bandcruft" or "garage bands." If I present information that proves its notability, and it's dismissed, there's nothing else I can do. Assume some good faith here, my creation of the article has nothing to do with it, check some of my other band AfD contribs if you need to. I haven't even heard a single song from them, for god's sake. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 21:58, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Generally, my opinion is that WP:NOT an instruction manual/game guide. I might be able to put up with articles about characters/units that have become pervasive in popular VG culture (e.g. <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zerg.html" title="Zerg">Zerg</a>), but otherwise this seems like a rehash of strategy-guide material. What's next, an article about "Archer (Age of Empires)"? Then again, there's an article on <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawn_%28chess%29.html" title="Pawn (chess)">Pawn (chess)</a>, and this is probably no worse than a lot of the Pokecruft floating around, so I'm a bit hesitant to recommend deletion. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 06:33, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> all, while having a presence in wikibooks and vgguides is nice, remember that starcraft and it's descriptions are not the type of thing you'd see in a book. Vgguides is an unnecessary wiki generally, too specific and not even a Wikimedia partner. The articles are not merely strategic, but also describe the story elements within Starcraft. One wouldn't delete a description of a classic novel and it's cast of characters, so this should be the same. That there are some stats or strategies along the way is no matter. I'd even say we need MORE articles on it, having one page for all units and structures is much too large, it should just be a liast page. Using groups would be good though. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 05:16, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). The last three unsigned "keeps" were all made by three different IPs shortly after each other, but were probably still made by the same person, so this is somewhat marginal and I am not entirely convinced this this phenomenon is notable or encyclopedic, but CanadianCaesar has made some valid arguments so I'm calling this a no consensus decision anyway. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:13, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article is clearly <b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></b>. And based on the page history, there have been persistent attempts to violate <b><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a></b> by adding vanity. The article also has <b><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a></b> problems—is this a legitimate phenomena? What <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">published evidence</a></b> supports this assertion? Has anyone written a book or even an article about this alleged phenomena? (And even then, the book or article would have to have been broadly distributed to be counted as a <b><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a></b>.) Additionally, if such a work were cited, all material in the article would have to be restricted to that source to conform to wiki's <i>no original research</i> policy. Keep in mind that Wikipedia is not a primary source of information. All material submitted should have been previously published and editors should stick closely to the original source. However, if an editor accumulated all this information and then had it published (by an independent, professional publisher; a photocopier doesn't count), and if said publication were <i>broadly</i> read by a sizeable number of people (at least nationwide), <i>then</i> the publication could be <b><a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a></b> as a legitimate reference. Otherwise, I see no way around the <i>no original research</i> policy.<br />
<br />
As far as using "google searches" to substantiate the article, I don't give those much weight. One problem is that Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia; so this article could already have been distributed across the net (thus biasing the web results). I would also be suspicious if a web site conveniently popped up to support everything asserted in the article. In any event, web cites (perhaps I meant web sites) should not be used as primary or secondary sources unless the author is recognized as a scholar in the particular field that he or she writes about. And even then, such information should (ideally) be mirrored in a paper-published form with a wide distribution. (Increasingly, I rely less and less on web sources; generally I only use web references if the author is a recognized authority and has published essays or books—in paper form—in his or her field.)<br />

<p>nn local lan party, no assertion of notability. I initially speedied this, and received an upset email from the author. Ain't nothin' that'll be hurt by letting this go through an AfD, and it might help smooth some ruffled feathers. I believe the author intends well, and I don't want him to think some cabalist is beating up on him, so, voila! &#160;:D - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 07:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Just for the record, here is the email I sent to Chairboy regarding the deletion of this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Chairboy,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You'll have to excuse me, I'm a long-time user/reader of Wikipedia, however I just recently created an account to create and edit topics, so I am not completely familiar with all the ins-and-outs of the system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know you meant well, but I am sort of offended. H4x0rLAN is a local organization that I've been helping run for over 3 years. My entry wasn't a blog whatsoever. I was doing my best to accurately document our existence. I thought Wikipedia was exactly for this sort of thing. I was using proper etiquette by following common procedure as I see used on other Wikipedia entries and linking to other Wikipedia entries for certain phrases and items. You say my entry (which was far from complete) was a blog, however I look at say the entry for the Internal Revenue Service. I was following the same format. Does this constitute the IRS entry as a blog? Does that entitle me the right to delete that entry? Why do entries for QuakeCon or DreamHack (other LAN parties) be allowed to exist, but that which I partake in does not?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if I'm sounding rude, but I was working hard on that entry that I thought could be a great addition to help out local gamers of Green Bay in finding an active organization to engage in. Again, it was far from complete and what I had posted was a small sample of the factual information I was planning on posting. Unfortunately, if this is the welcome I receive, I may have to reevaluate my future contributions to Wikipedia. Sincerely, GBLANSandrock</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have hosted events in size from 10 up to 150 attendees and have a community of over 330 individuals from several states and even Canada, which I think meets the criteria for notability. I was not given time to post this information before my entry was initially speedied. Thank you Chairboy for giving me the opportunity to properly dispute this deletion and post my thoughts.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This "local" lan party is in-fact one of the larger "casual" LAN Parties in NE Wisconsin, and as original author/gbLAN owner said, has people from all over Wisconsin, Upper Peninsula Michigan, and Canada. This page is not also complete, more is to be added, and current information is to be expanded. Also, as I have suggested to the Author, and as he reports, suggested to the WP Editors, the title to be changed from h4x0rlan (the bi-weekly event of gbLAN) to gbLAN itself, which stands for Green Bay Local Area Network (the city in which these events are hosted), because the gbLAN community also hosts a semi-annual event called Kick-It-Lan which hosts as up to 150+ people and is one of the larger if not the larges LAN party in WI/UP-MI north of Chichago or Milwaukee, which to me appears to be worth notability. For those siting WP:NOT can you please cite the text you are refering to, as I cannot find what you mean by "WP:NOT A LAN directory". Thank you! Soriano 23:42, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Seems to be an nn news reporter. Fails the "professor test" i.e. there is nothing to differentiaate this person from thousands of others in the same profession. PROD removed previously, article now claims that subject is "award-winning", yet no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> of the award, nor an indication of the importance of the award is given. Article reads like a CV and a copyvio. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 12:59, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, nomination is bad faith bordering on vandalism. IMDB credits alone pass notability test. "Article reads like a copy vio" is a claim that makes no sense whatever; if it is a copyvio, nominator should have little trouble finding the source. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply:</b> IMDB credits are as bit parts in several movies, mostly as a news anchor: 1. IMHO this alone does not equate to notability (although it does add to <i>already established</i> notability from other sources, which the article has yet to demonstrate). 2. The movie roles are not mentioned AT ALL in the article, neither is ANY OTHER mention of notability besides the unproven "award-winning" claim. I nominated the article based purely on what is currently written, which currently equates to nothing more than a simple CV. I contest the "bad faith" claim, and find the vandalism claim truely absurd. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 16:01, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Because of their high public visibility, news anchors are notable. (I'm going to edit out the bit about Jill's favorite hobbies though.) BTW, I think accusations of bad faith tend to be unproductive in AFD debates.

<li><b>Keep</b> I acted hastily and with ignorance by deleting the AFD's. Trolls came to mind. This won't happen again. However, there's nothing <i>controversial</i> about it to warrant deletion.

Source code for the Mindscript development environment the AfR refers to contains no references to Lego or RCX (the Lego Mindstorms CPU/controller unit.) Lego Mindscript is intended for programming the RCX controller. The Mindscript referenced by the AfD is intended for creation of platform independant scripts which run on personal computers.

<p>This collection of internal links is meaningful only as a <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">self-reference</a>; it is not a viable topic for a mainspace list. (Also, the implied threshold of relatedness for including a link on the list is too low for the article to have a notable subject, and too undefined for it to be maintained by other editors.) As I said on the article's talk page, the self-reference problem <i>might</i> be solved by rewriting and retitling it to a "List of topics related to Terri Schiavo", but even that would be a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">non-notable list</a>. The bottom line is that any topics significantly related to Terri Schiavo should be linked to as normal in the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a> article (in the "See also" section if need be), so they don't need a separate list of their own. <b>Delete</b>, but if anyone would like to copy the list to their user namespace (or maybe even <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerri_Schiavo_fd37.html" title="Talk:Terri Schiavo">Talk:Terri Schiavo</a>) as a navigational aid, that's fine by me. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 13:44, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Of course this is not an "article". It is a "list". That is what the title says. We have tons of lists pertaining to vastly more trivial subjects that this list.</li>
<li>Please note Marskell's emotional and long-term involvement with the Terri Schiavo page, his tendency to "own" the Terri Schaivo page, to pre-emptively warn people that they will be reverted (because he is so accustomemed to just doing the reverting) and his tendency to silently revert any changes he does not like. Any attempt by anyone with less authority than the now-inactive Musical Linguist to build up this information in the "See Also" section will simply be reverted by him without notice, with MAYBE a trivial justication afterwards and no futher negotiation on the matter. And also: absolutely no penalty on him for forcing his will upon the article, and no penalty on him for not constraining himself to a fair process (e.g. involving prior notification, genuine negotiation and compromise).</li>
<li>Marskell has already methodicaly hunted down and destroyed two separate attempts to organize this information within Categories. His first attempt to destroy the information was with a declaration that he would remove "most" of the newly-added articles from the normal TS category. Now that Pinktulip has been blocked, note how subtle Marskell, with his "ownership attitude" about the article, and how he can now implictily take credit for the results.</li>
<li>Note also how Marskell, on the TS talk page, had derisive and intimidating comments about the "Good Artcle" process when Pinktulip got a "good article", On the talk page he says "As for the good article tags, I think they're a joke and should be scrapped." But then he got admin after admin to hound Pinktulip, and Pinktulip resists and gets blocked, then Marskell turns around, puts on an innocent face and involves himself with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGood_articles_fe2d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Good articles">Wikipedia_talk:Good_articles</a> and act like a team player! Very clever of that aquistitive scavenger and character assassinator (and ongoing "article owner" with those sneaky methods of his). Marskell had imposed his will on the article for many months and made little progress (and participated in the FAILED attempt to get Feature Article). Pinktulip comes along, starts making progress and Marskell declares him to be a hijacker an keeps whipping up the hysteria. Once Pinktulip, who did NOT fight a revert war against this reverter in the article itself, but stayed on the talk page instead. Pinktulip got whacked due this guy's hysteria-inciting actions.</li>
<li>Look at uneven the tug-of-war contest is: Pinktulip spends hours building up the house of cards so that you all an easily see where the garbage in the politicians is and Timothy Marskell comes along with his fine Linguistic credentials and gives himself permission to go right ahead and knock half the card house over if it does not please him perfectly. Again, Pinktulip could have tried to restore his work, but he, Andrew Wiliiam Morrow, is twice Timonthy's age and much more patient about these sorts of things.</li>
<li>Timothy has done ZERO research. Others like Andrew do the research. Timothy then uses every tactic available to exercise control over the result. We are not talking about copyedit contributions. We are talk about content. Musical Linguist was overt in her pro-life view. Timothy's skewed views seems to coincide with hers. They have had MANY MANY months to OWN this article. They should let other take their turn fairly. I am fourth child from a large Catholic family. I learn very well to how wait for my turn. Timothy does not display that same attitude. Timothy's kind of attitude is what lead to many, many of the messy conflicts on this article. He should excuse himself. He has more than had his turn at it. He is emotionally involved with it. His attitue: if he can find a comma out of place or dangling particile (and I do like the content) revert the whole thing! Very easy. Science fiction writers, I find, also tend to have this bad habit because often what they do in their writtings offer is a great deal of surface, but not much content. -- <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.122.117.175.html" title="User:68.122.117.175">68.122.117.175</a> 12:01, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As others before me have pointed out, there's already a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Category%7ETerri_Schiavo_ae74.html" title="Category:Terri Schiavo">category for Terri Schiavo</a>, and a category corresponding to this list was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Terri_Schiavo_minor_players&amp;oldid=38701198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Terri_Schiavo_minor_players&amp;oldid=38701198" rel="nofollow">formerly</a> attempted at Category:Terri Schiavo minor players. This latter category or list of tangentially-related articles, as Amorrow/Pinktulip/TulsaGal/68.122.117.175 would like it to be, would be unencylopedic, unnecessary, unmaintainable, and impractical. Imagine if, at the bottom of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> article, there were a category corresponding to, in addition to Terri Schiavo, every famous person whose life was affected by death in some way. (Not to mention that there would be no established way to draw the line on just how tangential or remote these relationships could be.) So, respectfully responding to Kuru, Stifle, and others: the best thing to do is delete this list, leave the categories essentially as they are, and hope that Amorrow/Pinktulip will decide to be a little less contentious. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 04:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Reading the angry comments above, I appreciate some users are deeply touched by the Terri Schiavo case, and I sympathise with that. However, from Wikipedia's viewpoint, I have to say that we simply do not organse information in this way, and it would be wrong to start. This information really doesn't need a list, or a category, or a template, or a portal. Some of the pages mentioned in this list are, or should be, linked from <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>. Any more than that really is not useful. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 10:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as this Roleplay's founder, I would first like to note I was not informed of the creation of this page. I haven't any issue with its existence, so I'm not nominating it be removed, I'll leave that decision to whomever makes it. However, you can find a link to the Role-play here, <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/index.php?gmode=index&amp;guild_id=979" class="external free" title="http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/index.php?gmode=index&amp;guild_id=979" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/index.php?gmode=index&amp;guild_id=979</a> In case any may want to verify its existance. Obviously, the role-play is not well known within <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaiaonline.html" title="Gaiaonline">Gaiaonline</a>, so I wouldn’t suggest it be merged with it. However I don’t see any reason why it can't be merged with the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> page, other than the fact its a rather miniscule project. I just thought that as this Role-play’s creator, and supervisor, I had a duty to comment. Thank you for your time. 7 February 2006. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.98.225.149 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.98.225.149.html" title="User talk:24.98.225.149">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.98.225.149_698a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.98.225.149">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a member of the Roleplay, I would just like to say that none of us knew about the creation of the article (especially not the founder) but none of us have a problem with it either.

Anyway, I (and some other members) wouldn't mind if it were merged with the main <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> article, although, as the founder mentioned, it is rather small project. But we would prefer that it remain on its own, not being a big part of either <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaiaonline.html" title="Gaiaonline">Gaiaonline</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_afaf.html" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is the Roleplay's founder again. I believe one of the members edited the page to include several character bios. I decided that if some were included, we might as well include all the ones that we believe are vital. If our members were to add more information to this page, including summaries for different chapters within the roleplay, would this effect your decision on whether this is a legitimate article?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article does not appear to assert notability with any statistics, etc. but appears well-written.

<p>Well, I guess as a fan of and editor of articles concerning bands that are not popular, I never really considered the issue of notability. Obviously, it is not the band <a href="../../../x/_/m/X_Marks_the_Pedwalk_ac87.html" title="X Marks the Pedwalk">X Marks the Pedwalk</a> that is on trial here, but this obscure release by the band's predecessor. As far as notability goes, it does appear that XMTP qualifies, having gone on several national tours in Germany and releasing several CDs on established indie labels such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_Records_a2e1.html" title="Metropolis Records">Metropolis Records</a> and <a href="../../../z/o/t/Zoth_Ommog_5a13.html" title="Zoth Ommog">Zoth Ommog</a>. But like I said, I've already removed the link on the XMTP article to the Black Door single and replaced it with an external link to the entry on discogs.com I'm happy with this, but I do believe that the other XMTP releases deserve their own page.</p>
<p>Actually, I do have to admit that I believe every CD/LP deserves a page on wikipedia, but that's just a personal opinion&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe-dissonance-reports_f53d.html" title="User:The-dissonance-reports">The-dissonance-reports</a> 19:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've been around the net for 15+ years, and IMO having an entire article for this particular slang term is quite silly.

I don't have any objection to a move to Wiktionary, but this just isn't noteable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.

<p>This article is just pseudoscientific add copy for a magic gasoline additive. Contains such nonsense shilling as "Polyisobutylene as a gasoline additive works by hardening the molecules in gasoline so they combust more evenly," violates NPOV, provides absolutely zero supporting evidence for any claims being made, and is completely unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b>The entire information was on wikipedia BEFORE any mention of companies at the bottom. I'm sure this can be verified by some log. Where it starts, "There are two companies that..." and below that was only added recently after it was discovered that it is commercially available as a fuel additive. Therefore, it is NOT add copy. Only a tag at the bottom to list two companies that have it. Anyway, my car went from 34mpg to 43mpg at the end of two full tanks and no tuneup. It works and my personal experience is more substantial than 100% of any cynical rhetoric.

<li>1, Mitsukai - Japanese or just wannabe? Anyway, yes on this page, I am aware that what I wrote sounds like ad copy, but I am simply just telling it how it is. I was simply posting my feelings to all of your responses, which to me seem totally closed minded. George Orwell's worst nightmare. The people who constantly rewrite history. But yes, I am aware of that it sounds like an ad. This is for discussion of that article and I was simply defending what I am posting. Is that not what this edit page is for?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>First off, regardless of whether I am Japanese or not is irrelevant; I direct you to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> to learn a little more about that. Second, if , then you must realize that this is not the place for that; Wikipedia is you are aware that what you wrote sounds like ad copyan online encyclopedia, not the coupon circular in the paper. And it is not a matter of being closed minded, it's called professionalism and adherence to what is the standard here at WP.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 07:59, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>2, are you aware that I didn't write a single word of that entire post on pib? Only about companies that do have it available. I did that because the post seemed to imply that it was impossible to get. That is why I posted what I posted. You all seemed to never have a problem with the WHOLE article this entire time. That is because you only see that someone mentions a company and all of a sudden it is ad copy? Are you aware of how ridiculous that seems to me from my point of view of never writing the article myself and being attacked for it being blamed for writing an ad and you all talk about how scientific, etc... you need to be?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No, when we see something that is written like ad copy regarding a company, that is when we call foul. And for the record, I never claimed any scientific response to it, as that is not my balliwick. My expertise comes in noticing when something is advertising, journalism and creative writing. Guess which one yours came in as.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 07:59, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>3, Craig Stuntz claims the author never contributed to any other article, so therefore it smells like an ad. Just another example of erroneous ridiculous thiking and judgement. For one, you say THE author. There were two authors. The first wrote the entire article and you can verify since you know this wikipedia better than I do that it was from somebody else. Why don't you do that and post who the original poster was? You seem to ignore that fact and point fingers at me. The second author, me, simply posted a tag at the very bottom of the page letting people know that the product is actually available. Why don't you just look at the server logs and see this since you all are so "scientific".</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You seem to be taking this rather personally for someone who merely "posted a tag". Not pointing fingers, merely observing that detail.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 07:59, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>4, Personal experience is irrelevant? That is ridiculous. Therefore only your deskjocky non-real world testing pencil pushing ideas are real in this world but not what actually happens? Pretty hypocritical. The only thing that is irrelevant is what each person wants to believe is true. What is relevant is what is without judgement. 34 to 43 mpg is what is. What does it mean? All meaning is made up. You want to speak with logic but it is rhetoric. You want to be scientific, then be scientific and be consistant in each and every sentence. Otherwise, you are a cynical blowhard. Just have some integrity, not just conditional integrity.</li>

I can't speak for whoever did write that whole article. Anyway, it was only until a few days ago I tried to edit a page and found out I had to register so I did. I NEVER had to do that in the past.

<li>This is an abstract presented at a scientific meeting. As I know from my own research, most meeting abstracts never get published in peer-reviewed journals, and this one has not either. This particular abstract shows graphs of various benefits of putting PIB in fuel, but there is no statistical analysis, and the methods are sketchy, serious flaws in presentations of scientific work. Further detracting from the abstract's credibility is that it is hosted on the web site of a company that makes fuel additives. It also appears that the reported fuel mileage tests were carried out at this company's facilities.</li>
</ul>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As far as the specific fuel mileage test results he reports, well, there aren't any. There is an acceleration test, measuring how much fuel is consumed during acceleration, but it has no statistical validity and no indication of how many times they repeated the test. The report claims that for acceleration from zero to 10 miles per hour, fuel consumption went down from 11 grams to 2 grams, an astonishing 450% improvement. But by the time you get up to a speed of 30 miles per hour the improvement is 16 versus 21 grams of gasoline, or a 30% improvement. No results for higher top speeds are shown. Also, no result for overall fuel mileage is reported. They could have just filled up the tank and driven around a track for an hour. A real test would involve multiple runs on multiple cars, switching between fuels, with the fuel dispensed by someone independent from the rest of the team so that the driver and analysts don't know which test run used which fuel until it was over (see <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blinding_%28medicine%29.html" title="Blinding (medicine)">Blinding (medicine)</a> although the concept applies to all scientific research). I suspect there is no improvement above 30 MPH and no improvement in ordinary driving conditions. Certainly there is no evidence here for a claim of "improved gas mileage" since they didn't measure it.</li>

<li>This paper discusses how to make snowmobiles run with lower emissions in sensitive national parks. Synthetic <b>oil</b> blends that are high in polyisobutylene cut down on engine emissions. No claims about gas mileage are made, and they never even tried putting PIB in the gas.</li>

<p>Got anything else to add? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Thatcher131</p>
<p>1. Listen Tom, I have a problem with you continuing to post my personal information as if you are hoping to appear smart enough to discover it? Should I do the same and post all of your personal information on this website for all to see? It was simply posted in a document on the website that I linked to. Anyone with common sense could have found it so stop trying to impress yourself with your childish investigative duties.</p>
<p>2. I used a nickname since some wiki note said to sign the posts. I get a nickname and sign the post and you make a point to point that out! LOL, are you seriously dedicated to just being a nuisance or do you just want to stick with the issue? Your arrogant response simply shows that you are implying or trying to accuse me of posting as someone else? If you have any common sense you can see that the user account is the same. If I was hiding, would I sign my name, Tom? or...would I sign it as an anonymous handle like thatcher131 on a continuous basis? Seems you are the one doing the hiding. Also, would I link to a website that has my contact info? That is the point to the website is for people to contact me to begin with.</p>
<p>To Mitsukai</p>
<p>1. "you are aware that what you wrote sounds like ad copy". You took it out of context intentionally or just because you aren't that observant. I said yes to this editing page by telling responding. In the PROJECT page link, the answer is NO, it didn't sound like ad copy to me. That article that allaboutpoly??? posted, was mostly information from the Washington Times newspaper article about pib. The very last part, I simply posted that it is avaiable and where to get it from!</p>
<p>2. "when we see something that is written like ad copy regarding a company, that is when we call foul" That is sensible and I agree with you. Before I wrote where to get it, it was perfectly acceptable. Before that, the article was the same, but only AFTER the contact info was at the bottom was the actual content "blasted". Is that not seeming hypocritically illogical? If there was any problem with that text, it should have been changed before hand. I don't mind following wiki rules, which I will read your link to the wiki commercial info, but don't you think you have a responsibility to be at least honest about what you are complaining about? Before the contact info, no problem, after contact info, the actual content of the article was called into question. That is just immature nonsense.</p>
<p>3. By being insulting? Basicall, being called a liar and having arrogant stupidity thrown at me about having the testimonial believable and will I accept a bad two party out of state check? Why don't you tell that to the others who are the ones that started with the insults. Don't give me your hypocritical blabber. Just be honest and balanced...not narrow minded and biased. Remember, it is the cynics here that started throwing insults. Don't pretend they didn't.</p>

<li>Why is this marked for deletion? Because it has the word "products" in it? That is the name of the record label - a pun on "dairy products". Should I change the article name or something to fit it into some sort of naming scheme? Note that this is a legitimate record label and I have no affiliation with it whatsoever.

<dd>It's nominated because it looks like a straight advertisement, and nothing in the extremely short article really adds anything much to anyone's knowledge about the label, save telling them that it exists.</dd>
<dd>This is nothing at all to do with "naming schemes" (it's a great name) but you need to read what Wikipedia considers <b>notable</b> in places like <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The article as it stands doesn't appear to meet any of those criteria (not that the label <i>doesn't</i>, just that the article doesn't make it clear and verifiable that it does). A "prod tag" is a {{prod}} added to an article to say that it's <b>PRO</b>posed for <b>D</b>eletion — a method of marking an article for possible deletion within five days without going through the process of debate and discussion that's happening here. Removing the prod tag to open the discussion up is the right thing to do if you are disputing deletion, as you are. <b>Abstain</b>, by the way. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 01:05, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I dunno, I guess delete it then if it violates the rules. It was just supposed to be a stub. Ruby, is there something wrong with writing about record labels? I have been writing about them as Wikipedia only has articles on several important electronic artists and is missing many influential artists of today.

<li><b>Comment</b>. From the article: <i>He is currently regarded as one of the best young rowing coaches in the UK. In is rowing career "Nige" had a number of successes, captaining IC, winning the Temple event at Henley attaining a top 10 finish at Tideway and representing his country at under 23 level.</i> I really don't see why these appear to some as "insignificant" claims. Sure they may be bullocks, but they are still <i>claims</i> of notability, in my view. A7 should apply to artilces that make no apparent claims of notability whatsoever.

<li>All claims in this article are true. As for notability dont see how it is not noteable.

<li>Sure it does. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for deletion</a> isn't a vote, as such, more an attempt to gain an idea of the community's consensus. Anyone is welcome to make comments here. Counting the votes is one way of demonstrating that consensus, though. At the moment, those votes are in favour of deletion: WildKard and lane are sockpuppets or new users and will be ignored. You are in favour of keeping, but unless you specifically deny it, here, everyone will believe you are the subject of the article, and may give your comments a little less weight as a result (see <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> for our policy on self-authored articles).

<p>I am taking the slightly drastic step of proposing an article for deletion which previously went through the AFD process and was not deleted, this is the first time in my time as a Wikipedian I have done this. In case you were wondering, I was not the person who proposed deletion the first time. That time, there was no consensus, but several people supported deletion. The reason is that it has just been decided to delete the biography of another person of similar notablity, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anthea_Irwin_0e4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anthea Irwin">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anthea Irwin</a>. I pointed out in the course of this AFD discussion that it had been decided not to delete Jacob Sanders, one person replied that he ought to be deleted as well. They were both candidates for minor parties at the 2005 UK general election, I fail to see the fundamental distinction between them. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 19:58, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The only difference I see between Sanders and Irwin is Sanders distant relationship to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Sanders_5f17.html" title="Bernie Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> which might make him marginally more notable. I general, I believe unsuccessful minor party candidates should not be included, unless they do exceptionally well and/or attract unusual amounts of media attention.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per nom. This list makes verification almost impossible, considering the vast kinds of firms there are. It claims that it's a list of 'notable firms.' Yeah, right. What makes any of the redlinks unnotable? How can anyone tell if a redlink is notable or not? I suggest we split this list up into sublists, including corporate law firms, tax law firms, entertainment law firms, etc. I am in shock that this list includes fictional law firms as well.

I'm sorry <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> - nice try, but notability is too subjective a term to be defined in this way. I refer back to my comment about a law firm in <a href="../../../n/i/u/Niue.html" title="Niue">Niue</a>. Does notability include dealing with all the conveyancing transactions in any given place? Or are we talking number of fee-earners? Or are we talking about number of law suits they act on? Or are we talking about fee income?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is a notable PBS show. The original reason it was put up for speedy delete was because it was previously only a one sentence article without any sources, so naturally someone who had never seen the show would jump to conclusions. However, if the person who put up the delete tag is watching this next time please try and look it up on a search engine before deleting it.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> pending verification of claims like "invented the term 'gay pride'" (if he did invent it, he's notable, if he just claimed to do so, he's just a pillock), plus if the rather weird-sounding Expansionist Party is notable then so's he, as its presidential candidate in 2000 (though what "self-declared candidate" means I'm not sure). <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 00:35, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> This guy is an idiot. He claims this about the ferry-furry distinction: * Quote-<i>THIS is the famous "distinction without a difference", except that there are about 4 times as many -erry's as -urry's. And please note that Dictionary gives woor.ee, foor.ee, and hoor.ee (that's the sound that the U with a 'hat' (circumflex accent) shows: short-OO), which I have not heard so regard as bizarre. Either they heard wrong or they're on drugs.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Dictionary, oddly, is sometimes just plain wrong. For instance, "water" is not shown there as ever being pronounced "wut.er", but I listened very carefully to reports of water-main breaks on TV stations in the New York Tristate Metropolitan Area (the broadcasting capital of North America), and wut.er is plainly the pronunciation educated people in this area give that word. The SSWD project, of course, cannot offer "water" precisely because it has more than one common pronunciation.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li><i>If you put together the -erry's and the -ery's pronounced the same, you get a MASS of words with ER as the crucial spelling, but if you try to use -ury rather than -urry, you get a completely different sound. So I think we'll go with -erry. But I appreciate your views. Cheers.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Quote-<i>UR, ER, OR, and AR may be pronounced with tiny differences by SOME speakers in SOME dialects as to SOME words. I went to your URL for the Cambridge dictionary, which offers TWO bizarre transliterations (which may or may not be rendered in standard IPA but is opaque to me -- IPA transliterations tend to proceed from the positions of vocal apparatus of the linguists who speak them in preparing to write them; SSWD is concerned about what people HEAR, and if they hear no difference between, for instance, vaann and venn for French "vin", it doesn't matter to them whether the person saying it forms the word one way, because the listener hears it the same no matter which way a speaker might articulate it). Most to the point, the Cambridge dictionary shows TWO pronunciations, British dialect and American standard.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>I then went to the Merriam-Webster URLs for the other words and clicked on the speaker icon to listen to the pronunciations rendered, in American English, and found no distinction worth making. All those words would rhyme PERFECTLY as most people regard things. Of course, we could avoid the problem altogether by saying that there are two different pronunciations for "worry", so the word can't be changed!</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>For most ordinary , for whom the SSWD project is intended, not for linguistics specialists, there is between a great many word pairs or groups, no difference worth 'worrying' about. There are a lot of overeducated people who have bugaboos about tiny matters of no consequence, and will argue them endlessly, to everyone else's tedium. I'm not about to argue the linguistic equivalent of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, a subject that may have fascinated some medieval theologians but nobody else.</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>The SSWD project is about NEEDED change, and preferably changes that people can readily apply to things they HEAR. One transliteration for a small range of actual sounds is convenient, and all spelling is convention. Few speakers of standard English distinguish in sound between "ferry" and "furry". Having a distinction in spelling for these two HOMONYMS is useful. As to which spelling you favor for a reform of "worry", I have noted that you favor "wurry".</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem may be only that a following-R tends to alter the quality of the vowel before it, for some speakers more than others. I have not yet offered this word (which you plainly render "wurd" and I render "werd") and might select "wurry", on the basis that some people might see it as parallel to "merry", which they pronounce like "Mary". Or I may not offer it at all, since, as some people regard things, it has two pronunciations so cannot be changed if a change would antagonize some significant body of speakers. I am asking for more comments. Cheers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Quote- <i>YES, I noted that in checking "merge", some dictionaries use the U with a hat as the vowel. But in any case, that is the ER sound, as shown plainly by the sample words in Dictionary.com's own pronunciation key: "urge, term, firm, word, heard".</i></li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>As for "ont", I suggested that because "ant" is a homophone we can eliminate from a language filled to overflowing with homophones, and seems to those of us who say "ont" -- meaning a large proportion of the best-educated people in the U.S. and almost everybody in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, etc. -- that calling a person by a homophone for an insect is arguably disrespectful. I have no power to impose anything, and the SSWD site is designed mainly to make people think. As for "tord", too-waurd is a spelling pronunciation, and as with ev-er-y and other spelling pronunciations (which my Random House Unabridged labels so people know better than to use them), spelling reformers can properly advise people that tho they think they are being careful to be correct, they are actually being wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between "ferry" and "furry" is, I repeat, not "worth making. All those words would rhyme PERFECTLY as most people regard things." People who try to draw needless distinctions and force people to try to supply only one of essentially interchangeable spellings do spelling reform a disservice. This is not the distinction between "merry" rhyming with "berry" and "merry" rhyming with "Mary". It is TRIVIA that ordinary people do not waste time on and cannot justify wasting educational time and money on. If you see a poem in which one line ends with "ferry" and the next appropriate line ends in "furry" or "worry" or "cherry" or "very", will you be startled by an appalling lack of rhyme? If so, you are one in perhaps 15,000 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>Native speakers of English cannot and do not make the short-E as in "bed" and follow it with R in the same syllable and come out with anything like what most people say for "very", "berry", etc. Following-R changes the quality of many vowels in its same syllable.</li>
</ul>
<p>+</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all the silly and PRETENTIOUS distinctions you want. Ordinary people concerned with communication rather than language as an arcane study to itself will not trouble to heed you.</li>

<p>I was notified by email that the article about me was being considered for deletion. I did not write that article, and do not control Wikipedia's behavior. A simple Google or Yahoo search for "craig schoonmaker", however, should suggest that this tiny article should be retained, since such a search produces over 100 distinct mentions, excluding my own webpages and the Wikipedia article and other sources quoting that article. Among the many mentions are an article on the Columbia Journalism School's News Service about my political work regarding Canada(<a href="http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-04-30/518.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-04-30/518.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-04-30/518.asp</a>); some Italian-language mentions that <b>do not question my role in coining the term "Gay Pride"</b> (<a href="http://digilander.libero.it/falcemar/varie/omo/pride.htm" class="external free" title="http://digilander.libero.it/falcemar/varie/omo/pride.htm" rel="nofollow">http://digilander.libero.it/falcemar/varie/omo/pride.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.caffeeuropa.it/attualita/92gay-alemanno.html" class="external free" title="http://www.caffeeuropa.it/attualita/92gay-alemanno.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.caffeeuropa.it/attualita/92gay-alemanno.html</a>); a discussion of my work on homosexual separatism that mentions my inclusion (at length, I might add) in the book <i>The Gay Militants</i> by Donn Teal (<a href="http://coffeehousestudio.blogspot.com/2004_09_01_coffeehousestudio_archive.html" class="external free" title="http://coffeehousestudio.blogspot.com/2004_09_01_coffeehousestudio_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://coffeehousestudio.blogspot.com/2004_09_01_coffeehousestudio_archive.html</a>); a mention (with a picture that I did not provide) in a directory of biographies of noteworthy gay men (<a href="http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bios2/scho2.html" class="external free" title="http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bios2/scho2.html" rel="nofollow">http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bios2/scho2.html</a>) that incorporates some info from the Wikipedia article but has other info as well; recognition of my role in questioning the HIV theory of causation of AIDS (<a href="http://www.aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.htm</a>); mention by a prominent AIDS Dissident of my role in showing media misdeeds (<a href="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data/jlwar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data/jlwar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data/jlwar.htm</a>); many mentions of my work in spelling reform (my "Correct Pronunciation" dictionary is shown as a resource on many websites) and on, and on. The mere fact that some people may disagree with me on pronunciation or concerning my particular spelling reform does not alter the fact that my system has been mentioned as one of the top Internet websites on the subject. I am in <i>Who's Who in America</i>.
