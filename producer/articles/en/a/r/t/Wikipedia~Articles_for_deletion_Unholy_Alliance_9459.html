<p><b>SAVE THIS ARTICLE</b> The two voters above clearly identify themselves by their religious affiliations. I prefer to keep that part of my life private. If it disturbs them to see such ideas in print, let them refute them, point by point; otherwise keep still and reflect upon them. I have lived nearly all my life in Kentucky and North Carolina and know the Unholy Alliance for what it is, a fixture of American life. It was a common topic of discussion for as long as I can remember. The political abuse of well-intended religious impulses is something that must be reported and brought to light, not hidden. Intellectual cowardice has no place in Wikipedia. Several vague allegations have been made. Be specific or be quiet. For shame... --<a href="../../../m/b/h/User%7EMbhiii_4194.html" title="User:Mbhiii">Mbhiii</a> 19:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's nothing non-reliable about using Google searches to establish that a term has wide use, but my main intent is to use them as temporary hooks for better citations later, which seems acceptable to others (read discussion). Still, if all one wants to do is establish wide use of a term, Google searches would suffice as permanent citations, but for that purpose alone. I'd accept a radical rewrite to conform to Wikipedia standards that does not delete previous versions. Wanna do it?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - personal religious motivation, especially when identified as such, is germane to the discussion.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your gut reactions have no place here. A collection of facts pointing to a new idea can be inflammatory alone, but does not constitute OR.

<dl>
<dd>I am not sure where you are coming up with the "gut reaction" thing
<dl>
<dd>your "piece of ..." comment</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>but ad-hominem attacks against people arguing to delete the article are not going to curry you any favor or do anything to advance your cause.
<dl>
<dd>When people identify themselves as editors, and religious, they are open to question as to their motivation when editing or deleting an article on religion, i.e. are they trying to advance their own?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A collection of facts pointing to a new idea is, in fact, OR - read <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> for clarification.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, of course if the meaning is a "totally new idea," but it isn't. "Unholy Alliance" been around for a long time, as a general, vague epithet, and, as a very specific, and generally regretted, lack of separation, in the South, of politics and religion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Not one of the references listed in the article supports the notion of the "unholy alliance" as a concept.
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I wonder if you read any of it at all. All three articles mentioning Baptists and Bootleggers in the title do offer support. At least one article has the very concept named in the title! Would the writer use it in his title if the concept had no immediately identifiable meaning?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Google results cannot be used as references,
<dl>
<dd>That's a matter of opinion (if you read the discussion).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>and culling references where the term is used does not constitute reference material, either.
<dl>
<dd>I'd agree, but it's a good starting point for documenting something that seems to exist, heretofore, largely in folk-lore, until recently.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Add some verified, reliable sources documenting the subject of the article and the OR concerns may be alleviated.
<dl>
<dd>I'm willing to do that, but Jeez-Louise, if you read the discussion you'll know I'm a strapped single-parent, and on top of everything it's tax time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Spamming an article with Google results and unrelated sources DOES NOT satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not trying to spam anything, but provide hooks for myself and others to investigate further.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Furthermore the unsubstantiated allegations of the Catholic Church colluding with the Nazis comes across as rather inflammatory and the article could be interpreted as a thinly veiled <a href="../../../a/t/k/WP%7EATK_b196.html" title="WP:ATK">attack page</a> and qualify for speedy deletion.
<dl>
<dd>Do I have to document that, too? It's been on PBS and the History channel for decades it seems, and it qualifies as an example of an Unholy Alliance. Read up on Pope Pius XII and the operation to spirit Nazis out of Europe at the end of WWII to South America.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suggest, if you feel this article is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, that you clean it up, source it, and refrain from making baseless jabs at the nominator and other participants in the discussion. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 20:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Willing to keep trying and responding to criticism, so long as it is very specific, not general or vague as is much of what's on this page. Look, any editor who identifies their religious preferences must expect their motivations to be questioned when editing a religious article. I'd propose such people be required to recuse themselves, like judges, as a matter of Wikipedia policy.--<a href="../../../m/b/h/User%7EMbhiii_4194.html" title="User:Mbhiii">Mbhiii</a> 22:17, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An editor's religious views do not constitute a conflict of interest as they are citing valid Wikipedia policies that have <i>nothing</i> to do with religion.
<dl>
<dd>You don't seem to understand the analogy of a judge. It doesn't matter that the laws (policies) have nothing to do with religion. If he's hearing a case that involves his religion, he must recuse himself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The motivation of the contributors to a debate is not relevant to the veracity of their observations.
<dl>
<dd>It most certainly is, because of the iceberg theory of mind, only 15% is above water (conscious).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Trying to discredit them due to what you feel to be a conflict of interest is <i>still</i> an ad hominem attack and disruptive to the flow of discussion on the merits of the article.
<dl>
<dd>It is not in the least, rather it is a concern that should be common to us all, and please note this discussion is flowing with civility.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Please refrain from trying to discredit others and focus on telling us why the article should be kept.
<dl>
<dd>It is no discredit to address that which we cannot help (the 85% below water) but to ignore it is stupid. The article has merit, and I'm willing to work getting it up to standards. 'Nuff said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As far as your sources in the article are concerned, yes I have looked at them insofar as I am able to. Whether the writer of an article would use the term <i>unholy alliance</i> or not has no bearing on the discussion of the concept.
<dl>
<dd>...a simply amazing statement, in light of questions as to whether the term refers to anything real at all. Given that it does, then your criticism has value, but also if it does (refer to something real), don't delete the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The article establishes an unsourced dictionary definition of what <i>unholy alliance</i> means and then dives in to a lengthy recounting of examples of what one might percieve as such.
<dl>
<dd>Yup, and consider just how many Wikipedia articles do exactly that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Let me reiterate&#160;: it does not matter if you can come up with a million articles where someone uses the term.
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that'd pretty well establish it as a term of use; wouldn't you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Unless the term istelf is the subject of the source, then the source does not help with attribution.
<dl>
<dd>Point taken that assertions about the term need to be documented (if not blatantly obvious).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, yes, you must be prepared to cite sourced for information you put in an article. You cannot expect readers to do your homework for you and simply "figure it out".
<dl>
<dd>Certainly not for the long-run, I agree.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You cannot expect future editors or the AfD participants to sift through Google results and find something to defend your point of view. I am sorry you are a strapped, single parent with little time but that still does not put the burden of proving your point on anyone else. Spin the issue all you like, but unless the article is properly sourced and cleaned up, it fails Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 22:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, good answer; lemme chew on that. Though it does seem to have worked to some degree, attracting other contributors and editors. I'm willing to cut back to what can be established or proven about the concept, and let others add what they will as time goes on and new sources come to light. --<a href="../../../m/b/h/User%7EMbhiii_4194.html" title="User:Mbhiii">Mbhiii</a> 23:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The judge analogy does not apply - we are not judges. We are not a jury. This is not a vote. We are expressing ideas for consideration by the closing administrator. It is an attempt to establish consensus. In any case let me break this down into simple terms - the bulk of your article is <b>not</b> about <i>Unholy Alliance</i> as a topic, but is being used as a medium to exposit what by your definition <i>are</i> unholy alliances.
<dl>
<dd>There are a very great number of articles here, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomania</a> for instance, that are exactly in that format. Examples serve to flesh out and make real what would otherwise be pretty dry stuff. Please, add your own examples, if you know of any.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The entire section of the article about the term <i>unholy alliance</i> is unsourced and unreferenced and <b>that</b> is the problem.
<dl>
<dd>I concentrated on trying to answer the original objector (see discussion) who is a Baptist and concerned about the prominence of Baptists in the article. Having done that, I'm ready to address yours, if you don't kill it first.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That your Google searches and links establish the <i>existence</i> of the term is not in question, but establishing that something exists is NOT the point of sourcing.
<dl>
<dd>Now, that you admit Unholy Alliances exist, don't delete the article on it, but edit and enhance it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I am not going to debate this issue with you any further in the interest of not disrupting the debate overall, particularly since it seems you are more concerned with the religious affiliations of the people who have debated here rather than the substance of the article and its fitness in terms of Wikipedia guidelines.
<dl>
<dd>It's not their religious affiliations that bothers me, but that they would advertise them as part of their association with Wikipedia, then dare call for the deletion of an article that addresses an abuse of religion, one that results from a lack of religious oversight.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Google searches are a good start for a work in progress.

I realize now the two should've been separated. Unholy Alliance, in general, and then again, specific to Southern US politics and religion. That one could be split as well into pre- and post-Nixon.

<dd>I don't care how many analogies, theories, metaphors or comparisons anyone throws at the issue. The black and white truth of the matter is that two possibilities exist - either the article passes or fails inclusion criteria.

The motivations, affiliations, beliefs or attitudes of the people <b>do not</b> somehow exempt the article from having to meet the basic guidelines for inclusion! Since this is not a vote the closing admin does not count how many people say delete versus how many say keep. The admin will weigh the evidence presented both in favor of and opposing the deletion, measure the quality of the article against the standards, determine what the consensus of the Wikipedia community is on the issue and then close the discussion appropriately. If as you believe those&#160;!voting delete have no bias in policy then you have nothing to fear because the closing admin will take this into account. If however the concerns brought up by these&#160;!votes are <i>valid policy related issues</i> then it does not matter their motivation - either the article must be fixed to meet standards or it gets deleted. Bottom line&#160;: this is an "Articles for Deletion" debate, not an "Editors for Scrutiny" discussion.

<p><b>Weak delete</b> - Usually I would recommend RfC, as suggested by Armed Blowfish above, because the primary problems are OR and POV, which are usually fixable. (As, indeed, the citation issues have been somewhat addressed, although the effect is that now it's a very well-documented rant, as the sources seem to be cited to support the OR argument, rather than to document how the term is frequently used.) However, I don't see <i>this</i> article ending up as more than a dictionary definition once all the POV and OR are taken out. From the discussion it appears that this term is more of an expression (which doesn't justify having an article to archive its uses) than, say, a political science term of art (which might very well justify an article to explain a poli sci concept). So even if it's fixed, I doubt it will ever be an encyclopedia article. The way to save this article is to find <i>better</i> sources, not <i>more</i> sources—professional or academic sources using it in a political studies context. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 15:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>WRONG</b> - the article is in no sense a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rant.html" title="Rant">rant</a>. Such language, where it exists, is to be found on this page and the discussion page, but, most importantly, not in the article itself, which has become a comparatively dry listing of facts, descriptions, and instances of the subject, as it should be. I don't suppose any self-professed <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican.html" title="Republican">Republican</a>, such as yourself, would be too happy with this article's existence, but I would expect a self-professed <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeptic.html" title="Skeptic">skeptic</a>, such as yourself, would be quite happy with it. Anyway, calls are in to academics cited, Callahan, Yandle, and others. --216.77.231.87 17:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, you caught us: half-page Wikipedia article, listing "instances of the subject," has all of us at the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vast_Right-Wing_Conspiracy_f756.html" title="Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy">Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy</a> very, very unhappy. (While we're on the subject of rants, that article has a pro-Republican one. Let me address that.)<a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 00:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>KEEP AND MAKE A COPY</b> (small joke). I agree it's a work in process. I find it a fascinating collection of concepts that feed my philosphical questioning about -- guess what? Yes! That's right! "Unholy alliances!" Perhaps if some insult doesn't get this article banned I can add something to it. I don't find any OR or POV certainly not over the top and nothing that can't be obliterated by the next editor. --<a href="../../../x/g/e/User%7EXgenei_d0b4.html" title="User:Xgenei">Xgenei</a> 23:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><s><b>Weak keep</b> - the article premise (<i>that "unholy alliance" has been used to describe religious groups working with political ones</i>) is <b>fine</b>,<br />
the WP:SYN and WP:NPOV problems come from the <i>examples</i>—so delete just the offending material! (ie, "Ralph Reed...bootlegging.[19]")<br />
The article can still talk about the southern strategy (very mainstream), Ratlines (mainstream enough to have an article), and Eisenhower's and Roosevelt's quotes and the context. And surely it would be possible to talk about the corresponding section of Kevin Phillips' book neutrally, perhaps with some critical reactions? --<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatewaycat_906d.html" title="User:Gatewaycat">gwc</a> 04:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>A problem with your partial delete idea is that Reed's position as a Christian leader among conservative voters was understandably why he was picked to lobby against the Alabama lottery. He knew the money was coming from Indian casino gambling people who would benefit greatly (more gambling for them) if the lottery was killed, so he tried to deny it all, and was caught. (all documented in the links; that's why they're there) He's a Christian leader, they went to jail, so it's a "special" instance (religious/criminal) of an unholy alliance. Another "special" instance (religious/criminal) is the KY Baptist/Bootlegger thing which incidentally was explicitly called "the Unholy Alliance" in KY since the early 1900s.216.77.231.87 06:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>No vote</b> - 216.77.231.87, I'm a little confused by the non sequiturs, but I think what you're saying is that this article is not about "unholy alliances" but about "The Unholy Alliance" with some other examples (ie, Ratlines) as context. If this is the case, then I must retract my former opinion.
<dl>
<dd><b>non sequiturs?</b> What's your problem with having "the (so-called) Unholy Alliance in KY" used as an example of unholy alliances, in general (especially since it fits the "special" religious/criminal definition)?216.77.231.87 17:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have separated out the actual encyclopedic content related to the concept of an unholy alliance from the several questionable examples of such.
