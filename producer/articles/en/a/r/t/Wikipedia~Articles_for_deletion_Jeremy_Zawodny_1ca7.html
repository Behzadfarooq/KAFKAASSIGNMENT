<li><b>Comment</b> Good point, cacophony, the blog (which wasn't written by itself) is also notable and should have more of a presence in the article. 469th place out of 55 million anythings is impressive and just as relevant as your mentioning that his name only receiving 256 unique ghits because from Technorati we learn that the subject has received 2,685 links from 1,778 blogs, which would suggest to most that he is quite well known and notable within his field. On a side note, you may want to cross out your claim of Vanity now that it has been proved inaccurate and it goes against <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 05:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Regarding WP:BIO, the line you reference concludes with "or other well-known Internet search engine". <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.technorati.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.technorati.com" rel="nofollow">Technorati</a> has a respectable ranking of 181 on Alexa.

<li><b>Comment</b> Technorati is not an internet search engine, it is a blog search engine. As such, it's results would obviously be biased towards blogs, and anything that is a blog would rank higher on Technorati than on an internet search engine, regardless of the notability of the subject. If you'd like to use another search engine as an additional test of notability, feel free to pick one that treats all websites equally, rather than assigning a higher rank to the class of website that you would like to have a higher rank. Might I suggest you use one from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_internet_search_engines.html#General_search_engines" title="List of internet search engines">here</a>? As for the claim of vanity, currently the article seems to be sourced from Zawodny's autobiography, ergo, vanity. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUSER-cacophony_7d2b.html" title="User:USER-cacophony"><b>cacophony</b></a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUSER-cacophony_1e5f.html" title="User talk:USER-cacophony">◄</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_USER-cacophony_1fac.html" title="Special:Contributions/USER-cacophony">►</a> 11:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Technorati is not an internet search engine? To quote from the first sentence about <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technorati.html" title="Technorati">Technorati</a> on Wikipedia "<b>Technorati is an Internet search engine</b> for searching blogs, competing with Google, Yahoo, PubSub and IceRocket." If you would like to use search engines that compare sites like Amazon.com vs people like Mr. Zawodny, please keep using that strawman technique. If you would like to try to see where people like Mr. Zawodny stand in his field, Technorati is a far better judge, in my opinion - and by its Alexa rating, I'm not alone in using it as a helpful tool. Some people today might want to use ghits to use as strawmen against those who are well-known in the blogosphere, some in the past threw alleged witches into water to see if they'd float. It appears that you wish to avoid any tool that would show this subject notable, as opposed to seriously trying to discover how notable he is. That's too bad because it makes you appear biased and not not neutral. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 22:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

To quote from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_search_engines.html#Blog_search_engines" title="List of search engines">The Wikipedia list of BLOG search engines</a>, "Technorati". We are trying to determine how notable Zawodny is, <b>period</b>. Not in his field, not among bloggers, but among everything. Realtive notability is irrelevant. One could use your logic to determine that my dog, Skip, deserves a wikipedia entry, because he is notable among the rest of my pets. But I digress - It appears that you wish to avoid any tool that would show this subject non-notable, even if that tool is Wikipedia policy, as opposed to seriously trying to evaluate his notability.</li>

<dd>In fact, this whole argument is irrelevant. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that, in order to meet the notability requirements, the subject has to be "the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works". To elaborate upon that, "Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing" are explicitly excluded. Jeremy Zawodny does not meet those notability requirements. Therefore, Jeremy Zawodny is non-notable. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUSER-cacophony_7d2b.html" title="User:USER-cacophony"><b>cacophony</b></a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUSER-cacophony_1e5f.html" title="User talk:USER-cacophony">◄</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_USER-cacophony_1fac.html" title="Special:Contributions/USER-cacophony">►</a> 01:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid you continue to misread <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Nowhere on that page does it say that if someone fails at one of the bulletpoints then they are nn. Indeed it says that even if a person doesn't satisfy any of the items, they are still not necessarily eligible for a Speedy Deletion. The item that you quote is simply the first of a long line of things that *could* determine notablilty. Meaning even if Mr. Zawodny had several non-trivial published works where he was the subject, it still doesn't guarantee notability. "People who satisfy at least one of the items below *may* merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." With thousands of links to Mr. Zawodny as well as Top 500 Technorati ranking, and several non-trival newspaper articles where he was a subject, it would appear that he has what WP:BIO is looking for which is "a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest." But if you want to continue the charade that not perfectly meeting one item disqualifies you, then go right ahead. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 06:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, you're right, he fails at all the other bullet points as well. You are also correct in noting that people who meet the requirements *may* merit their wikipedia article, and they *may* not. You are also correct in that he does not merit speedy deletion, which is why we are going about non-speedy deletion in this AfD. So, on to the AfD;
<ul>
<li>The "Technorati ranking" of somebody's blog <b>is not</b> an accepted means of determining that person's notability.</li>
<li>Number of links to a person's blog <b>is not</b> an accepted means of determining that person's notability.</li>
<li>Number of google hits <b>is</b> an accepted means of determining that person's notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy only has 256 google hits.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Several non-trival newspaper articles of whom the person is a subject <b>is</b> an accepted means of determining notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy <b>DOES NOT</b> have several non-trivial newspaper articles of whom he is the subject, so that point is moot.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>There is <b>NOT</b> a good deal of verifiable information available about Jeremy, as it stands there is only <b>ONE</b> verifiable source that provides any biographical information.</li>

<li>It's clear you just want to be argumentative here. The same line that you claim deems ghits an accepted means of determining a person's notability is part of the Alternative tests section that is prefaced thusly "Other tests for inclusion that have been proposed (but haven't necessarily received consensus support) include:" Therefore your claim that "Number of google hits is an accepted means of determining that person's notability" is false. Just like many of your other opinions. Just like your opinion on Technorati, which I have suggested fits in with the Alternative test section as an "other well-known Internet search engine". Therefore if ghits counts, so does the Technorati ranking. Whatever, when you decide to read the entire article that you reference and throw in some common sense, and think about the spirit of WP:BIO as well as what it says (and doesn't say), you will probably have better luck with your opinions seeming less biased. In closing, and I'm not the first to say this, WP:BIO needs to include standards for determining bloggers. And I would suggest that until a consensus is reached regarding what makes a notable blogger, AfD's about bloggers should be tabled. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 23:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello, if I may reiterate, blogging search engines such as Technorati do not search the internet, they search blogs, and thus do not fit into the "other well-known Internet search engine" with Google, Yahoo, and Alexa. I really don't see why bloggers should be treated any differently than anybody else, that they should have their own special notability requirements. Other, more notable people who are bloggers seem to meet the notability requirements just fine. What we have to remember, though, is the fine line between blogger and blog, between website and website operator. Even if his blog were notable, then it would be notable in it's own article. Managing a notable or successful website does not automatically make one notable in their own regard. That would be notability by association. Thus, we cannot judge this <b>person's</b> notability by the notability of his <b>website</b>. That's why we have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> separate. If you continue to insist that his blog is notable then, should it meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, feel free to create an article on his blog. Just remember though, that none of the criteria for determining the notability of a person in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> includes them being the manager of a notable website. Having said that, I will again reiterate that Jeremy does not meet <b>any</b> of the notability requirements suggested in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.
