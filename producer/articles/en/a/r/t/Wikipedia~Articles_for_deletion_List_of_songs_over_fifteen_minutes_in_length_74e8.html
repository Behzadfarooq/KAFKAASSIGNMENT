<li><b>Comment</b> I think some better distinction needs to be made between "songs" and "works of music" (of which songs are just one type).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, 15 minutes is a bit arbitrary, but it's a quarter of an hour, if that has any meaning. It could be 10 or 30 minutes, but it's 15. Why not? Why are there 60 mintues in an hour - that's kind of arbitrary too. The criteria are a bit specific, but you can basically state them as such: no classical pieces, and the song must be a continuous song (i.e. extension by silence between a hidden track doesn't count). I kind of like the list, but I suppose it doesn't fit in too well. I'll defend it, but delete it if you must. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 22:18, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> but <b>revise and cull</b>. This should be restricted to actual "songs" as opposed to experimental sound pieces and classical music that routinely run long. A friend of mine created a <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_music.html" title="Noise music">noise music</a> piece on his computer that ran something like 3 hours.

<li><b>Delete</b> insofar as any song can be "remixed' to be over fifteen mnutes. How do you know? Fifteen minutes highly arbitrary (maybe Warhol influenced?). <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 03:14, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Remixes aren't allowed in the list.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>move</b> to List of unusually lengthy songs, and subdivide that page by certain ranges of length. i.e., the top section might be "5 to 10 minutes long" (though most songs would have to be near 10 minutes at least to be considered "unusually long", depending on the specific song), then "10 to 15 minutes long", then "15 to 20", then "20 to 30", then "30 to 1 hour", then "over 1 hour long"—<i>something</i> like that, anyway. Putting them in order of length just seems to make more sense to me than putting them in alphabetical order by artist, though I can see strong arguments for either, since the current page looks quite nice... But the reason I suggest this is, many songs are known for being "long" that only 10 or 12 or 8 minutes long, like "Hey Jude"; although it might open a can of worms and require us to start finding sources and citing them to show that the songs have been considered "unusually long" by various people, it would also remedy the arbitrary "15-minute cutoff" and protect the page from being spammed by dozens of non-noteworthy songs that just happen to be over 15 minutes long. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Completely arbitrary, purposeless, borderline indiscriminate collection of Hornbyesque information. Inclusion/exclusion criteria is frankly bizarre and entries could run into the tens of thousands if every jazz, techno, arabic, african etc. piece running +15 minutes was added. For an example, see the more than 200 entries for <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaus_Schulze_1da9.html" title="Klaus Schulze">Klaus Schulze</a>. As few of the songs have any notabilty, for length or otherwise, should be called <b>List of mostly non notable songs by many obscure bands over 15 minutes in length</b>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:26, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. But I like my idea more. Make it more vague and require sourcing for notability; there <i>are</i> plenty of unusually long songs out there that have nonetheless (or as a result?) achieved a fair amount of popularity, or sometimes infamy. It's not a completely valueless topic; we just need to assert notability with more vigor, and change the arbitrary "15 minute" limit to a vaguer, but ultimately more complete, listing of especially noteworthy "long" songs in general. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>To clarify: a "list of unusually long songs could include every song that has been remarkably successful despite its great length, or otherwise very noteworthy songs that are unusually long for their genre. I know I'd personally be interested in such a list; what are the upper limits of length in fairly well-known songs (note: both in the English-speaking world ane elsewhere!)? "15 minutes" is too arbitrary a threshhold, and gives a false impression to some contributors that <i>any</i> song over 15 minutes merits inclusion, even if it's not noteworthy. A broadening (and clarification) of this list's topic would allow us to start working on this problem. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 13:43, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, the bar should be <i>lowered</i> to at the very least ten minutes (and preferrably even shorter), and the list should be limited to noteworthy <i>songs</i> by noteworthy bands.&#160;:) The challenge here is not to make the list require increasingly long songs to get in, but to require <i>citations</i> showing that the songs have been considered unusually long by noteworthy or reputable sources. "15+ minutes" on its own is an arbitrary number (as <i>any</i> number would be), but the general concept of "unusually long songs" is a highly significant and relevant topic to analyze in a list such as this. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 08:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>After I posted that I changed my mind. Although I think I'd keep it over 15 minutes rather then reducing.
