(a) Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">not a indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Listing the speed limit on an unidentified part of the road and another speed limit elsewhere, and so on, is an indiscriminate collection of information. (b) The article is a description of a map feature. This does not make for readable or understandable prose. Why create so many substandard articles? A picture of a map would describe it so much better. (c) It is not expandable. This roadcruft only serves fragment a relevent description/discussion of transportation. This kind of material should be placed in an article like, Traffic pattern in Ottawa or Road transportation in Ottawa (or whatever community it is in) or what-have-you. (d) It is not notable. Why glorify a piece of infrastructure? It is just a piece of asphalt on the ground. It contributes to notable things, like a transportation network, but is not notable itself (unless I'm missing something and it is somehow culturally or historically significant). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 00:42, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, major streets are certainly worthy of articles. If we are going to have articles on every single <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dad%21_8413.html" title="American Dad!">American Dad!</a></i> epsiode, and every single <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> character and not too mention individual articles on all the recent cricket matches, then I think one of the busiest streets in the capital of Canada is important.
<ul>
<li>But I don't agree with having those articles either. Just because we have a bunch of stupid article topics doesn't mean we should just keep making them. <span style="color:#5A3696;"><a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplefeltangel_71dc.html" title="User:Purplefeltangel">♥purplefeltangel</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/u/r/User_talk%7EPurplefeltangel_43b8.html" title="User talk:Purplefeltangel">talk</a>)</sup> ♥ <sup>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Purplefeltangel_5fe2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Purplefeltangel">Contributions</a>)</sup></span> 20:13, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>But why is the road so busy? This is not the busiest road in Ottawa because of some unique feature it has. It is the busiest road because of how the road network is designed. I think you touched on a major flaw in these road articles. A discussion on why and how it became such a busy road would create an interesting and useful article. Instead, Wikipedia editors have chosen to create thousands of short articles on very narrow and very generic topics. How is this road (I mean the actual road itself, aside from its name and geographic place) any different from the other million paved roads on this planet? The road is not busy because of anything it did, it just sat there and traffic happened to it. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 03:47, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I've explained on recent Toronto street debates, I've always been of the opinion that city streets should only have articles if they have demonstrable historic or cultural significance far beyond their mere existence. Being a busy street doesn't cut it; being a yellow line in the MapArt city atlas doesn't cut it. By my reasoning, Ottawa streets that legitimately deserve articles would include Bank, Laurier, Sparks, Sussex and Wellington. But if going into exhaustive detail on a road's speed limit and how many <i>lanes</i> it has is the only way you can expand a road's article beyond two sentences, then you're dealing with a road that doesn't belong here. In a nutshell, my bottom line criterion for a road article is <i>is this a street that a person who's never been to this city and isn't a map junkie might still conceivably have heard of?</i> For Bank, Sparks or Sussex, the answer to that question is obviously yes, but for Woodroffe, it's no. I have to go with the <b>delete</b> on this one. And it's not Ottawa-bashing, either, because I want the majority of the Toronto street articles sh*tcanned too. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:22, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Woodroffe is a very historical street for those who live in Nepean.

<li><b>Delete:</b> If it were up to me, I'd likely delete the whole category of Ottawa roads and others like it. Separate articles for various, non-notable roads in every city in the world is silly. If there's nothing more important to say about a road other than "it's congested" or "the speed limit is this, and it changes to that," it fully meets the criteria of being non-notable. If there's a real story behind a road, something that separates it from millions of other similar roads, fine, it's notable, but a recitation of speed limits and number of lanes is just pedantic trivia. What's next, separate pages for important bus routes in Edmonton or, maybe, articles for each of the busiest sidewalks in Milwaukee? — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a> 22:19, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: You guys keep saying it's non notable, but how can you say that without knowledge of the city in question? Woodroffe is the <b>main street</b> in Nepean! Wikipedia seems to have articles on every single highway out there, so why can't there be an article on Woodroffe, which is more of a major road than most rural rinky-dink highways that have pages? -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 08:45, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Some more comments</b>: I'd also like to say that there are a lot of links to the Woodroffe Article from other pages, and that means there is deffinately a need for the page, and shows that it is certainly a notable road. Plus, I remember we put some Ottawa roads on VfD maybe a year ago, and they were kept. Why the change of heart? We got the go ahead to make articles on Ottawa's major streets, and now there is a turn against it?

<li>Life isn't fair. Perhaps that disclaimer on the edit page on how your work can be edited without mercy should include a bit on "your work may be deleted without mercy if no-one cares on which street you buy milk". If there are plenty of links to the street, then maybe see if there's any interesting information from those articles that could go in this article, but the simple fact is that it doesn't matter if a billion pages link to it - if there's nothing interesting to say about the street, it's not notable! -- <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:34, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd suggest creating an article Major Roads in Ottawa, Ontario. <b>Merge</b> with that proposed article, and, at such a time when the information on any individual road is sufficient, create an article devoted to the street. Some roads may never get there, while others will demonstrate their encyclopedic nature through a natural wiki process of expansion. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. As I keep saying, Woodroffe is a <b>major</b> road in the city. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 22:11, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And as several others among us keep saying, being a major road within one city is not a criterion that warrants an encyclopedia article. If you want Woodroffe to be kept, give us good reasons why a person who's <b>never even visited Ottawa in their life</b> might still need to know something about Woodroffe. We're not failing to take Woodroffe's major road status into account; <i>you're</i> failing to take into account that some of us legitimately think being a major city arterial isn't <i>enough</i>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:18, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Exactly. We don't care if people from outside Ottawa have no interest in the article, just as we don't care that non-physicists have no interest in <a href="../../../q/u/b/Qubit_Field_Theory_b73c.html" title="Qubit Field Theory">Qubit Field Theory</a>, that non-biologists have no interest in <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leucosoleniida.html" title="Leucosoleniida">Leucosoleniida</a>, or that non-Star Trek fans have no interest in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corat_Damar_c09c.html" title="Corat Damar">Corat Damar</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:59, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We do, however, care that to all available evidence there's nothing more important to say about this road than how many lanes it has or what its speed limit is. These are not encyclopedic details. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:01, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Articles on pokemon are certainly not encyclopedic nor worthy for inclusion on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/t/t/Image%7EOttawa_flag.png_f8c0.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/4/40/Ottawa_flag.png/20px-Ottawa_flag.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../o/t/t/Image%7EOttawa_flag.png_f8c0.html" /></a> <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a> 23:04, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree entirely. However, "that topic is just as out of place here as this one is" isn't a valid reason for inclusion. Come on, guys. You have yet to even attempt to challenge my belief that being a major city arterial doesn't automatically make a street encyclopedia-worthy; you're resorting entirely to distracting tactics that don't address my statement. All I'm asking for is a direct answer (without appealing to the Pokémon argument) as to why a run-of-the-mill city arterial should be important enough to merit an article that tells me nothing more than its speed limit and number of lanes, given that we're already turfing a bunch of Toronto streets of at least equivalent importance to Woodroffe. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bearcat, what is your opinion on individual highway articles? Woodroffe is busier than most provincial highways. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 23:31, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So are Warden and Broadview, and I voted to can those. I've already gone into some detail earlier in this discussion on what I consider to be some of the key guidelines for determining the encyclopedia relevance of a city street; provincial or state highways are a very different issue, because they're a different thing serving a different purpose, maintained by a higher level of government, marked on larger-scale maps, much smaller in number, much more clearly linked to historical and encyclopedic contexts, etc. Traffic counts are <i>not</i> the determining factor; even a completely unimportant minor street in a major city is probably going to have a traffic count higher than <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_101.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 101">Highway 101</a>. All you've done so far in response to my concerns is to continually repeat that Woodroffe is a major arterial, as if I didn't know that (I lived in Ottawa for six years, for heaven's sake). What I still haven't seen is one good reason <i>why</i> that fact should be important enough to merit an encyclopedia article, one good reason <i>why</i> I should abandon my current criteria for including vs. deleting city streets. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I am trying to get at is, Woodroffe Ave. is very similar to a highway in that it connects Barrhaven, (and points beyond) with the rest of the city. It also serves as part of the Transitway. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 00:54, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what I am trying to get at is that I don't think that's a particularly encyclopedic function which would justify a city street having an article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:49, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please remember the context in which these articles are presented. Roads are not Pokémon characters; each Pokémon exists independently of the other and there are actual differences between them (not that I know anything about Pokémon) while all roads are basically identical and exist as a system (network). Why would people in Ottawa want to see an article about this street (I say that while ducking and assuming the article conforms to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">policies</a> banning business directories, travel guide, indiscriminate collections of info). What can you say about a road that conforms to these policies, is on-topic and will not be repeated a hundred thousand times in other articles. An Ottawan would be better served with an article on the community's road network as a whole. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 01:05, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
