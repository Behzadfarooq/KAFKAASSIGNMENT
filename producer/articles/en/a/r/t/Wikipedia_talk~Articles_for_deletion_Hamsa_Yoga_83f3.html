<p>This article is called HAMSA YOGA not <i>kriyas</i>, <i>Hong Sau technique of concentration</i> (Yogananda's), <i>Soham mantra</i>, <i>Hans Yoga</i>, or any other. Here we are only talking about Hamsa Yoga and nothing else.</p>
<p>This Hamsa Yoga is only mentioned in the writings of its creator, a cult leader with a very questionable credibility. The term Hamsa Yoga isn't mentioned anywhere else.</p>
<p>The passages quoted below speaks about the use of the Soham mantra, and it's reverse which is "ham So." It does not contain the words HAMSA YOGA verbatim. Actually, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamsa_bird.html" title="Hamsa bird">Hamsa</a> is a mythical bird, a gander with power to separate milk from water, it is not a type of Yoga. Both Hamsa and Yoga are common words that can be found in Indian literature, but to have them together as a distinct style, system or school of Yoga is a completely different matter.</p>
<p>Since the only person voting <i>keep</i> agrees that Hamsa Yoga isn't a form of Yoga and actually insists in [bold letters] that it is a form of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pranayama.html" title="Pranayama">pranayama</a> then it is only proper to delete this article and just list Hamsa Yoga under <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pranayama.html" title="Pranayama">pranayama</a>. - <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerminator_III_f34c.html" title="User:Terminator III">Terminator III</a></p>

<p>"Ajapa japa uses slightly different mantrams in different traditions. These include So Ham, So Hum, Hum Sa, Hung Sa, Ham Sa, and Hong Sau."</p>
<p>from Tantra:The Magazine (Issue Five) Article by Alan Verdegraal (publisher of Tantra) <a href="http://home.istar.ca/~tantric/krya.html" class="external free" title="http://home.istar.ca/~tantric/krya.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.istar.ca/~tantric/krya.html</a></p>
<p>This reference was deleted by the Terminator claiming it made no mention of 'Hamsa Yoga'. Here above the quote clearly states it as a form of pranayam practiced. The article also terms them as 'kriyas'.</p>
<p>"Stage 2: Synchronizing Hamso with the breath</p>
<p>Stage 3: The individual sounds of So and Ham</p>
<p>In the first stage you formulated your consciousness of the pattern of Soham. In the second stage you reversed it to Hamso. Now introspection is neither upon Soham nor Hamso, but upon the individual sound of So with the ingoing breath and ham with the outgoing breath. After So there is a pause and again after Ham. Be aware of the two individual sounds and do not unite them.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Merging of Soham and Hamso"</p>
<p>from: The Original Ajapa Japa an article from Yoga Magazine (Talk and practices given at Cama Hall by Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Bombay, February 1963, originally printed in YOGA, No. 1, Vol. 2, 1964)</p>
<p>Again the above reference was speedily deleted with no discussion whatsoever. As mentioned in the article pronunciation of mantras has slight variation due to vernacular regional dialects. Bengalis (ie. Sri Yoganandaji and Swami Satyananda) tend to pronounce the 'a' in 'hamsa' as an 'o' as in the english word 'cow'.</p>
<p>More references:</p>
<p>hamsa literally, "Swan." Shiva rides a White Swan at the crown chakra, symbolizing the divine spirit, or the liberated Self. In India, the White Swan is a symbol very much like the White Dove of Christian thought, which appeared with Jesus at his baptism, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><br />
Hamsa Kumbhaka The Swan Breath, a gently powerful pranayama used with meditation to guide the Shakti to the swan. One breath can be used for each chakra meditation, progressively up sushumna, until all yantras can be held in mind (dhyana) during the same breath.</p>
<p><br />
hamsa mantra (hamsa japa) The continuous chanting of "hamsa." If the word "hamsa" is repeated rapidly, it becomes indistinguishable from "so-ham" being chanted rapidly. Together they mean, "I Am the Swan" (liberated spirit). See "so-ham."</p>
<p>from <a href="http://www.classicyoga.org/glossary/index-glossary.html" class="external free" title="http://www.classicyoga.org/glossary/index-glossary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.classicyoga.org/glossary/index-glossary.html</a> - a Classic Yoga Glossary</p>
<p>The inclusion of I Am that: The Science of Hamsa from the Vijnana Bhairava, Siddha Yoga Publications, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0914602276</a> by Swami Muktananda is because the book does in fact speak of 'So Ham' as a form yoga and meditation 'I am That' is the translation of 'So Ham'. Yoga is the culmination of both meditation and concentration. The fact that the 'Hamsa' is used in the title further bridges a connection between 'So Ham' and 'Ham Sa'.</p>
<p><br />
The text below was deleted without reason and without discussion:</p>
<p>The mystics of India (Bharat) recognize 'Soham' in the process of reversal or going back to the ORIGIN, which is to identify ones own self with the Divine. With the force of Pranayama, taking Apana (downward movement of Prana that aids in 'evacuation') back into Prana (upward movement Prana aiding in the function of respiration) and balancing with Samana, 'SOHAM' goes back to 'HAMSAH'. The literal meaning of 'HAMSA' is 'swan', 'goose' or 'flamingo'. Its color is spotless white, which is verily, purity of thought, mind and deed (Sattwa). This is known as the 'Arohana' ('Ascent') and 'Avarohana' ('Descent') in mysticism, but within the limit of Pranayama. In Sufism it is known as 'Hafs-e â€“ Nafas', but based on the Ishq-e-illahi. Patanjali speaks of it as Kundalini - a serpentine coil, which needs to be awakened by those, who are intent upon realizing the relationship between 'SAH' and 'AHAM'.</p>
<p>referenced from an article: SOHAM-I am That&#160;: by Dr. Chaman Lal Raina <a href="http://www.kashmirgroup.com/kpi/kpi_one.jsp?sino=530" class="external free" title="http://www.kashmirgroup.com/kpi/kpi_one.jsp?sino=530" rel="nofollow">http://www.kashmirgroup.com/kpi/kpi_one.jsp?sino=530</a></p>
<p>This SAME article is basically the entire basis for the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../s/o/h/Soham.html" title="Soham">Soham</a> (Sanskrit) further showing the connection between 'Soham' and 'Hamsa'. Notice the name of the article has the translation of the mantras as Swami Muktananda's book.</p>
<p>'Hamsa' is not only a 'generic term' and what is the 'spiritual significance'? Please clarify...you'll find the spiritual significance related to pranayama and 'So Ham' as well as the 'Swan' as a symbol of the Pure Soul. Do your research!</p>

<li>Note: Terminator is aggressively deleting without any discussion. Putting 'citation needed' tags when ample references are given according to Wikipedia standards. Terminator is clearly biased towards Hamsa Yoga Sangh and Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath and this fact should not be ignored in edits as is being done by most right now. Personal attacks have also been made as well as threatening behaviour. With such behavior this 'Terminator' should be blocked, but nothing is being done - nor will be most probably.</li>

<p>Please remember that Wikipedia is an EDUCATIONAL resource and not an avenue to vent your frustrations on an organisaton or individuals that articles pertain to. 'Hamsa Yoga' is more accepted in Indian culture more than you fully realise!!!213.106.1.25 00:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)Shaninath</p>
