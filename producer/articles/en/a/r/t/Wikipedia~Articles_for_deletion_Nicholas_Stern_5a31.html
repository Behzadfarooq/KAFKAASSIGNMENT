<p>A question of notability - no allmusic.com or artistdirect.com entry. No albums. Possible vanity/self-promotion.

<p>I don't know how to vote on this thing, but Nicholas Stern did not write this. I'm not exactly sure how to prove that, but there are plenty of outsider artists that have no albums that would'nt be found on either of those sites you mentioned. I was adding this to the growing list of outsider artists, not trying to promote someone, whom I'm assuming doesnt even wan't to do music anymore. If you were to delete this article on those grounds, it would only be fair that you delete Shooby Taylor as well. Only it can basically be proven that his was not a vanity page as he is dead. Also I think you would have better luck in the searches if you looked up: Nicholas Stern+Slapshot Rock as this was his most recognized song. (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>I only get 7 hits on the above search. Considering that one of them calls him "not-so-famous", it's still a question of notability. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 22:06, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again however fame is relative. He is famous in the outsider world as is <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooby_Taylor_2e1b.html" title="Shooby Taylor">Shooby Taylor</a> but he obviously isnt on MTV. I did'nt know that fame was the prerequisite for being on Wikipedia. After all if everything on here was famous, there would be no point in posting something. (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>But Shooby Taylor gets thousands of hits when you search on his name. Yes, fame is relative. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 22:48, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Shooby was included in the first wave of Outsider interest sparked by Irwin Chusid's book "The key of Z". I guess if we're talking amount of hits on websites to justify being on Wikipedia, whoever is typing has got me beat, however I don't see how this justifies not keeping an article on especially from the prior reasoning of "not having an album" which has now been replaced by "Does not have a lot of hits when searched for". I may have misunderstood but were you being sarcastic when you reitterated that fame is relative? (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't being sarcastic, I was just pointing out a comparison between the two. All I'm sayingn is that Shooby Taylor seems more notable. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has some guidelines on notability for musicians. To me, it seems like Shooby passes. Nicholas Stern doesn't. (This is all just my opinion, of course) By the way, sign your comments with four tildes (this char: ~). --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 23:04, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I mean it would be really hard for Shooby Taylor to legitimately live up to those standards with the exceptions of websites. Nicholas Stern was at one point featured prominently amongst a lot of the outsider pages such as "worst of the worst" and "Incorrect Music" and is still featured in the Outsider Music Group. I mean if this is going to be a standard, you have to put up notice that says "You must have X amount of hits in order to qualify to be on Wikipedia before you can post." Also would it make a difference in fame if I mentioned the fact that Steve Pascuito did some sidework on some 90's television shows as a stand-in and extra? Which is the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del</b>, sort of. This is overdue to be called, and no one has mentioned that the article was created by removing long-standing content on the real Nicholas Stern, and turning his lks into false lks. It doesn't seem worth going thru the motions of deleting just to restore the old one, so i am calling this VfD &amp; construing the result as "remove all mention of the non-notable one, with prejudice, and revert to the version that made no mention of him." ("With prejudice" means in this case that any article restoring essentially the same content under a different title would be speedy-deletable.)</li>
