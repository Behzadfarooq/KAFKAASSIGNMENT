The article has indeed been improved so far, but some of the footnotes are still highly questionable e.g. <a href="http://bigellsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/33%20and%20a%201%2F3" class="external text" title="http://bigellsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/33%20and%20a%201%2F3" rel="nofollow">this blog</a> (blogs are not peer reviewed and so are rarely reliable sources) or <a href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/rights/display.cgi?no=4283" class="external text" title="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/rights/display.cgi?no=4283" rel="nofollow">this book review</a> which only demonstrates that the reviewer (on a site I'm not familiar with) uses the term Southern Mafia, not even that the book itself uses that term.

<dd><b>Note</b> further additions of links to related topics in Wikipedia. W.r.t. "reliable sources" I don't want to rely on blogs, but if one wants to show a term used journalistically then blogs and reviews should be allowed (not, of course, to the exclusion of other sources). Also, I note from your Wikilink "the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication." To some extent, any publisher must consider all these issues before allowing a review, or letter to the editor, onto his pages. BTW (not that I'm claimimg to know) how do you know the book doesn't use the term?</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the sources weren't a little on the wonky side this wouldn't be much more than a dicdef as it stands. This article suffers the same problem as a related article recently deleted in that the 'sources' are largely just instances of the phrase being used and do little if anything to establish the meaning of the term or convey any information about it. It does little more than establish the existence of the term - the point of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is not to simply find quotes but to tell us something, which this doesn't. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 05:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hard_fantasy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hard_fantasy" rel="nofollow">yes</a>, I do. When they are constructive edits that actually resolve the problems that have been brought up. Your edit really hasn't satisfied that, and I will explain to you why. If you haven't read <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> in detail please do, but for starters, pay attention to the line that states <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true.</i> The problem with the sources in this article (as well as the now-deleted Unholy Alliance) is that they are almost exclusively quotations of someone using the term <i>Southern Mafia</i> without actually telling us what the southern mafia is. Your article then goes on to use these various examples of the word use to support a conclusion - but that is a violation of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. Wikipedia cannot rely on articles of this nature that basically say "This person has been called a member of the Southern Mafia, and so has this person, therefore the Southern Mafia can be defined as ..." What you really need is a source that explicitly tells us "The Southern Mafia can be defined as ..." You have one and only one source that does that - but the problem with that is that it is from a blog and not a reliable source. Again, read up on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for a more clear picture of what a reliable source is, and why a blog is not. Finally, if you do find reliable sources to cite on the subject, make sure that you can expand the article beyond a mere definition, else it will not pass <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a>.</dd>

<dd>Honestly, no one here has any kind of vendetta against you or your articles, we merely have a problem with articles that do not pass inclusion criteria. I am certain you are very well intentioned in wanting to contribute to the project with these articles of local significance that you feel are underrepresented here, and we all appreciate your desire to contribute. Unfortunately Wikipedia is not a vehicle for the advancement of new thoughts and ideas - there are plenty of other outlets for those kinds of things. Once an idea has become established, studied and verified, that is when it belongs here. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Can't speak for anyone else, but I know I've changed my opinion on several articles up for AfD if they've been improved. The problem with this article (in my opinion) is that while it's sourcing has indeed been improved (with the addition of the Texas Observer link added to the decent Scarfone link), there are still serious issues. One is that pretty much all of the other footnotes should be removed as they do not add any verifiable benefit to the article that I can see (all they seem to do is show the authors of this article didn't make the term up, which is covered by the two more acceptable sources, and that the term is used sometimes in the music industry, which oddly isn't mentioned in the article itself).</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately while the sourcing has somewhat improved, the removal of basically all of the text leaves this with other problems that I see. One is <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">it now appears to be just a dictionary definition</a> as mentioned already, but the sparsity also leaves two other issues: 1) that there is no assertion or evidence that the term is particularly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, 2) that from what I've seen so far, the phrase seems to clearly be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neoligism</a>.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Dispite adding quotations to show usage of the phrase (most taken from various book and movie reviews), the article remains little more than a Dictionary Definition per <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a>. Also, without a reliable source to tie the disperate usages together it remains an uncited OR synthesis per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.

<dd>I would be happy to change my vote ... if the concerns that have been raised by myself and others were actually addressed in the article. So far they have not. A synthesis occurs when you place two seperate ideas together so that they form a conclusion, whether stated outright or implied. In one sentence you talk about "traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise" and "organized crime". In the next you mention "conservative Congressmen from the South working together for a shared purpose". The clear implication to the reader is that that criminal activity and conservative congressmen have a connection. Whether this is "true" or not does not matter, <i>we</i> (as editors) can not make these connections ourselves... we need to cite reliable secondary sources that make such connections for us. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because an article has a ton of sources doesn't mean it can't be orignal research as well. Let me explain by example:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Suppose someone thinks that a new <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> advertising campaign has hidden racist messgages in it.</dd>
<dd>They go online and find a few books/magazines that explain what subliminal messages are and what racism is defined as.</dd>
<dd>Then they go and find a summary of the ad campaign.</dd>
<dd>They write an article explaining their ideas and citing their sources.</dd>

<dd>Yes, that seems to be the problem, but where? Criminals and politcians that are not linked, remain so forever, until they are linked in some clear way. Mentioning two thoughts on the same page does not link them, other than, in this case, as separate and disparate uses of the same term.

<dd>And you shouldn't add text to my comments. What I was trying to explain is that an article can be OR even if you give sources. The sources need to explicitly say what you say in the article. Many of the sources on the article only mention the Southern Mafia, in popular culture. I see nothing that <b>connects</b> "a traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise" to "The Southern Mafia in the Senate."

<dd>"Literary uses" = the words "Southern" and "mafia" are used in conjunction in books and magazines. What is needed is a reason that these two words belong next to each other for some specific reason. As it is, you just have a collection of referenced occasions that the words have been put next to each other. You need to show that the words next to each other have meaning beyond what the two words mean alone. There isn't any one specific group here that is called the Southern mafia (except groups that also go by other names?). In fact, each reference in the article weakens the case that an article is needed, as most of them are talking about a different thing. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Objection</b> - I really have to object to redirecting the article the way you did ... Perhaps I have misinterpreted your motivations, but redirecting an article that is in the middle of an AfD debate comes across as a back handed attempt to save the material in violation of the process ... which in turn comes across as a POV ploy. All this redirect does is shift the problem to another article. The material is still a dicdef and is still a violation of WP:SYNT. Plus the article into which it was moved has it's own issues with lack of citation (ie it had none prior to your redirect). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Shunting the material over on to another article, regardless of how well that other article may or may not be established, is not the way to fix the problem.

<dd>MBHiii, This really isn't the forum to explain how WP:SYNT works... I will respond on your talk page and try to explain further. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>According to WP:SYN,</b> "that precise analysis (A+B=C expressed by the author) must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published in Wikipedia."</p>
<p>In the Smith and Jones case, the author analyzed what Jones did (A) in light of some standard the author chose (B) to assert Smith may have been wrong about Jones (C) without citing a souce who agrees with the analysis. He takes A from one source, B from another, and asserts C on his own.</p>
<p>But here, there is no "Conclusion C." What are you saying are the A+B=C? If you assert I <b>imply</b> C, first of all that's not in WP:SYN, and if you do so on the basis of two different meanings of a term sitting on the same page, you'd better not read any dictionaries, your head might explode from possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, there is nothing I <b>"say in the article ... that connects a traditional and ongoing criminal enterprise to The Southern Mafia in the Senate."</b> - Mr.Z-man(above) It's you, making it up.</p>
<p>Note, wording changes to be less of a DICDEF and focus more on the two, separated subjects - no HOAX. --<a href="../../../m/b/h/User%7EMbhiii_4194.html" title="User:Mbhiii">MBHiii</a> 03:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Update</b> - With recent changes to the article, especially re-paragraphing, SYN is indeed much less of an issue. Unfortunately Dicdef still is an issue. The article basically says that a whole bunch of people have used this term, and then gives quotes of them doing so. It is an article about the <i>use</i> of the term "Southern Mafia" instead of an article about the <i>concept</i> of a "Southern Mafia". That is a DICDEF. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

You can't do that. Second, it doesn't help address the DICDEF issues anyway. Third, the subject of that particular source is the "Dixie Mafia", not the "Southern Mafia". Your assertion in the article that "Scarfone uses the terms 'Dixie Mafia' and 'Southern Mafia' in the same work, therefore we can establish Dixie Mafia = Southern Mafia, and therefore any reference to Dixie Mafia can be treated as a reference to Southern Mafia" is the very <i>core definition</i> of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>.</dd>

<dd>I have to commend the effort you are putting in to trying to save this article. It shows a lot of editorial perseverance and dedication that are <i>very</i> good traits and I for one appreciate your enthusiasm. Wikipedia can always use such tenacious editing! Unfortunately I think the problem with this article is that the "Southern Mafia" simply does not exist beyond a mere term of use and just can't be expanded beyond a dicdef - nothing out there seems to support anything more than that, and no amount of sourcing in examples will cure that fact. The zeal you are showing in trying to find sources leads me to believe that if they were there, you would have found them by now. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Somewhere</b> between SYN and COPYVIO must be room to write. Note, new rewriting so as not to cut-and-paste. Another more direct example of Dixie Mafia = Southern Mafia has been cited.

<dd>MBHiii, there is tons of room to write between SYN and COPYVIO ... Don't simply quote what the sources have said, write <i>about</i> what those sources have said. Also, I don't think anyone is saying that the Southern Mafia doesn't exist... We are simply saying that the way you are writing about it constitutes either OR or DICDEF. You keep going from one extreme to the other... without substantive statements discussing what the Southern Mafia is, where it came from, how it developed, etc. the article is nothing more than a dicdef stating that the term exists. When you try to add substance... you don't cite any reliable source to back up your substantive statements, which swings the article into violating NOR and SYN. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
