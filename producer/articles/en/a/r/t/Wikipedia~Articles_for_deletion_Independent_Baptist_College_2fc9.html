<li><b>Keep</b>: The nominated article does not read like an ad. It describes post-secondary education related to a "denomination", similar (though not identical) to a Jesuit education.

<dl>
<dd>No, it does not describe "post-secondary education related to a denomination." In fact, if you read it carefully "independent Baptist" simply means "independent" of main Bapitist ministry. Therefore, this article encompasses any broad Christian/fundamentalist/Baptist, as the article notes with "Bob Jones University"-- which is not Baptist. The Jesuit education article is a good one that describes a particular denomination. This article does not describe a denomination. My assertation is that the article is so broad it is worthlessly undescriptive since "independent" Baptist is NOT a denomination. The Jesuit article is perfect criteria to follow and this article falls far short of that. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

BJU is fundamentalist Christian, which can encompass Baptists, but the school doesn't strictly profess to be Baptist, let alone "independent Baptist."

<li>A Bible college is different than the Independent Baptist Colleges. A Bible college generally would have a much narrower curriculum, with more specific training for ministerial careers. The colleges described in this article, while preparing most for ministerial careers, may offer a broader education, providing a independent Baptist setting and also providing other areas of study - for example Tennessee Temple University offers a majors in biology and in mathematics. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 22:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Comment not meant to be controversial. I did a review of some of Bible colleges offerings of majors and then offerings of of independent Baptist colleges (IBC). Some of the IBCs are "Bible" colleges, while some have more general offerings. Point was that there is a difference. Some IBC are Bible colleges, while some are not. The "Bible colleges" terminology that I am referencing is that being used in the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_college.html" title="Bible college">Bible college</a>. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 00:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find no evidence on Google that such a thing as an "Independent Baptist College" even exists. You seem to have information I'm not aware of, and I'm genuinely curious. How do you determine what is an IBC and what isn't? Is it your personal judgement or what? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:31, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>See, my problem is, I've clicked on a bunch of those links, and most of the schools do not identify themselves as "independent" anything. West Coast and Crown do call themselves "Independent Baptist College", but how do we know what that means to them? With the <a href="../../../a/j/c/AJCU_7114.html" title="AJCU">AJCU</a> there's a verifiable thread connecting the schools; here, I see no such tool. Without some kind of secondary literature specifically addressing Independent Baptist Colleges, I don't see how we can write an article here. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:47, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
