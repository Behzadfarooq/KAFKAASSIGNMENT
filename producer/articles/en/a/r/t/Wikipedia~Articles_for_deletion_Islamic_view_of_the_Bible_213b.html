<li><b>Comment</b>: while I have no problem with the article being kept, I do object to the reaons given by many people (starting with Striver). The resons in the nomination are not "all editorial issues": <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is a core policy, and an article which is truly original research should definitely be deleted.

<dd>No, i am arguing that articles that go in depth on a subject from the views of a large religion has a solid precedences, thus, there is no problem per see with this sort of article as somebody implied. Now, if this article contains OR or something else, then edit it out or fix it or source it or whatever, we don't delete an entire encyclopedic topic due to some editorial issues. I just gave <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/islaminthebible/" class="external text" title="http://www.al-islam.org/islaminthebible/" rel="nofollow">the name of a book</a> that is more or less entirely about this subject, so spend the time building the encyclopedia, read the book and add references, or if you can't be bothered, just add the book title as reference. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are using 1 source to write an article on all Islams view of the bible? That doesnt strike you as a PoV problem when the entire article is written from the view of that one author? You havent addressed the original point again, how can an article attempt to list the views of "Islam on the bible", when there are so many different sects, groups, extreme views, individual beliefs etc. The religion itself cannot have a view on a different religious text, unless it says it in the Quran, and the entire Quran is accepted by all Islam to the same degree, then its inherently PoV. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 23:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I recall an article along the lines of Atheists' view of Jesus - which makes as much sense as Left-handed bus drivers' view of cowboy hats. Atheists as a group don't <i>have</i> a organized views of each religious figure. Individual atheists might have personal opinions but portraying that as an organized view is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> at best. Does Islam have an organized view of the Bible? The article currently has two sources; any evidence that those are Islam's view as opposed to the views of the authors of the articles? Surely if a group of 1.4 billion people has an organized view it is widely documented in a large number of reliable sources that largely agree with each other.

<li>As far as I know, it is possible to talk of a general orthodox "Islamic view of the Bible", so I don't think NuclearZero's worries are particularly well-founded. Muslim scholars have been engaging with their Christian and Jewish counterparts in controversies about the Bible and the Koran since the Middle Ages. If the views of certain Islamic sects diverge from mainstream Muslim theological opinion on this issue, it should be possible to cover them too. But I agree with Zunaid that this article should be deleted and recreated from scratch when someone turns up who is willing to put the effort in to write a decent page (ideally using reputable scholarly sources - e.g. the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>?).

<li><b>Delete</b>, all its information is clearly explained in the <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahrif.html" title="Tahrif">tahrif</a> article. This is an interesting subject, and I would keep it if it could be written by an expert, making it an intelligent and balanced article.
