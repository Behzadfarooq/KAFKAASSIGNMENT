<li>To date that has been pretty straight forward. Celebrities that are in have appeared as sims, musicians have re-recorded songs of theirs for the game. The explanation has already been made on all the appropriate articles anyway, so in this case its really a duplication of material except in the one case I noted above. The console piece is small and I'm not sure if Trivium re-recording a song for the game is notable in that context.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've made some improvements to the first section of the article based on the comments above but it still needs work, some points could probably be removed, and if anyone has a better idea for the title, it would be much appreciated.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Think of sources this way: if a reputable publication hasn't explored a theme of the film, at least briefly, it probably isn't notable enough to be mentioned in a Wikipeida article. If you want an example of a good "Themes" section, check out <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a>. It's impeccably sourced and well written, and explores the themes rather than lists them. I suspect a well-sourced article would be significantly shorter than this one, and could probably be merged back into the main article.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 17:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Could anyone who's voted to keep per Dannyboy3 point out what they find so compelling about his argument.

He hasn't attempted to counter any of the concerns about sourcing, verifiability, or notability.

<li><b>Weak <s>Keep</s> Delete —</b> Cites only a single BBC article that denotes notability (as far as I can see). Apart from that they have no charted hits or major awards. However, they have two album articles on Wikipedia not listed as AFD, and as such those two articles would also require deletion (I don't consider albums to be more notable than their respective bands).

(As above. I'm lazy.) The UK ska-punk scene is hardly thriving in 2007 (what with popular bands such as Lightyear, No Comply, King Prawn and Adequate Seven all splitting up in recent years), and Grown At Home are one of the few surviving bands of the genre still gaining popularity. It seems silly to make me come back and rewrite this in a few months after more headlining tours and CD releases. I'm sure that many fans of the genre would be interested in this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Do other editors read the article? For those that don't here are some excerpts from the article, they have realeased one EP 'which was then released on Cash For Pigs Records - a label created primarily to release this EP', e.g. self released. It is going so well 'The EP has sold more than 1000 copies.' They have also released one album, again on the Cash For Pigs Records label. As for the references, very few qualify as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. As for the tour, the requirement is that 'Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in reliable sources'. The tour has not yet happened, has no independent sources reporting it and, IMO, the requirement is that they are the main act. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 08:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, assumption will get you everywhere. So... because Cash For Pigs Records was created to release the EP, it's 'self-released'? Who said anything about any members of Grown At Home having ANY affiliation with the running of Cash For Pigs Records? Somebody considered their EP worthy enough of release to <i>create a record label</i> simply to release it. Lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>?

<p>Despite being a "cooperative house" this reads like it was written as a frat house prank. I acknowledge this might be salvageable as a basic article by removing everything beyond the first three paragraphs. Yet I'm putting it up for deletion because I waver on the importance of the location itself. But no references at all in the article.

<dd>That comment says that a Mathomat can be used to draw some shapes, and says this in exactly two sentences. But it does not discuss the mathomat as a subject. What we need is an article somewhere that discusses the mathomat as a subject (for example, with the title "Educational benefits of Mathomats in elementary classrooms"). <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 15:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Absolutely notable, and institutional in Australian classrooms - I don't know any Australian kid who wouldn't have used one at some point. It'd be called a stencil anywhere else, I guess (it's *not* a ruler, it's used for tracing shapes like triangles, curves and circles, and contains a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protractor.html" title="Protractor">protractor</a> in its centre, but does not make a great fashion accessory in the headwear stakes unlike the opinions of some 14-year-old students). It is a requirement to purchase one if studying maths in any Australian state - and often they have to be approved by a government agency such as the Board of Studies (NSW), Curriculum Council (WA) etc. Australian-based educational theory textbooks would be the place to reference this, but I don't have any at my disposal. Might contact Curriculum Council during the week to see if they know a text which would clearly and unambiguously refer to it. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Orderinchaos78. As an Australian student I can tell you that what Orderinchaos78 was saying is true.

Even if the artwork were somehow found to be notable, and even if there were a significant secondary source of about the sculpture, the article would have to be scrapped completely because of the copy vio, not to mention the style and content issues. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 06:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this is a hoax, but for once, it wasn't played on Wikipedia but rather the the source that was used in good faith by the article creator. Other than the obituary which is referenced and provides the material used for the article, I can't verify the claims, which if true should be easy to verify. I note that while IMDB has an entry for a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1083849/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1083849/" rel="nofollow">Johnny Mann (I)</a> and a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1905328/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1905328/" rel="nofollow">Johnny Mann (III)</a> there is no Johnny Mann (II) which leads me to suspect that they were hit by the hoax but later discovered it, deleting that entry. The only innocent explanation I can think of is that he was credited under a different screen name, but if that's the case, we really need that name for this article to be of any use. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caer’s whines</small></a> 06:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This isn't a hoax, but he wasn't notable. He really did exist (I'm looking at an obit from a Palm Springs, CA newspaper with his photograph and with a direct quote from the wife of the bandleader Johnny Mann, who says she wishes her husband dressed as well as this guy always did). The problem is that the man's notability was exaggerated quite innocently after his death. He may have worked as a walk-on or extra in soap operas and movies; generally there's a set number of lines an actor has to say in order to be credited, and he probably didn't make the credits cut in any of the things he did. I think what happened is that the writer of the Palm Springs obituary took Mann's roles to be more involved than Mann or his widow ever claimed they were, then when the AP picked up the obituary and condensed it they made him seem even more important. For instance, the AP report talks about a "recurring role" in <i>Highway to Heaven</i>. A recurring role is generally meant these days to mean a major role in two or more episodes. The original obituary didn't use that term. So yes, <b>delete</b>, but not as hoax. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 13:58, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Include</b> I was sitting on the fence about this article, but now I'm inclined to keep it since it lists sources now, and is well-written (no surgery is necessary to bring it up to standards). There are sixteen articles about <i>Jeopardy!</i> contestants on Wikipedia, by the way, which is a very tiny percentage of the number of people who have appeared on a popular show that has been running for decades. It's not like Wikipedia is dealing with an avalanche of Jeopardy-cruft, unlike say, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>-related articles.

<li><b>Include</b> Although Dupee currently has no records on the show, that is mostly because of the multiple changes in the show's format since he competed. He is a highly notable Jeopardy champion because he wrote the book which most contestants use to prepare to go on the show. Thus, all competitors know of Michael Dupee, and he is certainly notable enough to be one of the 16 Jeopardy contestants who are biographied in Wikipedia.75.200.104.42 21:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> In contrast to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_%28game_show_contestant%29_7e1d.html" title="Tom Walsh (game show contestant)">Tom Walsh</a>, Dupee never held any winnings records on the show, which should be requisite for notability barring notability outside of the show (as are the cases for Ohio State Treasurer <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cordray_c6ee.html" title="Richard Cordray">Richard Cordray</a> or children's author <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Sue_Park_ca4b.html" title="Linda Sue Park">Linda Sue Park</a>). If Dupee's forthcoming radio show is deemed to establish his notability outside of his involvement in the show, this should be considered. But his authorship of <i>How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win!</i> doesn't qualify him. It wasn't a huge seller, it's out of print, and it's mostly known only within the <i>Jeopardy!</i> community. Nor does his stewardship of several (wonderful) web sites/games make him notable. ToC champ and Google employee Ryan Holznagel also has a great web site (Who2.com), but none of these is enough to establish him as notable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 11:28, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b> Dupee's authorship of <i>How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win!</i> does qualify him as notable. That book is <i><b>the</b></i> book that most Jeopardy! competitors have used to prepare for the show for the last several years. If everybody in a specific field is using a particular text to learn how to do something, then it is notable. His book is the "Joy of Cooking" of Jeopardy!-preparation. Every copy ever printed sold and it was going into reprints when the publisher went bankrupt for completely unrelated reasons. The used copies on Amazon have historically been difficult to obtain and highly priced. Lately, the used copies are more attainable, but that probably is because there is now so much Jeopardy! info on the internet (thanks to certain persons like yourself, Robert K S, the extraordinary writer of the online J! Archive), which is in stark contrast to when Dupee's book was published. Plus, Dupee's 2nd book was a best-seller, being sold at all stores, including Wal-Mart, book stores, the Scholastic Book Fairs, and through Publishers Clearing House. It even had a sequel. Plus, TOC champ Ryan Holznagel is highly notable. He, in fact, is the next person that I was thinking of writing a Wikipedia page on. His web site Who2.com is really a cool site. It is a comprehensive trivia encyclopedia of biographical information.Zana4 04:32, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Band has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. which is the core notability requirement. I don't see any citation that the band had a hit on a national music chart. Article had previously been proposed for deletion in Aug 2006. I'm not sure if the undocumented claim that is in regular rotation on a retro internet-only radio station meets the requirement for notability but would be interested in what others have to say. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarfieldian_373f.html" title="User:Warfieldian">Warfieldian</a> 17:46, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Just because a page is part of a wikiproject doesn't mean it shouldn't be deleted. In fact the article seems to have been all but forgotten by the community as for the better part of 2 years all it had said was: "Dillon Dam Brewery is a brewery and restaurant located in Dillon, Colorado. The brewery was founded in 1997 and is located near Keystone Resort. Customers of the brewery tend to be a mix of locals and tourists and the brewery is a common stop after a day on the ski slopes." It also included a link to their website and a list of their beers. With the new addition of the beer awards notability is trying to be established, but I question if this can ever become more than a stub, which coincidently the above proposal flatly says should not be done. Maybe a better place to cover this establishment, and other like it, would be in a Micro-breweries of Colorado page?? <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsRedShirt_0fad.html" title="User:EnsRedShirt">EnsRedShirt</a> 15:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There is indeed an album out by these guys (albeit on a small record label) and there have been two independent sources of published reviews (from Pitchfork Media and the Independent Weekly). So, while we might be able to call their record label non-notable, we cannot say that there haven't been multiple sources of external coverage, and per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, that seems to be enough to keep the article to me. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSteve04_a262.html" title="User:TheSteve04">TheSteve04</a> 05:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point here is, indeed, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, but more than a quick Google search will turn up numerous results for external coverage, with multiple independent reviews of an album that has indeed been released from notable sources. We seem to be assuming that there is no album and/or external coverage, and there is indeed such material, so we can't quite make these claims. Instead, the major argument is not about whether the article is speculative in nature (the crystal ball argument) but whether the group is notable enough to be featured in Wikipedia. Considering that this group has been featured in and given positive reviews by well-known outlets such as Pitchfork Media, I've got to think that the group is notable enough to at least remain in Wikipedia, and with the advent of further material, there should be no debate on the issue. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSteve04_a262.html" title="User:TheSteve04">TheSteve04</a> 07:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:In the light of the above it sounds like she might well have done something interesting and be known for it, in which case lets see an article citing secondary sources that establishes that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Certainly professor is fairly high rank in a UK University, but I think it falls below what is required for notability in the wikipedia sense. A typical professor would be an editor of a journal and loads of publications, grants and PhD students. But that in itself is not notable, in a sense they are just doing their job. On the other hand any science professor with an FRS or engineering professor who is an FREng almost certainly would be notable. My interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)</a>, <i>1. The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources. 2. The person is regarded as an important figure by independent academics in the same field.</i> has to be backed up by evidence that is verifiable, I don't think the result of a promotion board can be considered as that. I must declare an interest, I am a professor at a UK university. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 10:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>'in a sense they are just doing their job'.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is merely an over-modest article - as was an AfD a little earlier. Did the nom think to check the links?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think checking the links is the point. Links should point to secondary sources so that the case for notability <b>established in the article</b> can be verified. I admit I am being a little provocative, but I feel strongly such articles should make a case for notability even if they are stubs.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the main editor of the page. Now, I don't understand why there is a sudden urge to delete this article. I have discussed with others before when it was considered for deletion, and it was decided that the article was worth keeping because the band is the side project of the drummer of a very popular band. I will gladly expand upon it if you will allow me to. The artist is currently doing more songs for the project. I hope we can work something out here to keep the article around.

Looking at the article for <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Douglas_%28drummer%29_0f88.html" title="Dave Douglas (drummer)">Dave Douglas (drummer)</a>, it's pretty stubby and kind of fluffy, and it would seem merge the two would do a better service to the subject.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 09:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just think someone could explain to me exactly what they want me to do to keep it around, because in cases like these, I'm always told all these things that don't lead to a direct answer. No offense to any of you guys, but I just think that the deletion policies on Wikipedia need a little more explaining. I don't see why there's always a rush to delete pages that don't seem notable enough. But hey, if you think combining the two articles is a good idea, I'm all for it.<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERoryS89_7c3e.html" title="User:RoryS89">RoryS89</a> 22:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)RoryS89</li>

<li>Rory, there are central core policies that you need to read: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> (in this case <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>) and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. They basically say that you need to have 2 reliable resources independent of the subject that assert that the subject is notable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> or at least <b>merge</b> I added 2 reliable sources that talk about the album, and the side projects that are contained on it, along with their history.

<ul>
<li>OK I see the point you all have. Deletion seems like a reasonable action. If this is done however, consensus will have to be made as to what YWAM base external links are appropriate on the main <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_With_A_Mission_e644.html" title="Youth With A Mission">YWAM</a> article. People tend to add YWAM base links to the external links section until it looks too large and an editor removes them. That's one of the big reasons I made this list. If we simply delete the list we'll have the same problem again of people contiually adding base links and editors having no consensus on what's appropriate and what should be left to the YWAM directory. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidkazuhiro_110a.html" title="User:Davidkazuhiro">Davidkazuhiro</a> 18:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>David, what I would suggest is locating a link on the YWAM home page that has a list of all the bases - and just link to that from the main YWAM article.

<li>With some reluctance, <b>Delete</b>. WP is not the place for a list of links to external websites for a particular organisation, even one as notable as Youth With a Mission. The main YWAM website contains an adequate search facility for identifying websites for their bases; where there is a base without a website, there is little point in merely providing a placename in a list. The list is anyway libale to become obsolete. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 23:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Salt</b> I'd genuinely like to say keep for this article, if only because the authors have taken a degree of care in creating it that's uncommon for up-and-coming groups.

<li><b>Keep</b> so your saying that their manager or someone from their camp is using Wikipedia to promote the group. That's a misleading and slanderous account to make carrying some serious repercussions. We (as in the public) learn that with Scott Harris when he made a mockery of the group in an article he wrote. The magazine coverage did happen in the March 2007 issue of On Tap Magazine. The article “Profound Intentions” was retracted. Now if everyone here puts just as much time into visiting the group’s website and reading what they find on Google and other search engines as much as you gather to make slanderous yet unproven allegations regarding their notability and who started the article you’ll see your wasting your time. If you say the group isn’t notable then ‘what the hell’ is all the discussion about. Profound Intent is notable enough for the simple fact that you can Google the group, visit a legitimate official website and purchase their music from major retailers.68.239.77.10 23:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is too complex. It should only contain the critical facts. Not doing so has caused many of us to dispute the group’s notability. I think just focusing on the Retraction of a magazine article about the group which has made headlines across the country and the mentioning of their record Play the Field at this point should be the only things in which the article is based upon. In my opinion their notable for "disputing a reporter in the media" regarding a article viewed by a great amount of people and has now been retracted and slated to be re-written according to Robert Fulton the magazines editor. The current criteria for determining such notability for Bands is currently “unreasonable” which has led to this discussion. The group has a lot in common with every standard of the current criteria. However it doesn’t necessarily meet each standard fully simply because their not on a “Major” label and have a “Chart Hit” but they are on a indie label with a major distribution deal with “Catapult” (distribution) which makes their music available worldwide both in stores and online. They’ve performed more than, but 15 live performances they’ve made have aided in their establishment and notability as a group or band. I think it would be reasonable for there to be an article on Profound Intent at this point. Make it a stub and allow it to expand with provable content as the group progresses. As long as the information is true it wouldn’t hurt Wikipedia or us (its contributors). <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_04d4.html" title="User:Queen Amber Rice">Queen Amber Rice</a> 20:38, 7 March 2007 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_04d4.html" title="User:Queen Amber Rice">Queen Amber Rice</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/e/User_talk%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_a90e.html" title="User talk:Queen Amber Rice">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Queen_Amber_Rice_ba7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Queen Amber Rice">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The claim they are on an indie label with a major distribution deal is totally incorrect. The article refers to their labels as "LaPret World ENT" (LaPret is the name of one of the members strangely enough) and "Catapult". <a href="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/" rel="nofollow">Catapult</a> are a vanity distributor, anyone with <a href="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/howitworks.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/howitworks.html" rel="nofollow">$35</a> can distribute an album through them. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 22:55, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Oh no Catapult is not the same as Catapult Digital Distribution Services. You can't pay no $35 fee, you have to be signed to a distribution deal. "You" are the one making the claim that they're with Catapult the Digital Distribution. Please choose your words and make your claims wisely. 72.75.69.101 00:03, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So there's two Catapults that have distribution deals with stores and online then? Until you provide evidence to the contrary, my claims stand, so perhaps instead of making veiled legal threats you could provide a link to the Catapult you allege to be different from Catapult Digital Distribution Services? <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 00:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Are anime voice actresses inherently notable? – I don't see any other claim of notability. Furthermore, there are no sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Japanese seiyū are more notable thank their Western counterparts because the seiyū industry in Japan is large and has a high celebrity status. (Read <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiyu.html" title="Seiyu">seiyu</a>) Not all seiyu are notable, however. Judging by multiple roles in Animation, CDs, and other information from the Japanese wikipedia, she seems to meet notability requirements. There is more info on the Japanese wikipedia that could be used to expand the article. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 07:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think "high celebrity status" is overdoing it. While there are differences in notability among professions between Japan and the Western world, I think that seiyu are getting more than a fair shake on Wikipedia. She certainly may be notable per the JA Wiki, but there is little evidence of it in the current article. I don't see any bias here. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu"><font color="darkgreen">よ!</font></a> 13:56, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't claim bias and I certainly did not make the argument to include all seiyu in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't see the merit in removing genuinely informative and referenced material off Wikipedia. Yes, maybe it's not the sort of thing that would appear in the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> but then isn't the great thing about Wikipedia the fact that it has articles of the type that don't appear in the mainstream encyclopædias? Is Paul Holt really any less notable than, say, <a href="../../../b/r/f/Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116.html" title="Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116</a>? This information does not exist in any other Wikipedia article and may genuinely be of interest and/or use to some people. The truth is that while he does not technically comply with the guidelines set down, he did release a record on a major record label which made the top 40. There was also quite a reasonable amount of media coverage at the time, and Paul Holt was invited to sing on national TV (the Xtra Factor). This article has suvived on Wikipedia now since 2004 without doing any damage to the project or harming anyone. What possible purpose is served by deleting it? It's simply a case of following the rules strictly over common sense. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomPhil_fc24.html" title="User:TomPhil"><sup><font color="#8D38C9">Tom</font></sup></a><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomPhil_8a58.html" title="User talk:TomPhil"><sub><font color="#2554C7">Phil</font></sub></a> 18:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is a user page that user switched to main encyclopedia - it's vain person who believes he's important, but is not notable to the world in general. The key, though, is that if he truly is important enough to have an article in the encyclopedia, he needs to wait and let someone else write it, rather than writing about himself. As a result of writing his own autobiographical entry, this page is full of unverifiable information. 129humility 15:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just because Leonovich is not world famous does not make him any less noted. He has had works performed in Carnegie hall, and completed Tchaikovsky's Cello Concerto. 129humility needs to stop his or her personal quest to delete Mr. Leonovich's biography on Wikipedia. Instead of trying to improve Wikipedia by looking real problems, he or she is making persistant hits on a solitary individual that he or she might or might not know personally. I am well aware of Wikipedia rules of vanity and promotion. I am here to state the facts. As you can see, there is a legitimate reference on the Yuriy Leonovich page: www.tchaikovsky-research.org. This page is mainained by Brett Langston and Alexander Poznansky, authors of the Tchaikovsky Handbook, and other well known biographies on Tchaikovsky's life. The authors are used as references on different pages on Wikipedia. I am not here to explain my means of obtaining information. However, I'd like to see the end of attacks on this article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see where in the article it is asserted that Leonovich has had works performed in Carnegie Hall, nor how this is verified. It does mention that he has performed at carnegie hall with a religious figure, but I fail to see how this makes him important as a classical musician. As for the Tchaikovsky, while this may be notable, it does not necessarily make Leonovich notable. This is similar to the argument that a professor with one important paper is notable. I believe, and numerous wikipedians agree with me, that the appropriate action would be to mention Leonovich in the context of an article on the Tchaikovsky, rather than to create an article about him. Also, Mr. Lysenko, could you please sign messages with your username, rather than a name that doesn't verify whether you're a seperate user or not? Thanks! 129humility 22:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, guys, rather than fighting at least one party should bother to get some verifiable non-trivial second party references. If they exist there is absolutely no reason for an AfD and further nominations would just get a speedy treatment <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 17:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what a second party reference would be. I also don't understand why "humility" believe that I am Mr. Leonovich. That seems to be his only claim, of me writing about myself. I met Mr. Leonovich once, breifly, and have no personal ties to him. And the fact that an important author on Tchaikovsky has noted Mr. Leonovich as someone of importance, seem to me as a good reason to keep the page alive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A second party reference would be some published material that verifies all of the information presented. As is, one is forced to wonder how you, who claim to have met Leonovich only once, could know all of the facts about his history, his childhood teachers' names, and his many unperformed works, unless they were published in, for instance, some reputable biography. That would count as second party. Personal recollections or interviews are considered new research, and are not allowed on wikipedia. Finally, as to my assertion that you are Leonovich: the fact that your facebook profile gives your username as your AIM username and your AOL email address, and that this biography started as your own personal user page seem to be pretty big indicators that you and Leonovich are one and the same person. That and the fact that hours after I had initially questioned the validity of this page, you had mentioned in on your facebook account. 129humility 22:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you are not Yuriy Leonovich, then by an amazing coincidence, your user name is the same as his email address. I understand your concern that a self-authored article runs a bigger chance of being deleted, but you should be honest with the process - it makes it easier for us to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. As to the article, unfortunately, I can't read the first source, but I hope that the closing admin makes sure that somebody does before this AfD closes. The second source is a trivial mention, but it links to this page <a href="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/features/article004.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tchaikovsky-research.org/en/features/article004.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which, while written by Leonvich himself, seems to be a scholarly work on his completion of the concerto. It seems to me that it would confer notability, <i>if</i> completing the concerto was a notable or unique occurrence in the music field (much like a mathematician solving or proving a famous theorem or equation). Unfortunately, most of us lack the frame of reference for determining if this is a notable act, so sources would be needed to support the following questions: Was the concerto "famous" for being unfinished? Are there any other sources on the concerto and Leonvich's modifications? Has the completed concerto been played anywhere? These are the questions that need to be answered to avoid deletion.

<p>I request opinions on this article, which since its creation has been a magnet for edit-warring (with WP:3RR and other problems) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Dbachmann_reported_by_User:Rayfield_.28Result:.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Dbachmann_reported_by_User:Rayfield_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and of a lot of uncivility and disputes on the talkpage.</p>
<p>About one half to two thirds of this article can already be found in the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_India_Theory_6239.html" title="Out of India Theory">Out of India Theory</a> and in the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Invasion_Theory_%28history_and_controversies%29_49df.html" title="Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)">Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)</a> articles. The remaining part of the article could be safely merged as a section into the OIT, AIT and Hindu nationalism articles. Most of it can easily find place in OIT, and the rest in the other two articles.</p>
<p>Here we have an article that claims to be about the "ideological position" that may manifest itself as "Out of India Theory", and that seems to have been created to paint views such as the "criticism of Aryan migration theories" as some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112042069" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112042069" rel="nofollow">Hindu nazism</a>. The article has also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory#Neutrality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory#Neutrality" rel="nofollow">neutrality issues</a>.</p>
<p>It does not need a separate article. Wikipedia has articles on theories like <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_hypothesis.html" title="Armenian hypothesis">Armenian hypothesis</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleolithic_Continuity_Theory_3136.html" title="Paleolithic Continuity Theory">Paleolithic Continuity Theory</a> and many other theories, but Wikipedia has not articles only on the psychological motives or ""ideological position" for these theories. Such claims belong in the article of the theory, not in a separate article.</p>
<p>I suggest that this article be merged as a section into the mentioned articles, or that at least a suitable title for this article is found. Such a title could be <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideological_positions_in_the_Indo-Aryan_migration_debate_4a5c.html" title="Ideological positions in the Indo-Aryan migration debate">Ideological positions in the Indo-Aryan migration debate</a> or maybe Out of India Theory (Ideological positions). --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 01:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 01:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is not, as you can read up in the article. "OIT" is shoddy scholarship, while "Indigenous Aryans" is nationalist propaganda. The two overlap, of course. Bakaman's google search is spurious of course (surprise, surprise), since it includes the "theory" part which we want to get rid of by a {{<a href="../../../m/o/v/Template%7EMove_e1dc.html" title="Template:Move">move</a>}} anyway. (as you can extrapolate from Bakaman's 'dabcruft' neologism, this isn't even about any topical issue for him anymore, he just follows me around wikipedia and tries to disrupt things in various small ways). "Indigenous Aryan position" is just a term for what <i>proponents</i> (or should we say, <i>disseminators</i>) prefer to call things like "exciting new emerging evidence found by eminent professors" (and permutations, ad nauseam), which is hardly preferable as an article title. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Generally, writers in the IAT rubric <i>avoid</i> trying to make definitive statements about OIT (and even if they do, the theorising usually ends at the Hindu Kush), or dismiss linguistics altogether. Bryant's book as a source is unfortunate, because as anyone familiar with the popular literature knows, the indigenousness of the Aryans has to do with (a) the indigenousness of Hinduism in <i>all</i> its antecedents and, thus since the 1920s, (b) the relation between the Vedas and the IVC. Everything else is secondary. Bryant does not cover these aspects in any particular depth. But they are the core of the "position", and rife with fringecruft. The point of this article in WP is to offer a home for the kookery, rather than have the nonsense vitiate other subjects. There really is no "debate". It's all jingoistic pseudo-historiography. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 20:12, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If Bryants book as a source is unfortunate, this means that you are also somehow confused over the article title? I admit I am still confused over the article title, and its relation to Bryant's use of the term (in my opinion Bryant uses it as a synonim for OIT). Which authors on history then advocate IAT as opposed to OIT? The creator of the article has defined the article this way: It is about the ideological position that may manifest itself as OIT, among a couple of other positions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=112034563&amp;oldid=112021277" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=112034563&amp;oldid=112021277" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> And looking at the content, I see no reason why it cannot be merged to OIT, AIT and Hindu nationlism. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 20:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I think "Indigenous Aryanism" might have been better, or even "'Indigenous Aryan' Thesis" (note the two levels of quotes). And I disagree with your reading of Bryant. It's fairer to say that Bryant would <i>like</i> to equate the two (mainly because he considers linguistics important), but this confuses the <i>theoretical</i> implications of mainstream linguistics with the <i>historiographic</i> concerns of the IA "school". <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 20:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even if it were correct that Bryant's term is about the same thing that the article is about (which I doubt), the term is not in current use outside the work of Bryant. Bryant is notable, but not every term coined or used by him must automatically be so. The term IAT was already used by H. V. Sreenivasa Murthy in 1963 in A History of Ancient India. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 11:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please stop playing word games. No one has to wait for someone to <i>coin</i> a term like "Indigenous Aryan(ism)" for the subject to remain in limbo otherwise. Conjoining "indigenous" and "Aryan" in a phrase has been around for a long time, earlier than 1963 for sure. (Try Vol I (1951) of Majumdar's <i>History and Culture of the Indian People</i>, Appendix to Chapter X.) If you want a subject title like "Indigenousness of Aryans to the Indian Subcontinent", say so, instead of quibbling.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is essential to the neutrality of WP that articles about historical theories espoused by different political groups be maintained equitably. That such a theory is under attack as representing the view of only a nationalist group, is all the more reason to support it. The article seems reasonably fair and adequately referenced. That this is not the mainstream theory held on a global basis is made clear. Any effort at suppression of any POV by technical arguments, or by detailed discussion of the weakness of prima fascia RSs, or by merging in such a way as to diminish the influence or the number of articles of the minority group in such matters is to be guarded against by resolving doubts by keeping the article. (And personally, I skip over discussions of the editors involved; I think most uninvolved people here would do so also, and so I do not see the purpose of such attacks.) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: There is nothing wrong with this article and entire world agree for this fact. Afd proposed to achieve political agendas, discriminatory to millions of people in India, especially the minorities, 'Lower' castes. This theory is OR and had been debated thoroughly and rejected by academics and progressive political parties in India."world specialists on ancient India", voicing "mainstream academic opinion in India, Pakistan, the United States, Europe, Australia, Taiwan and Japan" on the issue, is now part of a concerted campaign encompassing well-known scholars and hundreds of teachers and parents against this 20th Century idea.John Paul 06:31, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Apart from the article having it's merits and being well sourced, the proposer has since decided to retire from wikipedia on the same day as this afd. He Had also <del>raised</del> particpated in a rfc against the creator of this article, and taken sides with a person in dispute with the creator- the motive seems suspect. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 08:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you please clarify who do you refer to when you mention "retire from Wikipedia". I initiated RfC against the creator of the article (after making effort for 4 months on different article to remove OR and explain basic policy like WP:ATT to an admin). The article only has some sources NOW since I kept pushing to include sources (look at the previous version to see how many citation you can find [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;oldid=108051893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;oldid=108051893" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]). Dab is STILL misquoting the sources in the article (items ref in (3) and (7)). He refuses to provide correct citation for controversial statements in the article or to remove the statements. I have been working with a third party mediator to tackle one issue at a time. Dab refuses to participate in the mediation effort. The question is do we need 2 article on Wikipedia to discuss same content? AIT is long established article for same content that is better referenced than this article and includes efforts of lot more than 1 editor.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 14:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I refer to user Rayfield, or RF as the User signs. I correct my above statement-RF had "particpated" in a rfc and taken a stance opposed to dab.- <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 15:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)- Also in light with the request for deletion, it is misplaced as in the same request a suggestion to "merge" is also made, merge has a seperate template than afd, and if merge was the objective than the appropriate tags and discussion should have been placed and made. If the content can be added to the other article, then deletion / redirection suggestions can be looked at, but I think that should precede a request for deletion.<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 15:14, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify Rayfield (RF) has neither "certified" or "endorsed" the RfC. On talk page of RfC he has provided some advice (which any fair person would have difficulty disagreeing with) to Dab [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Dbachmann&amp;diff=112660032&amp;oldid=112655348" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Dbachmann&amp;diff=112660032&amp;oldid=112655348" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>]. It would definately make it easy to work with Dab if he followed WP:CIVIL policy. I made effort over 4 months to resolve this, how long can I keep clapping with one hand. I am still having difficulty understanding how enforcing WP:ATT on all editors evenly is not the best solution to this controversial problem.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. "Indigenous Aryanism" gets enough Google results to be notable on its own, and it looks like there are good sources for describing Indigenous Aryanism as an ideological position. However, it may be more useful to have this material in the same article as the Out of India stuff, as that might give the reader a better idea of the role these theories play in contemporary Indian politics and culture, as well as international Vedic scholarship.

<li><b>Keep</b> The original PROD says that the article was created by Richard Vobes himself for commercial gain. This is clearly not the case as the article was <b>not</b> created by Richard. The article contains information about Richard's contribution to podcasting. This is further supported by his contribution to Podcast User Magazine.

<li><b>Keep</b> Richard has been an extremely influential member of the podcasting community, has won awards for his "soundseeing tours" in the vobes.com show and has been part of the "audio blog" genre, via the nakeenglishman.co.uk. He has inspired many other peiople to podcast (including myself) and provides uniqueu content, which is consumed worldwide. All in all Richard has created over 1,000 prodcasts, which is more than the "podfather" himself, Mr Adam Curry. To consider "deleting" Richard's contribution would be like proving George Orwell correct. Ignore the doublethink: Keep the Vobe!pcogle 09:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> <i><font size="2">This page does seem rather like a self serving promotion</font></i>. Since the original Wiki article was created, he has strayed from his original show concept which endured a small (as claimed) but loyal following and he never discusses exact listener figures. It's not apparent how he has been any sort of pioneer in anything watershed; the show is still similar to '70's radio morning shows. Many, many others have inspired others to become podcasters -- not just Vobes. Judging from the same contributors emails being constantly read, apparently the listener base remains stagnant.<font color="green"><b>To echo an earlier commenter, where are the references and sources?</b> BIGGUY 22:29, 5 March 2007 (UTC) <i>note - edited to remove subjective qualitative statements</i></font></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Richard Vobes provides listeners a window into English versus American culture, and therefore provides a valuable <b>cross-cultural exchange</b> which trancends any debate as to his value as a broadcaster. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.134.164.37_b37b.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.134.164.37">209.134.164.37</a> (talk) 19:32, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small>Vobes is a pioneer in podcasting and audio blogging - deleting him is deleting history - do not let it happen</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Richard Vobes can justifably be seen as notable in that he has created children's Television programmes and produced his long running, regular, podcast. Earlier versions of the Wiki were certainly self-publicising but this situation has since improved. Subjective opinion as to the quality of his work do not add to this discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - okay disclaimer: I have some professional connection with Miah (though I have never met him) and I would not comment if this were a less clear-cut case. The closing admin can take that into account and perhaps even discount my commnent. That said, he would be notable just for his book <i>Genetically Modified Athletes</i>, so I'm a bit puzzled as to why the article on him is up for deletion. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 23:22, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I was the one who removed the prod, and also edited the article, removing a great deal of the over-extensive list of references, etc.) In addition to the book, most of the articles in the list are in high-quality journals, and an outside source is provided by the book reviews at least. But they should have exact references for the purpose. It is not unusual for people to nominate articles by clearly notable scientists on the basis they wrote much of the article. But the question is the quality of the article, not who wrote it, and at this point I don't think there's much COI left.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Upon some detailed exploration, one can find that references are indeed tucked away in the article. The article has improved quite a bit since it was AfD'd and even more since it was prodded (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Miah&amp;diff=113301115&amp;oldid=111993794" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Miah&amp;diff=113301115&amp;oldid=111993794" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). My reading of the current version reveals no real COI issues, and a look at the edit history shows that they were removed over the past few days. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although I confess to accessing this page while looking for a list of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casio.html" title="Casio">casio</a> calculators, WP:NOT a collection of links, or a directory. The page is almost useless, at least 95% of the links are redlinks, and few of the articles would ever contain any useful information without becoming instruction manuals, which <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Most of the lists are in neither numerical or chronological order, and there is no consistency of style or content. It's unknown and difficult to determine whether the lists are current or comprehensive, as there are no references or cited sources. All in all, this list needs an enormous amount of work itself, and the effort needed to establish the hundreds of articles it links to is simply titanic. Without all those redlinks linking to functional articles, the list is useless, and even if the faries were to accomplish that, and remain within the confines of WP:NOT, what would we be have then? A glorified category which can't update itself. Useless. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappy-melon_5e5d.html" title="User:Happy-melon">Happy-melon</a> 18:21, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires the sources be non-trivial. I'd argue the omniglot article is trivial, as it's nothing but a short overview, and is nothing but an internet website. A non-trivial source, by contrast, would be a mention in a published book or magazine. I haven't found any in a google books search. Also, "non-trivial" would mean saying more than just "here is a constructed language we found on the internet." In this case, though, if there is something like a medium (newspaper, even bulletin board system) where writers seriously USE <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovio.html" title="Slovio">Slovio</a>, I can see that making this article notable. Basically, let's try to prove that someone other than <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Hucko_4369.html" title="Mark Hucko">Mark Hucko</a> finds this language useful. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidicke_409e.html" title="User:Davidicke">Davidicke</a> 21:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will readily admit that the article has/had notability <i>concerns</i>, but disagree with some of your statements above. Like you, I too prefer physically-published or publishable materials (books, journals, news) over websites. But, an internet website, as long as it reliable, is still a source. I believe the overview in the Omniglot page satisfies "non-triviality" because Slovio is the page's primary (nay, sole) focus. A trivial overview would be limited to: "Slovio is a constructed language invented by Mark Hucko.". It may be appropriate to merge this article into <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Hucko_4369.html" title="Mark Hucko">Mark Hucko</a>, or vice versa, but I view that to be an editorial issue, which I would rather leave to those articles' talk pages and their editors (who are probably more specialised in matters related to constructed languages and their inventors). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:37, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

And from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability. Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." Thus, I would like to see more than an Omniglot overview. But I agree with you that <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Hucko_4369.html" title="Mark Hucko">Mark Hucko</a> might work, if Mark Hucko is notable himself at all. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidicke_409e.html" title="User:Davidicke">Davidicke</a> 18:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the article is not original research (it does not invent anything new and does not claim Slovio is used). I am not aware of Slovio being mentioned in any Czech media and AFAICS in Slovak media.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The nominator has suggested that the article is is "completely unsourced" and "presumably original research". Neither of these assertions are accurate: the links provided in the "External links" section account for a significant portion of the text (and the existence of published material, however little, dispels concerns of OR).

<p>Tihs article was deleted once as an autobiography, created by User:Johnbeal. It was re-created by a new user, User:Bsteph1, who started editing after Johnbeal stopped. I believe they are one and the same. The article is pretty much completely unsourced. IMDB <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003395/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003395/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> shows Beal to be a jobbing composer of music for minor productions - "specializing in composition for theatrical marketing", i.e. writing advertising soundtracks.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm brand new at this. I did not know there was already an article about John Beal. Where is the article? I created this because I could not find one. I am not John Beal. I became a fan of his when he was the composer for the hit TV shows "Vega$" and "Eight is Enough." I have listed a few articles I found about him. I have tried to rewrite the facts and avoid plagiarism, but... Would someone like to help me edit this to make it okay? There are bios of him all over the internet. According to this bio you cited, he's scored 35 theatrical or television films and documentaries, 26 major network television series or specials, and has been music director for over 20 major network specials. If you look at his credits on the IMDb for the 70's and 80's they're almost all hit shows. That's hardly minor. Bsteph1 07:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wiktionary. The external link says about this word, "It turns up from time to time as one of those weird words which is best known for being held up as an example of a weird word." The Oxford English Dictionary does include this word, but the only citation for this particular word comes from the mathematical work published in 1557 in which it was apparently coined, and which doesn't even use the same spelling; "zenzizenzizenzic" is how the word would be spelled if it had survived into modern English (as opposed to "Zenzizenzizenzikes"). The most recent OED cite for any of the "zenzi..." exponentials is from 1674. This word is most relevant as a word which should be in the dictionary, rather than as a mathematical concept which should be in the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:43, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Lumos - it's part of the history of mathematics. It's also part of the history of writing - early efforts to find appropriate symbols for mathematical concepts. I do think it's too short to stand as an article in its own right, so really should be moved to a section on some more encyclopedic page. How would anyone ever find this page if they did not know the word to begin with? I don't agree with DavidCBryant, though. Simply having a fascinating image isn't enough to merit inclusion. If that were the case, every single Pharaonic papyrus fragment would have its own page, and so would each of the clay tablets from each of the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and surrounding areas. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 04:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it's plenty notable, but don't think it should be an article all on its lonesome. I also don't think it should be shunted off to the last page of Wiktionary. Its notability is not in its placement in the alphabet, but its role in history. It may not be a big role, but it's there. Salix alba (below) makes a good point - we need an article on the history of the development of mathematical notation, and this "word" belongs right in there. Has anyone run across a page which deals with this issue?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because an unrelated article on The West Wing (which has really no similarities to this one) was deleted on its <i>third nomination</i>, does not set a precedent that this must be. The UNIT dating controversy is a major element of discussion regarding <i>Doctor Who</i> and I believe was created in order to prevent the main article on UNIT becoming overlong. It's sourced, and it is not OR nor is it a fanon concept. I'd support renaming the article if people think the title is a bit too POV-ish. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Your description of the article is very inaccurate, Andrew Levine. The page is not jumbled, as you say, and even if it was, that would be a reason to cleanup the article, not delete it. By you putting quotes around evidence, you presumably mean that most of this stuff is just made up, but in fact each and every fact as a direct link to an episode of Doctor Who or other spin-off media, confirming the fact's verifiability. I say the same for 'fan speculation', this article just states the facts as they appear. Unless a proper reason is seen for deletion, other than 'It happened somewhere else so it automatically happens here', you do not have a case for AfD. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmomo_8a01.html" title="User:Smomo">Smomo</a> 01:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It's not OR - the evidence is contradictory because it has to be; any attempts to reconcile it would be OR. I'd like to see the off-screen evidence section expanded, and the sources cleaned up a bit, but I don't see this a candidate for deletion. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Olsen_f29b.html" title="User:Brian Olsen">Brian Olsen</a> 01:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Information is detailed and relevant. The separate page is justified given its length and that of its parent page.

<li><b>Keep</b> — the <i>West Wing</i> page was deleted in part because of OR concerns. This page cites two published works which have dealt extensively with this controversy. The article could be reorganized to rely more heavily on the secondary sources (<i>AHistory</i> and <i>About Time</i>) and less heavily on the primary sources (the conflicting evidence from <i>Doctor Who</i> episodes, etc.), but that's an argument for improvement, not deletion. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 02:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This has been written about in quite a number of secondary sources, plus several of the stories that contradict each other have tried to cover this on their own pages but it proved a mess that got out of sync.

<li><b>Keep with Comment</b> Regarding the sources, above all else this article needs a footnote right at the end of the first sentence to verify that the controversy exists and is notable enough to warrant an article.

<li><b>Copyvio</b> - good call. Just about the whole article is a copyvio - pulled word from word from the eastbrunswick.org/publicsafety/ website. I've tagged it as a speedy copy-vio, so with luck, this AfD will become moot.
