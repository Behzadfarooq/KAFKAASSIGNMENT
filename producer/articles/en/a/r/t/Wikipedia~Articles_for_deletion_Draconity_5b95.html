<li>I don't think we should take such draconian measures, the word does garner over 10,000 ghits, there does seem to be enough people involved in this to make it notable (and others may be involved and not know it, <a href="http://www.armory.com/tests/draconity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.armory.com/tests/draconity.html" rel="nofollow">take the dragon test</a> to find out if you are).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Appreciate the draconity test! It would appear that I am, in fact, not dragon deep down inside or any other place for that matter (good to know). Yes, there are some people running around on the internet claiming that they dragons to varying degrees of manifestation but a solely internet based, argubaly delusional, group of people that find they have some metaphyscial relation to a mythical creature after a Mountain Dew and D&amp;D overload does not automatically provide for notability. Just for the sake of argument, even if they did that doesn't remedy the unsolvable issues of soapbox-ish-ness, vanity, neologism, sub-culture forking or original research and reliable sources, esp the last as it will never exist for this "community". This material is best left where it belongs, on personal webpages devoted to the art of "being a dragon". <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 05:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I pretty much agree with everything you're saying. I think you could come up with plenty of other examples of weird subculture stuff (and other things) where the same problems would apply, too. However, those are <i>content</i> problems, notability isn't affected by how difficult a subject is to source references or write objectively about, notability is about whether the subject affects or affected enough people substantially enough to be notable. In this case it's an open question and drumming up reliable statistics on the number of people involved is difficult, but when I pop a weird word like this in Google and out pops 10,000 hits, it occurs to me that <i>something</i> notable might be going on. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Keeping in mind you only raised the issue notability and that is the only issue that I'm responding too. Consider the fact that the word "Draconity" can refer to the simple "being of a dragon" which this article is not about and therefore any Ghit count is going to be horribly misrepresentative of what you are trying to establish. Again, for the sake of debate, even if this article were to prove some kind of notability (which it has not as it must in order to justify its existence) there is still a host of other rules it fails namely <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and more than a few aspects of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I really don't feel there is any sort of exceptional point in this article's nature that could warrant it being kept. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 08:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You bring up a valid point about the ghit count possibly being bloated by other articles regarding dragons that have nothing to do with the topic of the article. Frankly, I'm not sure <i>how</i> one would determine how widespread this phenomenon is. I don't disagree with you about the problems with the current state of the article, or the difficulty of solving those problems. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:23, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want to grant this article every benefit of the doubt I can. I recognize that there are people who identify as dragons, and as far as I am concerned, there's nothing wrong with that. Many consider this as a subset of <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_Fandom_e746.html" title="Furry Fandom">Furry Fandom</a> or <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, and logically a well rounded encyclopedia that covers those topics should cover Draconity as well. The problem with the article is that there is not nearly enough written about this particular subset, apart from personally published pages, <a href="../../../u/s/e/USENET_f12a.html" title="USENET">USENET</a> and message boards. (Compare the references and external links on Furry Fandom and Otherkin to Draconity, and you'll see what I mean.) Therefore it cannot be included into Wikipedia at this time. You can always come back and recreate it when there is more written on it by independent sources.</dd>

<li>Keep, and clean up. While the article itself makes a few assertions that seem rather unplausible, I think that it could be cleaaned to the point that finding sources would not be completely out of the question.

However, it is definitely closely related to <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a>, and may not be notable enough to merit a seperate article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - When I looked for google hits, all I could find were multiple message boards relating to the subject, and message boards are not sources for establishing notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The problem is notability and lack of sources, which is why I think it should be merged with the otherkin article with very little of its text - though they make up an important subset of the community, they aren't notable in and of themselves, but their existence is mentioned (but not gone into in any detail) by several publications cited by the <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a> article (that is to say, dragons are mentioned along with others, but only briefly). So. really, I guess its really not much of a merging at all so much as "mention them in otherkin briefly". <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 11:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - It's a fair point, but it would probably be better to mention this on the otherkin talk page instead of here, especially seeing as how the emerging consensus seems to be that there is very little, if anything, in this article that is worth salvaging and moving across to the other article. Also, a good point made earlier in this debate was to have Draconity redirect to otherkin as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'd love to argue the article needs cleanup, not removal, but I just don't see enough verifiable sources right now for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. The best solution is to fold this back into <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, which does at least pass that threshold, and then bring Draconity back if it ever starts getting attention on its own merits. <a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxil_3188.html" title="User:Baxil">Baxil</a> 00:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Darn. I thought this would be an obvious decision, but a bit of research changes my mind. The article as it stands is too much like original research, so I'm going with <b>Delete</b> for the moment. However, if the article returns with better references I'll be inclined to vote the other way: the phenomenon is real and though I've not met anyone who believes he's a dragon I have met some <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>, and believe that some of them are sincere. ( They may be wrong or loopy, but that doesn't stop them being sincere, and having a state of mind that should be covered here. ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The core problem is that the neologism Draconity is not, as far as I can find, a recognized term for a demographic by any creditable academic or journalistic sources as this article asserts. It's soapboxing original research. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 18:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a></b>, <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> is genuinely a neologism has been completely gutted. The idea that there is some incredibly important difference between believing you're a dragon and believing you're a wolf seems very weak to me. (I'm a dragon, I'm allowed to say that.) A paragraph or two in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a> with a redirect on the word <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> is all the subject genuinely needs. Perhaps a note pointing to the existence of online communities specifically for dragons and vampires (do other species have specific communities?) is worth making. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickArgall_92e1.html" title="User:NickArgall">NickArgall</a> 02:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>keep</b> there are 5 to 10 websites with more than 1500 members and there are other articals with less than 75 people in the subculture&#160;!!! <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichak_5385.html" title="User:Michak">user:michak</a></p>
