<p>A Zuchetto (Italian for head) is the small, round skullcap worn by a bishop, cardinal or pope in the Catholic religion or of the ecclesiastic. The official name of the Zuchetto is pileolus. Other various names used are berettino, calotte, subbiretum (because worn under the biretta), submitrale (because worn under the mitre), soli-deo. The zucchetto worn by the popeis white while that worn by a cardinal is red, even when the cardinal is a member of an order. Cardinals who had been secular priests received the red zucchetto and also the red biretta in 1464 from Paul II; the cardinals taken from the regulars were granted both in 1591. If the newly-appointed cardinal is at Rome he receives the zucchetto from the Sotto-guardaroba as he leaves the throne room where he has received the mozetta, and biretta from the pope; otherwise the zucchetto is brought to him, along with the decree of appointment, by one of the pope's Noble Guard. The pileolus of the bishops is violet, that of other ecclesiastics, including the prelates, unless a special privilege to wear violet is granted, black. Bishops and cardinals wear it at Mass, except during the Canon; other ecclesiastics may not wear it at Mass without special papal permission. However, according to a decision of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (23 September, 1837), a bishop also may not wear it while giving Benediction.</p>
<p>It cannot be said positively when the zucchetto became customary, but it was probably not before the thirteenth century. It appears on the cardinals in the fresco, "St. Francis before Honorius III", painted about 1290 in the upper church of St. Francis at Assisi. It is seen also under the tiara in the effigy on the tomb of Clement VI (d. 1352) at La Chaise-Dieu. The figures on the several tombs of bishops of the fifteenth century in the Roman churches show the zucchetto under the mitre. In the "Ordo" of Jacobus Gajetanus (about 1311) the zucchetto is mentioned in connection with the hat of the cardinals (cap. cxviii), and with the mitre in the "Ordo" of Petrus Amelii (cap. cxliv.), which appeared about 1400. It is shown in the pictures and sculpture of the late Middle Ages sometimes as a round skullcap, sometimes as a cap that covers the back of the head and the ears. In this shape it was called camauro; this designation was given especially to the red velvet cap of this kind bordered with ermin that was peculiar to the pope. There was great confusion as to the proper use of the zucchetto and hence the Sacred Congregation of Rites has delivered several decisions on the Subject ("Decr. auth. Congr. SS. Rit.", V, Rome 1901, 382).</p>

<p>Sputter coating is a process of covering a specimen with a very thin layer of heavy metal, generally a gold/palladium (Au/Pd) mixture. This coating increases the ability of a specimen to conduct electricity and emit secondary electrons when in a scanning electron microsope, acting as a "stain" for electron microscopy. Biological specimens, composed largely of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> compounds, are usually poor emitters of secondary electrons due to the low <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_number.html" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> of carbon. Rather than absorbing electrons from the electron source of the microscope and then emitting electrons for detection, carbon compounds tend to collect a charge.</p>

Permindex is a famous swiss-italian facet company of the jewish spy agency Mossad, which is alleged in the assasination of several world politicians, including JFK and two algerian statesmen. French president De Gaulle also accused Permindex of financing the secret army group of French Foreign Legion for the famous machine gun attempt at his life, where he was saved only by the sturdiness of his Citroen car.

A band from the Midlands - Luke Adams, Dan Butler, Mat Butler, Tom Fulcher and Lee Jordan.</p>
<p>The Voices have been a creative force for the best part of five years, their founding members meeting whenever the chance was available to record early demos and work on their songwriting. After an early incarnation as 'What are the voices', a name based on an old joke, the band as a live outfit was put on hold, while Mat, Dan and Luke went their different ways throughout the UK.</p>
<p>There was always the intention of getting the perfectly knit group together whenever it became a real possibility, so the writing and playing continued. Grasping the opportunity of a few days demoing any time they were back in the Midlands, the original three gradually built up a healthy catalogue of tunes over the next few years. Some of these are sketchy early recordings and others developed into the material on the Blue Light EP.</p>
<p>At this point in time, with the addition of Tom Fulcher on drums and Lee Jordan on bass, the band are pleased to have a solid disc of their work available. They stress, however, that they are continuously trying to produce better songs and have a mass of new material being developed. In order to showcase this and coinciding with the release of the EP, they are planning to play frequent acoustic sets throughout the next year.</p>
<p>The Voices are finally coming together as a fully fledged band and there is a mutual feeling that the time is right.</p>

<p>Good Evening Hyderabad is a daily FM programme broadcast on All India Radio's 102.8MHz between 5.05 and 6.55pm. It is neatly slotted into Hyderabadi, Telugu, Hindi and English slots each lasting about half an hour. Most of the programs are sponsored and offer a huge range of interactive and entertaining content. While music is one of the most important ingredients, Good Evening Hyderabad also offers radio plays, jokes and skits as a part of its repertoire. The fact that within just three months of its launch Radio Jockeys from the GEH stable bagged most of the prizes given for quality RJing by the Hyderabad Radio Lovers Club speaks for the standards of excellence that the program has brought to Radio in general and Hyderabad in particular.</p>

<p><br />
Sir Talbot Duckmanton was the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission - now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation - both known as 'the ABC'- from 1965 to 1982.</p>
<p>One of the more notable things about his tenure with the ABC was the Post Office Box addresses for the ABC in each of the capital cities of the Australian States - PO Box 9994.</p>
<p>In his earlier days with the ABC, Talbot Duckmanton was a sports broadcaster, having a particular interest in cricket. He created the first 'live' broadcast of a cricket test match from overseas by reading telegraph reports of each part of the game (each bowler's approach and the batsman's response) and broadcasting it as if he were there watching the match, including a sound effect generated by striking a piece of wood with a pencil to simulate the sound of the bat striking the ball - crowd sounds were supplied by sound effects men (sic, sports broadcasting in the 1930s was particularly male) using phonograh records of applause, cheers, etc.</p>
<p>Sir Donald Bradman's batting average in Test cricket was 99.94. What better number to have as the PO Box address of the ABC? Sir Talbot couldn't think of another.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-21_1552.html" title="Edit section: Vincent Kickerillo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vincent Kickerillo</span></h2>
<p>Vincent D. Kickerillo, a famous Houston homebuilder and real estate developer, was born in 1929, the son of an Italian sharecropper. In 1942 he left the farm in Texas' Brazos River Bottom near Bryan, to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>At age 13,Kickerillo, took his first job at Western Auto in Bryan, Texas, followed by a job at Hughes Tool Company in Houston, making ammunition for World War II. At age 16, he joined the Merchant Marines and traveled around the world for the next thirteen years.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Houston in 1957, Kickerillo's entrepreneurial endeavors led him to build several new homes and within one year, the Kickerillo Company was in real estate development and home construction. Since those early days, Kickerillo has had a profound impact on the growth of Houston and the trends of the upscale housing market. The Kickerillo Companies have developed or built in more than 28 communities that provide quality custom-built homes, shopping centers, churches, schools, apartments and recreational facilities. In 1964, Kickerillo purchased his first bank, and his financial holdings grew to over 20 Banks, Savings &amp; Loans and Insurance Companies.</p>
<p>Five decades later, Vincent is a multi-millionaire and the chief executive officer of a substantial real estate empire that has developed over 15,000 lots and built more than 10,000 homes in the premium price range. In addition, he has developed more than 1,000 acres of commercial property all over the city of Houston.</p>
<p>The highly successful builder/developer/banker/businessman has proven that a strong commitment to making a dream a reality can elevate a person who starts with very little into a realm of remarkable success. As a response to his extraordinary good fortune in Houston, he has strived to better himself and the community. The Kickerillo family commits itself to playing active roles in a variety of local and national benefits for others.</p>
<p>Since 1963, he has contributed substantial amounts of time and money to St. John Vianney Catholic Church, The Hughen School for the Disabled, The Anti-Defamation League, The Diabetes Foundation,The National Jewish Hospital, The American Cancer Society, The American Heart Association, The March of Dimes, The United Way, Easter Seals, Houston School for the Deaf, Texas Society for the Prevention of Blindness, the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center in Palm Springs, California, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Duchesne Academy and The Houston Council on Human Relations. The Kickerillos are also supporters of The Wortham Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>His impressive record of accomplishments, strong character, and solid beliefs have made Vincent Kickerillo successful in business and finance. Vincent shares his good fortune with his wife Mary and his daughter Kelli.</p>

<p>Michael James Nive, born 19th July 1986, is famous for becoming the junior chess champion at the extrememly young age of 6. He grew up in the town of Horsham, in southern England, where he attended Horsham Junior School and went to Horsham Grammar when he turned 11. He is famous for saying, 'Chess is a game of two halves, they are the match and the afterparty.' When Niven turned 18, he was sentenced to 3 years in jail for stealing ¬£3,000,000 from a bank in Horsham. It is rumoured that he was assisted by Jonathan Burke, a Jamaican 18 year old that is currently nowhere to be found. Burke is known in his local area as a troublemaker and has been in prison for 2 months before. Harry Nelson, the 'brains' behind the crime, was shot on site. Police said that he just stood still and did not move, apparently staring into space. Niven is due to be released in 2 years.</p>
