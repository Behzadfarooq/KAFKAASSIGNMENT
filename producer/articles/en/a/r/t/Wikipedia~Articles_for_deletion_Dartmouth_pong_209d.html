While some students were proud to see their school's name in The Times, others were dismayed by the factual error. The New York Times was not the first to attribute the genesis of pong to Dartmouth. Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, also attributes pong to the College. It is unclear where the game was first played, some have suggested Dartmouth College in the 1950s, but there has been no definitive date or place," the encyclopedia claims under "beer pong. Unofficial College historian and history professor emeritus Jere Daniell '55 recalls playing pong in its most primitive form when he was a member of Alpha Theta fraternity between 1952 and 1955. I'm not even sure it had a name," Daniell said of playing the game over 50 years ago. He remembered that a point system accompanied the game but said there weren't even ground rules yet." --AaronS 01:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your article has two things in it I have a problem with, well three now that I think of it. First off the editors note is&#160;:"This is the first in a three-part series looking at the evolution of beer pong as a social and cultural phenomenon at Dartmouth.". Its about it on campus, therefore not notable. Secondly, it states "While some students were proud to see their school's name in The Times, others were dismayed by the factual error. " What was the factual error? Also your article uses wikipedia asa a reference, so basically your reference is the wiki itself? <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Mike</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../o/n/t/User_talk%7EOnthost_6d42.html" title="User talk:Onthost">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onthost_a9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onthost">C</a>)</sub> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Star_of_life.svg/20px-Star_of_life.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" /></a> 01:16, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aren't you a nit-picky grumpy-wump! I can't explain the terrible editorial process at <i>The Dartmouth</i>, but it does have some clout as a student newspaper. And of course the article is about beer pong at Dartmouth -- where <i>The New York Times</i> claims it internationally stems from. --AaronS 02:25, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, Mike makes very valid points, that an article about something at Dartmouth can't really consider a Dartmouth newspaper to be a reliable, unbiased source. Yes, it's the oldest college newspaper, but it's still a newspaper that cannot naturally be expected to be unbiased about its own campus. And Wikipedia definitely cannot cite itself, even if it's citing something else that cites Wikipedia. I added a whole bunch of much more independent sources to the article, though. Mike, if you want to take a look at those, and see if they influence your vote? --<sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 04:15, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pong is known (inter?)nationally as Beruit or 'ruit. The kind of pong from which Beruit sprang comes from Dartmouth. It is simply called "pong" at Dartmouth. Outside of Dartmouth, it is called "Dartmouth pong." --AaronS 13:15, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why the name of the article is being argued here - I don't think anyone's meant "Dartmouth pong" to be a proper name, but rather just a descriptive name for a specific drinking game. Articles can be renamed without an AfD if that's an issue, anyways. On-campus, students are picky about it being called "pong" and not "Beirut", but that's only on-campus. The notability of the article is that it's the first version of beer pong (see sources in the article), and remains a major part of the Dartmouth College culture. I believe the sources that I added qualify as 'verifiable sources'. There is still certainly an argument to be made as to the notability of the facts, and that's what this AfD should focus on. --<sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 18:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "factual error" that The Dartmouth mentions is that the New York Times doesn't draw the tight distinction between Beirut and beer pong that many Dartmouth students are often extremely picky about.

A quick Google search reveals that "Dartmouth College" and "beer pong" seem to be mentioned in a very large number of other college's alcohol guidebooks/standards/etc... I'll see if I can find some more independent sources (also - I know those NYT stories have been re-run in other papers since their original publications). Dartmouth's version of beer pong is a quite unique variant, it deserves at least a section in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_pong.html" title="Beer pong">beer pong</a>.
