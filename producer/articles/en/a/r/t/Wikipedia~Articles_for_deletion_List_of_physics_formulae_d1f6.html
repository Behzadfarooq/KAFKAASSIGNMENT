<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result was <b>No consensus</b>. From the discussion here it looks like there is some serious skepticism that this can be made into a viable article, but enough people willing to give it some more time to be worked into an encyclopedic article to stay the delete button for now. The current article is already clearly further developed than the previously deleted article. I suspect this article will be back on AfD in the relatively near future if it doesn't progress soon, but for now it gets to stay. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 20:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article is marked in-use, but now it got prodded, deprodded by creator, then reprodded, so here we are in AfD. The two prods were "Unmaintainable. What constitutes a "physics" formula? What are the variables used the formulas below? What's their significance? This is just an indiscriminate list. Wikipedia is not a crib sheet for a physics exam." and "How can this ever contain every physics formulae?". I concur: <b>delete</b> as indiscriminate list with no real unifying topic and no context. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 03:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> How can you have a "list of formulae" as an encyclopaedia article? How would you define a formula as worthy of inclusion anyway? If a+b=c is a formula, is c-b=a a formula too? --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 03:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> <s>Weak keep.</s> In its <i>current</i> state, the list has some problems. <s>In particular, the second formula directly contradicts the third formula.</s> In principle, however, there's no reason this couldn't work. It would take some careful planning as to what would be in and what would be out. This is not listcruft -- there's almost nothing more fundamental than physics.

<li><b>cmon guys..</b>Yeah, it needs improvement so it's more encyclopedic. However, this article is EXTREMELY useful, and I don't think your reasons are sufficient to delete. Worthiness of inclusion is not the issue, that will be edited over time, and thats what wikipedia is all about. This isn't a study sheet, although it works as one I guess.

<li>The top of the article states that "Visualizing multiple formulae on one page may be helpful [...] after one has completed at least a basic course in physics.". In other words, this is coursework revision material, suitable for a physics course textbook. That is standard Wikibooks fare, and <i>Wikibooks already has this</i>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I still say this list is unmaintainable, listcruft, and unencyclopedic. What constitutes "physics"? You seem to be including only classical mechanics. Does it include <a href="../../../r/a/o/Raoult%27s_Law_3008.html" title="Raoult's Law">Raoult's Law</a>, which is generally considered part of chemistry? What about <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohm%27s_Law_3547.html" title="Ohm's Law">Ohm's Law</a>? Quantum mechanics? Fluid mechanics? <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bragg%27s_Law_f088.html" title="Bragg's Law">Bragg's Law</a>? String theory? Astrophysics? You've included things like the ideal gas law without stating it only holds reasonably true for noble gases at low temperatures. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 04:27, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> That's cause it's not done yet. I'm sure that eventually it will have to be cut down greatly, to include only the most important equations from each area. As for the <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal_gas_law.html" title="Ideal gas law">ideal gas law</a>, it'll be marked as only holding for ideal gasses when I get to it. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>... for now. As it is, it's a little jumbled and difficult to read, and therefore not a good quick reference. But formatting isn't a reason to delete; let the physics-lovers work on it and if it can't get better, the someone can renominate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkdsgraham_f1a3.html" title="User:Markdsgraham">Markdsgraham</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkdsgraham_0346.html" title="User talk:Markdsgraham">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Markdsgraham_228d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Markdsgraham">contribs</a>) 04:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This is probably more useful on Wikibooks, as part of a physics textbook, or perhaps on Wiktionary, as an appendix.

I <i>know</i> we're not supposed to bring other articles into the discussion, but consider <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_formulas_involving_pi.html" title="List of formulas involving pi">List of formulas involving pi</a>. This is another very broad topic, and one might easily say "Math is not that simple." (I'm a mathie.) But I think it's still a reasonable article. Perhaps not as deadly serious in tone as other articles -- more a collection of interesting, related facts -- but still a decent list. One might say: "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information," but that article is not indiscriminate, and while this one might be <i>now</i>, it just needs time to be pared down. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. per nom/ above comments. Trigonometric identities are a very specific topic. You wouldn't make a "list of mathematics formulas" page would you? This list is grossly incomplete, has no context, and is useless for people who want to learn physics. However, with a little work, I do agree that it might make a nice appendix in an introductory mechanics textbook on wikibooks. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 05:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - perhaps this might be a good reference for kids taking the regents exam (even though it doesn't have electricity &amp; magnetism, waves &amp; sound, optics, or modern physics), but are such laundry lists encyclopedic? I agree that this page would be very hard to maintain/ organize and standardize. Should Newton's second law be in differential form? Is "Momentum is the amount of mass moving" a good definition? These issues can be fixed, but there will be more. Even with a lot of work, trying to achieve the goal of "quick reference", will this page ever be useful? For me, if I want to know a formula, I will search for that specific topic, so I can understand the formula, and not just see it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 06:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is a reason that other Wikiprojects exist: Wikipedia does not and should not contain everything, that's not what it was meant for. This is textbook material pure and simple and does not belong in an encyclopedia. Since it is <i>already</i> in the Foundation's book project (Wikibooks) there is no transwiki needed. Slap a few wikibooks templates on the relevant physics articles and you're done.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> As-is, this list is reasonably comprehensive and maintainable. To be encyclopedic it must be restricted to important physics formulae and it may even wise to restrict it to important <i>classical</i> physics formulae (or at least keep anything involving <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> to the bare bones.) However, this page can get much bigger without being unweildy, and should.<br />
On Wikibooks: It seems to me that this material is also amenable to it, bot not in quite the same form. It is interesting to note the this article is already superior to the lists in Wikibooks. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I have seen lists of equations in print encyclopedias. So it makes some sense to me for this page to exist here. At the least, I find the argument that similar pages exists in Wikibooks to be most inadequate due to those lists being nowhere hear as cmoprehensive as this one already is. IMO, if this page can be referenced from other pages, then it belongs here. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those lists are almost certainly not the same as this list. Their contents almost certainly have more in common with one another than just being formulae used somewhere in the field of physics. Furthermore: Your reason for finding the argument inadequate is spurious. Firstly, that someone can link to an article is not exclusive to Wikipedia. We have interwiki links in many articles. Indeed, there are two right at the top of this very page, and two more further down. Secondly, as pointed out above, this list isn't comprehensive, contrary to your assertion. A comprehensive list would be so broad as to be useless. The idea that one can keep it to just "important" formulae is founded entirely upon sand, since the only workable definitions of "important" are either "important to physics topic X", in which case the mathematics actually belong in the encyclopaedia article that deals with that physics topic, or "part of the crib sheet in school curriculum Y", in which case they belong in the relevant textbook for that curriculum on Wikibooks. If you think that the textbooks in Wikibooks can be improved, then improve them, and encourage any other editors who want to write textbook content to do the same. Wikibooks is a wiki. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I find the demand that this article contain every physics equation to be both unfair and unrealistic. It seems to me that as this article grows, it can be split itnto sublists as needed, which only the most important entries from the sublist maintained here. IMO, this particular article is off to a very good start, which is why the deletion request is being strongly contested. Given that it seems to be headed in a good direction, I say that we should keep it and see how it develops. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "demand" is inherent in the list's scope, as given by its title and introduction. You find that scope, when it is pointed out to you, to be "unrealistic". Therefore I suggest that you think about the article again in light of that. As I've already pointed out, any constraints (such as the "importance" criterion that you vaguely mentioned before, but didn't define) to "realistic" lists lead either to content that belongs in an article about a specific physics topic, or in an examination crib sheet. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>New opinion - <b>Weak keep</b> if not transwiki. This article has not been improved on in a week. An energetic and ongoing attempt to catalog the important equations of physics is one thing. The current article as the best that can be created at this time is another. It is a good list, and should at least be transwikied if it is not retained in Wikipedia. I will support keeping the article at this time to permit it to be built up more and prosified somewhat. If nothing of the sort happens soon, then I will support its being tranwikied. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> in some Wikimedia project, whether Wikipedia or another. It is useful to have an article (or book or whatever) with a large, useful set of formulas in a consistent notation and with a useful organization. Earlier objections: "Unmaintainable." Why do you say that? What about a list of formulas makes it unmaintainable? There are books with formulas inside their covers; their publishers can and do maintain them, and in fact, little change from edition to edition to edition establishes that nearly no maintaining is needed. "What constitutes a "physics" formula?" The authors are answering that by editing the article, which they could do a lot more efficiently if they didn't have to face two deletion proposals and an Articles for Deletion debate. "What are the variables used the formulas below?" They're explained in the article. "What's their significance?" That's explained in articles to which this list links. "This is just an indiscriminate list." No, it discriminates very carefully: to be an entry in the list, an item must be a physics formula. "Wikipedia is not a crib sheet for a physics exam." Is that policy? Wikipedia is not an article on any topic, so how is this an argument against an article? "How can this ever contain every physics formulae?" Must it? Does or must the article on physics contain every fact about physics? This information belongs in a Wikimedia project. A link to it from <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">Physics</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanics.html" title="Mechanics">Mechanics</a>, and other major articles will let readers get to it just as easily whether it is on Wikipedia or Wikibooks.

<p><i>it discriminates very carefully: to be an entry in the list, an item must be a physics formula.</i> — That argument is clearly based upon the false premise that there are only a few formulae in physics. That is untrue. There is a large number of such formulae, and many of them have nothing in common apart from being "in physics". "In physics" is almost as indiscriminate a criterion as "written down".</p>
<p>A <i>discriminate</i> criterion would be topic specific.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Several problems here. Foremost, as noted above, this is Wikibooks material, and already exists there (at least in some form). Wikipedia is not the CRC Handbook (we also don't keep trig tables, for example). Second, it lacks limitations that are not going to be easily resolved. There are entire textbooks about the math behind fluid dynamics, for example, not to mention quantum physics or anything more esoteric. What about derived forms? Variants with differing sets of assumptions? This article does not set boundaries, and efforts to ascribe limitations after the fact strike of original research. Similarly, third, we cannot "wait for it to be finished". In a very real sense, Wikipedia articles are <i>never</i> finished ... especially those that approach limitlessness. Finally, I'm not sure exactly what the content of the previously deleted article was, but haven't we had this discussion before? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The advent of calculators has rendered the trig table a rarity.

I view a long list of formulae without context to be more like the latter than the former. As a possible suggestion, however, a list of formulae by name that provides some context for each and that links to the articles in which they are discussed might be of value as a navigation tool (assuming no such list exists at current). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As I mentioned above, trigonometric identities are a very specific topic, but still there is a huge page dealing with them. (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_trigonometric_identities.html" title="List of trigonometric identities">List of trigonometric identities</a>) But, you wouldn't make a page called "List of mathematics equations" would you? That is basically what this page is like right now. A better title for this page would be "physics equations in elementary Newtonian mechanics" (basically regents and AP level). The only use for this page is as a <i>crib sheet</i>, and it isn't even very good for that, as it has numerous technical difficulties and does not include Electricity &amp; Magnetism, waves, optics, or any modern physics (which is most of physics). Over all, it has no context, little or no educational value or practical use. When people forget an equation and need to look it up, they will search for that specific topic. When people want to learn about an equation, they need something that relates it to nature; something with context and an explanation of the conceptual ideas involved and how the equation is used, etc. Just having the equation thrown out there leads one to a "plug and chug" mentality which gives little understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. Currently, I see two possible futures for this page: 1. delete it and merge into wikibooks or 2. Somehow reduce this page in it's size and scope (perhaps to elementary Newtonian mechanics?), and then assuming there are people who know physics willing to work on it, they will fight the ensuing edit wars, and hope that is turns out ok and is not a big confusing mess (or conversely, a pitifully incomplete indiscriminate list). Right now I am opting for 1, because I think most people involved in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_physics_a0db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject physics">Wikiproject Physics</a> have a lot of other more important things to do then deal with this.

Beyond that, I am amenable to the possibility of transwikiing this article, but I don't think that a good case for that has been made yet. I for one want to see how this article develops before lowering the boom on it. If it integrates itself into this project readily over the next few months, then obviously it will deserve to stay. If it instead stagnates I may prefer to see it transwikied later. BTW - I also think that it would be nice if the folks who think that material belongs in Wikibooks would have as their vote "transwiki" instead of "delete". The later is a call for the total removal of this material without even trying to put it in a better place, and I totally disapprove of that. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Build it and they will come. This should be given time to develop and grow. There is evidence that there is considerable interest in this sort of thing. It has been attempted several times before by different editors. There is clearly some sort of need for this.

<li><b>Delete</b> this is indeed useful but belongs at wikibooks. Formulae should be (and generally are) listed within the articles on specific topics rather than grouped into a massive category like "physics". <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 07:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Is anyone reading the above comments? Anyone who has tried to learn physics knowns that lists of equations are not helpful for anything except crib sheets for tests. We here at wiki should want to increase public understanding of physics, not deprive them of it. Therefore, if we are going to create this page, it's going to take a lot of work. And for reasons above, many had said it would be unmaintainable, unless it is downgraded, and even then I am not sure how it might turn out. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanski14_d77d.html" title="User:Danski14">Danski14</a> 15:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not gonna deny that a lot of people would use it to bone up for tests, but there's a lot of these equasions, and I get them mixed up all the time. If I ever needed a random physics equasion in everyday life (Don't ask for an example, <i>PLEASE</i>) then I would love to come here and just look it up. If you're really that concerned, then we can add an explanation to each equasion, although that may just bloat it a bit too much. We'll burn that bridge when we cross it. And besides, Physics books generally have tables of formulae in the back, so why not have one in the Wiki for people without physics books? -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 16:18, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If were going to add explanations, that would be a waste of time. Everything is already covered in other articles. (<a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell%27s_Equations_bdbf.html" title="Maxwell's Equations">Maxwell's Equations</a> was mentioned before as a good example.
