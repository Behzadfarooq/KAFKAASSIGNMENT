<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-24_1259.html" title="Edit section: The Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge, Mooringsport, Caddo Parish, LA  USA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge, Mooringsport, Caddo Parish, LA USA</span></h2>
<p>HISTORY: In 1914, as modes of transportation progressed, the Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge at Mooringsport was built to replace the ferry. The Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City, Missouri built the bridge under authority of the Caddo Parish Police Jury. This vehicular bridge illustrates the unique "Vertical-Lift" design of Mr. James Alexander Low Waddell of the illustrious firm of Waddell and Harrington Bridges. This design allowed the entire center span to lift in a vertical direction to allow tall oil equipment to pass through, especially Gulf Oil Company's <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pile_driver.html" title="Pile driver">pile driver</a>. This design was invented in 1893 and was successfully introduced in Chicago with the South Halsted Street Bridge. The Caddo Lake Drawbridge is a direct descendent of this structure.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1941, just prior to World War II, the United States Army held maneuvers in and around Mooringsport as a means of preparing the soldiers for war. During the maneuvers, Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S. Patton came to Mooringsport and led the Red and Blue armies in the "capture" of the bridge. They also bombed the bridge with sacks of flour.</p>
<p>In the mid 1940's, ownership of the bridge was transferred away from Caddo Parish to the Louisiana Department of Highways {LA Department of Transportation &amp; Development-DOTD}. Shortly after the transfer, the Department of Highways realized that there was no longer a need for the bridge to open. Consequently, the concrete counterweights were removed from the bridge's tower and dropped in the lake.</p>
<p><br />
THE SAVING ENDEAVOR: In the late 1970's due to the narrow width of the bridge, the flow of vehicular traffic was changed to one alternating lane. At this time, the DOTD determined that the useful life of the bridge had been exhausted and it was time to consider its replacement. In 1989, the DOTD received funds from the Federal Highway Administration for a bridge replacement project. The project called for the construction of a new two lane bridge approximately fifty feet to the east of the old bridge. The construction proposal also called for the old bridge to be destroyed when the new one was completed. A citizen's campaign was launched with involvement of Local, State and Federal officials and political leaders. The objective was to save the Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge and convert its use into a pedestrian walkway, landmark, and tourist attraction. After two years of negotiations, the DOTD and the Federal Highway Administration agreed to use the funds appropriated for removing the structure to refurbish the bridge instead. This agreement was made with the stipulation that Caddo Parish agrees to assume ownership and liability. On June 26, 1991, the Caddo Parish Commissioners voted to accept the bridge into the Caddo Parish Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>
<p>On July 24, 1991, The Historic American Engineering Record {U.S. Dept. of the Interior/National Park Service} rendered their evaluation of the bridge. The evaluation indicated that the bridge is nationally significant due to its designer, its unique design, and the fact that it is the sole surviving example of this bridge type in the State of Louisiana. With this determination, the bridge was eligible to be presented for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Due to a unique state law that forbad the application process, this was delayed until ownership changed.</p>
<p>After the bridge was cleaned, painted and barricaded to vehicular traffic, ownership of the bridge was transferred back to the Parish of Caddo on October 3, 1995. A rededication ceremony was held in Mooringsport later that month to mark the saving of the town's chief landmark and to honor those who had contributed to the endeavor. On June 4, 1996, a public hearing was held in Baton Rouge by the State's Review Committee regarding nomination of the bridge to the National Register of Historic Places. On October 18, 1996, the Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge was officially entered into the National Register of Historic Places under the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.</p>

This is a concept found in Roman law that described the civil law that applied to Roman citizens. The jus civile was combined with the "jus gentium" (the law of nations) to form the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman civil law. All this happened during the rule of the Emperor Justinian (482-565).</p>

Each week, two teams of 5 to 7 players (although only 5 may be actively playing at one time, one of these a "Wild Card," more on that later) face questions posed by host Wayne Faligowski. Once the regular season is completed, the top eight highest-scoring teams advance to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Each team is spotted 2,000 points to start the game. Host Faligowski checks the five categories for the first half, and one is chosen at random. Faligowski then asks five questions in that category. Each question is worth a pre-stated number of points; within a category, two questions are worth 10 points each, two are worth 20 each, and one is worth 40. All questions are "toss-ups" (that is, players must buzz in to answer); a correct answer earns the points for that question, while wrong answers cost the same amount.</p>
<p>One of the players on each team is designated the "wild card." The wild card player may buzz in just like any other player, except that a wild card's signal takes precedence over any other signal except the other wild card (as such, this is termed a "steal"). Each wild card can only steal three times during the course of the half, and a failed steal attempt causes a loss of twice the point value of the question.</p>
<p>The categories are played in a random order, and after all five categories are played, the half is over. Substitutions may be made at halftime, and the wild card is always changed.</p>
<p>The second half is played the same as the first half, except that there is an added "mystery category," represented by a line of question marks. The mystery category is always the last category played, and the point values for the mystery category are doubled (to two 20-point questions, two 40-pointers, and one 80-pointer). After the mystery category is played out, the team with the highest score wins the game.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all players receive calculators and movie rentals. Teams who advance to the playoffs are treated to a riverboat cruise, and the final winners receive $3,000 for their school.</p>

<p>Flowing in Policy debate is debater shorthand. It has evolved into a system of symbols that denote longer words. A policy debate is flowed on sheets of paper in vertical columns. That is, the first speech is the first column going down a page. The next speaker's answers are written in the next column, lining up horizontally with the initial argument. A judge flows each round, keeping track of all of the arguments. This aids in the decision-making procedure at the end of the round.</p>
<p>Basic Procedure:</p>
<p>Each off-case argument (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disadvantage.html" title="Disadvantage">disadvantage</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterplan.html" title="Counterplan">counterplan</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kritik.html" title="Kritik">kritik</a>) etc. is flowed on its own sheet of paper. Any case debate is flowed on the sheet of paper where the judge flowed the 1AC.</p>
<p>Many symbols and nomenclature are used to quickly note what is being said.</p>
<p>(S) (circled S) is solvency (!) Is the Impact (L) is a link w/o is without o/w is outweighs L/T is a Link turn NU is a non-unique U is unique I/L is an internal Link DA is a disad CP is a counterplan NB is the net-benefit to a counterplan -&gt; leads to, or yields ^ (up arrow) increases, more, etc.</p>
<p>Common Abbreviations this year: WOT - war on terror (a common DA) WOD - War on Drugs PA - patriot act BCS - body cavity search</p>
<p>A circle with a slash through it (similar to the "empty set" symbol in mathematics) is used to denote a negation, such as "not" or "isn't"</p>
<p>Example: Supppose a debater says "Increased proliferation doesn't lead to nuclear war." A debater may flow that as " ^ prolif. (/) -&gt; nuc-War."</p>

<p>"The Banner of Equal Rights" was the banner of the city democrats of Philadelphia in 1828. William Heighton was a common shoemaker who became the leader of the Philadelphia Working Man's Party. The Panic of 1819 accelerated the process of subdividing manufacturing and increasing industrialization. Unskilled workers filled the factories, pushing skilled workers away and bringing longer hours and smaller wages to all. William Heighton organized the skilled journeyman into the Mechanics Union of Trade Associations (MUTA). This was the first citywide organization of journeyman in America. MUTA succesfully used strikes to improve wages and hours for journeyman. This orginzation greatly improved worker influence and rights for skilled workers. However, Heighton's orginzation did not help, in fact purposfully hurt, women, children, blacks, and unskilled workers, who were viewed as a threat to journeyman. Heighton was the portrait of a self-made man. He was an English immigrant who became a wage-working shoemaker, who later became a leader of men, and a celebrity throught taverns and commoners. Heighton was greatly influenced by John Gray.</p>

He appears on stage to accompany Jeff with the vocals to MC5's song Kick Out The Jams. However, he only remains on stage for a fraction of the song before he decides to dive of the stage into the audience. Whether he was caught or not remains a mystery. However, with the knowledge that it was a Jeff Buckley concert we can probably safely assume that he was not. Indeed, there is a general consensus amongst music critics that stage diving during Jeff is just not on.</p>

<p><i>WHO MADE THE NEANDERTHAL FLUTE?</i></p>
<p>Found in 1995 by Ivan Turk in Slovenia, at the Divje Babe site, the juvenile cave bear femur bone, known as the <b>Divje Babe flute</b>, was a major find of recent times.</p>
<p>The reason for that was because it provided powerful evidence that Neanderthals were the equal of other humans in the evolution of humankind. It was also the oldest known musical instrument, and the first known instance of a diatonic musical scale sequence.</p>
<p>But no sooner than it was found, in 1998 the theory was put forward, most notably by taphonomist Francesco d'Errico et al, as well as Phillip Chase and April Nowell, that the bone, with 4 holes in a line, was not a flute, but was a natural object fashioned by random bites from carnivores.</p>
<p>The debate was on. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Fink_3972.html" title="Bob Fink">Bob Fink</a> wrote an essay the year before claiming the bone's holes were "consistent with four notes of the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatonic.html" title="Diatonic">diatonic</a> (do, re, mi) scale," based on the spacing of those four holes. The spacing of the holes on a modern diatonic flute (minor scale) are unique, and not evenly spaced. In essence, they are like a simple fingerprint. The Divje Babe bone's holes matched those spacings very closely. D'Errico et al never consulted a musicologist and never noticed that the holes mirrored the spacing of a world-wide musical scale sequence. He also never addressed the cause of the 4 holes being lined-up, and being of approximately equal diameters.</p>
<p>Others entered the debate, and the archaeological and paleo-anthropological community was split.</p>
<p>The bone has become a noted attraction in its Slovenian museum, touted on official Slovenian websites and is a source of pride in Slovenia. In the West, numerous painting were made, models fashioned, and musicians have played them at conventions of flutists and of scientists. New books on related subjects have since been published, including the bone as the oldest flute known.</p>
<p>While taphonomists disagree about the bone's marks, others just looking at the flute can see clearly that it looks virtually identical to any other flute of prehistoric times. But some taphonomists tend to dismiss "looks" or <i>prima facie</i> evidence. Is there any way to prove or give a high degree of probability to whether this object is really a flute or just a miraculous accident?</p>
<p>Among the people writing on this matter are IvanTurk, who found the bone, Bob Fink, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Otte_2417.html" title="Marcel Otte">Marcel Otte</a> and others. Fink was invited to write a rebuttal published in <i>Studies in Music Archaeology III</i> (proceedings of a world conference on music archaeology) in which he outlined a probability analysis on whether it was reasonable to believe the bone was an accident.</p>
<p>Without using any complicated diagrams, or complex mathematics, or relying on knowledge of music and musical terms, Fink's view, which is presented below, can be easily understood regarding the approximate probability of this object being made by nature or carnivores randomly biting holes into it. Some evidence summarized from the findings of Ivan Turk, et al., and with links to more reading, is also listed.</p>
<p>In summary, Fink's view is that the coincidence we are asked to believe for such a natural origin to the object becoming a "flute look-alike" (with a known scale sequence to boot) beggars the imagination, bordering on miraculous. He believes it is far more probable the object is a flute, made by Neanderthals. Opponents have not offered any contrary explanation (as of 2006) for this object looking so much like a flute.</p>
<p>First let's look at a picture of O's to represent holes: In the Divje Babe flute, we have these holes (approx):</p>
<p>O________O________O____O</p>
<p>namely, they are lined-up, but not equally-spaced apart from each other. The first three are more or less equally spaced, and the 4th hole is about half the distance found between the others.</p>
<hr />
<pre>
         THE LINE OF REASONING ABOUT THE DIVJE BABE BONE:
</pre>
<p>A. Now that we see the unequal spacing, one can ask:</p>
<pre>
    <i>What does that unequal spacing mean? If anything?</i>
</pre>
<p>B. Since the holes are not equally spaced, one normally can answer:</p>
<pre>
    <i>It suggests a *random* arrangement. Why? Because</i> 
    <i>natural or chance measurements are usually noted for</i>
    <i>being unequal and patternless -- normally.</i>
</pre>
<p>C. So it seemed to d'Errico, et al, to be a random, naturally-caused spacing. That's where d'Errico et al, stopped their inquiry.</p>
<p>D. If the holes <i>had been</i> equally spaced, then that is notably a characteristic attached usually to human designs. Why? Again, nature only rarely comes up with equal spacing. -- And not all the holes were equally-spaced apart, as all can see.</p>
<p>E. The unequal spacing cannot, however, be assumed <i>automatically</i> to be random, because of this: The holes are <i>also</i> as agreed by all:</p>
<pre>
    1. <i>LINED-UP</i>, four in a row, and also

    2. have similar sized diameters and

    3. are nearly all circular,
</pre>
<pre>
    4. and like a flute, the holes fit the size of fingertips, 
    and exist on a hollow-bore cylindrical bone.
</pre>
<p>F. Those latter four facts normally indicate human design and therefore do not square with the assumption that the other fact, which is the unequal spacing, is "random or chance-caused."</p>
<p>G. So we <i>must</i> now ask:</p>
<pre>
    <i>Is the unequal spacing really random, or does it actually </i>
    <i>match some purpose, after all?</i>
</pre>
<p>H. 1997: Fink pointed out in his essay <a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <i>The Neanderthal Flute</i>, that the spacing matched that of a musical minor scale on a simple flute, which anyone could see by looking at any simple flute if made in the minor key. So the next question now must be:</p>
<pre>
    <i>How </i>likely<i> is that match?</i>
</pre>
<p>I. It can be shown (see below) there are several million other different ways to place 4 holes on the barrel of that bone, <i>all suggesting nothing, not lined-up, and having no match to any spacing pattern known.</i> Mathematically, then, the answer to that question is:</p>
<pre>
    <i>One chance in millions that Divje's hole spacings, </i>
    <i>and the four holes lined-up, and the other facts listed, </i>
    <i>could </i>all<i> occur by </i>accident<i>, or chance, or be </i>
    <i>caused from four </i>separate<i> carnivore bites.</i>

</pre>
<p>J. <i>Undisputed fact</i>: No two or more holes could've been made by one bite, because the spacings do not match ANY animal's teeth-pattern. This is admitted by Nowell and Chase in their <i>Current Anthroplogy</i> article in the Aug-Oct 1998 issue.</p>
<p>Therefore: The object is a flute or a miracle or coicidence.</p>
<pre>
         THE SIMPLE CALCULATION FINK PUBLISHED 
</pre>
<p>On a cylinder about the size of the Divje Babe bone, four holes can be made. If any one or more of the holes is moved 1/4 inch up or down it will making the 4 holes go out-of-line.</p>
<p>Or, if one or more holes is moved left or right the same amount, then the holes can assume about 640 spacing patterns that signify nothing known or purposeful.</p>
<p>On the up-down movement of any one hole: There are about 10 places around that bone diameter for a hole to be moved out-of-line. That's 10 ways to be out of line just moving one hole.</p>
<p>As there are 4 holes that each could be placed up or down 10 different ways, that gives this the calculation, as follows, using normal probability multiplication:</p>
<p>10 times 10 times 10 times 10, which equals 10,000 ways for the 4 holes, as a set, to be <i>out of line</i>, or NOT like a flute.</p>
<p>As said, keeping the 4 holes in line, but now moving one or more holes left or right, there are about 600 to 640 ways for holes to be spaced left or right so that no spacing is like any of the other spacings (even while the 4 holes are still lined-up). For clarity, here are five examples pictured below:. (The vertical lines represent the ends of the unbroken femur bone):</p>
<pre>
    1.   |       0  0     0 0          |    
   
    2.   |      0     00   0           |
</pre>
<pre>
    3.   |          0 0   0      0     |
</pre>
<pre>
    4.   |    0     0    0 0           |
</pre>
<pre>
    5.   |    0       0 0          0   |
</pre>
<p>Proceeding in this manner, about 640 various spacings can be similarly made that do not repeat, nor signify anything in particular regarding usefulness or purpose of the spacings. Only a few would match a musical scale formation or be equally spaced. [The standard formula used was 17!/(14! 3!) = 680. Less 40 or so that would match other scales or parts of scales, etc.]</p>
<p>So now, the calculation continues:</p>
<p>We now multiply the 10,000 by 640, giving us 6,400,000 or close to 7 million ways in which random arrangements of 4 holes moved up or down, or left and right, can appear on a bone, or any cylinder, without repeating any pattern twice, and without looking like a flute with lined-up holes spaced like a known world-wide musical scale sequence (do, re, mi, fa).</p>
<p>There is also the fact reported by Turk's monograph of 1998 that the holes are all similar diameters; all fitting a fingertip; all circular instead of oval (like most carnivore bites would appear if the holes were made that way); all in the proper ratio of bore size to hole size found in most flutes; and all on the kind of bone (femur) usually used for ancient flutes. One may not easily calculate all the additional odds for the existence of those facts instead of something less orderly, but if calculations were made, the odds that chance biting of holes (one-at-a-time) in a bone producing a look-alike flute, consistent with a diatonic scale sequence, could reach into being only a one-in-trillions chance event.</p>
<p>The taphonomists Turk et al, do not agree with d'Errico et al. But the <i>prima facie</i> evidence instead appears sufficient and overwhelming. The tooth spans of many animals were checked by all concerned to see if any of them could bite such a hole or two holes at once. If they had found a match to any animals, that would've been cited as evidence that carnivores made the object. No holes matched any animal's tooth span. "Except for one animal" says Fink: "The human animal -- who 'bit' the holes of a musical scale into that bone, making it an artifact, not an accident."</p>
<p>Turk conducted laboratory experiments which pierced holes in fresh bear bones in the manner of carnivore punctures, and in every case, the bones split. The Divje Babe holes round, and not oval, and Turk says, in his website and in his article in MIT's <i>Origins of Music</i> anthology, the bone shows no "counterbites" expected on the other side of the bone matching the immense pressure necessary to make the holes. Yet the bone did not break in the Divje Babe instance, a fact not matching expectations of carnivore efforts, as Turk's experimentation showed.</p>
<p>So why has this object been resisted so strongly about being declared a flute made by Neanderthals, and also the oldest known instrument and the first instance known of a diatonic scale sequence? Perhaps one needs to look at the deeply held investments in the views held by different camps regarding the capacities of Neanderthals (and by musicologists regarding the "Westerness" of the diatonic scale). As Marcel Otte (director of the museum of Prehistoire, Universitie de Liege, Belgium) pointed out in the April 2000 <i>Current Anthropology,</i> if this bone was unearthed at a <i>homo sapiens</i> site, instead of a Neanderthal or Moussterian site, it would have been named a flute in a flash.</p>

<p>The equation of a Straight Line ig given as</p>
<pre>
                                   <b>y = mx + c</b>       
           or                   <b>∆y = m ∆x</b>
</pre>
<p>The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) is a scan-conversion line algorithm based on calculating either ∆y or ∆x, using the following equations</p>
<pre>
                                   <b>∆y = m ∆x</b>                
                                <b>∆x = ∆y/m</b>                
</pre>
<p>We sample the line at a unit intervals in one coordinate and determine corresponding integer values nearest the line path for the other coordinate.</p>
<p>Consider first a line with positive slope. If the slope is less than or equal to 1, we sample at unit x intervals (<b>∆x = 1</b>) and compute each successive y value as</p>
<pre>
                                   <b>y</b>k+1 <b>= y</b>k <b>+ m</b>
</pre>
<p>Subscript k takes integer values starting from 1, for the first point, and increases by 1 until the final end point is reached. Since m can be any real number between 0 and 1, the calculated y values must be rounded to the nearest integer.</p>
<p>For lines with a positive slope greater than 1, we reverse the roles of x and y. That is, we sample at unit y intervals (<b>∆y = 1</b>) and calculate each succeeding x values as</p>
<pre>
                                   <b>x</b>k+1<b> = x</b>k <b>+ 1/m</b>
</pre>
<p>These equations are based on the assumption that lines are to be processed from the left endpoint to the right end point. If this processing is reversed, so that the starting endpoint is at the right, then we either have <b>∆x = -1</b> or <b>∆y = -1</b>.</p>

<p>Vibroacoustic Therapy (VAT) is the common denominator for all therapies which are using sound wave transfered to the whole body, or parts of the body, in order to obtain increased well-being. VAT is used as the main effective feature in many products under different generic names. Although the healing effect of sounds and music have been known in folk medicine for thousands of years, VAT in its modern form (using lodspeakers or acoustic transducers) was first introduced by Olav Skille, Norway in 1980. The main target group was children with multiple handicaps, and the first observed effects were reduction of spasms in children with Cerebral Palsy. Since then many different fields of use have been discovered by many research projects from all over the world.</p>

<p>Lynx Edicions, founded in 1989, is a publishing house dedicated primarily to publishing books on ornithology and natural history. It was founded with the main objective of publishing the Handbook of the Birds of the World, a 16-volume work which is currently published on a yearly basis and of which by December 2005 the first ten volumes are already available.</p>
<p>The Handbook of the Birds of the World is managed, edited and published entirely in Barcelona, from where it is marketed and distributed to over 150 countries. It is an innovative and unique work, the first ever to deal with all the bird species in the world (and their most distinctive subspecies) in detail and with complete illustrations and photographs. Each volume is produced with the participation of preeminent specialists from different countries who have specialized in each of the families. This emphasis on technical expertise has resulted in the coordination of an international team of authors and illustrators from the publishing house. The first volume appeared in 1992 and that same year it was recognised as the Bird book of the year, a prize given by two prestigious British publications, British Birds and BirdWatch. These same two publications awarded the prize once more in 2002 for Volume 7 of the Handbook of the Birds of the World.</p>
<p>The Handbook of the Birds of the World is directed mainly towards the scientific community. As it has grown to become a high-level international project, many world experts have endorsed it and have been incorporated into its team of writers. The scientific media and many specialized journals have recognized the Handbook as the foremost work of international ornithology, a claim which many channels in the national and international media have confirmed repeatedly.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing the Handbook, in its 15 years of existence Lynx Edicions has also published over 50 books in four different languages (Spanish, Catalan, French and English). Lynx Edicions www.hbw.com (being renovated at present)</p>

<p>Born in Havana City, Cuba October 24, 1963.</p>
<p>Josignacio has defined and drawn attention to a famous generation of young Cuban artists called by the critics as “The Generation of the 80’s” (The most rebel of all). His own technique “Plastic-paint Medium” and his controversial body of work have redefined international expectations in Contemporary Cuban Art. Josignacio, who grew up in Cuba, (is also often credited); with helping to refocus the Cuban contemporary art world from his native Havana to the Art World of Miami, USA, the city he adopted after defecting in 1989.</p>
<p>His work has, (almost more than any other artist of his generation), became familiar via the media, particularly following his Hortt 38 Best in Show award wined in 1996, in the Museum of Art of Fort Lauderdale [an event that, at least in some ways, he relishes and uses].</p>
<p>Josignacio has addressed the exchange in his own Erotic-Porno-Shows, which confronts the relationship between Art and Sex in a wide range of “aesthetical-perception” from merely crude-explicit-figurative to an almost abstract manifestation, his work frequently reflects the world that surrounds him via “The Media and News”, the real life of Miami and his own.</p>
<p>His controversial shows named “Marihuana”, “The Miami Clowns”, “Liquid Sex”, “Hot Sex At your own Risk”, and his “Live Collages” are some of the “Hits that heated the Miami art scene”.</p>
<p>Josignacio is an “obsessive-compulsive-worker”, proof of that is the amount of personal shows (more than twenty in almost two years!) he did in Havana from his first one in march 2, 1987 to his definitive departure to Mexico may 10 , 1989. Slowing it down in Miami because his economical situation only aloud him to survive. Despite of this, he has not stopped creating his works.</p>
<p>Josignacio’s peculiar technique and his unique form to use it have derived a new visual effect, which have been a topic of study for many art students and art critics (some of them called “NEWISM”).</p>
<p>Josignacio’s work consists in a group of series, which he has maintained open for more than 20 years. Some of them are Dualism Series, Abstract Series, Erotic Series, Tauromaquia Series, etc.</p>
<p>Josignacio has been described as “The artistic representative of the Plastic Era” by Jose Antonio Portuondo, renowned Cuban intellectual, “Josignacio is a revolution inside The Revolution” by Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and “Josignacio is a Natural Born Abstract”, by Dr. Kenwood W Moffett director of Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>“…If God is everywhere and everywhere you find my art, then we have a lot in common….” - One of Josignacio’s reflections. Josignacio resides in Miami Beach, Florida</p>

<p>I am color...blind, Coffee black and egg white, Pull me out from inside, I am ready, I am ready, I am ready, I am...</p>

<p>I am covered in skin, No one gets to come in, Pull me out from inside, I am folded, and unfolded, and unfolding...</p>

<p>[[Crane Industries, NBC's <i>Italic text</i>Passions<i>Italic text</i>]].</p>
<p>Crane Industries is the business that serves as the principal employer for the Crane family on NBC daytime's popular seven-year running soap <i>Italic text</i>Passions<i>Italic text</i>. Based out of Harmony, Maine (the principal setting for <i>Italic text</i>Passions<i>Italic text</i>), Crane Industries is headed by the ruthless and powerful Alistair Crane, portrayed on-screen by John O'Reilly since January 2005. Prior to late 2004, Alistair's son Julian, played by the superb Ben Masters since 1999, presided over dealings at Crane Industries. However, since Julian's moral turnaround from American playboy to perfect gentleman, Alistair has deemed his son not ruthless enough to control the company. The enterprise's legal counsel is Ethan Winthrop (portrayed by Eric Martsolf, 2002-present), the disinherited son of Julian's first wife Ivy Winthrop (portayed by Kim Johnston Ulrich, 1999-present), who believed he was Julian's son until his wife Gwen Hotchkiss (played by Liza Huber, 1999-present) exposed his true paternity to the tabloid <i>Italic text</i>Daily Private Lives<i>Italic text</i>, revealing that he was not of Crane blood. However, Ethan has continued to serve as the attorney for the company. In 2002, when spitfire Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald (Lindsay Hartley, 1999-present) and Julian accidentally wound up married, Theresa made herself CEO of Crane Industries so she would prevent Ethan from getting any position at Crane. However, after stepping down, power returned to Alistair and Julian. Julian's two sons, Foxworth 'Fox' Crane (portrayed by Justin Hartley since 2002) and Chad Harris (portrayed by Charles Divins since 2002), also work at the company. Two new additions to Crane Industries include Kay Bennett, who works as her boyfriend Fox's secretary, and scheming Valerie Davis (played by Daphnee Duplaix Samuel since December 2004), who is the executive assistant to Fox and Chad, but is trying to get closer to Fox and push Fox and Kay further apart.</p>

<p>Absolute value equations are those which include absolute values in the terms of the equation. They are strict binomials: they will always produce two answers: this is because to solve an absolute value equation, you will eventually have to split it into a negative and a positive scenario, because we do not know the sign of x and the absolute value bars would remove it anyway. The simplest of the absolute value equations is |x|=x. This simply states that the absolute value of x is x. A more complex equation would be 5|x-4|+18=2. To solve this, you must first isolate the absolute value term. First, you would subtract 18 from the entire formula to receive 5|x-4|=-16. Second, you would divide both sides by 5. You would receive: |x-4|=-16/5. Now you must split the equation: you should receive x-4=-16/5, 16/5. Now you work with these two answers. You simply add 4 to each term (for the fractions +20/5). Your answers become 4/5, 36/5. Should you have more than one absolute value term in an equation, you skip from binomials to general polynomials. If in function notation, these equations can be solved by graphing. Where the same y value corresponds to two different x values, you have found your answers.</p>

<p>The Mary Erskine School is an all girls school in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The majority of its pupils live in the surrounding area (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midlothian.html" title="Midlothian">Midlothian</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fife.html" title="Fife">Fife</a>) but boarding facilities are available. The school is non-denominational but claims to have a broadly Christian outlook.</p>
<p>The school is linked with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart%27s_Melville_College_358a.html" title="Stewart's Melville College">Stewart's Melville College</a> ("SMC") an all boys private school which is located approximately one mile (2 km) from the MES campus. Together MES and SMC have a co-educational Junior School which caters for pupils from 3 to 11 years old. The Junior School is split between the MES campus and the SMC campus. There is also a nursery school which feeds into the Junior School.</p>
<p>Although the school is single sex, many activities, although not teaching, are carried out jointly with the boys from SMC. The sixth year of the school is largely co-educational, partially as an attempt to wean the children into a mixed sex world and partially because of the reduced roll in this year.</p>

<p>Timothy Kang was born in Korea. He is the average Korean guy. This means that he owns a dry-cleaning store, has a black-belt in Karate, eats vast amounts of rice on a daily basis, takes computers apart and puts them back together in his spare time, and fears Godzilla.</p>
<p>Tim Kang's name is not really that Korean. If it were like "Ping-Pong", then he would be even more Korean, but alas it is not.</p>

<p>The Lincoln Review Letter has been commenting—for some 30 years—on matters of interest to black American thinkers from the vantage point of a conservative pioneer, editor-publisher Jay Parker of Great Falls, VA. Mr. Parker is also one of the nation’s leaders in charity work, having held the top posts over many years with Davis Memorial Goodwill Industries (DC), the Light House for the Blind, the Salvation Army and the Downtown Kiwanis Club of Washington, DC. He is also a syndicated radio broadcaster of commentaries. The views expressed by Mr. Parker, of course, are not necessarily those of the Community Forum or its officers and Board of Directors, but do reflect conservative thinking among increasing numbers of thoughtful Americans in the mainstream of U.S. economic, political and social life.</p>

<p>Anal Fuckticular II (born in 1928) is an American bop and hard bop tenor saxophonist. Like many other successful musicians from Chicago, he studied music at DuSable High School under Walter Dyett. Griffin, was reputed to be the 'World's Fastest Saxophonist' in the jazz idiom, though as he aged, and as the jazz audience declined, this accolade has all but disappeared. In the 1940s and 1950s he worked in Lionel Hampton's and Joe Morris's bands, in the Jazz Messengers, and in the Thelonious Monk Quartet. From 1960 to 1962 he and Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis led their own group. Having felt he had achieved much in the USA, his pinnacle on record arguably the 1957 Blowin' session on the Bluenote label with fellow tenor John Coltrane, he moved to Europe. He lived in France in 1963, moving to the Netherlands in 1978, and he still continues to record and tour.</p>

IKEv2 To the editor: This text is only a very brief summary of IKEv2. The IKE v2 RFC was published this Winter and so it's hot off the press. Hopefully this summary will be replaced with a more complete article once people have had time to study the new RFC in detail.</p>
<p>Regards, anon.</p>
<hr />
<p>IKE is a method of establishing a security association between two communicating parties; usually the security association is in essence a key used to encrypt or authenticate communications.</p>
<p>Basically, IKEv2 is a simplified version of IKEv1. The basic IKEv1 protocol consists of three exchanges between the two parties that wish to set up a security association. In the first exchange one party proposes various parameters for the security association and the other party accepts one of the proposals, or terminates the protocol session. Typical parameters are the encryption algorithm that is to be used and the key size. In the second exchange the communicants exchange further information required to set up the security association using the now agreed parameters. The security association is then established and the last exchange is used to check that the security association is working properly. For example if an encryption algorithm has been agreed in the first two exchanges then the third exchange is encrypted under that algorithm.</p>
<p>IKEv2 accomplishes in two exchanges what IKEv1 does in three by using only one exchange to agree parameters instead of two.</p>
<p>The terminology used in the IKEv2 RFC is less abstract than that in v1 and this should be a substantial improvement. IKEv1 was vague on numerous important points and this caused incompatibility between systems and headaches for implementers trying to undertand what the standard meant in real terms.</p>
<p>The publication of IKEv2 coincides with a revision of the IP security (IPsec) architecture, of which IKE is a central component.</p>

<p>The leaders of all of the Five Civilized Tribes signed treaties with the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a> at the start of the Civil War. Many of the tribal members, however, did not support the Confederacy, and, not being organized, were driven from Indian Territory with a large loss of life. Most fled to Kansas and Missouri. Many of the "Loyal" Indians volunteered for Union duty in order to get control back from the Confederate generals. The Indian Home Guard regiments fought mostly in Indian Territory and Arkansas. It was mainly due to these Loyal Indians that the Five Civilized Tribes were able to retain any of their lands following the end of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Rodney P is a Battersea born MC who entered the UK hip hop scene in the 1980s. He started out as a member of the London posse, one of the UK's first home grown hip hop acts who were highly influential in the development of the genre. Rodney P has had one of the longest and most respected careers in UK hip hop. Also known as riddim killa, he cites the reggae he heard while growing up as a second-generation West Indian immigrant as an influence on his dub-heavy music.</p>
<p><br />
In 1986 The London Posse were invited by Mick Jones of The Clash to support his new band Big Audio Dynamite on a UK tour.. A recording contract with Big Life records followed, and Rodney P went on to support hip-hop heavyweights NWA and Soul II soul in the early nineties.</p>
<p>The decision to guard his creative control led to the birth of his own label Riddim killa, a collaboration with Low Life, one of the rapidly growing scene’s leading labels. He was introduced to DJ Skitz by a mutual friend from the Deal Real workshop in the West End, and appears on Skitz’s albums Countryman and Homegrown volume 1. The pair now host a show on the BBC’s 1Xtra radio station, a leading black music network. This development in his career led to involvement in radio documentaries, including a programme recorded in Johannesburg about the aftermath of Apartheid.</p>
<p>His other recordings include tracks with high profile DJs and producers such as The Nextmen, Mystro and Plus One, and alongside fellow MCs Roots Manuva, Skinnyman and Dynamite MC. His open-minded attitude to music is demonstrated in his collaborations with dance acts Roni Size and Freq Nasty, and even more surprisingly with Bjork and Nitin Sawney. He continues to dominate the live scene as one of the most sought after artists, taking the mic both on the UK circuit and with his contemporaries from across the Atlantic. Recent appearances include the MF Prince's Trust Concert with Jay-Z and Alicia Keys and the United Nations Habitat Charity Concert alongside Jazzy Jeff, Dead Prez and Mos Def, as well as regular appearance’s at London’s legendary Fabric live nights.</p>

<p><b>Marios Varvoglis</b> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek</a>: Μάριος Βάρβογλης) (<a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>) was a Greek <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> of the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Era_9030.html" title="Modern Era">Modern Era</a>. He studied music at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatoire_de_Paris_fce2.html" title="Conservatoire de Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a> and the Schola Cantorum with Leroux, Caussade, d'Indy and others. He remained in Paris until 1920 and he maintained close relations with artistic circles that included Casella, Ravel, Varèse and Modigliani who painted Varvoglis portrait (Le beau Marius) in 1919-1920. After 1920 he taught at the Athens conservatory and he became active as a music critic and conductor. He was persecuted for his liberal political views and, after the war, he was imprisoned in a British concentration camp.</p>
<p>As a composer, he belonged to the Greek national school but the French influence in the style and structure of his works is obvious. Varvoglis wrote orchestra works, chamber music, solo piano music, one opera etc.</p>
