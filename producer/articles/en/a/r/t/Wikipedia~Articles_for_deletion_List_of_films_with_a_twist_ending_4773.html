<p><b>Delete</b> - grouping films by what sort of ending they have is indiscriminate.

<li><b>Delete</b>. <s>Please stop already with the indiscriminate arguments for these lists! Or, if the same argument is going to be used on all of these article, do a mass nomination.</s> This list is <i>potentially</i> verifiable, but I think it would be <i>extremely</i> difficult to do. However, I agree with <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> that the inclusion criteria are too broad. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:15, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I have noted in at least two other of these AFDs in response to similar comments, a mass nomination of these articles would have been extremely impractical. Trying to talk about 20-some articles nominated together would result in chaos and confusion and would undoubtedly lead to a closure with instruction to re-nominate individually. These nominations seem to be going smoothly enough, not sure what the grounds for complaint about them is. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I do agree that a mass nomination of &gt;20 articles would be confusing, but nomination of 3-5 related articles (as the arguments against all are essentially the same) would cut down on the number of separate debates where separate and/or distinct points may be raised. In any case, my main complaint is not the separate nominations, but the blanket application of the "indiscriminate" criticism (that is, of course, your prerogative and I don't think it was in bad-faith; I simply disagree). I voted to delete in a number of cases based on "loose association", voted to delete in a number of cases based on other reasons, and voted to keep in a number of cases because I did not think the criticisms were applicable and/or grounds for deletion (vs. improvement). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:33, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"Indiscriminate" was not blanket-applied to all of the nominations. No single criterion was applied to every one of the nominations, as various of the articles present different issues. I recently mass-nominated around seven or eight articles for million-dollar winners from Who Wants to be a Millionaire and the nomination was shut down because it was a group nom. I can't think of a group of articles that are much more closely related than those, but they were considered too diverse to consider together. I did not want to go through the hassle of mass-nominating the articles only to have to repeat the work after it got shut down. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I can certainly understand your desire to avoid a mass nom. In all fairness, you <i>did</i> provide different comments for each nomination. However, there was also a significant degree of similarity between a number of the nominations (for example, a dozen of them (+/- a few) started out by citing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and then stating that "a list of every time X has appeared in a film is indiscriminate"). In any case, I agree that <i>this</i> article deserves to be deleted; my comment was to express my frustration with some of the other nominations. However, it is still your prerogative as the nominator whether you do them together or separately.

<li>I don't mind that they were nominated for deletion separately - I actually prefer it that way. However, the canned statements at the beginning made it look like <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> hadn't considered each article's problems and merits individually, and had just been impatient to sweep them all out of the way. However, it only looked like that to people who knew how many substantially identical AfDs were being launched with that same canned statement. To the casual debate participant, it might have appeared as if <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s canned statement was not canned. That fact is likely to ruffle some feathers, as has happened, because some may feel that <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> was attempting to pull the wool over our eyes. It is easy to see how such an act could set off alarm bells, even though there is nothing actually wrong with it. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:40, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, I am becoming truly tired of your constant passive-aggressive, bat-your-eyelashes, skirt-the-edge-of-civility comments throughout these nominations. You've continually misrepresented my arguments and on at least one occasion have flat out spoken untruthfully, and your constant (completely wrong, by the way) speculation on my motives in nominating these articles and your implication (couched oh-so-carefully in "gosh, I can certainly see how <i>some</i> people might think he did something wrong" terms) that I have in some way acted improperly demonstrates your abject failure to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:30, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
