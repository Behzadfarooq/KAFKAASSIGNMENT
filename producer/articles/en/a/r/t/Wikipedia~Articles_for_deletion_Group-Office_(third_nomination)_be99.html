<dd>I agonised over this. And changed my mind twice. But there is no consensus to delete. It seems that the existence of the thing is verifiable. Thus the barebones of WP:V are satisfied. What isn't satisfied, is reliable sources that indicate notability. But ultimately WP:N and WP:WEB are guidelines. They indicate what wikipedia tends to keep or delete. They are descriptive not prescriptive. Unlike WP:V and WP:NPOV they do not trump consensus. It may well be, that this is the type of thing wikipedia tends to delete. It may well be that keeping it is inconsistent. But, that consideration is not enough to force a deletion in the absence of consensus. Brenneman made a good case, and frustratingly, many of the keepers focused on the re-nomination rather than refuting its reasoning (bad!). But, on the other hand, I take Pschemp's point (and she did give reasons) that many of the keepers have previously given reasons. Brenneman's case for deletion is very strong, but the article does not appear to breach WP:V, and so it comes down to consensus. Brenneman has been unable to persuade a consensus of Wikipedians that the article should be deleted--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 01:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moving on from the ad hominum considering I <i>notified</i> you of this nomination:
<ol>
<li>Even if we accept that the single osnews piece is from a reliable source, it is not the required <b>multiple</b> published work.</li>
<li>The os news review is by Bob Minvielle (<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Bob+Minvielle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Bob+Minvielle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google</a>) whom appears to be just a guy who wrote in according to their <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=168" class="external text" title="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=168" rel="nofollow">Style Guide: How to Submit Articles,</a> which doesn't appear to match the concept of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> as I know it.</li>
<li>The review is on a small on-line forum, which is a far-cry from, for example, being reviewed in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired.html" title="Wired">Wired</a>. There are <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Awww.osnews.com+review&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Awww.osnews.com+review&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">lots</a> or reviews on OSnews and I don't think you're suggesting that we have articles on all of them.</li>
<li>The Open Source Industry Australia is a de facto press release for the <i>above</i> review, consisting of a forty word precis and a link to OS news. That's forty words out of 1,500, which I am staggered by suggestion that it's anything other than a trivial mention.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm sure that I sound like a broken record here what with asking that the guidelines be followed an all, but I'm simply not seeing the required coverage to demonstrate notability: I'm seeing an article built out of a single review and a lot of passion. It's entirely possible that I'm totally ignorant, but the way to change that is by presenting more facts. This article has been done over this three times now and I still see just the one.</dd>

<li><b>note to the above note</b> Someone expressed some confusion with my statement, so I guess I should clarify. I guess I can see how this may be seen as non-notable. However, it has passed an overturn at deletion review, and has apparently been nominated a few times since. This indicates to me that there is no clear community consensus on the topic, and that this is likely a content dispute that might be better worked out on a talk page than a deletion debate. Once something has been through the ringer once, I feel it is usually superfluous to re-nominate, though I can understand in this case there is some confusion over the actual consensus, so I don't hold any prejudice against the nominator, the topic may indeed be questionable enough that it warrents debate. The above statement was intended to state my belief that without a substantial reason for changing our collective minds, we should let it stand, otherwise we run the risk of endless AfD rounds that could get tiresome. Again, that's the general principle, in this case I'm not sure which takes precidence, a questionably notable topic or the prior case history. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think I see what you're saying, but in general I try to keep in mind that wikipedia's idea of "consensus" is often the comments of less than a dozen editors. Lots of stuff gets nominated and the discussion gets flooded by people from a message board, or policy gets blatantly ignored, or an admin closes too early, etc. etc. I have nominated several tenacious articles for deletion that had survived multiple previous attempts and I'll probably do it again.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Incredibly strong KEEP</b> What is wrong with us that we want to thrash out the same issue over and over? I think I smell something rotten in the state of Denmark. What do the editors who keep nominating this for deletion have to GAIN from deleting this? Sounds VERY mysterious to me. Once I can understand. Twice a bit iffy. But THREE times in short succession? I am outraged. I cannot believe this. What is the value of attacking someone who means well and who is trying to provide some valuable information about a product people obviously use? I often use Wikipedia as a trusted source to find out a little bit about different software packages. Sure there can be advertising contamination, but the nature of Wikipedia means that it is far less and far more balanced than many other sources; in fact than almost any other source. This really reeks. And I am disgusted that we would be trying to drive away productive members of our community. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Please reconsider what you are doing. Are you really that bent on destructive actions?--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 18:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a disinterested party, I am wondering why Wikipedia's rules and policies even permit an article to be renominated for deletion <b>less than two months</b> after a previous AfD vote was closed with a <i>keep</i>. At best, this nomination is questionable; at worst, it is destructive and disruptive. IMO those who are in favor of deleting this article should accept and respect the consensus of the most recent AfD for the time being. The time is definitely not ripe for a new nomination. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 19:08, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep and salt</b> The appropriateness of the article is obvious. N is clear from the number of the users, aand there are no problems reported with V. The article still had some traces of advertising language, and I removed some. Perhaps other supports can add some of the many reviews instead of just talking about them.

<li>I am absolutley unapologetic over renominating this article. It has no serious claim to notability, no citations from reliable sources, and despite it's many rounds through deletion discussions appears to continue to be defended based upon totally spurious grounds:</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>"I promised to quit"</li>
<li>"product people obviously use"</li>
<li>"this nomination is questionable"</li>
<li>"number of the users"</li>
<li>"abuse of Afd"</li>
<li>"keep"s without rational X 2</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Simply having <i>a lot</i> of inline citations doesn't solve the problem that this "little piece of software" appears from the evidence presented to be less article-worthy that <i>"Reaper, a An OpenGL based 3D-game, emphasizing stunning graphics and interesting algorithms."</i> or <i>"GQview, an image viewer for X windows."</i> If there were serious arguments presented that this satisfied our well-established guidelines, than this could concieveable come down to "consensus" via counting noses. But there are not, just a lot of shrieking. There has been very little effort to even <i><b>rebut</b></i> the deletion arguments, mostly just they are ignored. There may be some people involved here who should be ashamed, but it bloody well isn't me.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> A) It may be a little early to renominate this. B) While Mr. Brenneman may come off a tad too overzealous in this discussion, I can certainly understand his frustrations, as he presented a perfectly valid argument for deletion only to be met with several unfair statements and accusations regarding the deletion. C) This appears to be something that is being retained per "I like it," which I'm starting to notice isn't really all that uncommon, however D) I abstain from officially opining because I think what's needed here is for everyone to just step back, allow this article to have sufficient time to develop before renomination, on the condition that E) Rather than simply asserting how notable this is and waving hands at the deletion, perhaps people can work to improve and source the article per Wikipedia policy. If this is done, then there will not be a need for further nominations ever. If this is not done, however, then F) I resent the idea of "salting" this as it really goes in the face of ideas about bold editing, changing consensus, and, though perhaps biased, does not give due credit to someone with a very good history of sensible Wikipedia editing. GassyGuy 02:01, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds reasonable (especially the part about allowing the article to develop). I don't actually know what "salting" means, and Wiki doesn't <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Salt (disambiguation)">cough it up,</a> so I'm not sure what that fuss is about - apologizing for using a term without knowing its usage, that was stupid - I've seen it used when something keeps coming back, again and again. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 02:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Salting is usually meant as a form of page protection. I've never seen it use for keep pages before; it usually refers to the page that happens after something has been deleted multiple times. It results in that page that says something like "Wikipedia does not have an article on..." etc. I'm assuming in this case, it's meant as eliminating the possibility of ever renominating this. That possibility should be eliminated by addressing the nominator's concerns within the next several months, not by imposing some sort of arbitrary protection, in my opinion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just about every above reason to keep is invalid and based on either 'I like it', or 'it's been nomninated before!!!'. The topic lacks any evidence of notability, lacking multiple non-trivial references as per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The hand-wringing about 'oh my god, it's been nominated before!! RECENTLY!! are irrelevant. Two months ago is not particularly recent when the article is so fundamentally lacking in evidence for its assertions of notability, and voting 'keep' on procedural grounds because of this is disruptive, and ignorant of Wikipedia's requirements for verifiability (see that little message at the bottom of the editing window?) The article was only restored at DRV because DRV is a purely head-counting exercise, so is easily subverted, and this has some very dedicated people who want it kept regardless of basic fundamental <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm surprised that so many references on the article are not in English. Surely it should be possible to find something to back this up in the English language - this is the English language Wikipedia after all. I'm not persuauded that this article is properly verified and is based on reliable sources. Usually I would suggest giving an article some space to develop but for an articles 3rd nomination this is a pretty serious problem - these weaknesses should have been ironed out after the first nomination. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 15:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm the person who added those non-english sources last night, and I agree that more english sources are needed. However this software is predominantly used in Japan and Europe. Also, "group office" isnt a useful search term in english. So I specifically investigated its notability in the non-english world when I realised that most of the public installations (roughly <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22group+office%22+lost_password.php" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22group+office%22+lost_password.php" rel="nofollow">identified</a> using google) were in other countries. IMO a Japanese zdnet article should be considered as reliable as the English equivalent, and the fact that the page is in Japanese makes it only slighly less verifiable, as machine translation ensures you are seeing a pretty honest interpretation of the article. These source prove that the features listed in the English documentation from group-office.com is reliable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 21:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Evidence of major distro inclusion = keep<br />
Absence of evidence of major distro inclusion = delete+salt</b>.<br />
The sole policy-based claims of notability that means anything in all the above seems to be that <b>Alexa reports</b> it as #8, and that it's included in various <b>major linux distros</b> (per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> examples of major distros include Debian, Fedora, etc). No evidence is presented for either of these statements so far. Alexa itself is not a neutral source. Although listing on Alexa may be evidence of usage, it's unclear if <i>Alexa mention alone, unsupported by other evidence</i>, is a sufficient evidence for notability. Likewise, if it is included within the named major distributions, can someone paste a few links to the relevant <b>major distro</b> package inclusion listings and then this AFD will pretty much be done. If that's not possible, and lacking evidence of these then I have to agree that Group Office doesn't look at all notable outside its own fan-base and <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7074" class="external text" title="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7074" rel="nofollow">one minor review</a> elsewhere. (And as an aside, references to <i>"Incredibly strong keep"</i> and <i>"Hyper-strong keep"</i> suggest that the responses concerned include emotive views rather than policy based views, tending to support the nominator's interpretation.) Without <i>evidence</i> that this view is significantly wrong, then it looks like it should be deleted - probably with salt since with 3 heated nominations and much ardor for the package, article recreation must be considered a possibility. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 22:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is how some articles end up with 18 AfDs.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 17:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That sounds like a beef either with the AfD process itself or with the way it was handled in the second nomination for this article. Your apparent assumption is that the second AfD was closed by the numbers rather than by following policy and consensus ("don't meet policy but have vocal fan bases"). Besides failing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> on the part of the closing admin, I think this assumption is factually incorrect as well. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 17:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't want to get into it, but I couldn't even count the times I have seen AfDs closed based entirely on vote counts, especially when there is excessive verbiage as there arguably is here. Note that I am not the only one who felt the need to make a comment to the effect of "admins, PLEASE read all the discussion." This is not assuming bad faith on their parts, and I wish you wouldn't keep jumping to that citation, as accusing someone of making a mistake or misusing policy is not the same as accusing them of bad faith. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 17:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wish you wouldn't keep assuming that an AfD was mishandled just because it didn't go the way you think it should have. Obviously saying someone made a mistake isn't assuming bad faith, but saying someone misused policy is. And closing an AfD based on numbers can't really be a simple mistake; you're accusing the admin of not doing his or her job. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 18:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article in question was the Gay Nigger Association of America. I will continue to nominate articles for deletion that fail to satisfy the inclusion guidelines, knowing both that consensus can change and that deletion discussions are a rough tool at best: Facile, unpredictable, and governed mostly by who shows up and shouts. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 21:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><small>What a waste. WP:Notability is a guideline, not a be all end all policy that requires endless wonkism about the nuances of its interpretation. WP:N-Software is still only a proposed guideline and one that not everyone agrees with. This article has mutiple non-trivial sources period. The broader view is that this article contributes to Wikipedia's purpose by providing useful, notable, verifiable knowledge. Is it the most earth shatteringly important knowledge that human kind needs? No, but neither are the feeding habits of Pokemon. Many of the plain keep votes here were given with reason and explanation on the previous discussions and knowing the history, it is rather obvious that asking people to comment yet again on a topic already hashed out multiple times is going to cause some hard feelings. Good faith nomination or not, this is a typical and understandable human response. Wikipedia is written by people, not robots without feeling. The bottom line is that this is improving Wikipedia and I have seen no evidence that it isn't or that it is harming the project in any way. Wikilawyer all you want about it, but if this project can't see the forest for the trees it has some serious issues. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
