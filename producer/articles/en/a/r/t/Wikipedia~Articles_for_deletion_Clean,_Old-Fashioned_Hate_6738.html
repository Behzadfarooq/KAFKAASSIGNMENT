<p>It's a college rivalry, which in my opinion isn't all that notable, and apparently <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Clean%2C+Old-Fashioned+Hate%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Clean%2C+Old-Fashioned+Hate%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">google</a> agrees. All colleges have rivalries, but the only people that have any interest in them are current students and those closely involved in the program. Also, it's not particularly well written, and everything it mentions could probably be summed up into the articles of the colleges themselves (if they haven't been already.) <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 00:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Professional teams in the USA are few and far between. College teams and rivalries take on the level of pro teams in those areas. Some are as well known as the 'Old Firm' is in Europe. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 02:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - that point is taken but any local trophy between just two pro league teams, at any sport, would, I suggest be non-notable. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 03:09, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> If there's nowhere for this in the individual college articles or <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_rivalry.html" title="College rivalry">College rivalry</a>, then there sure isn't anything here worthy of its own article. There are hundreds of college rivalries in the USA alone. If this one's as well known as the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Firm_736d.html" title="Old Firm">Old Firm</a>, let's see some evidence, and if it's genuinely convincing, I will gladly switch my vote. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 03:12, 7 July 2006 (UTC) (see below --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 05:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Georgia Tech vs. Georgia rivalry is, in comparison to many of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games_1c50.html" title="List of NCAA college football rivalry games">List of NCAA college football rivalry games</a> articles which aren't up for deletion, a much more notable rivalry. The rivalry engages the entire populace of the state of Georgia (8,000,000 people) once a year for football, once a year for basketball, and three times a year for baseball. This is what American sporting is about, hardcore rivalries. They keep the games interesting and intense. I personally have never heard of the Old Firm rivalry in the United States but the average American college sports fan knows that Georgia Tech and Georgia hate eachother's guts. As a previous poster's mentioned, college sports and college rivalries in the United States are equivalent to European club rivalries. You guys get your rivalries, we've get ours. It can be stubbed, if need be.--<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcaliburhorn_1fda.html" title="User:Excaliburhorn">Excaliburhorn</a> 11:56, July 6, 2006

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd just like to point out that only two of the articles on that chart (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_for_Nevada_fb19.html" title="Battle for Nevada">Battle for Nevada</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholics_vs._Convicts_34f6.html" title="Catholics vs. Convicts">Catholics vs. Convicts</a>) got fewer google hits then the one in question. Now, I realize that this isn't a sure-fire way to judge the article's notability, but I just wanted to inform you that some of those rivalries aren't as obscure as you might think. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 04:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Retort:</b> Your Zadar Cow got many less hits than the article in question. I'm very displeased with this whole procedure. I recommend a stubbing and moving on.--<a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcaliburhorn_1fda.html" title="User:Excaliburhorn">Excaliburhorn</a> 12:44, July 7, 2006</li>

<li>I found quite a few references to the rivalry that didn't always refer to the title of this article, so I'm going <b>Keep</b> and trusting you guys on the notability, before <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Varsity_Match_62d1.html" title="The Varsity Match">The Varsity Match</a> ends up in here.&#160;;-) BTW, I think there may be a mistake in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games_1c50.html" title="List of NCAA college football rivalry games">List of NCAA college football rivalry games</a> , since the list states this rivalry is a few years older than the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_South%27s_Oldest_Rivalry_cb44.html" title="Deep South's Oldest Rivalry">Deep South's Oldest Rivalry</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 05:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having lived in Georgia, I know first-hand that people go crazy about it: Georgia fans don't use mustard (as yellow is Georgia Tech's colour), GT fans don't use ketchup for the same reason. If you get married to a person who went to the other school, both families disown you. So therefore, <b>Keep</b>. It's a big part of the social fabric of the state of Georgia.--<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicosBailBonds_657b.html" title="User:ChicosBailBonds">ChicosBailBonds</a> 05:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although this article can definitely use some cleanup/expansion, the rivalry is both historic and huge in the state of Georgia and has involved mainly notable coaches (e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Heisman_5766.html" title="John Heisman">John Heisman</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Scobey_Warner_b62b.html" title="Glenn Scobey Warner">Pop Warner</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Dodd_4868.html" title="Bobby Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Dooley_0649.html" title="Vince Dooley">Vince Dooley</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Curry_a725.html" title="Bill Curry">Bill Curry</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Ross_f16f.html" title="Bobby Ross">Bobby Ross</a>). --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoswell_native_a674.html" title="User:Roswell native">Roswell native</a> 12:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable college rivalry. Per DarkAudit, I'd say that college sports is <i>bigger</i> than pro sports through most parts of the southeast. That said, I'm not running out to create an article for the Textile Bowl, but Tech–Georgia is a biggie as rivalries go. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 13:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I lived in Jacksonville, FL for three years. Florida and Florida State football got far more press than the NFL Jaguars, even when the Jaguars were in the playoffs. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 14:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm surprised this is being considered for deletion. This is certainly a notably sports rivalry. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 14:13, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems well written and referenced. There is often a statewide (if not wider) interest in big college rivalries. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanminier_5003.html" title="User:Ryanminier">Ryanminier</a> 16:24, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is part of {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_College_football_b1c7.html" title="Template:WikiProject College football">WikiProject College football</a>}} and for completeness on the subject matter, must be included. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu">Mecu</a> 17:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being from Michigan, I know how huge rivalries can be, with <a href="../../../m/s/u/MSU_11ac.html" title="MSU">MSU</a> and <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_f1c0.html" title="Ohio State">Ohio State</a>. I say keep because rivalries are perhaps the biggest part of college football, many times even more important that what bowl a team makes it to. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornagain4_4b3f.html" title="User:Bornagain4">Bornagain4</a> 17:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It has its own name, it has multiple print sources, it's quite important to a few million people in the state of Georgia.
