<li><b>Keep</b> - There are many, many articles on WP that have but one mention in another source, often a newspaper. This calendar isn't discussed in every journal these days, but it is a very legitimate calendar proposal that got "press" in the 20th century (if "publicity" is a good measure of notability, which it is obviously not.) The nominator posted a warning that sources were required, and a source for this calendar was produced. The book that serves as a source is a legitimate one, printed by a major publishing house, not a self-published paper or even an obscure journal. It should suffice. Yet, it was immdiately put up for deletion after the actions of the nominator were challenged. I believe this is being deleted as part of a what seems to be a very aggressive deletion strategy of most calendar reform proposals, based in part upon what isn't even an accepted WP <b>guideline</b>, but instead, a <b>proposal</b> for a guideline, on Notability. One thing is certain, it is NOT currently a policy, and shouldn't be aggresively interpreted as such. When every cartoon character or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Crash_Bandicoot_characters_e1f6.html" title="List of Crash Bandicoot characters">minor video game character</a> is afforded an article on Wikipedia, going after calendar reform proposals seems a bit absurd. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 21:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm really not sure where to start here, but let's try:
<ol>
<li>Exactly what are you claiming is a "proposal for a guideline"? <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> is one of the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">five pillars</a>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are both accepted guidelines.</li>
<li>The claimed source for this calendar (Steel, 2000) says nothing more than "In 1930, there was another leap-week calendar proposal put forward, this time by a Jesuit, James A. Colligan". That does not appear to fulfil the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirement that "any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source", as it does not give any details of the calendar beyond its inventor and the date of invention. Which sources are being referred to for the rest of the information in the article?</li>
<li>The line of reasoning of "What about article x?" is well covered at <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> and the further linked essays; I see no need to rehash them further here. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 22:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> There is all sorts of lawyerly cleverness one could throw at this argument, and the previous post is a masterful example of this technique. Suffice it to say this *seems to be* a selective purge of certain pages, and despite the fact that a clever answer has been written by someone in the past that "crap" exists elsewhere, the implication that this is "crap" is not an argument, it's an attack.
<p>And let me elaborate, and clarify, my previous comments. First, Notability is a GUIDELINE, and carries with it far less weight than a policy, and even as a Guideline, its meaning and application here is hotly disputed, as the Notability article's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">history of reversions and extensive revisions</a> can attest to. As for Reliable sources, they are being added at this point, so this process of deletion was a bit premature. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 02:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong in several ways. You are not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> by assuming that this is some kind of "selective purge". The application of notability here at AFD is the subject of widespread agreement. It has been in use at AFD for several years, now. The current dispute was caused by a few editors trying to change the long-standing definition to something else. And it was <i>you</i> that called articles crap, by employing the long-discredited <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokemon_test_84d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokemon test">PokÃ©mon argument</a>, not <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm hoping for the day when wanton deletionism is just as discredited as that argument, which was apparently written by deletionists, and is a straw many anyway, since clearly this calendar isn't as well known as the Pokemon characters, and no one is saying this. The "other crap exists" <i>essay</i> was similarly designed to build up the idea that all deletions are valid, and shouldn't be questioned. Sorry. I question all deletions, and wonder why deletionists don't simply improve articles, not run around deleting dozens of them. I'm assuming you're acting on your best judgement when you nominate the many articles for deletion you do, and not out of malice, even though you seem to be aggressively applying a guideline that clearly is <i>still</i> in hot dispute. Let me also note that two people commenting here is not sufficient for a consensus. It's good that you relisted this. Let's hope people find their way here <b>on their own</b> to comment on it further. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 05:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
