<li><b>Excellent work</b> Well written. Covering a serious, notable living person. The tone is studious and the claims thoroughly backed up in great detail. The links all check out, the sources are reliable and all of them pass verification. Well done DrParkes. I know that they have blocked you, but add me to your list of supporters. We will try to defend you while they won´t let you speak for yourself. Kentkent is right, you should try and get onto another computer and defy their bullying. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 08:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, please do. We are fighting alosing battle with the Loudenvier/Gelston/Nate/FlowWTG sockpuppet. (Or socketpuppet as they like to call it.

<p><b>Caution</b> This AfD is being attacked by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppets.html" title="Sockpuppets">sockpuppets</a> Loudenvier, Nate, FlowWTG, and Gelston. It is my firm belief that they are all <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppets.html" title="Sockpuppets">sockpuppets</a> and the same person. It might be a good idea if administrators were to take a closer look at those users. They (he) have been consistently disrupting the work of DrParkes aparantly because he dared to disagree with their (his) Judo based view of the origins of BJJ. They (he) managed to get DrParkes banned by stealthy misuse of the system. Now, during his absence, they (he) are attacking anyone who disagrees with them (him). They are even vandalising and disrupting this AfD nominiation. They consistently vandalise anything that does not fit their points of view.

<dd>Do you have any proof that us four are sockpuppets? Or is it because we <s>voted</s> rgued for delete and don't agree with you? Look at my IP Address. You'll see its from Iraq. Look at Loudenvier's, I'm sure it hails from Brazil. Look at Flows, good chance its from Ohio. Your accusations of sockpuppetry are attacks on the creditability of others, and do not keep with the spirit of WP:Civility. You think Barry Ley deserves an article. We disagree.

<dd>Looks like they are on to you, LOUNDENVIER/NATE/FLOWWTG/GELSTON. What are you going to do if you get caught out and banned? Surely by now you must realise you have gone too far.

<dd>The problem with this "No you are!!" line of thought: Nate, Gelston, and Loudenvier have been on here and editing for a long time in separate areas of wikipedia. All of you, on the other hand, joined within the same few days, edit exactly the same articles, speak exactly the same way, even down to CAPITALIZING NAMES. It's quite a tell. I don't think you're even taking this seriously anymore - please, just stop. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowWTG_1378.html" title="User:FlowWTG">FlowWTG</a> 17:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whatever you say FlowWTG, or should I say Nate? I'm sure you would like us all to go away. What a great world if everyone who did not share our point of view would just go away. There are some notable historic characters who would have agreed with that sentiment. Stalin, Mao tse tung and Hitler to name but a few. But look what happens when people stop trying to defy tyranny and sacrifice free speech. No. I think it best for humankind in general if we and everyone else who believes in the banned DrParkes keeps fighting to clear his name. We can not, must not allow the insidious hijacking of this noble institution to continue. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 17:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow. This article seems to be attracting a lot of attention. For my part, the links provide sound verification for its inclusion in Wikipedia. Ley seems to someone who stirs up a lot of passion, one way or the other, in several of the editors at least. And Google´s one and a half million listed pages about him certainlty suggest sufficient notability.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b>- not really, came across it as while looking the contributions of an unhelpful editor on another article. I generally try to keep any one I come across in a good state, wikify an add citation requests but these were repeatedly removed or bad sources added. Also if you google "Barry Ley", including the quotes it give 560, this looks for the exact phrase, I did a UK only search around 167 are based here if he is based in the UK these are the most likely to be relevant &amp; getting few &amp; far between esp as unless he's a member of "PLYMOUTH &amp; DISTRICT CONSUMER GROUP" the first few are not about him.</dd>
<dd>Also I notice the only pages you have edited are the same as the banned User:DrParkes any relation?--<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate</a> 16:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>As far as I can see, DrParkes is the victim of the bias and vandalism of a small clique of Judo fans. No relation, but as you guys have teamed up to get him banned while you sabotage his work, he needs all the support he can get. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 21:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I search for "Felipe Machado" I receive 118.000 google hits. Should I start my autobiography on wikipedia? "Felipe Rocha" returns 30.600 hist. Loudenvier, my nickname, and used everywhere only by me, returns 911 hits. I think my nickname is more notable than Barry Ley in general. I would never write about Loudenvier on wikipedia though. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 17:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Over a million hits for "Barry Ley" His book did indeed make it to No 1 on Amazon bestseller list albeit only for a short time and, as pointed out by another editor, about one and a half millionth place on the all time list. Out of nearly 100 million titles on their inventory since Amazon's inception. It seems positively vindictive that you should decry his work so, in the full knowledge that you have had him banned from replying. Are you afraid he will keep coming up with more proof for his claims, just as he was doing right up until the moment you managed to get him cut off?</li>
</ul>
<p>I say good luck to him. I hope others will rally round this poor victim of malevolant vandalism. Keep your chin up DrParkes. There are plenty of us cheering for you. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 14:48, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>You really don't want to find it, do you?</b> No wonder if you spell it wrong NATE. It is Barry LEY. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 08:42, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a noteworthy subject. And it is unfair foreveryone EXCEPT DrParkes to have their say. There are plenty of sources citations and proof. More than any other article on Wikipedia it seems. The book is a bestseller and there are a huge number of other books with their own articles. Ley is a fascinating subject, well covered by the media. Unfortunately, DrParkes has committed the sin of telling the world about the true origins of BJJ in other articles. He obviously did not realise the political power of the Judo set in this organisation. Preech Jigoro Kano, or hold your tongue! <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKentkent_e537.html" title="User:Kentkent">Kentkent</a> 19:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Ley Guard is definitely now an accepted part of the sport. I agree with kentkent that we should keep this article. If you have long legs, the Ley Guard is a safe way to defend while setting up the triangle. While it looks precarious, it is in fact quite stable as long as you grip your ankle tightly. As this technique is now accepted into the mainstream, I think that its inventor deserves to stay on Wikipedia. And I also agree with kentkent that DrParkes does seem to be getting victimised for daring to challange the judo propaganda inherent in the articles on BJJ. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> 08:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment to closing admin</b>. I have no opinion on this article and, in fact, have not even looked at it. However, of all the users who have edited this discussion, 2 have less than 50 edits (all of which are in this AFD or the Barry Ley article) and were created just a short while ago. These two users also happen to be the most ... I believe "obnoxious" is the most descriptive term. They are <a href="../../../k/b/e/User%7EKbenton_de63.html" title="User:Kbenton">Kbenton</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kbenton" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kbenton" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>) and <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesthorburn_a872.html" title="User:Jamesthorburn">Jamesthorburn</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jamesthorburn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jamesthorburn" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>). Despite having edited the article's talk page and this AFD multiple times, they seem to do so in rotation: first one edits for an hour, then the other, and so on. As "obvious, disruptive sock puppet(s)", I believe a block without checkuser would be appropriate, per <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">WP:RCU</a>, or some other form of warning/block. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
