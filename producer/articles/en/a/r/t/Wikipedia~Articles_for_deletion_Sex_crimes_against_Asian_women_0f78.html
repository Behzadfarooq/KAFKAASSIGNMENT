<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> for now. The introduction doesn't reference "Some Asian Americans point to the racial stereotyping of Asian women as a driving force behind sex crimes targeting them." I can't say whether this is a prevalent theory or a collection of newstories that struck some Wikipedia editors as being similar. Also if kept that title should be changed to say "Asian American."

<li><b>Comment</b> There may be room for an article, based on the report, though a better source than a college paper would be nice. The individual reports have no value in an encyclopedic article. Total sexual assaults has been estimated at 200K per year in the US. Five selected incidents don't mean anything. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right, five individual incidents don't mean much. That's why we need to expand and add more incidents. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 19:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the article that says Asian women are disproportionally targeted does not provide a single supporting reference for that assertion and the authors have no apparent expertise in the area of sex crimes or statistics. Instead, they are reporting on something discussed in a Asian-American women's organization meeting. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 20:40, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Even if any users have any expertise on the subject matter, they'd have to rely on sources like the Asian American woman's organisation that was linked. Providing your own insight into the subject matter would violate <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>. In other words, we <i>must</i> use other sources. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>But you need unbiased professional sources. An Asian women's organization says sexual assault is a special problem for Asian women? Not surprising. Try asking a Latina women's organization or an African-American women's organization. What would their response be? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>There's really no such thing as an unbiased source of information, especially when you're talking about something that is controversial. What makes an article conform to NPOV is the presentation of opposing points of view. Hence, the stub I added in request of expansion of the article. The lack of an opposing view does not entail deletion of an article, it entails the inclusion of said opposing view into the article. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 06:00, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You seem to be suggesting that a POV article is OK, as long as you ask for opposing views. Sorry, that's not good enough. The absolute bare minimum required is that you must provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verification</a> from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Source</a> to support the contentions in your article, and you have not done so. You have a handful of anecdotal incidents with nothing to indicate that they are related or are part of any particular pattern or trend. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uh, no. That is not what I'm suggesting. I'm suggesting that the article is far from being in a finished state. That is why it needs expansion. That is why it needs more sources, especially ones with opposing views.

<li><b>Comment</b> - For those of you who want to delete the article because you think it's POV - you need to check <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_d4d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion">Wikipedia:Deletion</a>. POV is not criteria for deletion. Otherwise, all those controversial topics that people think are POV are in danger of deletion. <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, anyone? The proposed solution for a POV article is to clean it up and make it NPOV. And having said that, I've added the {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPov_4969.html" title="Template:Pov">pov</a>}} tag to the page. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 16:28, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've added the U.S. Justice Department as a source of opposing view. Like I've said, this article needs expansion and additional sources, not deletion. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 16:50, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So the only <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> you have is an opposing view? I really don't see that helping your argument. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b>Wikipedia is a <i>tertiary</i> source. This article could be includible if it discussed (i) a theory or school of thought in the academic community on which papers had been published or (ii) a trend that is widely acknowledged as a trend (and not just a collection of crimes) in major news media. The article does not discuss either of these. It's not that what the article says is invalid, it's just not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 18:13, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<dd>Note that this is research about the Asian American community, as is clearly the focus of the article, and not Asians in general, as its name erroneously suggests. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 02:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
