<p>This article exists solely to promote Florentin Smarandache, who has promoted himself via extensive sockpuppetry in various &amp; sundry places on the Internet. Here's an excerpt from one of my personal favorite sockpuppet episodes (there are many more): <i>Hello from India!</i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.logic/msg/c7beb0c0f565c09f?dmode=source" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.logic/msg/c7beb0c0f565c09f?dmode=source" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> posted from an ip address belonging to UNM-Gallup, the employer of Smarandache. Now that this bio is up for deletion, we can expect a flurry of sockpuppets coming forth to cheer for Smarandache &amp; question the motives of everyone in sight. Please in the name of all that is good let's not reward sockpuppetry and self-promotion with a Wikipedia article. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Smarandache may be a wacky self-promoter and much of the sort of math he does may be the kind of unmotivated axiomatics and base-specific number theory that more serious mathematicians find trivial, but he's well known for it and therefore notable. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 06:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Most of the information about Smarandache outside of Wikipedia seems to be written by Smarandache himself. If material written by Smarandache is excluded, it is unclear that much of anything is left. Hence, this person is non-notable outside of what he has written on himself. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 08:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A search of Amazon.com for Smarandache comes up with 182 books, many of them not written by him. When you can get a dozen authors--W. B. Vasantha Kandasamy, Linfan Mao, Mladen Vassilev-Missana; Krassimir Atanassov, Amarnath Murthy and Charles Ashbacher, Yi Yuan and Kang Xiaouyu, Howard Iseri, Sebastián Martín Ruiz, Ion Soare, and Wenpeng Zhang--to write books with your name in the title, you're notable. As for verifiability, Thompson Gale's Contemporary Authors series--which should be neutral, and available in most major academic libraries--has an article on him, which is available standalone from Amazon for six bucks. I'm getting a strong feeling that people are confusing dislike of the person with notability. I don't know much about the guy, but even if his works were insipid cultic trash, getting this many people from around the world to write about his work, plus the biography in Contemporary Authors, makes him notable. P.S. Can we avoid the preemptive attack on all who would vote to keep this article?

<li>Do I get a feeling that people are a bit biased against this guy? His theories that a dozen people have written books on isn't a bit notable?

<dl>
<dd>The way this hypothesis is presented on Eric Weisstein's World of Physics is as follows:
<dl>
<dd><i>Several authors have published theories claiming that the speed-of-light barrier imposed by relativity is illusionary. While these "theories" continue to be rejected by the physics community as ill-informed speculation, their proponents continue to promulgate them in rather obscure journals. An example of this kind is the Smarandache hypothesis, which states that there is no such thing as a speed limit in the universe (Smarandache 1998).</i><a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Superluminal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Superluminal.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

</dd>
<dd>Maybe they are "a bit biased" too. If you look up the reference<a href="http://www.gallup.unm.edu/~smarandache/NoSpLim.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gallup.unm.edu/~smarandache/NoSpLim.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, it is really totally unscientific <i>even in comparison with your run-off-the-mill piece of pseudo-scientific junk</i>. It reads like the typical junk faster-than-light speculation posted by a freshman on a bulletin board. I don't know whether Smarandache was picked randomly, or as a particularly egregious example of ignorant speculation. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:03, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I counted the number of pages on his website where he manages to use his own name, whether for Smarandache Social Paradox, Smarandache's Law on Sensations and Stimuli, Smarandache Notions, Quantum Smarandache Paradoxes, Smarandache Geometry, Smarandache Anti-Geometry, Smarandache Function, Smarandache Palindrome, Smarandache n-structure, Smarandacheials, Smarandache Zero Divisors, Smarandache-Rodrigues-Maiorino Theory, Smarandache Divine Paradoxes, Smarandache Semigroups, Smarandache multiplicative functions, Smarandache Complex, Smarandache Groupoids, Smarandache Number, Smarandache-Zero Divisor, Smarandache's Illusion, Smarandache's Syndrome, ..., it just goes on and on. I found 336 such pages. The guy is just incredibly prolific. Most of it (established by sampling) either makes no sense, or is completely elementary and utterly trivial. A Lambiamoid Number is a prime number plus one. Lambiam's Theorem: 3 is the only odd Lambiamoid Number. Lambiam's Hypothesis: There is an infinite source of energy. Lambiam's Paradox: 0×0 = 0, therefore 0 = 0/0 = undefined. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that several people writing articles in the walled-garden Smarandache universe are the Master himself writing under a pseudonym. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:26, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, we <i>do</i> have an article on <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smarandache-Wellin_number_2d9c.html" title="Smarandache-Wellin number">Smarandache-Wellin numbers</a>. And I think it's slightly perverse to say a concept can be notable but the person that it's named after may not be - but I won't press the point&#160;! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 14:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would actually prefer that biographies like this would not appear here on wikipedia, perhaps just some articles on some things that Smarandache has done. But currently we can read many such entries on wikipedia, so according to how the wiki rules are applied in practice, we cannot delete this article. If we delete this article then a large number of similar biographies should be deleted as well as other articles on marginally notable topics. E.g. what about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hockaday_School_a37b.html" title="The Hockaday School">The Hockaday School</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mark%27s_School_of_Texas_bb1a.html" title="St. Mark's School of Texas">St. Mark's School of Texas</a>.? <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
