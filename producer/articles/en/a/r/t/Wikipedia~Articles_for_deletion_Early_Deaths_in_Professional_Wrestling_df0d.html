<p><a href="../../../l/c/_/WP%7ELC_690f.html" title="WP:LC">WP:LC</a>. Completely inapproprtae considering the article List of deceased professional wrestlers was deleted. Just make a category of deceased pro wrestlers and it can serve the same purpose.

<li>No, I TRIED to make a category for this topic, but the category police went ballistic (see this link --&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_February_20#Category:Deceased_Professional_Wrestlers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_February_20#Category:Deceased_Professional_Wrestlers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_February_20#Category:Deceased_Professional_Wrestlers</a> There is nothing inappropriate about this list. Sure, it's inappropriate that these young men all died way before there time, but I had nothing to do with that. As far as the definition of an "early death", I'm not sure how to define it, but I'm quite certain that having a heart attack at age 42 qualifies. Leave this article alone. - wfresch</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> is impossibly POV. There is no objective standard as to what constitutes an "early death." <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: It gives undue weight to deaths in the Pro Wrestling business as compared to other high stress athletic fields like Pro Boxing, Football, Basketball or Baseball (why isn't there a list for these sports? - Pro Boxing would have an even worse record IMHO since its not staged). The POV contention is of course, participation in Pro Wrestling causes "early" (ill defined) death which is not proven (compared to other sports/professions). The only death I can see on the list that can be directly pinned on Pro Wrestling is Owen Hart's accidental death from a wrestling stunt gone wrong. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 09:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: It's POV (how "early death" is defined) and possibly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. Sure, a significant number of notable pro wrestlers had drug problems that may have been a cause of death, but it's not really encyclopedia-worthy to list all of them together (or perhaps categorize them together). Even an article on steroids in pro wrestling I don't think would be good enough to keep (because the well-known cases are for wrestlers who have appeared in the "big league" promotions, which of course is not indicative of the industry as a whole - after all, WWE makes use of an extensive travelling schedule more than the average indy promotion). <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 19:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, I hadn't checked this page in a while; I was busy working like normal people do. The fact remains that the 40 plus people mentioned in this Wiki article died early deaths. What are you people debating about?</li>
<li>This isn't a category, and it doesn't have to be a list. I would say that, if a couple paragraphs can be added to this, and then the list of wrestlers is at the bottom of the article, that should be alright. If you have to, rename the article to "Professional wrestlers who died before age 50." That would get around the whole "what qualifies as an early death?" debate.</li>
<li>If there can be lists of sexual positions, and lists of "Nintendo games that feature Mario as a character", why should this article be the subject of such scrutiny.</li>

<li>First, please sign your posts by adding four tildes ~~~~ after your comments. Second, there is a strong consensus against either listing or categorizing people on the basis of their being alive or dead (with the exception of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> which is maintained for legal reasons). Third, regardless of what age is selected it is an arbitary standard of inclusion. Finally, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> (lists of Mario games or sexual positions) are not justification for this article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b>*The problem I have with this article is that it (IMHO) gives the biased point of view impression that the Pro-wrestling business "causes early deaths". Its not balanced and rather unfair to the industry. It doesn't take much effort to selectively cherry pick a bunch of deceased wrestlers, put them in a list without any context whatsoever and call it "Early deaths in professional wrestling" - You might as well retitle this article "Pro wrestling causes early deaths", in which case it will be speedily deleted as a biased attack article. There is no context to this list, as I have stated in my comments above - a biased cherry picked list of dead people is simply not encyclopedic and does not warrant inclusion in Wikipeadia. I can selectively list early deaths in any number of professions (lawyers, doctors, policemen, insurance adjusters etc.) and give the false impression that n-profession causes short life-spans. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 03:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Go ahead and try to come up with a list of lawyers that died early deaths. You won't be able to come up with 50 people that were significant enough to be mentioned on wikipedia in the first place. There is a list on wiki titled "People that committed suicide by gun." This could just be thought of as "People that committed suicide by working over 330 days per year, for 15 years straight, then had their heart explode." Is it really so different?</li>

<li>There is a wiki page titled, "Poltergeist curse" that lists actors/actresses that died early deaths that all happened to work on the Poltergeist films. Are they implying that working on a movie makes you die? If so, should that article be removed? By nazi logic, the answer is yes. - Nate Jibb</li>

<p><b>keep</b> Noteworthy, controversial. This subject comes up in the press every time there's an 'untimely' death in the sport. At those times, people curious about the subject would surely find a categorized list like this useful and informative. At other times, the article will serve to educate those who are unaware that there's a controversy about the subject. Gooshy 16:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Its exactly lists like these that gives Wikipedia a bad reputation.

Just how many basic Wikipedia encycopedic rules does this article break? People who are curious about about pro-wrestling and other subject matters can be better served than with a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> biased and out-of-context list like this. Without context on each and every wrestler's death, this list is useless - just what can be inferred from bladder cancer deaths (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tenta_c94d.html" title="John Tenta">John Tenta</a>)? What of other pro-wrestlers that have retired and gone on (or will go on) to have higher than average median life expectancy lives? Even if the article originator is out to prove a connection between pro-wrestling and early deaths (nothing wrong with writing such an article - you just need to meet the Wikipedia guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), a list like this is laziest and the worst possible way to present such information.--<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 03:29, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the cut-off point for "early death"? Does it relate to Average Life Expectancy? If so, is this taken into account for the wrestler's nationality, gender, ethnic group and country living in at time of death? If not then why not?</li>
<li>Does this section cover promoters and managers?</li>
<li>Does this section cover deaths that have nothing to do with wrestling (e.g. car crash)?</li>
<li>Does this section cover wrestlers from present day right back to the beginning of professional wrestling?
