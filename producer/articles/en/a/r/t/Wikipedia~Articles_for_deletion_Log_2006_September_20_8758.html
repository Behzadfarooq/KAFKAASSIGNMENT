<li><b>Comment</b>. On further evaluation, it seems that the type of protection I'm talking about does not require an AfD. It's something an admin can roll on at his discretion.

At first I was going to post a <i>delete</i> comment out of moral support because I agree with the nominator's principle but thought it would unsuccessful because this would be one of many similar articles. To my surprise, I soon found there isn't a similar "article" for a lot of other U.S. states. That's probably a good thing. This is a category in article's clothing. The entire purpose of categories seems to be defeated by lists like this.

<li><b>Comment</b> These articles were created after a few people didn't want to see information about "X in popular culture" included in firearms articles, where such a section would describe its depictions in movies and computer games. I don't support the existence of this single massive list, since it's utterly unmanagable and provides minimal information, but it would be nice to have popular culture information included back into the articles. Something like the MP5 or AK-47 could use a mention of its ubiquity in certain roles, if we can find sources to support it, while other weapons like the Beretta 93R could benefit from a mention of prominent roles, like Robocop. An indiscriminate list of every occurance is pointless, but there should be some information back in the articles, especially now that this sorry excuse is gone. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: What qualifies as "original research" when verifying if a firearm appears in a movie? Anyone who watches <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> can verify that Neo uses a <a href="../../../v/z/_/Vz_61.html" title="Vz 61">Vz 61</a> Skorpion in the "Lobby Scene."

<li>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis". <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says "In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material." It also says "Articles related to popular culture and fiction must be backed up by reliable sources like all other articles." There is no free pass for material about films, literature, or any other readily available media, we still need sourcing. (And, in the particular example, only a gun afficianado would recognize specific weapons on sight.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>My point with that comment was this: if anyone has the <a href="../../../v/z/_/Vz_61.html" title="Vz 61">Vz 61</a> page open while watching the movie, they can see it's the same thing. But if someone watches the movie and wonders what it is, they can look on this page, and look through the firearms listed for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a>, and see that the <a href="../../../v/z/_/Vz_61.html" title="Vz 61">Vz 61</a> is listed here. Because it's verifiable through watching the movie, must we really require screenshots, or an expert's analysis of firearms featured in the movie, to know what appeared? --<a href="../../../u/n/h/User%7EUNHchabo_7c60.html" title="User:UNHchabo">UNHchabo</a> 16:37, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and investigate</b>. While the fact that Unpopular Books printed <i>Decadence of the Shamans: Or Shamanism as a Key to the Secrets of Communism</i> may be poetically apt, this seems to be a non-notable publisher dedicated to some minor and unintelligible ideology. I'm not sure that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies here, since this seems to be some kind of marginal movement in art or politics rather than a business. If the business guidelines were applied it falls well short of meeting them, but like all guidelines, they only define what is <i>per se</i> notable.

<p><b>A POV summary of the reasons for deletion</b></p>
<p>1) That the publisher is <b>unverifiable</b>. It is easily verifiable that Unpopular Books has published a number of works. At least two contributors to this page own a number of them. As I have stated above, I feel that the texts they have published, and their authors, make them notable.</p>
<p>2) <b>Walled Garden</b>. Because Unpopular Books is in some way linked to other projects such as the LPA, etc, it forms part of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a>. I would dispute this. It is clear that authors published by Unpopular Books such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Home_1868.html" title="Stewart Home">Stewart Home</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Barrot_1712.html" title="Jean Barrot">Jean Barrot</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asger_Jorn_d263.html" title="Asger Jorn">Asger Jorn</a> as well as the collected works of the <a href="../../../u/p/_/Up_Against_the_Wall_Motherfuckers_9339.html" title="Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers">Black Mask Group</a> have a wide appeal. They are, individually, relatively obscure, but to my mind clearly notable within their respective fields. If people feel that pages on the Neoist Alliance, or LPA, or AAA or NLI should be deleted then I would think that individual calls for deletion should be done on those pages and not here. I note that nobody is proposing that <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asger_Jorn_d263.html" title="Asger Jorn">Asger Jorn</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Home_1868.html" title="Stewart Home">Stewart Home</a> be deleted from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>3) "An under-construction text based official <b>website</b> <a href="http://unpopular.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://unpopular.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>". The page is about Unpopular Books and the works they have published, it is not a page about their website. Indeed it seems unlikely that "it wants to disprove its title using wikipedia as promo vehicle" if its own site is so minimal.</p>
<p>4) "dubious <b>ghits</b> (admittedly a very crude test in this case)". Indeed. As I have pointed out above, googling the authors or titles and Unpopular Books does give a reasonable number of hits for a project of this type (i.e. marginal, but still notable)</p>
<p>5) "Not a hope of passing <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>." Again, as stated above, Unpopular Books is not notable because it is a huge multinational corporation with offices all over the world. It is notable because of the works and authors it has published.</p>
<p>6) "No assertion of <b>notability</b> (for the publisher)". As I have said above: "I am happy to revise the article on the basis that Unpopular Books is notable for the works it has published rather than for being a publishing company." I am unclear if I am entitled to do this whilst the deletion debate is ongoing.</p>
<p>I would invoke most of the reasons for not deleting covered <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">here</a>. I.e. wikipedia is not paper, there is a lack of objective criteria, etc.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if people could respond to these points rather than simply saying "delete" etc - it will add to my understanding of wikipedia if nothing else.</p>
<p>Finally, it seems that the creators of this article have not been informed, could the person who initiated the call for deletion do that? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Eden_ae98.html" title="User:John Eden">John Eden</a> 14:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding the three counter-arguments:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Danby comment isn't the notable part. The broadcast of the movie on one of Australia's three major broadcast networks is.</li>
<li>The fact that it is sold on Amazon doesn't seem to be a counterpoint.</li>
<li>Not that it's a particularly respected show, but it is a nationally syndicated one: <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_AM_b201.html" title="Coast to Coast AM">Coast to Coast AM</a> has also had at least one discussion on the movie.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, whether the movie is a hoax or potential disinformation is not relevant. Personally I think it's garbage, but that doesn't make it any less relevant.</dd>
<dd>Finally, as <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> stated, <i>AfD should not be a "Pitch til you win " kiddie carnival game. It was nominated before and the result was keep.</i> Yes, consensus can change, but this was just voted on six months ago.

<li><s><b>Keep and update</b></s> <b>Weakest possible keep</b> If this were held a month ago, I would have voted delete.

<li><b>weak Keep</b> marginal. but it's got over 600 google hits, an imdb listing, and a national showing in Australia. i don't see the harm, as it doesn't look like a promotional listing. if it's soon to be forgotten, then this will be just one more page no one looks at. no big deal. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 09:53, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Its being described as "laughable" adds to its notability, albeit not its credibility, but the latter is not our concern. The article needs to include the National Nine News article, the CNN interview and <a href="http://www.911inplanesite.com/fox_hatchetjob.html" class="external text" title="http://www.911inplanesite.com/fox_hatchetjob.html" rel="nofollow">"Fox News hatchet job"</a>. The nom fails to acknowledge this exposure, which not only invalidates the nom, but also the deletes which cite "per nom". We need to be presented with all the evidence, not selective evidence to argue a POV. Three deletes also subscribe to a strong predictive element, namely "soon to be forgotten". We do not delete on what we think is going to happen in the future, i.e. speculation, but on what the reality is now. If something is "soon to be forgotten", it is a testimony to current prominence, as it is stating that it has not yet been forgotten. The previous AfD was near-unanimous, so a second AfD should not have been made without more serious consideration than is evidenced here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Peephole#911:_In_Plane_Site" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Peephole#911:_In_Plane_Site" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Morton_devonshire/Archive04#911:_In_Plane_Site" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Morton_devonshire/Archive04#911:_In_Plane_Site" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:24, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It being presented on a national broadcast television channel <i>normally</i> would be an indication of notability, but, <b>CWC</b> makes good counterarguments.

<li><b>Comment</b> The broadcast counterargument is simply wrong. It's been broadcast more than once, and it was not broadcast directly against 'Path to 9/11'. Regarding other comments about the <b>lack of validity of this AfD</b>, you really should read what is written. The issue is not the timeframe of the second AfD. I don't believe the nominator is acting <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">in good faith</a>. The fact that the nom states "the video isn't available at Blockbuster", shows that he did some searching outside of Wikipedia to verify notability. At least one of the references provided were easily available in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_news.html" title="Google news">Google news</a>, showing <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream_media.html" title="Mainstream media">Mainstream media</a> coverage of the video. This is why discussions before a renomination after a consensus was reached are important. Deliberately ignoring such procedures is a violation of procedures, and intentionally disruptive. The nominator in this case has done it multiple times, and in the vast majority of cases the AfD fails. Remember this isn't a vote. It's a presentation of the facts involved with the article. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><font color="green">Sparkhead</font></a> 17:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dt>Reasons the article should be deleted</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This article is titled Roman Catholicism in El Salvador. The first paragraph says it is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church. Does anyone need an encyclopedia article to figure that out?</li>
<li>The second paragraph says how many El Salvadoran Catholics there are and the structure. There are something like 150+ countries in the world. Is there going to be a separate article for each religion for each country? Rosicrucians in Tibet? Jehovah's Witnesses in Bahrain? Scientologists in Tajikistan? This is really almanac-type information, not encyclopedia-type info. It belongs in a Religions section of an article on El Salvador, not here. At most, there could be a <i>Roman Catholicism (statistics)</i> article listing this type of information for various countries.</li>
<li>Gee, one bishop was killed <i>sometime</i> during a decade and the military persecuted a religious group during a civil war! How unusual! (And that info was only added recently.) Again, not "encyclopedia" material.</li>
<li>There are no citations or sources.</li>
<li>"Assassinated" is POV without sources.</li>
<li>The alleged reasons why he was "assassinated" are POV and unsourced.</li>
<li>The article says the bishop was assassinated "during the 1970's" in the civil war but it did not "officially" begin until 1980. Again, unsourced and POV.</li>
<li>This article doesn't talk about <i>Roman Catholicism</i> in El Salvador, it talks about alleged military persecution.</li>
<li>Without documentation, "persecuting" and "murdering" are POV and rumors.</li>
<li>Almost all editing activity on this article has consisted of adding categories.</li>
<li>Given that the article has been here six months, there has been ample time for it to be expanded if anyone wanted to.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I originally de-prodded this article and added the Cleanup tag.

<li><b>Delete unless rewritten</b> That the article has existed for SIX months without cleanup leads me to believe that such cleanup WILL NOT HAPPEN. Just because the topic is POTENTIALLY noteworthy (who knows if there's anything encyclopedic to say about RCiES? There might be nothing to say about it at all!) is not reason enough to keep a BAD article on said topic (or even <i>off</i> said topic as this article seems to go). <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 15:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems to be a non-notable painter. I googled her and found her own website and a few sites where anyone can list their own products. I found no indication that she has had any exhibitions in independent galleries, won any awards, articles written about her, etc. I realize this is a stub but without at least a little more it probably doesn't qualify as encyclopedic material. If she has had any exhibitions, awards, etc., adding that should be enough to justify keeping this. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a></b> 01:05, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A defunct EverQuest server. There doesn't seem to be anything too special about it.

<li><b>Save this page</b> It is a worthwhile page because it was a groundbreaking server that spawned a ton of notoriety. This server is known and talked about by people who have never even played on it. There are many noteable events to come out of this server including "Fansy 'the famous'" whose actions caused sony to change the game works (which took effect on the other pvp servers). I feel this article is being judged by people with no insight/interest towards the topic of the article and the community it represents. This article merely needs to be cleaned a bit but a deletion would be a crime. The server may no longer be running but the community and interest in the article is far from dead. -- 70.65.133.151 09:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There was a significant majority for deletion, and the keep proponents, on whom there is the burden to prove the article's worthiness for an encyclopaedia, did not demonstrate that this is a term <i><b>discussed</b></i> by reliable sources (rather than just used in passing). Reliable sources that discuss the term are required if we are to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article, as opposed to an article trying to cobble together a meaning from passing mentions (i.e. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research by synthesis</a>). The keep proponents refer only to a Google search (which is worthless, gfdgf, which I typed in by hitting my keyboard at random, turns up over 10,000 hits) and a BBC article which does not mention the word anywhere. Oh, and the famed 'there are other articles like this' argument, which should be cause for immediate speedy deletion until people stop using it. Nothing has apparently altered since the AfD, as the article itself currently only contains a reference to Google Groups, a supposed use by a journalist in his blog which I can't even find in the page linked to, and a use in the title of someone's book. Administrators do of course have discretion in closing AfDs, so I mean no disrespect to Deathphoenix, but deletion review has the discretion to overturn them, and I think we should in this case, even if the AfD is quite old. We could also relist, but in my opinion the old AfD and the non-negotiability of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is sufficient grounds to delete. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

US Senator <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Nunn_1450.html" title="Sam Nunn">Sam Nunn</a> discusses the coinage of the term in one of his own scholarly articles and discusses whether the distinction between suicidal motives and military motives on the part of the bombers may be helpful in profiling possible bombers.

In particular, the article as written today seems to address all of Sam Blanning's (and, by incorporation, Lid's) concerns in full.</li>
<li><i>Notability</i>: This is closer. Google scholar will get you about 40 hits, most of which are Israeli himself or citations to Israeli.

<li><b>Comment.</b> The repair seems to consist of adding a few links to local newspaper articles to the list of blogs involved in the squabble. Local news coverage doesn't make something notable. A google search on "Deborah Frisch" returns primarily political blogs attacking her. This article is just an attack by one political blogger against another, and should be deleted. <i>Update:</i> I see part of the repair job was to remove the categories "Abuse," "Aggression," and "Computer Crimes" from the article. I'm more convinced than ever this is a smear job, and should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 23:25, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The rewrite is an improvement but it still violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a link farm</a>. An adequate article in my opinion would be one that discusses the company's history, its officers, annual revenue, profit, etc. Otherwise, the article still looks like its more intended to attract business than it is intended to describe the business. Also, even if the preceding information were provided, the company would still have to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia guidelines for notability of companies</a>.

<dd>The critical piece, as I see it, is having the article reference publications which mention the company without being just a regurgitation of a press release or a trade publication interview with the company. In other words, it must be a "real" news article and not just some sycophantic trade journal article which is a PR promotion disguised as a news article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> provides the details.</dd>

<dd>OK, perhaps I should have <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumed good faith</a>. The bulk of the article remains a list of Internet sites which, while they are not formatted as clickable URLs and are not placed in the External Links section, are still nothing more than a list of external websites. Moreover, the formatting is such that the listing of these websites takes up a prominent part of the article. It wouldn't be so bad if the list of websites was 5-10% of the article and provided as a simple list separated by commas. Putting them in bullet points with section titles for each grouping causes them to dominate the article. Thus, despite Torimadi's comment below, the article still looks to me like a solicitation for people to visit the gambling sites. I'm not familiar with other articles on Internet gambling in Wikipedia but, if they are all like this one, they are all candidates for deletion. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> and make the article conform to the requirements therein.
<dl>
<dd>Actually, since they have a parent company in Christchurch Casinos, this should be redirected and added as a subcategory of that article, like you suggested earlier. That would be consistent with how other gambling companies are handled. <a href="../../../r/r/a/User%7ERray_9aaf.html" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> 21:17, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The current version of the page doesn't seem promotional at all to me, and isn't it better for the end user to provide a link to the official site? That being said, the mention of an article for the parent company with the the Kiwi page as a sub sounds reasonable as well, but it should still contain the official site link in my opinion. Torimadi 16:37, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. This should be treated linke all similar companies and articles. An article about the parent company should be created, and this redirected to it, with all the useful info incorporated in the parent of course. If nobody beats me to it, I'll make a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch_Casino_f5d6.html" title="Christchurch Casino">Christchurch Casino</a> article. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 00:05, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whoa there, hoss. Slow down. I'm glad that we could forge a compromise between the two of us but we can't just slough off the opinions of the other editors who have chimed in on this discussion. For a fuller explanation, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Can_the_nominator_of_an_AFD_withdraw_it_once_a_consensus_to_delete_has_been_formed.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Can_the_nominator_of_an_AFD_withdraw_it_once_a_consensus_to_delete_has_been_formed.3F" rel="nofollow">this conversation on Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. What we need to do now is get enough of the "delete" votes to switch to "redirect". I have started the process by expressing my change of opinion immediately below the nomination. You can help by contacting (OK, spamming) each of the "delete" votes and asking them to reconsider their vote. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 05:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Probably should take your own advice. First, you inappropriately put up an article for afd that should have been prodded instead. An article did not belong under this name since that is not how any other similar articles are done. Second, you seem to have not assumed anything like good faith a couple times, the second time saying "Whoa there, hoss. Slow down" when Rray simply said to move ahead with the redirect. I'd suggest being a little more deliberate, especially before starting premature things like this. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 06:35, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm... you're mixing together a bunch of things that are not necessarily related. I will address them individually though not necessarily in order.</dd>
<dd>First, as far as I can tell, the choice between PROD and AFD is the nominator's call. If the nominator thinks that it is unlikely that the PROD will be objected to, he can PROD the article in order to shorten the process required for deletion. I admit that I chose AFD as the conservative route since I'm not particularly experienced in CSD and PROD. I can understand being criticized for SPEEDY'ing an article that didn't meet the criteria. I didn't think this article met the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> although, on reflection, it was pretty close to meeting "No content whatsoever. Any article consisting only of links elsewhere". I didn't think the article was likely to be PROD-worthy because, if nothing else, I expected the author of the article to object. Frankly, I just can't make any sense out of your criticism here. Maybe you can enlighten me as to what you think I should have done instead of nominating this article for AFD.</dd>

<dd>Third, as far as my failing to Assume Good Faith, I really thought that RRay could understand what I meant when I characterized his article as still violating "WP is not a link farm". I didn't think I had to spell it out for him. Turns out I was wrong so I apologized. BTW, in my humble opinion, the new <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch_Casino_f5d6.html" title="Christchurch Casino">Christchurch Casino</a> article still violates "WP is not a link farm" and "WP is not hosting service for advertisements and promtotions" as it stands but has the potential to become a real article if someone will put real effort into expanding it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Given the repeated failure to add any substantive encyclopedic information about <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Gaming_b95d.html" title="Kiwi Gaming">Kiwi Gaming</a> OR <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch_Casino_f5d6.html" title="Christchurch Casino">Christchurch Casino</a> into either article, I find it increasingly difficult to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I have Googled Christchurch Casino so I know that there is some encyclopedic material out there on the Net. Presumably there is more available from sources that are not on the Net e.g. number of employees, annual revenue, whether it is the only casino in Christchurch, the largest or just one among many. What is the nature of the corporation? (Private or public) Who owns it? Who are the management? Etc., etc. So why hasn't that material been added? The failure to address these issues suggests an assumption that promotion of the online gambling websites is the primary agenda here. I have turned unacceptable articles into acceptable articles in far less time than has been elapsed since this article was nominated for AFD. Just today, I have done this with respect to the <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty_in_India_b565.html" title="Poverty in India">Poverty in India</a> article. If you really believe that this material is encyclopedic then it is incumbent on you to raise the quality of the article to meet Wikipedia's standards. I considered doing it but I figured there are enough "Keep" votes here to share the work.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The "I won't insult your intelligence" bit was borderline uncivil and I apologize for that. I believe I provided adequate links for RRay to acquaint himself with Wikipedia policy. Skirting around the "not a link farm" policy by claiming "only one external link" is asking a bit much.</dd>

<dd>Fourth, the "Whoa there, hoss" may have been a bit over-familiar and jocular but the point remains that there are procedural issues that need to be dealt with regarding the Redirect before we could "move ahead with the Redirect". RRay didn't hint that he was aware of these issues and I frankly wanted to check on my understanding before committing to a particular stance here. So I did just that over at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>.</dd>

<li>Totally false. There is no reason to make this article an exception to the standard way every single other similar company has articles.

<li>Great, thanks. Based on looking at about 5 or 6 of the articles in the category, I would challenge Vegaswikian's assertion that <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Gaming_b95d.html" title="Kiwi Gaming">Kiwi Gaming</a> is "no different than many of the others that we already have". Most of the articles in the category are superior to the <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Gaming_b95d.html" title="Kiwi Gaming">Kiwi Gaming</a> article. Of these, <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabcorp_Holdings_0e74.html" title="Tabcorp Holdings">Tabcorp Holdings</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/GoldenPalace.com_431e.html" title="GoldenPalace.com">GoldenPalace.com</a> stand out as being some of the best. At least one article (<a href="../../../e/v/e/EverestPoker.com_97a4.html" title="EverestPoker.com">EverestPoker.com</a>) is not much better than <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Gaming_b95d.html" title="Kiwi Gaming">Kiwi Gaming</a>. That suggests that <a href="../../../e/v/e/EverestPoker.com_97a4.html" title="EverestPoker.com">EverestPoker.com</a> should be either expanded or put up for AFD. It might be useful to go through each article in the category and identify candidates for a "improve or delete" drive. Further discussion on this thread that is not directly related to the <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Gaming_b95d.html" title="Kiwi Gaming">Kiwi Gaming</a> AFD should probably be moved to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Gambling_47b9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gambling">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gambling</a> --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable nickname for Duke used by UNC fans. By this logic, the most trivial of nicknames deserves its own article.

<ul>
<li>The redirect is to benefit a reader who types the phrase into the search box. Therefore, for a reader who encounters the phrase "University of New Jersey at Durham" elsewhere and comes to Wikipedia for an explanation, the redirect should go to the article where the phrase is explained. That's <a href="../../../u/n/c/UNC-Duke_rivalry_ec5d.html" title="UNC-Duke rivalry">UNC-Duke rivalry</a>. The phrase isn't sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a> article, so a redirect there would be less useful to the reader. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 15:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - So all nicknames are not treated equally? Your suggestion would make sense if UNC fans were the only people using the nickname. But it's a nickname for Duke, so it should redirect there, if the article absolutely must be killed.<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> 15:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Offhand, I can't think of any nicknames that would merit a separate article, but there might be some that are so notable as to qualify. If so, they'd be treated differently for that reason. Every nonnotable nickname should redirect to the article that will be most useful to the reader who types the nickname into the search box. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 16:05, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So we're back where we started. Bronx Bombers=New York Yankees, University of New Jersey at Durham=Duke University? If that's the way the redirect is set up, I'll stop objecting to this silly deletion proceeding. <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> 16:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - So, Chapel Hell and Carowhina should redirect to UNC by this logic. Tarholes should redirect to Tarheels. And Big High School should redirect to NC State. I personally think none of these should be redirects, but if others disagree, then all of these should exist in case people come across any of these terms in articles. I wouldn't object to that.

<p>This article is about the founder of <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eigomanga.html" title="Eigomanga">Eigomanga</a>. An article already exists for the company. Outside of this context, he is not particularly <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notable</a>; most of the article is about his various jobs, such as a translator and consultant. None of the material in the article is <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">referenced</a>, and it generally reads as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">vanity</a> article, especially if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austin_Osueke&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austin_Osueke&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history</a> is taken into account. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Austin+Osueke" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Austin+Osueke" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> yields only about sixty or so references to Eigomanga's Austin Osueke, most from press releases.

<li>Comment: Does somebody have a reliable source for the Science Olympiad claim (I'm sure it must exist, but wouldn't know where to look)? I don't understand how that makes the topic more, or less, encyclopedic, particularly when an appropriate source isn't cited. Hopefully, we're not encouraging people to make uncited claims of notability, just so they can avoid deletion. Its far better to start an article with only easily verified, uncontestable facts first (e.g. name,location,size,grades,etc...), and leave unsourced claims to later, when a proper source is found and cited. Its my personal preference to simply remove such uncited claims, but I suppose that would cause upset, so I haven't. p.s. I note an early version of the article, was quite candid in citing its sources, as "<i>various El Rancho students</i>". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:07, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It isn't just deletionist who have issues with including all the schools, and saying that since most(note not all) earlier attempts have not gotten the articles deleted is not in fact a keep argument. The claim that all schools are notable is very far from an agreed upon claim. As to "organic growth"- even at least one school inclusionist also considers "organic growth" to be a buzzword with no actual meaning. Making viable arguments is a good thing. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:12, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe that this is a non-notable messageboard. We don't, for example, have an article about the University of Michigan's forum.

<li>Zeppelin: Who are you to judge what is notable or not. If the University of Michigan forum wishes to have a piece about it then it is not any of my business. The Sin Boards are a great resource for people to interact with in a college setting where they are not judged by their appearance or their position in society but mearly by their words and actions. That is a great thing and something that should be remembered and the community that is created online should be fostered. Not distoyed by someone with an inflated sense of self importance. Also how is this not of note. Reading through the opinion on the board you get the real ideas and thoughts of people in Ireland. For instance of the links is to a debate on Northern Ireland. With sides of the arguement that are never heard outside of Ireland. Have a read of that thread and see if you don't learn something about the conflict in Northern Ireland that you would not hear about in America.

<li>Paddy: Indeed, Zeppelin is right on the ball. With the ever-increasing fees slowly creeping into the Irish third-level education system, the prospect of people being "left behind" in society grows greater each day, i.e. the less well-off members of society. Great strides have been made by the Department of Education and Science in recent years to increase the number of those people from the bottom end of the income ladder who are most at risk of being excluded from receiving a full education. Various initiatives have resulted in totals losers (up to that point), making it through. Now, you may ask how the Sin Boards fits into this? Well, it's like this: on reading the Sin Boards, you will quickly see that the posters on the Sin Boards are nothing more than the dregs of society, scrapped from the bottoms of buckets littered throughout the west of Ireland. These people struggle through the system, not because of the support offered by the insitution itself, but in spite of it. The Sin Boards members collectively provide a full support system for students who fail exams, miss their annual registration, can't find appropriate accommodation within which to base their studies in an already difficult environment, get into serious financial difficulty or just find their housemates to be really annoying. It offers an opportunity for members to discuss the best and worst moments of their day from seeing a nice flower near your house to having to walk to college on a rainy day, similar to how Americans openly discuss their "feelings" and then give out about people prying so deeply into their lives. In addition, it's the oldest and most successful forum in any educational institute in Ireland, some achievement for a small university in the west of Ireland. The forum picks up some three million hits per year. Multiple awards collected over recent years make testament to the success of these Boards. If the University of Michigan chooses not to set up something to support those unfortunate people from the lowest rung of society in their particular area, good for them, but I feel that the Sin Boards are something to be proud of. (And that's all from a neutral, not involved in any way whatsoever, not even a little bit, standpoint.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.203.7.33 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.203.7.33_db9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.203.7.33">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Sure there are thousands of boards on the web but a small proportion of these provide a service on the same level that the Sin Boards do. As Paddy and zeppelin pointed out, it is an irreplacable resource to the students of NUI, Galway, as university that attracts people from all over the world to study and an external source of information on the boards can only be beneficial to all concerned. - Triangler <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.42.29.112 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.42.29.112_4e9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.42.29.112">contribs</a>) 2006-09-20 15:56:25 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Perspective</b> Most of the posts in favour of deletion are reasonable however a lack of local knowledge is blinding you to the genuine usefulness of the boards. Galway has a population in the region of 80,000 people. The university has a student population in the region of 15,000. I can understand completely that from your perspective, the boards are insignificant but given the size of the university population in relation to the size of Galway as a whole, I can assure you, the boards are more significant than you realise. - Triangler <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.42.29.112 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.42.29.112_4e9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.42.29.112">contribs</a>) 2006-09-20 23:43:36 (UTC)</small>

I haven't even solicited others for input yet, and I think that's important. By the way, have you even read the Malazan series?

As for secondary sources, it is unlikely you will ever get secondary sources on any work of fiction - by necessity you are working within the canon. By nature, secondary sources would only happen when you get people writing theses or major literary analyses of <b>big</b> books, a la Tolkien and so forth. If you look at the Star Wars main page, the references are to George Lucas' work, not SW per se, and the sub-pages contain lots of text, some to encyclopaedias about the universe, but also references to the actual novels. I would think that using the original works is a necessity, and the standards are maintained by peers who have read it rather than continuous references to page numbers.<a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 12:27, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do you mean that we should have articles on every Civil War veteran? Why? As for being family to famous Old West figurines: would you also include articles about Joseph McCarty-Antrim, Susan Lavenia James, or the unnmaed two brothers and three sisters of Calamity Jane?

<li>Figurines? I'm going to assume it's a translation error rather than a slur of some sort.

<dd>Apologies for "figurines", it was not intentional. I meant figures. And your example is incorrect, since each of the Jackson Five are famous for being a member of the band.

<dd>Newton Earp is not famous, that is correct. However, how many of the Jackson Five can most people name? I'd say two, maybe three. Newton Earp is part of the Earp family, and, much like Paris Hilton, is famous for nothing more than family ties. However, it is notable and part of what shaped Wyatt Earp, as he ran away from home more than once to be like his three older brothers who were serving in the army at the time. I believe the article should remain because it helps identify and define who Wyatt Earp was, and, although the man himself may not be famous, his family is. That's my opinion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.47.88.133 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.47.88.133.html" title="User talk:208.47.88.133">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.47.88.133_da5c.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.47.88.133">contribs</a>) 15:03, 22 September, 2006.</small></dd>

<p>This article, written by an editor with the same name as the contact given for the WIF, makes extraordinary claims -- the planned construction of a global science city being the most remarkable, with the huge number of claimed Nobelist members not being far behind. (The same editor has also linked large numbers of scientists' Wikipedia articles to this article, and also to the WIF website; so many that I blocked them for linkspamming.)</p>
<p>Yet, apart from a number of distinguished academics having accepted fellowships and other awards offered in letters from the WIF, there seems to be remarkably little evidence to back up its claims that does not come, directly or indirectly, from the WIF itself. See <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#World_Innovation_Foundation" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#World Innovation Foundation</a> for more discussion about this, and details of some of the concerns about verifying the WIF's claims.</p>
<p>I propose that we <b>delete</b> this article unless verifiable evidence can be provided for the assertions in this article. If the WIF is an organization of the size and significance asserted by the article, it should have no difficulty doing so. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 13:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete -- The WIF website contains very little verifiable data, and looks like a front.

<li>Judging by the the comments on the WIF site's letters page <a href="http://www.thewif.org.uk/letters.php?xy=1920" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewif.org.uk/letters.php?xy=1920" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>: the WIF appears to send out large numbers of letters to academics, offering them honorary fellowships, and academics write back to say thank you, they'd be honoured to accept. As one commenter on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> notes, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> is well known for this kind of activity. Now, if these academics have done more than just reply politely to letters offering them an honour, and perhaps release a press release that they were being recognized by such an honour -- for example, if they had attended committee meetings or conferences held by the WIF -- I'd be much more inclined to accept at least some of the WIF's claims. However, I think the burden of proof lies with the WIF to demonstrate this. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 15:41, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Personally I never suspected the organization of being an outright hoax; as others have pointed out, there is evidence it's real. But merely existing isn't enough. I've yet to see any verifiable evidence that the organization is notable, and I think it's telling that the only person who has added information about the organization seems to be trying to promote it. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 17:09, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to be clear, the original criterion identified for the deletion of the article was that it was not verified information.

<ul>
<li>The issues aren't completely separate: I think the claim that the organization <i>exists</i> is verifiable, but the claims that it's <i>notable</i> aren't (for example, there's no source for "it can count on the individual and collective support of...87 Nobel Laureates"). What criteria others use is up to them. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 17:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. If it exists <i>as claimed in the article</i>, complete with its Swiss foundation and planned global research city on its way, then it is certainly notable, and the article should be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm a little unclear as to how the WIF is supposed to come up with proof of its existence, when the primary editor of this article has been blocked from contributing because of the linkspam issue noted above. The person who is in the best position to provide the evidence is not able to contribute. Messages were left on his talk page about link spamming (not verifiability), and there are no comments to the article's talk page expressing concerns about verifiability. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 15:53, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is actually false, the burden of proof is not on the organizations as most do not post here. To say they are not notable after apparently information saying they are, means the burden of proof is on the accuser. You can do a google search some people list it as their highest honor and there are speeches WIF members gave, though I am sure they are known for more then that. Also our lack of ability to google their conferences, does not mean they do not take place. While I personally do not believe they exist, the "proof" says otherwise. As I stated on AN/I perhaps its best to contact some of the prestigious members and find out if this is a hoax, but I do think that more info needs to be rounded up before Wikipedia denounces it a hoax. What a black eye it would be if they are real and Wikipedia called such a group fake. Perhaps Arbcom or some legal aspect of Wikipedia should investigate this. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not about proving them fake; rather, it is about proving their assertions to be real. The burden of proof for a <i>positive</i> assertion is always on the person making the assertion, in this case, the original writer of the article, who, at least on the face of it, appears to be a representative of the WIF. Otherwise, editors are put in the position of having to prove a negative. This is implicit in the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 16:37, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Proving something is ahoax isnt proving a negative, proving lots of sceintists are fooled is not proving a negative. I have given numerous links showing people belong to this group, their website speaks for itself as well. Its membership speaks for itself as well. If it exists, I think this AfD is not proper way to handle this and Arbcom or someone should put in some research time, or a phone call to them. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 16:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

It may fall short of a 'hoax', per say, as the organization does exist, but in the same sense that a diploma mill is not a real institute of higher learning, this is not "multi-billion dollar global centre for scientific research." Public relations releases from universities mean nothing, as those PR departments at universities are vicious at taking whatever they can. As it stands currently, its a joke. Why are their offices and registrations in the UK, if they're based out of Sweden? Where's the past information and coverage about this organization? As Uncle G puts it, each of the pieces of 'news' have the same PR-style wording. Not only do I belive the subject is not notable, but in the end nearly all the claims are unverifiable and dubious. Plus, there's vanity involved. Last, where's these research centers that are supposedly all around the world? Burn it.

Even if it's a hoax, if it has indeed attracted so many Nobel prizewinners (most of them well into their twilight years, by the look of it), it would be a notable hoax. As it is, there is a vanishingly small amount of evidence about the organisation which does not come from its own website and "executive chairman". --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 12:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As somewhat of a newbie, I judge articles based not on what I think at all, and only according to (rather strict reading of) WP guidelines. Let me also preface the rest of this by saying I am far from a prude, and widely circulated many of the above listed phrases amongst friends back in the day, and in an attempt to see what human are capable of I have a library of some rather gross and disgusting images and videos which frankly don't disgust me anymore. So, coming upon this article I did first what I usually do: read the appropriate guidelines, in this case <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. To judge a neologism on whether you've heard of it seems to suggest you haven't read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> lately. What are these guidleines for if arguments are made which ignore them? In spite on what I've read on the other sexual neologism debates, I think they, too, still fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> miserably, and suggest another debate on the merits of them at all. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyanakoolaid_5548.html" title="User:Guyanakoolaid">Guyanakoolaid</a> 22:47, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah yes, but remember the steamer. Remember the Dirty Sanchez. Read the AfD's for those. The Cleveland steamer was even taken to DRV by an admin after it was kept, an unprecedented move at the time, as DRV was at that time only for appeals on <i>deleted</i> articles. No one seems to want to hear debate on this type of article anymore. It's apparently been discussed to death. The only solution I can see is to keep things like the Carlsbad grimple to set a low bar for inclusion for sex moves. Then, every silly sex move from Urban Dictionary will be copied over into Wikipedia and someone higher up than I will be compelled to do something about it in the form of a policy. Poetlister's vote is valid as it is clearly based on <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, an old policy.

<dd>Well to a certain extent I agree with you, even though I was the one who originally made this page. It isn't really enough info for an individual page.

<dd>Hi Gerovitus, please note that (as I said) I'm not suggesting anything bad has happened, merely choosing to retract a bit of my comment. But also: sorry! Because I see that you're absolutely correct, and I got it backwards about the fact that the "see also" (though not the categories) was new to the IAM article on September 5th. However, I stand by my point that however excellent the Advanced Driving UK website may be, (and I don't want to knock it as a site), it may not be notable enough for WP. The bottom line though is that the Institute of Advanced Motorists <i>is</i> different because it's a long-established registred Charity which does things in the physical world and is recognised by many insurance companies, which makes it notable. A website ought to be pretty special to be notable on Wikipedia. As has been noted below, Slashdot meets that criteria by having a very large number of users indeed. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 22:32, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ADUK has links with one of the largest insurance broker's in the UK. The IAM qualification is only officially recognised by AON (IAM Select). The IAM's charity documents clearly show the IAM's commercial goals, they're article is an advert. Gerovitus 22:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It would help the article's case then, to include those links with the insurance broker. And also, if you think the IAM article is an advert, that's not a defence of your article, it's a reason to change the IAM one, or nominate it for deletion also, surely? – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 22:55, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The AD-UK entry should remain, IMO. It's a very valuable resource for thos wishing to improve their driving and is well-subscribed by some very highly qualified road drivers who assist them in doing so. Given that there are entries in Wikipedia for such organisations as Sustrans and Transport 2000, there's no reason not to allow AD-UK to remain as an entry. They have ostensibly similar objectives although AD-UK is probably more practically oriented for drivers who wish to make a positive contribution to road safety in the here and now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.93.21.134 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.134.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.134">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.134_14f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.134">contribs</a>).</small> <small>19:38, 9 September 2006</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Having read and taken on board the comments in defence of the article, I've tried giving it a bit of a cleanup, and crucially given it an opening sentence which defines what kind of a thing is being talked about – previously the article dived straight into prose, not in very clear Wikipedia style, and one was left unsure of the nature of the entity. It remains unstated whether it's a company, charity or unincorporated body. I've also toned down the number of times the name of the website is mentioned (with capital letters) which hopefully go towards making it all a bit more readable. The main problem with the article now is the number of unreferenced statistics and statements (i.e. "you can help"&#160;;-) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 14:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>To Alex and Marius:</b> this article reads like a non-encyclopedic essay.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not a dictionary, agreed. Craic is wider than a dictionary definition, it is a cultural concept which I don't think has been explained in enough detail here. If someone Irish could expand on this a bit more, that would be great. It was of great help to me, having heard this used in a cultural concept so many times. The last use of this I heard was around how the wealthy Irish were taking over the English racing scene. The Irish were everywhere and the English complaint on the Irish was summed up as "craic seems to be nothing more than people saying how great the craic is". User:patrickfitzg</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Although the article requires cleanup, the topic is certainly notable and encyclopedic under all applicable Wikipedia standards, as well as any imaginable common-sense standard. If the only available options were Keep and Delete, I would vote Strong Keep. However, the game in which this play occurred is itself notable and encyclopedic, and as such, I would argue that this article should be merged with a newly created article about the game. Unlike <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Play_c4c5.html" title="The Play">The Play</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catch_%28American_football%29_4585.html" title="The Catch (American football)">The Catch</a>, the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_Reception_5506.html" title="Immaculate Reception">Immaculate Reception</a>, the Doug Flutie <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_pass_e730.html#History" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary</a> and other notable plays, the Bush Push was part of a game that will be remembered for much more than just that one play. The USC-Notre Dame game of October 15, 2005 is widely considered one of the best games in college football history (some would say <i>the</i> best, but it's probably too early to make that judgment), and it had two other plays/moments that were just as individually memorable/extraordinary as the Bush Push: the 4th-and-9 pass from Matt Leinart to Dwayne Jarrett, and the out-of-bounds fumble by Leinart which caused the Notre Dame student section to prematurely rush the field, thinking they'd won the game because the clock had prematurely run out. The Bush Push, of course, was the next play. But even beyond these three plays/moments, the whole game was extraordinary and notable. It was one of the most-hyped games in recent memory (for example, the Friday-night pep rally at Notre Dame Stadium was nationally televised), and yet amazingly, it managed to exceed the hype. The game also proved very significant to the overall 2005 college football season, as it allowed USC to remain undefeated and ultimately reach the national-title game; if the Irish had won, they might very well have reached the title game in the Trojans' stead, or else Penn State would have gone. Anyway, the game itself deserves an article, and the Bush Push should be a substantial segment of that article, and the Bush Push page should redirect to that article. 129.74.201.21 15:09, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If the only available options are Keept and Delete, I would delete. The article, while covering a notable and encyclopedic topic, is not itself very encyclopedic. It is written with a sneer at Notre Dame. If an option is to rewrite it as objectively as possible, then by all means keep it. For example, "a well-known ploy" with respect to the green jerseys. That statement has little encyclopedic value. Also, the author is mistaken that "Irish partisans . . . roared with approval." Sure, they cheered for the team, but Irish fans in the stadium were generally apprehensive about the green jerseys. Anyway, what does all this talk about jerseys have to do with the play? It seems to serve the contributors purpose to simply mock and sneer at Notre Dame. I would keep the basic facts, but re-write it without any bias. I would also modify it so that all spelling errors are corrected ("rejoyced" anyone?).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The term is a neologism that relates to more than just hockey and I can find no valid source for the quote used in the article for "notability". On top of that, the article has a hoax fact that the term is somehow related to the "knucklepuck" shot from the Mighty Ducks movie(s) (a "wounded duck" has no power behind it and flobs to its target, like a tipped pass in football; the knucklepuck takes an erratic flight similar to a knuckleball pitch, due to intentional end-over-end rotation of the puck). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 17:57, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: I've heard the term used (very rarely) to describe a wobbly or errant pass in football; certainly not in hockey, to which the article alludes.

<p>Prod removed because someone disagreed that this should be deleted without discussion, so listing now. My main concern with this article is that there is nothing special about songs that start with telephone sounds. If this is kept it opens the door for Songs that start with burping noises, Songs that start with baboons arguing, and Songs that start with with someone saying the word banana. In other words, it opens the door for a list of songs that start with ANYTHING, a potentially endless amount of lists. My other concern was that this list was entirely unsourced, however the person who removed the prod added a couple sources for individual songs. The vast majority still isn't sourced. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a collection of indiscriminate information. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Additionally, I disagree about it being unsourced. The primary source is implicit in the content - all you need to do to verify whether a particular song meets the criteria is to listen to the song in question!

<p>Article was prodded, but author deprodded for consistency with First to Sixth Party System. It looks to me as if the whole range is fairly unnotable, but that the use of the terms declines dramatically to the end of the range, making the article Seventh Party System a case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Seventh Party System gets 10 distinct Google hits, which is terribly low for something that only started in 1994. Of these links, at least this one<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/2897/index54.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/2897/index54.html" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> lets the seventh start in 2000 at the earliest. This article<a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/polparties/sexracrel.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jofreeman.com/polparties/sexracrel.htm" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> only agrees on the first five (which are not up for deletion), and sees the outlines of a seventh system only in 1996. So we have very few references for a seventh party system, and the few we have disagree seriously. This makes the concept non notable and the article <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> or at least not according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and hard to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I say we Keep this article. I surely agree that there may be disagreement as to when the Seventh began, but that point is worthy of noting in the article itself. It certainly isn't a valid reason or point to delete the article. If you feel the whole range is unnotable, perhaps the proposal to delete should be the whole range, not just one part of it. In fact by selectively deleting only this one portion, it would leave the reader confused as to the missing time frame (that you propose to delete.) I don't believe there would be much support at all to delete the entire range, as it is a scholarly term and subject much studied. As far as google hits, many somewhat abstract scholarly discussions will not find a wide discourse in general society. That surely is no reason to delete from wikipedia, or any encyclopedia for that matter. (You will find many topics with articles in wikipedia that are far less scholarly or otherwise used than this, and they too are worthy of maintaining inclusion.) Wikipedia has no requirements as far as numerical google hits.</li>

<dd>On a further note, being that we were discussing google results, John H. Aldrich of Duke University is one of the scholars as far back as in 1997 (in Political Science Quarterly, see <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195(199724%2F199824)112%3A4%3C541%3ATTTRRI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195(199724%2F199824)112%3A4%3C541%3ATTTRRI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> ) made the polical science observation that we are currently in the Seventh Party System.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-historical, nonreferenced. Just because some poly sci wonks have speculated about a seventh party realignment, it does not mean it should be presented as a scholarly consensus, as this article appears to do. From a practical standpoint, the article makes no argument for any great sea change in the parties in 1994, only that the Republicans took control of the Congress in that year. I don't see why the "Seventh Party System" would not have begun in 1980 ("<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_Revolution_b6cf.html" title="Reagan Revolution">Reagan Revolution</a>"; "<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reagan_coalition.html" title="Reagan coalition">Reagan coalition</a>" controls Congress) or 1972 (<a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Presidential_Election%2C_1972_fe0b.html" title="U.S. Presidential Election, 1972">Nixon Landslide</a>, effective death of '60s-style big government liberalism). <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<dd>Allon, I think you would be better suited to suggest the article be updated to clarify your points, rather than delete the article in its entirety. Certainly it has historical value, and we have some references in this discussion (see above) that ought to be included in the article itself. As far as scholarly consensus is concerned, we could discuss in the article any scholarly disagreements as to the timeframe of the Seventh, when it began, when the Sixth ended, etc. In 1994 the Congress became Republican for the first time in 40 (fourty) years.) That it seems is quite a sea change. It certainly is a strong argument for the scholars who classify the Seventh beginning in 1994. In any event, these points ought to be mentioned in the article. (Hence the reason why the article is currently classified as a 'stub'.) <a href="../../../1/6/9/User%7E169.132.18.248.html" title="User:169.132.18.248">169.132.18.248</a> 14:54, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the term is only used by very few authors, and even those disagree on when and how. What makes "seventh party system" notable? Being the logical next after "sixth" is no argument,a we could then just create "eigth", "ninth" and "tenth" as well. e should have articlse on scientific terms that are widely used in their speciality, but it looks like "seventh party system" is not widely used at all and is rather obscure. When it gets more mainstream (at least to the level of "fifth party system", although even fourth and fifth party system are still pretty obscure), then an article would be warranted. Now, it seems that only very few authors / scholars use the term, while mainstream politicologists / historians don't use this classification, certainly not for recent times. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

Now your saying even the 4th &amp; 5th are "pretty obscure" (in your words), it seems you are arguing to delete the whole series.

<li><b>Comment</b> This discussion has gotten off track. The argument isn't that this is an obscure poly sci term, but that <i>to the extent</i> political scientists have spoken of this term it has been speculative. This article passes it off as common wisdom that there was a party realignment in 1994-- which it isn't-- and does so completely absent of sourcing. Now, if someone were to add sources to the article, that would be a VERY different situation. The point is, as it is written the article is very misleading; there is no consensus or even substantial academic support that I know of for the idea that a new party system began in 1994. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 23:35, 22 September 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<p>The remark of the above party is a very 'anti-book' remark. Most of the best writers have started out by self publishing. "A good book is a good book--regardless of who printed it" is my motto.</p>
<p>LEGERDEMAIN is a fully, legally published book, which is, indeed, the only <i>non-theory</i> book ever published on the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. It has been featured repeatedly at the Amelia Earhart Festival in Atchison, KS and is drawing increasing attention. It represents a step forward in collecting and correlating the knowledge on this subject. The party who posted the complaint should get a copy of the book and check it out before lodging complaints. --David K. Bowman, wikiman999</p>

<p>Three articles relating to a local band from Buffalo, New York (the band, an unreleased "album", and a list of also unreleased songs). The "album" appears to refer to a performance they did on a local college radio show; I suppose it may have been recorded, but any recording isn't even available on their website. As mentioned, the band has a website, as well as a MySpace page, and their gigs are posted on setlist.com, but that's about it. They have not achieved any of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">indicators of notability</a> commonly used for musical groups. The articles are orphans with no other links from elsewhere in Wikipedia. They appear to have been created by a group member (some of the text is a copy of what appears on their MySpace page), and there's an absence of sources aside from what they're saying about themselves. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article violates wikipedia's cardinal content policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Moreover it is also a duplicate of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> but with the twist that a newly coined term i.e. 'Islamic Emirate of Waziristan' has been used in order to give the uninformed reader the illusion that there is some newly formed independent state which has been set up in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The fact of the matter is that the tribal areas or <a href="../../../f/a/t/FATA_c9b8.html" title="FATA">FATA</a> have always been out of the bounds of the central government and even though the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> binds the government to remove newly constructed security check points in the region; it does not call for the total withdrawl of government presence and creation of some separate state, as has been implied here. As such this article is a total work of fiction and is based on false foundations. The references are weak, to say the least, and thus this article needs to be removed.

<li><b>Additional comment</b> The only reference, out of all the <i>neutral</i> references provided, which even mentions (and very briefly) this fictitious term of the 'Islamic Emirate of Waziristan' is the one from Newsweek. All the other references are about the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> or its ramifications. I won't comment on the Press Trust of India report as it is an Indian goverment mouthpiece and does not fall into the sphere of a <i>neutral</i> source when it comes to topics pertaining to Pakistan. Thus just writing up a new wikipedia article based on a term which has only been mentioned by one news outlet in only one of their reports is, in my opinion, not something which can be called a verifiable piece and hence will go against wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy according to my judgement.

<p>Despite Red aRRow’s unsupported assertion, this article does violate the principle of verifiability. Quite the contrary; the article is rather well footnoted. Red aRRow need only refer to footnotes one and two to verify the article’s introduction. As such, Red aRRow’s insertion of verification needed edit is clearly erroneous and borders on vandalism (as does the entire attempt to delete this article). The fact that a publication has printed facts which contradict an official state policy (of any government) does not render that publication irreputable.</p>
<p>Second, Red aRRow’s assertion that this article “is also a duplicate of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>” is simply incorrect. One need only compare the two articles—both their content and their citations—to discern the difference. However, one correction should be noted with respect to the article and the term “Islamic Emirate of Waziristan.” The author of the article states that "The Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is the name <b>given by some commentators</b> to an area of Waziristan, Pakistan that they say gained de facto recognition from the Government of Pakistan on September 5, 2006 as a result of negotiations between Islamabad and local tribesmen to end the undeclared Waziristan War.” (Emphasis added.) Actually, the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is not what “some commentators” have termed this de facto autonomous region; rather, it is the name coined by the Pakistani Taliban for their new “state.” (See <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/</a> at ¶ 2.)</p>
<p>Third, whether or not the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan exists as a de facto state is irrelevant to its validity as an article. Contrary to Red aRRow’s unsupported assertion that the article is “a total work of fiction,” the article is fully verified and factual. Unlike Red aRRow, the author makes no assertions of opinion, and also unlike Red aRRow, virtually all of the article’s facts are cited to legitimate and reputable original sources.</p>
<p>Red aRRow is obviously passionate about the Pakistani government’s reputation in light of the peace treaty recently signed with the Taliban in Waziristan. Nevertheless, Nationalist passion—however fervent—should not be allowed to dictate which articles remain in Wikipedia, and which are deleted. A review of Red aRRow in existing Wikipedia pages reveals a singular concern for maintaining Pakistani honor, which is perfectly legitimate as long as the arguments are factual and based on violations of Wikipedia policy. In this case, they are not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the article fortunately documents, the Pakistani government has essentially stated that it would like to have the article deleted. Nationalism is not a basis upon which to delete an article. Indeed, the irony of Red aRRow’s and the Pakistani government’s arguments is that to delete the article would itself be a violation of Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>I would respectfully disagree with Sandstein’s two arguments. First, as pointed out above (and by Sandstein himself), the article is verified.</p>
<p>With respect to the neologism argument, I would say that while perhaps technically true, a neologism is not fatal per se. Moreover, given how recently it was “created,” the disputed nature of its status, and its geographic and cultural remoteness, to say the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is a neologism doesn’t mean a whole lot—it’s somewhat of a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a>. Likewise, given how underreported this region is, to wait until a vague “mainstream use” is attained offers no benefit other than denying the reader the opportunity to educate himself and seek out original sources. Finally, the article should not be deleted until “such a state is actually founded.” The point of the article is its “founding” according to the Pakistani Taliban, and arguably according to the terms of the peace treaty between Pakistan and the Taliban. If an entity is deserving of an article only if it has widespread international recognition, then shouldn’t the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnistria.html" title="Transnistria">Transnistria</a> article be deleted as well? And for that matter, the Islamic Emirate of Afganistan should as well considering the fact that only a couple of countries ever officially recognized it.</p>
<p>Finally, the phrase “<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan_b3b3.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Waziristan">Islamic Emirate of Waziristan</a>” has historical and contextual significance. This new entity was founded/is attempting to be founded by the same people who founded the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_b03f.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a>. The article should remain.

<li><b>Keep</b> As an encyclopedia the website has the right to keep this article in place, and as an independent article too i.e. not to be merged with Waziristan accord. The fact of the matter is the "Pakistani Taliban" have termed this name to their region. Their is no writ of the Government beyond Mir Ali and Miran Shah, and there never had been any government authority in the 7 Tribal agencies in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA). The author has not put his personal opinion in the article but have collected the reports of reputed journalists who have expertise in reporting the matters related to Afghanistan/Taliban. To name one such journalist is Syed Saleem Shehzad of Asia Times Online, who has been working on the subject since 9/11. A number of other press resources has been conforming with Syed Saleem's reports eversince he unvieled the story in December 2005. It has been verified from a number of resources including BBC (off and on) that Taliban have the practical control on the both sides of the Pukhtoon belt i.e. in Waziristan and the Southern Afghanistan and it is believed that sometime in coming months Mullah Omer (Taliban Supreme Leader) is expected to announce the re-emergence of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. This is the covert reason behind the Waziristan accord, Musharraf's visit to Kabul and US's unpleasant watchul comments. Both Islamabad and Kabul feel threatened the way Taliban have re-emerged. Both capitals are trying every best in their own way to stop the strong rise of Taliban, this is why Pakistan has signed the accord with the Tribal elders so that they withdraw their support for the "Pakistani Taliban". So on grounds of not having personal opinion of the writer, factual reporting on behalf of different Press sources and as an Independent credible story, the article should be kept in Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.81.213.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.81.213.157_e7d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.81.213.157">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<p>Regarding the claims that wikipedia is becoming "infested with indians", please take a look at the primary contributors to this article. I am not Indian. I am a 6th generation Irish American from the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a>. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> is a Canadian law student. Inkan1969 is not Indian as far as I can tell -- his edits suggest he's a fan of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microstate.html" title="Microstate">microstates</a>, flags, and national anthems worldwide.</p>
<p>Take a look at the two main news sources underpinning the article, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Times_Online_fb87.html" title="Asia Times Online">Asia Times Online</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>. Asia Times Online is based in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Newsweek is based in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a>. Neither have any stake in the India/Pakistan conflict. Take a look at the reporters who have provided us thes articles. Mr. Syed Saleem Shahzad, the Pakistan Bureau Chief for Asia Times Online, appears to be Muslim, not Hindu, if his name is any indication. The Newsweek reporters, Ron Moreau and Hussain Zahid, also lack Hindu names.</p>
<p>I am dumbfounded by the claims we are "Indian teenagers", "devious indians", and that our edits evidence Wikipedia is "increasingly infested with indians". How could anybody come to that conclusion? You've given me quite an education as to how high passions run on this topic, and how these emotions do not require an basis in evidence. It discredits you severely, if I can be frank. I thought the periodic insanity on the <a href="../../../t/i/b/Talk%7ETibet_6ce7.html" title="Talk:Tibet">Tibet talk</a> page was the epitome of irrational, emotional outburst, but by comparison it's a model of cold scientific reason...</p>
<p>On the topic of bias, I just took the time to check the user contributions of everyone who has voted "delete" so far in this discussion. Silly me, I took the time to check up a bit on who is saying what here. Save <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">User:Sandstein</a>, who votes "weak delete", I observe that none of you has made a single edit on any topics besides the topic of Pakistan or India/Pakistan conflict (that's Red aRRow, 82.31.151.203, 62.31.20.122, 203.82.48.56, Dizasta76, and 132.161.221.18 -- all monotopic contributors). (Not quite zero actually -- one of the IP addresses made a single edit to adjust the Muslim population quoted on the demographics of Thailand page). So you guys are not exactly the model of unbiased contributorship. I also observe the eldest of you, Red aRRow, has only been contributing since July. Prior to his involvement in this article (he is the one pushing for this VfD), his edits have been limited entirely to topics pertaining to the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Navy_09e4.html" title="Pakistan Navy">Pakistan Navy</a>...</p>
<p>I can't help but connect a dot or two. This past week the Government of Pakistan publicly stated they will take "immediate notice" of this article on Wikipedia. I'm not sure what that means, but it comes to mind that perhaps a few of you are employed by the Government of Pakistan. Nothing at all wrong with working for the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> and contributing to Wikipedia, but it does seem suspicious that the long-time Pakistani Wikipedians are silent from this dispute, while all these newbies are crying "lies!" and "fiction!" and repeatedly attaching POV and VfD flags to the article, without bothering to provide a single verifiable source to counter the references put up by the Wikipedians outside south asia.</p>
<p>Changing gears, let me add a few more points to the thoughtful contributions made above in defense of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The text of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> is secret. The press in Pakistan is regulated by the government. The area in question is remote and very dangerous, as Mtclvrt points out. Combining these conditions, it is unrealistic to expect the same level of news investigation we expect for stories unfolding in the US or Europe. When we get two independent and unbiased sources, such as we've got here, uncountered by sources to the contrary, we should take the story to the bank. Note that domestic Pakistan news organizations are not likely to take the lead in uncovering the details of an accord the Government wants kept secret. Not good for business. My personal interpretation of the Dawn News article, which reproduced most of the Wikipedia article verbatim, is that the Islamabad journalist was are keeping their readers informed by letting Wikipedia do the speaking, meanwhile keeping his head down by letting the Pakistan Foreign Office have a free swing at discrediting it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) Two independent sources attest to the existence of the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan. No verifiable source claims contrary. While I realize that few sources have the broad knowledge of the area required to conclude no such organization exists, we are fortunate to already have input from the organization best suited for understanding the situation, the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a>. When the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_News_01a3.html" title="Daily News">Daily News</a> brought the Wikipedia article to the attention of the Foreign Office, it would have been easy and natural for the Office to trivialize this group if the group did not in fact exist. Fantasies! However, the Foreign Office did not take that opportunity. Instead it only maintained that it did not cut a deal with the Taliban. Oddly enough, the Wikipedia article did not claim the IEoW was the Taliban. Somehow the Foreign Office considers the IEoW to be the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>. That's a fact in itself. How is it the Foreign Office could know this independent fact about the IEoW, if the IEoW didn't exist?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) For those of you that don't keep a close eye on current affairs, note the Musharraf government is in the midst of a major spin effort regarding the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>. One of his Brigadier Generals told <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> the accord would give sanctuary to <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> under certain conditions. The general apparently confused the domestic message on the accord (civil war is over, forgive everybody) with the international message (war on terror is important). The <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a> went crazy. Musharraf now has to pull out all the stops to reconcile what is inherently unreconcilable. All of which makes it very hard for fact-finding anywhere near this radioactive topic. All the more reason to listen carefully to any outside journalists who are able to make contact with the players in Waziristan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, on <b>merge</b> vs. <b>keep</b>: <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom harrison</a>'s suggestion to merge the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan with Waziristan Accord is not an unreasonable one, if we take a certain view of what's happening. That particular view is that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan_b3b3.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Waziristan">Islamic Emirate of Waziristan</a> is important primarily in light of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>. That view probably has the best odds of prevailing in the end, but it is not the only view out there. Another view, and this argues for <b>keep</b>, is that the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is essentially a branch of the Pakistan Taliban, and it has impact and influence apart from this accord. The very name "Islamic Emirate of Waziristan" has strong Taliban overtones, as 203.81.213.157 points out (it directly evokes the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_b03f.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan">name the Afghanistan Taliban used for itself</a>). If the Pakistan Foreign Office statement is taken at face value, the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is a Taliban organization which was not party to the accord. If so they were not partty to the accord, they should not be consolidated onto the accord page. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 22:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for your assertion that since the text of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> is a secret plus, in your opinion, the press in Pakistan seems to be regulated by the government (a claim which I personally reject as anybody with an internet browser and an internet connection can see by going over to the websites of Pakistani publications and see the blasting they are always handing out to the government e.g. here is what I found in 1 minute flat <a href="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2006/editornotesep2006.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2006/editornotesep2006.htm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/herald/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dawn.com/herald/" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>....doesn't seem to be 'regulated' to me) do not hold true as a justification for this article to be stamped as verifiable and be given a place on wikipedia. In fact this should serve as a basis for deletion because until and unless more <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence has been found regarding this fictitious <i>Emirate</i>, this article is unverifiable and violates wikipedia's cardinal policy.</dd>

<p>I am referring to the press laws imposed in 2002 that caused the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Federation_of_Journalists_5e0a.html" title="International Federation of Journalists">International Federation of Journalists</a> to write<a href="http://www.ifj-asia.org/page/ifj_protests_against_new_press_laws_in_pakistan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ifj-asia.org/page/ifj_protests_against_new_press_laws_in_pakistan.html" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The International Federation of Journalists, the world's largest journalists' organisation, representing over 500,000 journalists worldwide, is deeply concerned over the recent adoption of three new press laws that it believes will seriously impact on the freedom of the press in Pakistan.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>According to our information, the Pakistani government adopted the new press laws on August 31 2002 that increase the penalties for defamation, impose a system of prior authorisation for the news media, and create a government controlled press council, despite objections from Pakistani journalists.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We understand that the new defamation laws allow for penalties ranging from a minimum fine of US$800 through to prison sentences. We also understand that the Press Council is not independent of Government, with four representatives, including its president, appointed by the Government.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This constitutes government regulation of the press by my standards, if not by yours.</p>
<p>Regarding the general who spoke to ABC News, my mistake, he was not a <i>Brigadier</i> General. He was a <i>Major</i> General, which would be one step up from Brigadier General I'm guessing. This is not the first time my memory for detail has failed me. It was a <b>General Shaukat Sultan</b> who told ABC News on Tuesday, September 5th, that bin Laden would not be taken into custody "as long as one is being like a peaceful citizen".

Double standards, anyone? The article doesn't mention it is a state as a matter of fact, but just that some call it so, therefore it should be kept accordingly or merged with the peace accord article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your accusations are unfounded and baseless. The casualty figures needed to come from a <i>neutral</i> source and as you can see now I have added one. Although Fox News is a vehemently right wing media organization and is known for propagating the American <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-con.html" title="Neo-con">neo-con</a> agenda, still I have left your 'contribution' to the article which is sourced from that biased media organization. Plus as I have said before the article's credibility and verifiability is being debated here...not mine. Red aRRow 19:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>"Neutral" sources are hard to come by on a regular basis given that what appears to be neutral to one person may be contested as "a vehemently right wing media" by another. For all you know the one (DW link) you have added only adds half baked information which you haven't fully read yourself. If you had done that then you would probably have noticed that the 400 casualty figure mentioned in the Deutsche Welle source is for one year only and not the full duration of the conflict. I have now added the original source for the casualty claims for both sides. Further the casualty quotes I provided came directly from eminent Pakistani authors, which you removed twice before some sanity prevailed. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 06:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>btw, the FOX news article doesn't come from them. It is syndicated from Associated Press and a similar story ran in Pakistan's Daily Times.

<li><b>KEEP Jeffersonian Republican Party</b> - I think this is the most unambiguous name for the party in the first-party system that developed in opposition to the Hamiltonian Federalists. It is apparently also a name with considerable currency. The other proposals are not as clear and D-R has confused people and been contested here for years.

<li><b>Keep all three and direct Jeffersonian Republican Party to Early Republican Party</b> -The early Republican Party was a seperate party from the two break away parties Dem-Rep &amp; Nat-Rep. If you want to view all of them as a continuation party with no breaks, then you can do that too. But, there was a split -right? And that split resulted in two parties with a different name than the former -right?

<ul>
<li>To put it briefly, wrong. The party before the breakup had many names, including DR and NR. But even if this were right, the PoV forks and cut-and paste jobs should be deleted.

Due to the cut-and-paste moves, I erroneously believed that the talk page had been left behind in one of the moves and moved it to the wrong place. I can no longer move the talk page back to its original location, although I have created a Requested Move. Please make sure that this talk page is moved before deleting this article.

<li>Exactly. This is why the page nominated should be deleted rather than redirected: too much potential confusion. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I would suggest the AfDs be put on hold until the cleanup and requested moves have been made. Right now, at first glance, I see articles about the Republican Party being put up for deletion (questionable on its face, you must admit), people adding articles second-hand for deletion and a revert war in the history of at least one article. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:02, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All these are efforts to contain the disruptive edits of User:Nikpapag by several editors. The articles put up for deletion are forks, which Nikpapag created by cuts and pastes, of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a>. This is the party of Jefferson and Madison, which broke up in 1824, not the present Republican party. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 03:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffersonian_Republican_Party_1427.html" title="Jeffersonian Republican Party">Jeffersonian Republican Party</a> was first made into a cut-and-paste by <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> at 06:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC). The page already existed as a redirect which Rjensen overlaid with a copy of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a>. Nikpapag <i>created</i> <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_0b78.html" title="Early Republican Party (United States)">Early Republican Party (United States)</a> as a clone of his preferred version of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party (United States)</a> about 8 hours later, at 14:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC). — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 12:24, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Another comment</b>: The Democratic-Republican Party was, prior to Jackson, known simply as the Republican Party. We may consider that separate articles (for Democratic-Republican Party and Early Republican Party) may well be appropriate. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 04:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi

<li>This claim is disputable, and is being discussed on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarly_Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_46b0.html" title="Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)">Talk:Early Republican Party (United States)</a>; but it is peripheral to this AfD. Editors on both sides of that discussion have reverted Nikpapag's edits, which are simple mischief, and interfere with the discussion. These three pages are the same article; two of them have Nikpapag's unsourced claims that Jackson belonged to the "Democrat Republican Party" [<i>sic</i>]. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 05:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
