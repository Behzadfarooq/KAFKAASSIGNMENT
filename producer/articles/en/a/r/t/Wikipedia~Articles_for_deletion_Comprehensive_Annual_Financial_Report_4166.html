<i>This is fairly incomprehensible, and the talk page is basically an advertisement. Based on the amount of html previously in the article and still currently, it is likely a copied from somewhere.</i><br />

<li>you said it! It is a valid topic and to censor this would be to participate in the literal cover up of the issue. So Stubify it, put up "wikistandard"s disclaimers, whatever. The article could be better sourced. Having talked with Walter Burien and Gerald R. Klatt(USAF retired). My impression is they would like to see links to their site on here as well as government addresses for the imfamous CAFR reports for all over the country. Klatt's www.cafrman.com has these but they are from 2003.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.209.140.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.209.140.21.html" title="User talk:209.209.140.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.209.140.21_1096.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.209.140.21">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Though the report is a real report, I'm not convinced that it is notable enough for its own article. There's no reference to "CAFRs" on major news sites, and the references listed in this article appear to be personal websites with a strong bias. The Google hits don't mean much to me either, since "CAFR" as an acronym can have multiple meanings. So I recommend deleting this article, or possibly merging it into something else relating to State Government spending. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 04:50, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. It's not impossible that this could be made into a real article, but almost none of the current material would be usable for the purpose. I don't think we should wait around patiently for people with a strong POV to come up with something that would make sense to a neutral economist. Best to delete. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 01:24, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here is a typical example of knee jerk anti conspiracy theory bias of wikipedians, these documents are verifiable and do exist. It is not significant at all that acording to Burien's research that numerous news outlets and public officials recieve a copy of many CAFR's reports from the local water and school public corporations to the several state and general government reports and do not do reports on these government holdings? Yall's nose for cooruption potential isnt itching at all? <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessie_Ventura_1847.html" title="Jessie Ventura">Jessie Ventura</a>'s political career is punctuated by his releasing some of Minnisota's government surplusses held outside the budgetary set of books. The Potential for cronie investment shuffeling should be obvious to even a 6th grader. I.E. guide investments to support your friends politically. If you don't know the investments exist in the first place you dont know to look for the deal making and the stategic investments BTW tally up the institutional investment in big companies like Health insurance, Motorola, IBM and MICROSOFT - 60-85% government owned, that is supposedly not Musellini's Corporatism? The artical needs a NPOV, shure, but these issues HAVE to be mentioned or you end up with a bias of ommission problem. Living in the world's remaining superpower you have to demand "show me the money"! Failure to understand these issues is tantamount to crossing the steet when you see a woman getting raped or a mugging in your path and not even dialing 911. I am only left with the two possibilities either there is intentional ignorance of this topic or a lack of ability to grasp the concepts of government surpluss assets. I dont know what else to say except you'll get the govenment you deserve? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.209.140.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.209.140.21.html" title="User talk:209.209.140.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.209.140.21_1096.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.209.140.21">contribs</a>) 21:55, October 1, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>(Comment to anon editor) The main problem with this article is that much of it appears to be what's called <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is against Wikipedia policy. Something cannot appear on Wikipedia unless it is has already been published in outside credible sources (personal websites and blogs don't count), which prove that this subject is notable. In other words, it's not enough to prove that the report <i>exists</i>, you have to show that outside sources believe that the report is <i>important.</i> There are thousands of different government forms out there, and the case that needs to be made (in my opinion) is that this report is individually important. If credible references can be provided, I might be willing to change my mind on this article. For more information, please review the Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've stubified the article and repeatedly removed a set of crap and spam links, and I've also posted a note at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Business_and_Economics_43a8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Business and Economics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Business and Economics</a> asking for input, to no avail. I have no interest in babysitting this article, and with the current lack of interest from qualified editors I'm pretty certain it will go back to spam/soapbox status in no time as soon as this AfD is over. So I'm amending my <s>vote</s> opinion to <b>Delete</b> unless someone is willing to keep this article on their watchlist and make sure those links stay out. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is just the proverbial second set of books outside the budgetary process. If you cant see why that is the most significant report of any divison of government then we are doomed as a country. Some of you seem so averse to conspiracy "theory" that if something sounds like one, you trash it even when the proof is hidden in plain sight. I fail to see why the Gerald R. Klatt sites cannot be included, he isnt selling anything and provides links to all the CAFR's that are analysed even if they are abit old. (2003) Some of the newer State CAFR's are difficult to locate (on purpose). When government entities cry we need to raise taxes cause spending is over the budget THIS is the ammo to hit them with; we know how much is in the CAFR&#160;! Sell some stock and surplusses(far above the required assets to back pensions and bonds et c.) There are tonnes of short blurb articals on wikipedia that I have run accross and none of them have to have to be on "watchlists" that I am of aware of. So Walter Burien might end up selling a videotape or two because someone found out that there really is CAFR reports out there. Since he HISTORICALLY re-discovered this accounting trick and exposed it to the world (through AM talk radio in New Jersey) How bout someone put up a biography on the guy; I would but it would last about 2 hours and that is beiing optamystic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.209.140.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.209.140.21.html" title="User talk:209.209.140.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.209.140.21_1096.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.209.140.21">contribs</a>) 23:16, October 4, 2006.</small></li>
