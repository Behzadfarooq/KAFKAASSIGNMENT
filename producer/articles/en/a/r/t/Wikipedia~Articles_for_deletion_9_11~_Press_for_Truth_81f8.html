<li>I am not sure what a "ghit" is, but the film draws 341,000 hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%229%2F11+press+for+truth%22</a> There's quite a difference and I believe 341,000 proves notability. Whether you believe the film to be "cruft" or not, it is wrong to remove all mention of it from Wikipedia, for whatever stated or unstated reason. We are here to serve our users. If you view the film and object to its contents for factual reasons, that could be treated in the article or "discussion" page. But simply attempting to delete articles other editors begin for such reasons (especially flawed reasoning such as the wildly inaccurate claim there are only 344 hits) is just wrong, and against what we stand for here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 02:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - A useful stub of what might be a better article concerning a reasonably notable film. This deletion request seems driven by political rather than academic motives, and hence should be scrutinized carefully. I don't agree with the film's conclusions, but I wanted to know more about it, particularly as related to other 9/11 conspiracy theory propoganda.

<li><b>Comment</b> no opinion, but I added an Importance tag to the article because the article makes no case why this film has any relevence, notability, or importance. TBC basically did all the legwork already so interested parties just need to include the sources he's provided in the article (and go ahead and boldly remove the tag after the sources have been included).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:21, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, absolutely</b> One of the best 9/11 movies I have ever seen. Furthermore, this is a new movie. If this were to disappear into the fog of time then I could see some argument for deleting it, but why throw out the baby with the bathwater? This movie features the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey_girls.html" title="Jersey girls">Jersey girls</a> who were on the family steering committee for the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Commission_ffe5.html" title="9/11 Commission">9/11 Commission</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> After reviewing the sources, I have found that the article does NOT pass notability requirements. The NYT mention is NOT an article that focuses on, and only on the movie (which is required. The article must be a full-length featured article about the subject only). It is only a mentioned as a small part of related 9/11 events happening on or around 9/11/06. Rotten Tomatoes is not used as a 'reliable source'. Amazon is used to verify the movie was made though, as is the AOL movies listing but neither provide a reason the movie is notable. <i>Slant Magazine</i> and <i>Hub Weekly</i> are not a print magazines but rather are blogs...which removes them as a reliable sources (blogs are not normally allowed, per wikipedia policy). <i>Scoop</i> is not a reputable website (and this is just a press release), and hence is also voided as a reliable source. Nothing notable about this and does not have multiple, independent, third-party, reliable, full-length featured articles about the film.</li>

<dd>On a side note, I want to shake a finger at all the keeps that have not done any research into this beyond looking at the AFD and voting per what ever was said.

As for the New York Times article, I did <b>not</b> state that the article entirely focused on the movie, I only stated that it <i>mentioned</i> the movie.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: that is why it is called a "stub." There are a lot of such articles throughout Wikipedia, and we don't delete them all for the reason that they are short. A blow-by-blow description of the film's contents, how it was made, etc. can of course be added but that takes time, with the contribution of various editors (which could include you). But it seems that, at least so far, your edits consist solely of attempting to remove articles written by other editors, and not to create any new ones of your own. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 21:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If those articles have a right to exist here, so that our users may learn from them (as I believe they do), why not also an article about a widely released new film examining one of the most important events of the past few years, and featuring as its main characters the widows of men lost in that event? Is fantasy more significant than fiction, or is it simply a question of whether consumers bought more of one and fewer of another?

<li><b>Comment</b>: In discussion about another 9/11-as-inside-job movie that was successfully ground down to zero by the deletion police, I mentioned the comparison to <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_as_a_Dog_c251.html" title="My Life as a Dog">My Life as a Dog</a>, a Swedish movie. Someone pointed out that it was nominated for two academy awards. But when I mentioned it to my Swedish relatives they thought it was rather insignificant or uninteresting. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie myself. What's my point about all this? Here is a fictional movie, that came out long before wikipedia was around--indeed, the internet, as such, only had 5000 computers on it at the time. So documenting it is documenting a piece of film arcana. On the other hand, we have here under consideration a serious movie about a deadly serious subject having extensive interviews with people <i>whose relatives died on 9/11</i> ... and we're having a discussion about deleting coverage of this topic. Have folks even seen what the Jersey Widows and other family members have to say? Go watch the movie and tell me it's not for real what these people feel and perceive. I think most of the people on this page are either arrogant or heartless. I'm beginning to feel like assuming good faith of these other editors is a sick joke. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaimiddleton_a602.html" title="User:Kaimiddleton">Kaimiddleton</a> 08:13, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whether you and your Swedish great-uncle have heard of <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_as_a_Dog_c251.html" title="My Life as a Dog">My Life as a Dog</a> is utterly irrelevant - the movie has gained substantial coverage, been nominated for or awarded many prizes, launched the career of a major director, and is clearly significant (and pretty good, by the way). Equally, your strong feelings on viewing the movie "9/11: Press for Truth" are utterly irrelevant to the discussion at hand: the question is whether the movie in question has enough significant independent coverage to justify an encyclopedic article and allow one to be written. As far as I can see, this movie passes the low threshold required, so I've voted keep - this despite loathing conspiracy theories. Other disagree.

<li>Comment: I don't think the film represents a conspiracy theory. It sets out a timeline and focuses primarily on the government's failure to investigate promptly and fully as in previous disasters of a similar magnitude, and particularly on the failure to answer the questions developed and posed by family members to the 9/11 Commission, once that committee was finally organized, over the objections of the Bush administration. Probably a lot of the comments implying that the film is akin to some of the other 9/11 conspiracy films come from people who haven't seen it. A glance at the strongly political userboxes of the editor who put this page up for deletion suggests there may be other overarching motivations for his actions (whether conscious or subconscious) than lack of "notability" of this film. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 11:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Don't see" is the key phrase here, as it seems you haven't seen the film before voting here. As mentioned above, there are no conspiracies discussed in the film; it is a straight discussion of facts regarding the 9/11 timeline and investigation, and the families' reactions. So what you and many editors say above is really quite inaccurate, and reflects poorly on you in that you would vote without <i>verifying</i> that what you say is correct. When you say it's not "any more notable," does that mean, then, that this documentary is <i>less</i> notable than <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludicolo.html" title="Ludicolo">Ludicolo</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laughing_Man_%28Ghost_in_the_Shell%29_e14e.html" title="Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)">Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)</a>, or <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_Mal_Doran_92bc.html" title="Vala Mal Doran">Vala Mal Doran</a>?
