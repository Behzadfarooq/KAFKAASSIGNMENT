<p>It began in 1959 when two friends were making the cultural arts fund for Aurora. They were doing quite some work in Auorora during that time. Fortunately, in 1960, they had enough money to have Aurora Community Theatre's first production, The Tender Trap. The play was held on the tiny stage of the Church in Aurora's Fellowship hall. It had done plays there for about ten years.</p>

<p>In 1969, Aurora Community Theatre had its last play at the Church in Aurora. It was fortunate to get a new venue. Aurora Community Theatre was now apart of the Aurora Memorial Library Complex. The Complex was made up of a library, a meuseum, and the theatre. There, it had it's first play. Ten Nights in a Bar Room. The Theatre was theme that fit into the 70s's. It had a small, but a nice lobby. It had two box offices, two showcases, a large sign for the theatre, and a coat rack. In the showroom there was a technology room, (the lights,) 250 seats, a stage, and orchestra sub-stages. There has been many dedications in the theatre, including many ones to Lynn Potter.</p>

<p>At Aurora Community Theatre, there's always different events. It starts off in the summer. The Theatre usually participates in the city 4th of July Parade. It's float is always based on the summer play. In the fall, there's also a dinner theatre night. At the city's trick-or-treat event, they always have a booth for candy there. Winter is where they have a full house for a special free show. Aurora Community theatre has a holiday show with a tree lighting ceremony following. When Spring comes, there's a city community expo. Aurora Community Theatre has a booth there. Finally, at the end of the season, the theatre has a dinner with a meeting to follow, then a show at the end. Every four years new trustees are elected.</p>

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets and other antibacterial drugs, ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets (erythromycin stearate tablets, USP) are an antibacterial product containing the stearate salt of erythromycin in a unique film coating.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is produced by a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus ) and belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics. It is basic and readily forms salts with acids. Erythromycin is a white to off-white powder, slightly soluble in water, and soluble in alcohol, chloroform, and ether. Erythromycin stearate is known chemically as erythromycin octadecanoate. The molecular formula of erythromycin stearate is C 37 H 67 NO 13 ·C 18 H 36 O 2 , and the molecular weight is 1018.43. The structural formula is:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Inactive Ingredients: 250 mg tablet: Cellulosic polymers, corn starch, D&amp;C Red No. 7, polacrilin potassium, polyethylene glycol, povidone, propylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium citrate, sorbic acid, sorbitan monooleate and titanium dioxide.</p>
<p>500 mg tablet: Cellulosic polymers, corn starch, FD&amp;C Red No. 3, magnesium hydroxide, polacrilin potassium, povidone, propylene glycol, sorbitan monooleate, titanium dioxide and vanillin.</p>
<p><br />
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Orally administered erythromycin base and its salts are readily absorbed in the microbiologically active form. Interindividual variations in the absorption of erythromycin are, however, observed, and some patients do not achieve optimal serum levels. Erythromycin is largely bound to plasma proteins. After absorption, erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. In the absence of meningeal inflammation, low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid but the passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier increases in meningitis. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier, but fetal plasma levels are low. The drug is excreted in human milk. Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.</p>
<p>In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and is excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on biliary excretion of erythromycin is not known. After oral administration, less than 5% of the administered dose can be recovered in the active form in the urine.</p>
<p>Orally administered ERYTHROCIN STEARATE tablets are readily and reliably absorbed. Optimal serum levels of erythromycin are reached when the drug is taken in the fasting state or immediately before meals.</p>
<p>Microbiology: Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol.</p>
<p>Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone, but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used concomitantly.</p>
<p>Staphylococci resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of erythromycin therapy. Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.</p>
<p>Gram-positive organisms: Corynebacterium diphtheriae</p>
<p>Corynebacterium minutissimum</p>
<p>Listeria monocytogenes</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment)</p>
<p>Streptococcus pneumoniae</p>
<p>Streptococcus pyogenes</p>
<p>Gram-negative organisms: Bordetella pertussis</p>
<p>Legionella pneumophila</p>
<p>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</p>
<p>Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis</p>
<p>Entamoeba histolytica</p>
<p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</p>
<p>Treponema pallidum</p>
<p>Ureaplasma urealyticum</p>
<p>The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown .</p>
<p>Erythromycin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 0.5 µg/mL or less against most (&gt;/= 90%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of erythromycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>Gram-positive organisms: Viridans group streptococci</p>
<p>Gram-negative organisms: Moraxella catarrhalis</p>
<p>Susceptibility Tests:</p>
<p>Dilution Techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's). These MIC's provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC's should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of erythromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
MIC (µg/mL)  Interpretation  
</pre>
<p>&lt;/=0.5 Susceptible (S) 1-4 Intermediate (I) &gt;/=8 Resistant (R)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.</p>
<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard erythromycin powder should provide the following MIC values:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Microorganism  MIC (µg/mL)  
</pre>
<p>S. aureus ATCC 29213 0.12-0.5 E. faecalis ATCC 29212 1-4</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure 2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15-µg erythromycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to erythromycin.</p>
<p>Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 15-µg erythromycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Zone Diameter (mm)  Interpretation  
</pre>
<p>&gt;/=23 Susceptible (S) 14-22 Intermediate (I) &lt;/=13 Resistant (R)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for erythromycin.</p>
<p>As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 15-µg erythromycin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
Microorganism  Zone Diameter (mm)  
</pre>
<p>S. aureus ATCC 25923 22-30</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets and other antibacterial drugs, ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p>
<p>ERYTHROCIN STEARATE tablets are indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below:</p>
<p>Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)</p>
<p>Lower respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae .</p>
<p>Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes .</p>
<p>Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae .</p>
<p>Skin and skin structure infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment).</p>
<p>Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis . Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.</p>
<p>Diphtheria: Infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae , as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent establishment of carriers and to eradicate the organism in carriers.</p>
<p>Erythrasma--In the treatment of infections due to Corynebacterium minutissimum .</p>
<p>Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica (oral erythromycins only). Extraenteric amebiasis requires treatment with other agents.</p>
<p>Acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Erythrocin® Lactobionate-I.V. (erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP) followed by erythromycin base orally, as an alternative drug in treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin. Patients should have a serologic test for syphilis before receiving erythromycin as treatment of gonorrhea and a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months.</p>
<p>Erythromycins are indicated for treatment of the following infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis : conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections during pregnancy. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults due to Chlamydia trachomatis .</p>
<p>When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum .</p>
<p>Primary syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum . Erythromycin (oral forms only) is an alternative choice of treatment for primary syphilis in patients allergic to the penicillins. In treatment of primary syphilis, spinal fluid should be examined before treatment and as part of the follow-up after therapy.</p>
<p>Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease.</p>
<p>Prophylaxis Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever-Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the upper respiratory tract e.g., tonsillitis, or pharyngitis). 3 Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients. The therapeutic dose should be administered for ten days.</p>
<p>Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever-Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever). 3</p>
<p><br />
CONTRAINDICATIONS Erythromycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to this antibiotic.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is contraindicated in patients taking terfenadine, astemizole, pimozide or cisapride. (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions .)</p>
<p><br />
WARNINGS There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, occurring in patients receiving oral erythromycin products.</p>
<p>There have been reports suggesting that erythromycin does not reach the fetus in adequate concentration to prevent congenital syphilis. Infants born to women treated during pregnancy with oral erythromycin for early syphilis should be treated with an appropriate penicillin regimen.</p>
<p>Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored for creatine kinase (CK) and serum transaminase levels. (See package insert for lovastatin.)</p>
<p>Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of "antibiotic-associated colitis".</p>
<p>After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis.</p>
<p><br />
PRECAUTIONS General: Prescribing ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS .)</p>
<p>There have been reports that erythromycin may aggravate the weakness of patients with myasthenia gravis.</p>
<p>There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin therapy. In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy. A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 4 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.</p>
<p>Prolonged or repeated use of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p>
<p>When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ERYTHROCIN STEARATE Filmtab tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p>Drug Interactions: Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.</p>
<p>There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Coadministration of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin.</p>
<p>The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience:</p>
<p>Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine: Concurrent use of erythromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.</p>
<p>Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and related benzodiazepines : Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly.</p>
<p>Sildenafil (Viagra): Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.)</p>
<p>There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .)</p>
<p>In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate.</p>
<p>Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfernadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias, have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.</p>
<p>There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes, most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ).</p>
<p>Drug/Laboratory Test interactions: Erythromycin interferes with the fluorometric determination of urinary catecholamines.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term (2-year) oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25 percent of diet.</p>
<p>Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category B: There is no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25 percent of diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation, and through weaning of two successive litters. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>Labor and Delivery: The effect of erythromycin on labor and delivery is unknown.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers: Erythromycin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use: See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .</p>
<p><br />
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent side effects of oral erythromycin preparations are gastrointestinal and are dose related. They include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and anorexia. Symptoms of hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction and/or abnormal liver function test results may occur. (See WARNINGS .)</p>
<p>Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. (See WARNINGS .)</p>
<p>Erythromycin has been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have occurred. Skin reactions ranging from mild eruptions to erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely.</p>
<p>There have been rare reports of pancreatitis and convulsions.</p>
<p>There have been isolated reports of reversible hearing loss occurring chiefly in patients with renal insufficiency and in patients receiving high doses of erythromycin.</p>
<p><br />
OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, erythromycin should be discontinued. Overdosage should be handled with the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and all other appropriate measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.</p>
<p><br />
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Optimal serum levels of erythromycin are reached when ERYTHROCIN STEARATE (erythromycin stearate) is taken in the fasting state or immediately before meals.</p>
<p>Adults: The usual dosage is 250 mg every 6 hours; or 500 mg every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily are administered.</p>
<p>Children: Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, in equally divided doses. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled but should not exceed 4 g per day.</p>
<p>In the treatment of streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis), the therapeutic dosage of erythromycin should be administered for at least ten days.</p>
<p>The American Heart Association suggests a dosage of 250 mg of erythromycin orally, twice a day in long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections for the prevention of recurring attacks of rheumatic fever in patients allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides. 3</p>
<p>Conjunctivitis of the newborn caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: Oral erythromycin suspension 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for at least 2 weeks. 3</p>
<p>Pneumonia of infancy caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: Although the optimal duration of therapy has not been established, the recommended therapy is oral erythromycin suspension 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for at least 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Urogenital infections during pregnancy due to Chlamydia trachomatis: Although the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been established, the suggested treatment is 500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day or two erythromycin 333 mg tablets orally every 8 hours on an empty stomach for at least 7 days. For women who cannot tolerate this regimen, a decreased dose of one erythromycin 500 mg tablet orally every 12 hours, one 333 mg tablet orally every 8 hours or 250 mg by mouth four times a day should be used for at least 14 days. 5</p>
<p>For adults with uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , when tetracycline is contraindicated or not tolerated: 500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day or two 333 mg tablets orally every 8 hours for at least 7 days. 5</p>
<p>For patients with nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum when tetracycline is contraindicated or not tolerated: 500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day or two 333 mg tablets orally every 8 hours for at least seven days. 5</p>

<p>Is a historical drama made in 1996 (International release: 2004), directed by Vincente Aranda.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Anarchist Revolution and Spanish Civil War in Barcelona, militia women Pilar (<a href="../../../a/n/a/Ana_Belen_578a.html" title="Ana Belen">Ana Belen</a>) and Floren (<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Abril_d005.html" title="Victoria Abril">Victoria Abril</a>) are joined by former prostitute Charo (Loles Leon) and former nun Maria (Ariadna Gil). The film opens with scenes of working class militants demolishing and burning religious icons, as they shout "down with Capitalism!" and "long live the libertarian revolution!"</p>
<p>While fully emmersed in the overall enthusiasm of revolutionary Spain, Pilar and friends find themselves fighting against deep gender inequality which complicates their efforts in the war against Franco's nationalist/fascist/catholic forces. They encounter resistance even within their own "Free Women" (<a href="../../../m/u/j/Mujeres_Libres_9ce0.html" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres Libres</a>) organization as one woman (that resembles <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federica_Montseny_0458.html" title="Federica Montseny">Federica Montseny</a>) tries to persuade them to stay and work in defense factories, while men try to convince them to go work as cooks, not front-line soldiers.</p>

<p>The Water Wiggle was a aluminum and plastic water toy that famous children's toy producer "Wham-O" made in the 1960's-1970's.It consisted of a plastic seven foot hose,aluminum nozzle,and plastic dome covering.The nozzle would spray water nside the plastic dome which would propel the Water Wiggle through the air at dangerously high speeds.The point was to try and "catch" the toy,but most children were afraid to use it bcause when struck by it,pain was usually inflicted.It was eventually recalled in 1978 after killing a four-year-old boy.For some reason the boy removed the plastic dome and the nozzle became lodged in the boys mouth,drowning him. The Water Wiggle is among the list of highly dangerous toys released before the 1980's.</p>

<p>The story goes that the Goddess Bhagavathy revealed herself to a fervent devotee of a notable family viz. Mulluveettil family. It is said that one evening a young girl appeared before the head of the family while he was performing his oblations in the Killi river and requested him to help her cross the river. Impressed by her charismatic demeanor, the- old man bent before her with awe and reverence and not only helped her cross the river but took her to his house nearby. Strangely enough, while the household members were amidst preparations for intending a warm welcome to the young girl, she vanished. That very night the Goddess Bhagavathy appeared as an icon before the old man in his dream and demanded that he should establish an abode for her in the nearby sacred ground of shrubs and herbs (kavu), at a consecrated spot marked by three lines. The next morning the old man went to the spot revealed to him in the dream and to his great surprise he did find three marks indented on the ground. He lost no time in erecting a temple on this consecrated spot to house the Goddess. Many years later, the building was renovated by the local devotees. They also installed a beautiful and majestic icon of the Deity with four arms, bearing weapons of destruction in each, like spear, sword, skull, shield etc. The consecration ceremony of this Exalted Being was performed by no less a person than the high priest of the Badarinath Temple. The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple, one of the ancient temples of South India, is popularly described as Sabarimala of the Women, as women form the major portion of devotees. The Goddess in the temple of Attukal is worshipped as the Supreme Mother, creator of all living beings and the mighty preserver as well as destroyer of them all. The pilgrims from all over the country, who visit Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and worship the Lord, do not consider their visits complete without the visit to the shrine of the supreme Mother Attukalamma. Vishnumaya took the incarnation of Bhagavathy to annihilate the evil and protect the good in the world in the present Era namely Kaliyuga. According to mythology, Attukal Bhagavathy is supposed to be the divinised form of Kannaki, the famous heroine of Chilapathikaram, written by Elenkovadikal, the Tamil Poet. The story goes that after the destruction of ancient city of Madurai, Kannaki left the city and reached Kerala via Kanyakumari and on the way to Kodungalloor took a sojourn at Attukal. Kannaki is supposed to be the incarnation of Parvathy, the consort of Paramasiva. The all powerful and benign Attukal Bhagavathy reigns eternally supreme at Attukal and nurses devotees as a mother does her children. Thousands of devotees from far and near flock to the Temple to bend before the Goddess with awe and reverence to prostrate and redress their affliction and agony. The Pongala Mahotsavam is the most important festival of Attukal Bhagavathy Temple. The offering of Pongala is a special temple practice prevalent in the southern part of Kerala and some parts of Tamilnadu. It is a ten-day programme commencing on the Karthika star of the Malayalam month of Makaram-Kumbham (February-March) and closing with the sacrificial offering known as Kuruthitharpanam at night. On the ninth day of the festival the world famous Attukal Pongala Mahotsavam takes place. The entire area of about 8 kilometre radius around temple with premises of houses of people of all caste, creed and religion, open fields, roads, commercial institutions, premises of Government offices etc. emerges as a consecrated ground for observing Pongala rituals for lakhs of women devotees assembling from different parts of Kerala and outside. The ceremony is exclusively confined to women folk and the enormous crowd, which gathers in Thiruvananthapuram on this auspicious day is reminiscent of the Kumbhamela Festival of North India. This year (2006) more than 12 lakhs of women devotees participated in the pongala festival.</p>

<p>India has ever been the holy land of gods and goddesses. Since ages past, men and women kings and emperors, saints and sages here were worshipping the Lord not only as the omnipotent and absolute 'one' but also as the 'one' whose manifestations are varied and manifold and who possesses different names, forms and divine attributes. Thus Almighty the Eternal God was worshipped in different forms such as Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, and their consorts; representing specific divine attributes of the Lord. Ancient puranas have described that Siva and Sakthi were simultaneously worshipped from the period of Aryans and Dravidians. Vishnumaya took the incarnation of Bhagavathy to annihilate evil and protect the good in this world. She grants every wish of Her devotees and resides in their hearts in multifarious forms.</p>

<p>According to mythology, Attukal Bhagavathy is supposed to be the divinised form of "Kannaki", the famous heroine of Chilappatikaram, the sangham work of Tamil Literature written by ilamkovadikal. After the destruction of the ancient city of Madurai, Kannaki left that city and reached Kerala via Kanyakumari and on her way to Kodungalloor took a sojourn at Attukal. The hymns of the "Thottampattu ) sung during the annual temple festival, are based on the story of Kannaki. Moreover, architectural depictions of Goddess Kannaki seen on the Gopuram temple substantiate this mythology. Small wonder then. that, Sri. Vidyadhiraja Chattambi Swamy, the well known saint of Kerala, found this temple premises ideal for his meditations. And there are so many stories which prove the greatness of the Goddess and which attract thousands of devotees to the temple.</p>

<p>Anyone visiting the Attukal temple is first struck by the beauty and charm of the temple architecture. The temple structure is a harmonious conglomeration of both Kerala and Tamil styles of architecture. The beautifully carved figures of Mahishasuramarddini, Goddess Kali, Rajarajeswari, Sree Parvathy with Lord Paramasiva and various other depictions of the Goddess in and around the temple are undoubtedly the work of a gifted artist. Equally well presented around the corridors surrounding the temple, are the depiction of various other Gods and the epic stories of the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu viz., the "Desavathara". On either side of the elegant front gopura - are the icons based on the story of Goddess Kannaki. On the southern Gopura, the puranic story of "Dakshayaga" is depicted in sculptures. The decorated gate at the entrance of the temple is by itself an excellent example of architectural beauty.</p>
<p>There are two idols of the Goddess in the sanctum sanctorum. The original idol is preserved in all its pristine beauty covered in ornamental gold embedded with installed stones. The second idol of the Goddess is installed besides the original one. Within the temple corridors are also installed carvings and sculptures of Lord Ganesan, the serpent God and Lord Shiva. At the centre of the Sanctum within the Sreekovil, at a consecrated spot is installed the idol of the Goddess Attukal Bhagavathy emanating light and lustre to all.</p>

<p>Divine Gold Lockets with the prathishta image of the Devi on one side and the imprint of Sudarsana Chakra on the other, are now issued to the devotees from the temple counter. This moderately priced pendant, which can be worn by men, women and children of all ages, at all times, is a talisman of safety and prosperity.</p>

<p>Chandrachur Singh, the doe-eyed actor was born on 11th Oct '68. It's a phenomenon that after six years of unhappy existence in Bollywood and after taking a decision of going back was he taken aback to get an opportunity in a project that had given him a break and a chance to prove himself again.</p>
<p>In fact, the film industry is just one destination for him but it didn't embrace him for six years in spite of all the sweat he put in and that's the reason behind his decision to quit the WOOD and go to his old profession to teach music when ABCL approached him with a project which he readily grabbed as he was looking for one. The movie "Tere Mere Sapne" offered by ABCL in which he was an NRI was enough to prove himself and it was a superb hit at the box office.</p>
<p>Later - he was known as Chandrachur 'Maachis' Singh in Bollywood as his next movie 'Maachis' won him all the glory he was overwhelmed with and in a night he was the craze of girls. He won VIDEOCON SCREEN and FILMFARE awards for the display of his performance in 'MAACHIS' that boosted up his morale to act and survive in the field.</p>
<p>Singh co-acted with the best actors and actresses in Bollywood to date. Though his movie 'Sil Sila Hain Pyar Ka' with Karishma Kapoor was an average, he had a lot in that film to exhibit his acting capabilities. And he wasn't stern for the loss of six years in the industry nor was he looking for excuses but he fought back to get a place in the tough competition of Bollywood and now he's still there to give the best and prove himself time n again.</p>

<p>Seppo Kivinen, better known under his artist name S. Albert Kivinen, is a Finnish author and professor of philosophy. In the 1980's, he was instrumental in introducing H.P.Lovecraft to Finnish audiences. He is also the author of several articles in Finnish about Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos, as well as of short stories which feature Lovecraftian elements such as Cthulhu, the Great Old Ones etc. in a Finnish setting.</p>
<p>His most important work in this vein is the short story Keskiyön Mato Ikaalisissa ("The Midnight Worm in Ikaalinen"), in which an anonymous narrator consults the excentric "lecturer of cryptochronology" H. Herbert Bladh - probably modelled on Kivinen himself - in order to get rid of a Lovecraftian monster running wild in Lake Kyrösjärvi in Ikaalinen (incidentally the place where Kivinen himself grew up). This seminal story has proved immensely popular with Finnish readers of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror, and inspired other writers to try their hand at Lovecraftian fantasy in familiar Finnish settings.</p>
<p>Although the story of the Midnight Worm is one of the all-time favorites of the Finnish fandom, Kivinen's other Cthulhu stories have been less fortunate. The most well-known of them are probably Tuulta tallova itikka ("The Mosquito that Treads on the Wind" - the word itikka, mosquito, stands here for Ithaqua) and Cthulhun suojatti ("Cthulhu's Favourite"). However, other authors, notably the horror writer Boris Hurtta, have utilized Kivinen's settings, stories, and characters in order to create a consistent "hidden history" of Cthulhuan events for Finland.</p>
<p>Kivinen's most important innovation as a Cthulhuan writer has probably been the connection of Finnish folklore to the Cthulhu mythos. In several of his Lovecraftian stories, he has included genuine-looking stanzas of Finnish folk poetry with hidden references to the Cthulhu mythos, especially names of the Old Ones in a debased form, as though they had been worn down in a natural way in the mouths of old storytellers.</p>
<p>The short story Keskiyön Mato Ikaalisissa was first published in the special Lovecraft issue (3/1987) of the Finnish fanzine Portti Science Fiction, published by the Tampere Science Fiction Society. In 1990, Mr Kivinen republished it in his collection of stories and articles, Merkilliset kirjoitukset (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 951-8931-02-X</a>). It was also reprinted in a collection of Finnish science fiction with the same title (Keskiyön Mato Ikaalisissa), <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 951-9269-57-6</a>.</p>

<p>Scum of the Earth is primarily, Arthur Koestler's account of his time in detention, and subsequent escape, after the German occupation of France in 1941. The book begins in the period just before the outbreak of war, in southern France. It follows the travails of Koestler as he moves up to Paris just prior to the occupation and gives a lucid description of the chaos and fear that gripped Parisians as the Germans rolled inexorably toward the city. Among the memorable scenes from the book are Koestler's detailed account of the bureacratic wrangling he had to endure to try to avoid arrest by the French authorities as the Germans approached, the conditions in the Rolland Garros stadium where the political prisoners were herded as the country's defences fell apart, the camp life at the foot of the Pyrenees and the political divisions which prevailed there. The book's wry commentary on the futility and bureaucracy of pre-war France, the barbarity of political repression and the breakdown of human solidarity in camp conditions all make it an important contribution to Koestler's other philosophical work. As a primary documentary evidence of conditions in France just prior and during World War II it holds enormous value. The title refers to the rapid fall from grace that Koestler and the other veterans of the Republican forces from the Spanish Civil War endured. Once hailed as heroes for their valiant opposition to Fascism, on the eve of war and once the Germans had conquered and divided France, they became the lowest of the low, the Scum of the Earth.</p>

<p>Mount Buggery is a mountain in the state of Victoria, in Australia.

<p>Bedford Park was one of the earliest garden suburbs. It was conceived in the 1870s by Jonathan Carr who purchased 24 acres of land near Turnham Green Station in west London. It was developed by various architects (including in particular Norman Shaw) between 1875 and 1914.</p>
<p>In the mid-late 20th century, unsympathetic development and some demolition of important buildings led to the houses forming the estate being protected by being listed grade II.</p>

<p>I am only a college studnet and do not feel i have the requirements to write an article but one is needed on the new orleans race riot of 1900. A good place to start would be the book "Carnival of Fury" Robert Charles and the New Orleans Race Riot of 1900 by William Ivy Hair. This is little to find out about this online and I think it was an important event for the development of New Orleans and the culture that spawned Jazz music. I t shows how an ordinary man can rise to extraordianry when the evetns present themselves and also shows how a society where change is difficult and you are being comstantly put down results in a riot. Alot of police officer were killed and ciuvilians. Most of the police offers were biggots and mistreated african americans and were crooked. It would be an interesting article to write and Robert Charles is of particular interest.</p>

<p>Before the shelves became bombarded with preseason basketball magazines, before the onslaught of pay-per-view Web sites, there was the ACC Basketball Handbook.</p>
<p>As the oldest magazine at UMI Publications, Inc., in Charlotte, N.C., the Handbook annually presents extensive team profiles, national and conference perspectives, preseason predictions, and recruiting updates from around the region and nation.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.acchandbook.com/images/ACC74.gif">Image:Http://www.acchandbook.com/images/ACC74.gif</a>The Handbook includes a preview story for each team indicating what to look for this upcoming season and an individual player spotlight story highlighting a particular player from each team. The section also includes last season’s results, schedules, stats and rosters. Each preview and spotlight piece is written by a beat writer that follows the team for that region’s local newspaper.</p>
<p>Feature stories that are important and current to the conference are included. They consist of stories about the incoming freshman class, the state of the ACC, and a where are they know article. Some features vary from year to year.</p>

And while the Handbook now sells in stores rather than out of the back of a car, one thing remains the same: a passion for providing our readers with the most comprehensive coverage of the nation’s best basketball conference.</p>

<p>Aris Velouhiotis is a pseudonyme for Athanasios Klaras, the founder and leader of ELAS, the Greek Liberation Partisan Army during WWII. Klaras, a member of the Greek Communist Party conceived the idea of forming an army to hit German troops in November 1941. He began with only 5 men on the 22nd of May 1942 and by fall of 1944 ELAS numbered approximately 200,000 people, the largest volunteer army in the modern history of Greece. A great achievement was the blow of the Gorgopotamos bridge on the 25th of November 1942, maybe the most important sabotage that took place in WWII. On July 5th 1943, ELAS was officially recognised as an allied army by British General Metland Wilson. After liberating almost half of mainland Greece, Velouhiotis was abbandoned by his political party for dissagreeing in serious matters, most important of which was his belief that German occupation would only be replaced by the British after the liberation. He was hunted down and committed suicide on the 15th of June 1945, just before the Greek civil war</p>

<p><b>The Nighttime Price is Right</b> was a syndicated 30-minute version of the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game show</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a></i> that ran from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.

<p>The structure of <i>The Nighttime Price is Right</i> was the same as that of the daytime show during its first three years on the air (1972-1975). Three "One-Bid" rounds were played, with contestants called from the audience to Contestant's Row. They were followed by a pricing game.</p>
<p><i>The Nighttime Price is Right</i> did not use the Showcase Showdown that its daytime counterpart did; however, it did have a two-player Showcase. The Showcase participants were determined by order of winnings, and the players with the two highest values advanced. As in the daytime show, the contestant who came closer to the actual retail price of his Showcase without going over won it, but if he was less than $100 away from his own Showcase's value, he won both Showcases.</p>
<p>After the series was cancelled, another nighttime version would not be attempted until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, when <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Davidson_e99e.html" title="Doug Davidson">Doug Davidson</a> hosted <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Price_Is_Right_%28Davidson%29_08f2.html" title="The New Price Is Right (Davidson)">The New Price is Right</a></i>.</p>

<p>Tony Barr, Candidate for U.S. House of Representatives, 2006. Progressive Democrat. Pennsylvania 9th Congressional District.</p>
<p>Tony Barr is no politician. He’s a Bedford County special education teacher in the Everett school district. He has spent most of his professional life helping to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. He doesn’t just talk about values; he puts them into practice every day. Values like fairness and compassion for the least among us.</p>
<p>Tony lives on Blue Knob in Blair County with his wife Liz and two small boys. Until recently they were content to help out with local Democratic organizations. Like a lot of people, Tony worried about the direction the country is heading. He’s gotten angry at the way money seems to rule the actions of our representatives in Washington. And like many others, he thinks it is past time for change in Pennsylvania and Washington, DC.</p>
<p>When Tony heard the Democratic Party wasn’t going to stand a candidate against Bill Shuster, an underperforming politics-as-usual rubber stamp if there ever was one, he was appalled. Instead of complaining about it, Tony Barr stepped up. With just two weeks before the May 16 primary he organized a successful write-in campaign. It took energized volunteers and a lot of hard work, but Tony is now the official Democratic candidate on the ballot.</p>

<p>Sporting organisations in Northern Ireland follow one of three models a) a UK model, b) an All Ireland Model c) a Northern Ireland Model. Northern Ireland has an international football team, whereas Rugby has an All Ireland team, although Ulster play as a club side. Northern Ireland does not participate in the Olympic Games, but forms part of the UK team. Some sports follow two or more of these models. A horserider may for example participate for the UK or Ireland team at an Olympic Games but participate for Northern Ireland in a European or Commonwealth Championships for Northern Ireland in the next tournament. The model usually depends on the Sporting Federation. The term Ulster can be misleading with a sporting federation as it can mean the territory of Northern Ireland or the larger territory of 9 county Ulster. Northern Ireland's most famous Sporting personalities include Dame Mary Peters winner of Olympic Gold, Munich Games and Manchester United footballer George Best.</p>

<p>SOT is an acronym for "Sound on tape". It refers to any audio recorded on analog or digital video formats. It is used in [television] and [film] script writing to indicate portions of the video that will use the natural sound from the time of recording, as opposed to audio recorded later (studio [voice-over], [foley], etc).</p>

<p>The word itself is pronounced as thus (taken from dictionary.com): mel·lif·lu·ous ( P ) Pronunciation Key (m-lfl-s) adj.</p>
<p>Example of use: "his voice was very mellifluous", "Wow, that person was really mellifluous for his age",</p>

<p>A cryptid of Sri-Lankan mythology. The tale goes as follows: A father, doubtful that his son was actually his, killed the boy. He then made a curry from the child's flesh, which his wife began eating. Upon finding a finger in her bowl and realizing the horrible truth, she ran off into the woods and commited suicide. Afterwards, according to Buddhist belief, she transformed into an Ulama(Devil-bird). The Devil Bird is said to make shrill, horrific cries of grief. Very few have reported seeing said creature, though many tell of hearing its blood-curdling screams. It has been suggested, by various ornithologists that it may merely be a wood owl; although, supposed eye witnesses describe it as appearing to be similar to a nightjar, no records show a nightjar that can scream.</p>

<p>Psyclotron is a long story made of more than 25 Psychedelic-Rock nights since 1992. Created in Belgium to transport the public in 1969, it's an actual journey in the Hippie world. Psyclotron Psychedelic Parties often gathers 800 to 1000 people dancing on the hot tunes of 1965 to 1975 selected by the deejays. From Pink Floyd to Jimi Hendrix, from 13th Floor Elevator to Iron Butterfly, from Canned Heat to Hawkwind, from Beatles to Janis Joplin. It featured concerts by local bands, and by the British Psytrance band Optic Eye. A proper Psyclotron consists in a chain of at least 3 halls. The dancefloor room covered with a psychedelic lightshow (coloured oils), a large chillout room, and the cinema (with Candy, Easy Rider, Woodstock, Little SHop of Horror, etc). Posters, locations, deco, music ... everything has been meant to bring the visitors back in the sixties.</p>
<p>Some of the recent Psyclotron event were Chill-Out &amp; Ambient nights with softer lightshow, tea, pillows and incense. The music then reflects the 70's "cosmic music", as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Eduard Artemiev, Redolfi, and the earthy chillout as Ravi Shankar or Nustrat Fateh Ali Khan.</p>
<p>The Psyclotron crew also organised in Brussels some art exhibitions related to that specific and creative decade, featuring vinyl sleeves, picture-discs, posters, flyers, furnitures, among other significant forms of creations.</p>
<p>As a party, or as the opening of a festival, since 1992 Psyclotron took place at: KultuurKaffee VUB hall, Halles de Schaerbeek, Bulten hall, Caserne Dailly, Magasin 4, Ex-Voto Brussels, Studio Volta, Dour Festival, Botanique Centre Culturel, Beursschouwburg, Le Gazon, Kunsten Festival Des Arts ... among other locations.</p>
<p>Deejays are and were: Jöhn, El Bosco (Nico), Gillax-o-Tron, Gilles Maes, Uriel</p>

<p>Boyhood studies is an interdisciplinary research area with a focus on aspects of boyhood, male socialization and young masculinity. It is situated in the overarching fields of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_studies.html" title="Gender studies">gender studies</a>, specifically <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men%27s_studies.html" title="Men's studies">men's studies</a>, and life phase studies.</p>
<p>The notion was proposed by authors in the late 1990s (Pattman, Frosh &amp; Phoenix 1998; Sørensen 1999, 2000). It is historically preceded by the feminist area of Girlhood Studies, which was thus referenced at least since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.boyhoodstudies.com" class="external text" title="http://www.boyhoodstudies.com" rel="nofollow">Boyhood Studies</a> (2006) deals specifically with this new field, and a journal (THYMOS: The Journal of Boyhood Studies) is due to appear in 2007.</p>

<p>Abbasi (Arabic:عباسی) is a Muslim family name denoting descent from Abbas ibn Abd-al-Muttalib paternal uncle of Prophet Muhammad. The Abbasid caliphate was established by the Abbasi clan and ruled Middle East during 750–1258 CE. The members of Abbasi family can be found in: Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.</p>
<p>In Pakistan this family is predominantly found in two different regions, one at edges of Northwest frontier province and Punjab in areas known as Abbotabad and Muree hills. Second branch of this family is found in the area of Bawalpur, southern part of Pakistan. Although some tribes who claim to be Abbasi's in both areas do not appear to represent the true blood line but the history shows us that both areas do have a fair claim to be representing this Arabian tribe. Now the modern genetic testing can put to rest any doubts to the legitimacy of who is and who is not from the real Abbasi tribe. This is a very good example of rise and demise of royal families and their members. Not all but vast majority of this tribe are scattered around the world without any real political power and indeed in most cases not even being able to go back to their homeland, i.e. Arabia. A refugee tribe forever one might say. If they were still a royal family one wonders any Arabian country would have dared rejected their entry to their own home land. Their demise has even allowed their tribal blood line to reject them as one of their own, an example to learn from that when one is down and under than one is denied access to their own home and their own people reject their legitimacy without any evidence.</p>

<p>24.128.233.137 20:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC) MittenZ</p>
<p>MittenZ (12 November, 1923-16 June 1989) Commonly referred to as Mitz, and by his friends Tom, was a Professor at the Institute of Goralimp, he was also the author of several theories such as ‘The Goat To Man: A New Stage in the Evolutionary Process’, ‘Goats in Evolution’ and ‘How Goats came To Be’ and his scientific breakthroughs with his colleague Drimp.</p>
<p>Early Life</p>
<p>MittenZ was born in Goatlington, Australia 12 of November 1923 to Marry Clovor Donalee (43) and Richard M. Nixonton (50). MittenZ was the youngest in a family of 12. At the age of 4, MittenZ began noticing goats for the first time. He became attracted to goats, and felt that he himself was a goat as he states in his critically acclaimed memoirs, “At such a fragile age I seem to have inadvertently allowed myself to be “over come” by these magnificent creatures. In a sense, I was a goat.”</p>
<p>At age 6, MittenZ’ father Richard M. Nixonton died over a long battle with cancer. The death of his father affected MittenZ in a lot of ways; he soon realizes this and admits that his father’s death was the biggest and most frightening blow to MittenZ as a young child, as he later states in the letters to his Sister Marrile Donalee. After the death of his Father in 1929, MittenZ and his family would move to what is now known as Borsash, in Southern Australia. There MittenZ had undergone intense psychological experimentations that he deemed “Silly and foolish”. He had a league of private tutors whom his mother had referred to as “The Mistresses” MittenZ soon speaks ill of these women in his memoirs and states, “The three women in my life whom have made the life in which I have lived so disastrous and jarred that I would sooner slice off my hand then to have those three demoniacs in my company once again.” MittenZ was enrolled to the Borsash school of Talented Souls in 1933 at the age of 10. His experience there varied, and MittenZ does not speak much of this in his memoirs. But he does state that his first love, which we have identified as Violet Le Jude (12), was “Overcome by the darkness.” We to this day do not understand the exact meaning of this statement. In 1936 MittenZ apparently leaves the Borsash school of Talented Souls for the Borsash Academy. Here his studies on Goats and the evolutionary process of Goats intensifies, MittenZ later states in his memoirs that at the Borsash Academy he received the greatest and most profound knowledge a man could ever receive.</p>
<p>MittenZ later attends the Cambole Institute of Experimental Devices, which was pleasantly situated 15 minutes from his home. It is said that MittenZ regularly rode his bike to attend this institute and was seen frequently handling goats near the Cambole Institute on Patch Adam’s Farm for Domesticated Animals. It is said during this time period that MittenZ was experimenting on goats, and using the devices he had acquired by the Institute to test on the goats. This may seem cruel, but never were the goats harmed. His experience there has a heavy impact on MittenZ studies and he later states that the Institute was filled with people whom he had disliked throughout his childhood. He leaves the Institute in 1945 and receives a Scholarship for Churnbowls College located in Ballfist, Australia. During his time at the Churnbowls College he meets somebody who will stick to him until his tragic death in 1989, Drimp Colodoll. He speaks frequently about him in his memoirs and states, “Drimp Colodoll was probably my dearest friend whom I have had the inexplicit joy of having in my acquaintance, though his opinions vary from mine; he is still the friend one could only wish for in certain situations.”</p>
<p>After the death of his eldest brother John Scoot Fitch Jerald, MittenZ abandons his position at the Churnbowls College in 1949 and returns to home. For several months MittenZ would spend his time aiding his sicklied mother, who was at the time 66. MittenZ’ mother never recovers, and dies in 1950. MittenZ states in his Journal:</p>
<p>”August 20, 1950.</p>
<p>My mother is gone. My mother.. Is gone..”</p>
<p>This is the only time MittenZ will speak of his mother’s death.</p>
<p>After his Mother’s death, MittenZ would enroll in the Cloverfaced College 230 miles from his childhood home of Goatlington until the following June where he leaves the college to enlist in the Australian army. MittenZ was commissioned as an officer 1st battalion, Clombderdon Heavy Infantry. MittenZ arrived at the front line in a town called Solay Forstroodlement. He was later injured at the Battle of Barkingdogs and returned to his studies after the war had ended.</p>
<p>In 1952, MittenZ applied for Corfangledon College in Collerfest, Australia. He was accepted, and will later state that his place at the Corfangledon College would be the sole place that would encourage him to write ‘The Goats of the World’ and ‘The Goat To Man: A New Stage in the Evolutionary Process’. MittenZ received heavy criticism for his evolutionary theories on Goats, but he continued to astound scientists and people a like. His third book “The Goat to be” was ranked the third best seller of 1955. He will later receive the award “the Goatlin award for literary and scientific expertise” in 1964.</p>
<p>In 1957 MittenZ would meet a late Lorry Vanstroodlehyme at the National Convention for Evolutionary Progress, they became fast friends and in 1959 they would marry. There’s much speculation on how and why Lorry Vanstroodlehyme married MittenZ, some theorize that she was simply after MittenZ newly acquired wealth. But MittenZ merely states, “Lorry and I were in love, and at such a feeble age one must assume that marriage was simply cliché—if we didn’t tie it then when would the next chance present itself? I married Lorry with this ideal. And I have no regrets.”</p>
<p>MittenZ retired from his position at the Corfangledon College to continue his work on Goats, Lorry and MittenZ both agreed to buying an estate up on the Cloudinthesky Mountains, Northern Australia in 1961—this house would usher in a new train of thought for MittenZ. Just one month after they settle into the estate, MittenZ starts work on his acclaimed Goat trilogy ‘The Goat with No Name’, ‘The Goat in the Train’ and the completely unrelated ‘The Twisted, winded epicycles of a perfectly trained Goat horde’. All three will inherently increase MittenZ’ popularity among people. By 1962, about 74% of the Earth’s population owned one of MittenZ’ books. He will later state, “This popularity baffles even me. I’m simply an Australian born goat-lover with a theory, but you people flatter me. And I thank you.”</p>
<p>In 1964 Lorry Vanstroodlehyme dies, leaving MittenZ with a tainted memory of the best years of his life. MittenZ will later state that during his marriage he had actively cheated on Lorry with a 27-year-old evolutionist from the United States Institute for Goatly Talks named Debra Wisinhower. Some say the unnecessary strain on the relationship is what might have caused Lorry to die so suddenly. MittenZ never spoke to a single Woman again until his death in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1965 MittenZ picks up the pen once again and starts work on a completely renovated style, the book he would publish would set him up with legends like Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, and Steve Erwin. ‘The Evolutionary Process in the Eyes of a Goat’ would make MittenZ a national and world success. He would later state in his Memoirs that this book opened his mind up to new experiences. This book encouraged MittenZ to make the Documentary film, ‘The Goat Sky’ which would play a scrutinizing 20 months in the Movie theatres. In 1967 MittenZ was awarded with the highest honors in Australia, and was elected Prime Minister—Australia’s economy was never the same. Shortly thereafter, MittenZ would make Australia a World Power and a center for World Peace among countries differing in opinion. He would connect the Middle East through peaceful democracy and would end all world conflicts like China Vs. U.S. and Palestine Vs. Israel. Both settled to agree on terms MittenZ would conjure up personally.</p>
<p>In 1977 MittenZ lost the election to Charles Francais Goraninty, Mitz admitted that he himself had failed Australia in 1975 when a typhoon hit Western Australia, which was built to withstand any typhoon so promised by MittenZ, and he had openly regretted ever setting up the Typhoon Alert System—which was responsible for thousands of deaths. Shortly after the Typhoon war broke out between India and Brazil which would result in a massive power struggle between the two ‘already’ World Powers. Australia vowed to keep out of the war, but after outstanding criticism from both the U.N. and the U.S. Australia had to interfere and so it did. 49,032 Australians were lost in a nuclear attack as Australian forces were being deployed in the Eastern borders of Brazil. This caused an outrage among the Australian people and MittenZ was deemed the worst Prime Minister (In a time of war) to ever come into power. MittenZ retired respectively and wished Charles Francais Goraninty the best of luck, unfortunately that luck did not occur. And Australia has been on a downward spiral ever since.</p>
<p>In 1979, with the Police Enforcement Act of Legitimate Time-Inspecting Presuppositions MittenZ fled from Australia and its dictator Charles Francais Goraninty, he fled to the People’s Republic of China—but did not stay very long. He then fled to Russia where both the people would greet him and it’s active government, unfortunately for MittenZ he was attacked by some twenty Christian Radicalists who have an outspoken disagreement with anything that has to do with Evolution. He was hospitalized for four weeks until he was lead out of the country by plane. The Russian Government vowed to never see that happen again, but MittenZ never returned to Russia. Instead he fled to the United States of America. Where he would write ‘The Screeds of Man: A study on dull Politicians and their idealisms’ which would, again, boost MittenZ credibility. But unfortunately for MittenZ the long-standing Nuclear strike by Brazil (Which was later renamed the South American Union under the impending Globalist agenda that was being pushed by Edwardo Devasquiz) was still a deep-wound in many people. And he did not receive much support.</p>
<p>In 1982 he would return to Australia once again, with the fall of Charles Francais Goraninty and his fascist regime Australia was once again a free Democracy, partially Liberal for the people could not muster enough courage to trust the Conservative party that was currently set there. During the time MittenZ spent in hiding, his brother Richard Nixonton and his sister Abbigal Loanhart Graffole and her husband were both killed in many of the outcries against the Fascist government that was set. This affected MittenZ in a very peculiar way, and he would retire to his childhood home in Goatlington until 1988 where he suffered from a stroke and was rushed to the hospital, only to be diagnosed with Ass cancer. After a year fighting, MittenZ’ ass simply gave up. And he died at the age of 69.</p>
<p>Career as a Scholar</p>
<p>MittenZ spent his best years as a professor for several colleges; he was a grand spectacle indeed. He taught at Corfangledon College for 9 years (1952 to 1961) and was later a Professor of Modern day Evolution and Common Biology at the College of Comminghand for two years until he retired from teaching and concentrated his efforts on his writing and theorizing. MittenZ up to his death craved the comfortable life of a College professor, but he simply did not have enough energy in order to be compatible in such a profession. So he sent the notion out with the cat. And he never did dwell on the subject again, until 1987 in a letter to his brother Marcus O’Reilly Nixonton. MittenZ was much affected by the works of Don Scottferd Macarthur and his works on the Human psyche as well as his Political ideology, he was also very much influenced by Dougless Ramathor whom he had secretly read in his Summer estate in Belfadge, Australia every Summer.</p>
<p>Career as a Writer</p>
<p>MittenZ was always affected by Literature and the study of Human and Animal biology, ever since he was a child he dreamt of someday becoming a famous author, never in his mind did he ever have the notion of becoming a World leader. But it comes with the territory, and with age comes wisdom. During MittenZ complicated life he wrote several books, most theorizing about the evolution of common goats—as well as the goat-to-man theory, which had never been heard of until MittenZ came along. MittenZ is probably best known for his works on Goat evolution and his long-standing battles with Creationists.</p>
<p><br />
’The Goat To Man: A New Stage in the Evolutionary Process’</p>
<p>was a book professing the Evolution between Man and Goat; MittenZ believed that there was no Ape in the Evolutionary chain—merely a goat. He believed, and studied, the many similarities between goat and man. Even comparing fossils with that of a Human skeleton. Which is the essential basis of this book. In this book, we find that MittenZ believes strongly in Evolution and Natural Selection, but he does not believe there was an ape or a “Common Ancestor” in the equation. He believed the Goat was our previous state, and he believed the goat is a perfect being. As he states in the book, “The goat is not a worthless character, nay—it is a free and wild beast. If you tease it with carrots it will charge, if you pat it and love it you will gain a friend. This is essentially the same as a Human, only we do not desire carrots as much. Human interaction is a chemical phenomenon; human hatred is a chemical phenomenon. Any act or emotion that seems like a self-evident truth (but deemed inappropriate by the Mass Public) is merely part of the Humans nature; we simply inherited these “genes” from the goat. And thus we are similar to the Goat.”</p>
<p>’Goats in Evolution’</p>
<p>the book is simply that, it explains where and how the goat comes into the Evolutionary chain and why. It explains the goat’s purpose and the goat’s features, and it also explains (in low-detail) about the common interaction a goat has with a human. It is a book theorizing the goat’s abilities, as well as the goat’s faults. In his memoirs, MittenZ states, “The book ‘Goats in Evolution’ merely explains the goat’s role in Evolution, you may not know it—but the goat plays a vital part in Natural Selection; as well as Evolution in general. It explains the traits of the goats, the character and the general attitude that is currently accepted amongst them.”</p>
<p>‘How Goats came To Be’</p>
<p>is a study on how Goats modernized, and how Natural Selection chooses the finest goats. It explains the traits that are developed between goats, and how and why the weakest of the goats dies off. It goes into detail about differentiations amongst different sets of goats. It’s a book about Natural Selection, and its affect on Goats. MittenZ did not speak much about this book in his Memoirs; he simply stated that when he was making it a woman named Maggy Pinchiner constantly nagged him on the style in which he has inherited.</p>
<p><br />
’The Study of Goats in Person’ (co-written by Drimp)</p>
<p>is a two-year study on goats, which earned MittenZ and Drimp an award for their overt attempt at spreading Goat awareness, and what we can do to try and stop goat abuse. MittenZ spent a lengthy time writing about ‘The Study of Goats in Person’ he went into character, and the endeavors him and Drimp went through during their two-year place in the wilderness studying these goats. The Goat Trilogy</p>
<p>The Goat Trilogy is a children’s book series on Goats and the adventures they face, and how they overcome them. It is a children’s book series, so it shouldn’t be taken seriously. They are simply moral stories.</p>
<p>’The Goat With No Name’</p>
<p>is the first book in the acclaimed Goat Trilogy, which starts off with a goat with no name wondering the hill-side in search of better feed without any friends. It details his adventures and how he reacts in certain situations, it is a moral story for children 7-under. And is a beautiful book filled with love and adventure. MittenZ speaks little of the Goat Trilogy, but he did say this, “In order for us humans to set a common decency and an understanding of morals we must for put ourselves in the position of certain characters and react in best suitable ways. The biggest attack the psuedo-religious nut-jobs have against Evolution is that we set no Moral Stronghold, and we are simply sitting on Morass. Well this is just an attack on those who attack us with such puerile misunderstandings and generalizations.”</p>
<p>’The Goat on a Train’</p>
<p>Is the sequel to the first book ‘The Goat with No Name’ it, again, details the adventures of certain goats who are in search of better feed and shelter from predators. In addition to MittenZ’ previous book, he creates some powerful characters in this story—some even frightful! In all, this book is about Morals and general decency for modern day society.</p>
<p>’The Twisted, winded epicycles of a perfect trained Goat horde’</p>
<p>this is, like the two others in this Trilogy, a thrilling adventure story of bandit goats who want everything their way. Fortunately for us, Daved Gingersnap and his gang of detectives thwart these brutes in their plot to poison the world’s water supply and rape Supreme Overlord Casey Richards.</p>
<p>’Scholarly Articles/books</p>
<p>‘The Evolutionary Process in the Eyes of a Goat’</p>
<p>is a book that details the mind-boggling views of a goat that is questioning his existence, it’s essentially a debate held within the confines of a teenaged goat between a Creationist and an Evolutionist. It is an insightful book that details the attacks of the Creationist Right-wing nut-jobs and the responses you can use to thwart them.</p>
<p>’The Screeds of Man: A study on dull Politicians and their idealisms’</p>
<p>Is a delightful book about Politicians and their attempts to silence freedoms, it’s a hilarious book that pokes fun at every RIGHT-WING FASICST NUTJOB TO EVERY GRACE THIS FUCKING EARTH AND IF I SEE ONE MORE I’LL BEAT THEIR HEADS IN WITH A METAL TUBE WITH GLASS SHREDDED ONTO BECAUSE I’M COOL LIKE THAT!!</p>
<p>Memoirs</p>
<p>Is a detailed study on the events that took place in MittenZ life, it explains in full detail the decisions he made and the situations he had to endure to insure his place in History.</p>
<p>MittenZ death and legacy</p>
<p>MittenZ will forever be imprinted on the concrete slabs of History. His insightful ideals and his general understanding of human-goat biology will forever leave its mark on the wall of History. MittenZ asked if he could be remembered solely for the achievements in which he takes great pride in; as he told his sister in one of the last known letters that MittenZ wrote during the years of his illness. He states, “Dear sister, there is not much time left—and I do feel a jabbing pain in my ass at this very moment. But I’d like to thank you, and all of you, who made my life a pleasure. I only wish to be remembered for my writings on goats, the studies I have made and the articles I have written. The debates I’ve gone through, all-worthless to me in the long run. I’d simply like them to understand the goats; I’d like them all to understand what it is to be a goat. This is all I ask in return.”</p>

<p>Klay World: Off the Table is a 2005 DVD claymation film created by Robert Benfer, known by his internet nickname, -Knox-. It continues the adventures of his signature blue clay men on their home, Klay World. It is set up in a similar vein of his previous short movies. It features some of his clay men from older movies and lots of new ones. Notable recurring characters are the crazy Dr. Bob, the time-travelling Dr. Brown, the helpful no-armed guy and the strange long-armed guy.</p>

<p><b>Spoiler warning:</b> plot and/or ending details below It starts with two stone-age clay people conversing, until a sudden flash of light accompanies the arrival of Dr. Brown and his time-machine hat. With Brown are two clay men, Chip Brown who is Brown's nephew and Rick the Prick, Chip's beanie-wearing, piercing-studded friend. They observe the stone-age clay men but then an argument starts between Chip and Brown, so they return to the present. After their disappearence, a stone-age clay man takes out a spanner and zaps his mate with a bolt of electricity, killing him.</p>
<p>Back at the present Chip breaks up with his uncle, and after a strange conversation with the bearded clay man Vince they confirm nothing interesting ever happens on Klay World. Their attention is caught by a crowd of clay men all talking, as Dr. Bob steps up to the podium. He announces that they were contacted by another species of clay people through a purple radio set. Then Dr. Bob announces the arrival of Mr. Black, the smartest clay man on Klay world. He brings up a clay man called Smiling Gary (so-called because he is always smiling) to re-tell his alien encounter through the radio, and then says that they shall build a truck to leave the house and find the aliens who contacted them.</p>
<p>Chip and Rick then hear an alien signal through the radio again, and so thay decide they shoul join. They then meet up with the crew of this expedition: Mr. Black, Dr. Bob, Smiling Gary and a high-voiced happy-go-lucky ski-hat wearer, Pick. First the crew refuses their joining but then Chip announces he is the nephew of Dr. Brown, in which Mr. Black says he can join since Brown stole the time-machine which he invented. They begin work on their truck, but they are so stupid they didn't build anything, and resolve to order one on the Internet.</p>
<p>After a Nikko Max RC truck arrives, they set off. But since the truck only seats four, Rick cannot come with them and Dr. Bob must stay behind to manage the radio. Dr. Bob assures Rick this may be a terrible idea, and so the crew set off into the unknown world past the front door.</p>
<p>At Klay World, they adjust the radio set so that it can communicate through the truck via walkie-talkie. However, it does not work and the no-armed guy lends a hand.</p>

<p>Takamine Hideo was born in Aizu, Wakamatsu (present day Fukushima Prefecture) in 1854. After completing his studies in the feudal domain's school, Nisshinkan, he became a page to the daimyo Matsudaira Katamori from April of 1868 to the surrender of the domain in November that same year. Like many youths, and samurai, he was sentenced to kinshin confinement for a time in Edo (renamed Tokyo). He soon attended KEIOGIJYUKU (present day Keio University founded by Fukuzawa Yukichi) and later received a scholarship to attend Oswego Normal School (present day Oswego SUNY), in New York State from 1875-1878. He was fortunate to attend Oswego during the very height of its fame as a progressive and innovative institution for teacher education. Takamine interacted with E.A. Sheldon the director of the school and lived with famed educator Johann Heinrich Hermann KRÜSI (1817-1903)(often noted as Hermann Krusi).</p>
<p>During his time in the United States he also attended Anderson School of Natural History on Penikese Island during the summer of 1877 and spent one semester studying under Burt Wilder, a famous zoologist at Cornell University. He was the first Japanese (many believed the first Asian) to have a teaching credential.</p>
<p>After returning to Japan, he became an assistant to American scientist Edward Sylvester Morse and accompanied him on a trek to the rugged areas of Hokkaido which occupied by the Ainu.</p>
<p>He eventually became the Vice Principal and Principal of the Tokyo Normal School and Tokyo Higher Normal School (same school but the name was changed), Principal of the Tokyo Art School, and Tokyo Music School. Most importantly he was deeply involved in women's education and became the Principal of Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School.</p>
<p>Generally, he is remembered as the man who introduced Pestallozian teaching methods and philosophy to Japan due to his translation of James Johonnot's Principles and Practice of Teaching into Japanese as KYOIKU SHINRON [the new theory of education] 1885. Other projects he focused on included Japan's Exhibit in the Columbian Exposition of 1893 (World's Fair 1893) and he was involved in the 1909 Great Britain and Japan Exhibition. His legacy can be concluded as an attempt to implement the American model of Education in his native country. In the end, the more conservative, German model was adopted by Japan.</p>

<p>''''<i><b>What happens when you blend the sensuality of Sade, the spiritual resonance of Enya, the power of a mesmerizing live performer and genre pioneer, whose seductive masculine voice is already well-known around the world? The phenomenon is known as THE EARTHMAN EXPERIENCE! Earthman is receiving amazing reviews from fans and industry alike. Heard most recently on his entire original score of HBO’s Pledge of Allegiance, music for the History Channel’s History Mystery and numerous TV and radio commercials from The Goodwill Games, to Oil of Olay and Citibank, to Win Dixie, and Click Radio, his newest live performance was filmed at NYC’s MAKOR by French Television and broadcast on CUNY-TV. Captured on tape was a rapturous audience response to a collection of powerful, original tonal music that immerses the listener into polyphonic vocal sounds, creating vibrations actually shown to promote healing. “Being disconnected is an illusion,” says Earthman. “We ARE all connected, as evidenced by the state of world events. “If we don’t love others then we cannot love ourselves. Listening to my music allows people of all cultures to resonate on the same frequency, promoting peace and cellular unification.” His rapturous, energy-filled performances are most often described as "religious experiences." Prophet? Preacher? Shaman? Guru? Teacher? No matter what you label him, it's evident that his energy, music and healing come from the heart. Sound out of this world? So does his remarkable journey to THE EARTHMAN EXPERIENCE. This veteran of new music genres, Haitian born Richard Laurent first pioneered the emergence of “House Music” in the late ‘80’s as leader of MOONFOU, selling 250,000 of his original ATA Records hit, “I SAY SHUT UP” his first time out. Building on this amazing debut, he formed “KRAZE” in the mid ‘90’s with his two sisters and ex-Madonna boyfriend, Norris Borroughs. With their very first outing for Big Beat Records, they hit ..1 worldwide on Billboard selling 350,000 copies! This sparked an international “KRAZE” tour, which took them to Australia, the UK, Amsterdam, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Germany, Japan and Tunisia. By now, Laurent had already been researching a new passion called Bio Sonics, healing through vocal tones, frequencies, and sonic vibrations, the theory behind ultrasound. While in Tunisia, he sought out a group of healers he read were already doing this work. Hooked and fascinated, he stayed for many months studying with them. His swift and remarkable proficiency in channeling the healing, vibrational tones of meditative vocal chanting led the healers to dub him “EARTHMAN.” “I am lucky to have come from a culture where non-traditional healing is valued and to have also inherited the vocal aptitude of my mother, who’s an incredible opera singer. Now is the time to help people tap into their own subconscious mind to be present to love at deeper levels. Love of self and others creates connection. I’ve always had this ability to reach people and now I know how to share it with others.” His powerful performance of “Put Myself in Heaven” is strong testimony to his gift. In an effort to shine light on the atrocities and natural disasters that Haiti has been going through for the past 200 years. Earthman recently participated in a “Benefit Concert for Haiti” sponsored by Artist Relief Fund for Haiti (ARFH) and held at New York’s Club SOB’s. Earthman and his band were one of the openers for Grammy-award winning superstar WYCLEF JEAN &amp; his partner JERRY WONDER. The packed SOB’s house witnessed and raved the introduction of Earthman, a supreme force to be reckoned with in the new millennium. Earthman has also rocked Brooklyn's BAM CAFE and The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC). The world needs THE EARTHMAN EXPERIENCE and Earthman is ready to spread the soulful and intoxicating sounds of the next new wave of music to people everywhere.” Ready to be transformed? Well, ready or not, here he''''</b></i></p>

<p>PG Games is a gaming company founded in 2002 by Kimberly Kubus, with the help of fellow game maker Siege Delux who helped create a few of the first games.. through the years the popularity of PG Games has grown to be a very familiar name.. the games are created with Game Maker, a game creation tool created by Mark Overmars, a few of the games has also been created with Klik &amp; Play and some other tools..</p>
<p>PG Games has created many games, most of them lost or deleted, but the current list of games on the website represent the official games that will not be lost anymore.. PG Games is known for creating games with a bad taste that at the same time are original and creative and appeals to a certain crowd... the company is most famous for the Johnny games, one of the longest running Game Maker game series.. it is based upon a simple platform concept, but still stays original.. other popular titles include Cooking Breakfast 2, Lawnmover Massacre and Friday The 13th 3.. all these games have had fan games created by other users of the program Game Maker..</p>
<p>The name "PG Games" stands for "Paradise of Great Games", it does not have anything to do with the game rating PG, usually the games are playable by any age, but some of the games contain adult content such as Nice Game which contains images of dead people.. and some games contain lots of themes based around the concept of killing, darkness and gory battle scenes..</p>
<p>How many titles that have actually been released by PG Games is unknown, it is assumed there are over 50 titles released, but most of them are obscure pranks and unplayable games that have been lost and/or removed..</p>
<p>All games are 100% freeware and can be downloaded easily and free from the official website..</p>
<p>Cooking Breakfast 2 spawned a huge reaction because of the flashing screen and intense sound in the game that could give people epeleptic seizures.. and Nice Game contained scenes of cannibalism, monsters and dead people.. thus the company has called themselves an evil company, even though those games are just a simple joke..</p>
