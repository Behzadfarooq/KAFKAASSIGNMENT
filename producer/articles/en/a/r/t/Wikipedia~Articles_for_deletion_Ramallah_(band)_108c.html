<li><b>Keep</b>Please read TedFrank's user talk page history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TedFrank&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117720240" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TedFrank&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117720240" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TedFrank&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117720240</a> for recent drama between him and me (I authored the recent version of the article). This appears to be a spillover from that page, though I thought that the dispute was over. TedFrank has repeatedly added the "notoriety" and "citation" tag to the page, and I attempted to fix the problem (to his liking) to no avail. If there are problems which need to be addressed, please explain more clearly how I can do so (i.e. notoriety) instead of simply trying to get the article deleted. I have found the band's CDs for sale at various stores near my residence, so the band seems notable, though I don't know what I can cite or write on the page to accredit the band as notable. TedFrank has also attempted to remove an addition to the "Racism" article I made and described it as "vandalism." <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 15:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is clearly a personal attack, and that was all I was attempting to point out. in other words, the article is only being targetted because you dislike me, not because you actually have a concern for quality. I have been working on making the article better, and you have not been any help - rather, you have simply attempted to delete it within an hour or 2 of adding the tag that called for a notability reference.<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 15:47, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>also, this isn't my "pet article." It was created by others, and I found it and decided that, because I enjoy the band, I would make it better. for that it faces deletion, even as I am attemptign to fix the problems by asking for suggestions on the discussion page <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 15:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article is being targeted because it fails to meet Wikipedia criteria, and I brought the AfD because you repeatedly removed a legitimate notability tag. If you wish to attack my response to your vandalism on other articles, take it to <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, because this is not the place for it. If you don't want the article to be deleted, you need to talk about the article and why it complies with Wikipedia policies, not about me. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 15:52, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's fairly clear that you have directly sought out the page in order to continue the drama. You can argue all you want against that point, but I frankly don't care, and anybody with sense will easily see that you are, basically, trolling.

<li><b>Comment</b> The band meets the following criteria:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). (Thorp Records)</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.(Blood For Blood)</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.(Boston Hardcore scene)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> Certainly these are parameters specified in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. They need to be added to the article; we cannot deduce their existence otherwise. If appropriate qualifying standards exist in the article, then clearly the article attracts support. But they have to be present in the text in order to be considered.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 16:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I wont disagree with you, Anthony, but the fact of the matter is that I have only been working on the article for less than a day or two, unfortunately my attempt to revise it simply attracted TedFrank's attention. If given time I can modify the article (the US tour is cited in the article already, for one thing).<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 16:07, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> May as well delete it then. Since my mom just died yesterday, I've been fairly fucked in the head, and I doubt I'll even want to deal with the pressure and antagonism here. I tried making amends with TedFrank, and the fact that he has been cynical to the point of attempting to get rid of the one page I cared for (as seen on my userpage) actually really got to me. Maybe I'm being a wuss, but...whatever. Bye. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 16:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Both Thorp Records and Thorpe Records are red-linked. The <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_for_Blood_9703.html" title="Blood for Blood">Blood for Blood</a> article also fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>; I've tagged it. Ramallah has next to no mention in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_hardcore.html" title="Boston hardcore">Boston hardcore</a> article, except in a bulleted list of about 80 bands. The Ramallah article says they cancelled their international tour (and I question whether such a tour would satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Every one of Sayers' claims flunks scrutiny. The article has been tagged since February, and Sayers was the one who removed the tag indicating that he didn't wish the article to undergo any further scrutiny. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 16:13, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
