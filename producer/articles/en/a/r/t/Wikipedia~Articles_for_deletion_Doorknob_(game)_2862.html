<dd>Okay - if you review this history of this article, you can see that it started out as a generic and short description of the game, which I consider to be acceptible among other articles about "informal" games such as tag, etc. I added considerably to it to make it an April Fool's page, and tagged it as such. Then it disappeared before I had a chance to fix it after April 1st. Then it reappeared, and someone chopped it down to one badly-written sentence. The article is useless right now, I but I would be willing to restore it to a good list of the game's rules, written in a formal tone. However, I don't want to waste my time if it's just going to get deleted. Aguerriero 14:34, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Another update - I just restored the article and edited it to be formal and encyclopedic. Please review the current version before voting. Aguerriero 14:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a pretty good example of something real (and probably verifiable), but still simply not an encyclopedic topic. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I encourage everyone to support this article remaining intact, because it documents a legitimate game that many of us played or still play. Aguerriero 14:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I added a published reference to the article. I disagree that this constitutes "something made up in school one day". While it probably was at one point, you can find people all over the world who played this game. It is written about in books. I consider it on par with other playground games that have articles, as well as phenomina like <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calling_shotgun.html" title="Calling shotgun">Calling shotgun</a>. Aguerriero 16:09, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I just don't see a reason why not too keep it, especially now that there's a published reference about it posted. I feel like some people here may be mistaking the absurdity of the game for absurdity of the article. There's a lot of references to it not being encyclopaedic, but I'm not really sure what that means? If it's simply a matter of language or style, that can easily be fixed, and shouldn't be a reason to delete. <b><a href="../../../b/m/e/User_talk%7EBmearns_89f8.html" title="User talk:Bmearns"><span style="color:green">B.</span></a><a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmearns_0c69.html" title="User:Bmearns"><span style="color:navy">Mearns</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmearns_15b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmearns"><sup style="color:red">*</sup></a></b>, <tt style="color:pink">KSC</tt> 16:38, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Something like this has been around for at least 50 years, although I don't remember anything about doorknobs, and I don't remember it from Boy Scouts. Calling 'safeties' was something junior high boys did while standing around shooting the breeze. I wouldn't have called it a game then, and I won't now. And I don't believe it belongs in Wikipedia. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 16:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As much as it pains me to say it, this <i>is</i> a widespread 'game' that has existed in some form (and at least some places) for decades.

<li><b>Comment</b> as mentioned in several of the comments here, no one here made up the game, in school or otherwise. <b><a href="../../../b/m/e/User_talk%7EBmearns_89f8.html" title="User talk:Bmearns"><span style="color:green">B.</span></a><a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmearns_0c69.html" title="User:Bmearns"><span style="color:navy">Mearns</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmearns_15b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmearns"><sup style="color:red">*</sup></a></b>, <tt style="color:pink">KSC</tt> 02:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This definitely fits into not for things, the only reference listed on the page isn't a study or report on childhood games as the example on the NFTs page (freak dancing) is. I think wikipedia policy is pretty clear on this issue hence the three times over speedy deletion. <b><a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.reed_7e4e.html" title="User:J.reed"><font color="green">J.reed</font></a></b><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> 19:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The NFT argument is absurd because it fails every test on the NFT. This is not just a dictionary article; it explains the entire game. This is not for "someone's own purpose"; it is to document a well-known and much-played game. This is verifiable, both by the reference cited and by the number of people from all over the country who have commented here who recognize the game. And finally, this definitely isn't original research. So, do tell: on what ground do you claim the NFT argument, other than that its your personal opinion? The fact that you or others consider the game "childish" or "sophmoric" doesn't mean anything, nor is it a reason to remove something from Wikipedia. There are people out there who would want to read the article either to learn about the game or as a nostalgic reference. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 19:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
