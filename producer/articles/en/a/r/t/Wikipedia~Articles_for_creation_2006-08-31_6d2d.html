<p>Dr. Donald F. Roberts of Stanford University, studied the effects of media for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>The Recreational Software Advisory Council rating service for the Internet (RSACi) who used the works of Dr. Donald F. Roberts merged with the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA) in 1999. The original aims of RSAC, to protect children from potentially harmful content while preserving free speech on the internet, continue to provide the cornerstone for ICRA's work, backed by the biggest names online.</p>

<p>Duke is the final boss of King of Fighters Maximum Impact, and returns as a selectable character in Maximum Impact 2, otherwise known as King of Fighters 2006 in the US. Not much is known about this man, except that he is the leader of the group "Mephistopheles", the syndicate currently controlling Southtown. He became a target of an attempted assassination by Fate, a rival gang member, and foster father to Alba and Soiree Meira. The disturbing scar on his neck possibly signifies that he survived the attempt, but people see him as an immortal because of said scar. In response to this futile attempt on his life, he decided to return the favor by hiring an assassin named Lien Neville to kill Fate. Unlike Fate's attempt, Lien succeeded in her master's task by breaking Fate's neck. Duke quickly rose in power in Southtown, until he gained complete control of it. Years later, he hosted the King of Fighters Maximum Impact tournament, with his group now under the public name "Metatron", to recruit new members, and to learn more of Alba &amp; Soiree Meira, whom he heard were out for revenge. In the final battle, he fought against Alba, and lost. Before Alba strode in to kill him, though, the lights dimmed, and screams were heard. When the lights came back, Duke, along with the spectators in the arena, vanished. The only clue left behind was a message left by Duke. Written in blood, the message read as follows:</p>
<p>"I'll see you in Hell!"</p>
<p>Later, in one of the other characters' storylines, it is learned that "Mephistopheles" is actually part of a bigger organization, known as "Addis", which is lead, we now know, by a man named Jivatma, another character in Maximum Impact 2, and the boss of that game.</p>
<p>In Maximum Impact 2, Duke returns, with a partner named Nagase. He no longer wants revenge on Alba, but has now set his sights on killing Jivatma, for reasons unknown (possibly because Jivatma betrayed him).</p>
<p>Duke is another example of the infamous "SNK Boss Syndrome." When you fight him in Maximum Impact as a boss, he has an infinite super meter. He is considered to be extremely "cheap" because 2 of his supers can be used over and over again for massive damage. One of his supers is a stream of fire that is fast, and hard to block. It also stuns your opponent, even when they block. The 2nd "cheap" super move is his signature move, known as "Ground Zero." He cannot be hit out of it, and if you do, then you will lose almost half of your health meter as Duke slams his fist into the ground, causing an extremely large explosion that takes up half of the screen.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Duke can be considered as "the devil personified." With his dark grey skin, blood-colored jacket, and jet-black hair, he is truly a force to be reckoned with. One of his rigging models in Maximum Impact even adds bat wings and horns to accompany this fact. Truly, he is one of the greatest King of Fighters bosses ever.</p>

<p><b>Beach-Head</b>, the rough tough and always ready to rumble Ranger of the highly elite G.I. Joe team is a character that is disliked by many, but loved passionately by a few who can see the greatness this character has to offer. The favorite character of G.I. JOE writer Chuck Dixon, he is revealed to be a highly trained and modivated man. He is primarily known to the fans of both the Cartoon and Comics as the 'DI from Hell' because of his almost impossibly high standards and what some consider brutal training methods; it is widely known that despite his cool head on the battle-feild he has absolutely no tolerance for other people's incompetence and laziness, especially concerning their physical training and preperation.</p>

<p>The forests of the Northwest have not been managed well in the past. They have been utilized for one purpose---the production of wood fiber. Little care has been given to prevent habitat destruction and less to rehabilitating these abused forestlands.</p>
<p>Since the 1980's several Southern Oregon forestland owners have been at the leading edge of a new generation of forest managers. These forest land owners have found that the best method of managing these cut over lands is to try to enable them to recover as a forest ecosystem, as they were prior to man's entry into the forest.</p>
<p>Many forest professionals and land owners think of these lands only as "secondary" forests of even-age stands which are to be left alone until time to come back in and cut them all again. Forest farmers believe that these forests have been so abused that they are completely out of balance and must be manipulated in order to bring them back into ecological balance. They must be thinned, but no species is ever to be completely decimated. There must never be so much thinning that the crown cover is depleted leaving the forest floor exposed to excessive sun or rain. There must be a cross-section of trees of all ages. Trees are not thinned solely for the removal of the largest healthiest individuals- in fact wherever a healthy large tree can be left, it is left to grow larger and stronger. Only the weaker, sick or damaged trees are removed to give the healthy ones more space, food and sunlight so that they may thrive.</p>
<p>Today, forest farm owners take heart in the knowledge that, although their efforts may not bring them financial reward, it brings forth an even greater reward... a natural and varied forest habitat that can support many creatures and a healthier, happier earth.</p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>In 1984 Orville Camp published his book, "Natural Selection Forestry, A Guide to Natural Selection Forestry", which galvanized landowners to resist standard forest practices and allow nature to tell them how to manage forests.</p>
<p>In 2005, Ms. jeannie Kendrick wrote her book "Alex's Forest Farm" (Copyright TX 6-269-353) which chronicled, both verbally and photographically, the actual forest management activities carried on at their forest farm. This book exhibits an incredible array of native plants and animals actually living in their forest.</p>

<p><b>Ethiopology means mystries around the countries that border Ethiopia and Egypt.</b> The word was founded in 1922 meaning the study of the countries that are in the horn of Africa. In the 12th century before the Fasil Ethiopian tower was built the place was owened by the kingdom of axum "ak'sum" but after 2centuries the axum kingdom was overthrew by Manuan an Egyptian Leader who claimed to have the tresures of Raphayus. This great mystery had not been found untill the late 1820s when it was passed down. This word still is unwritten in many of the world's dictionaries but behind it lies great mysteries.</p>

<p>"Frenesi" is one of the songs Artie Shaw recorded in March of 1940. "Freseni" became one of his big-hit recordings. For that session he combined a full stinged instrument section with a normal swing band which also included French horns along with woodwind instruments. Using French horns in a jazz band during the "Frenesi" recording was a first in the history of jazz. By Jay Miles</p>

<p>The Sydney Assyrian community is a large and tight knit community. They are mainly based around the Fairfield city area in western Sydney.</p>
<p>The first Assyrians turned up as migrants into Australia in the early 1960's, they settled in the eastern suburbs of Sydney until a decision was made to base the Assyrian community of sydney around Fairfield. Since then they have expanded and populated the Fairfield area and more Assyrian families started to flow into Fairfield to join their relatives after the Iraqi Gulf war in the 1990's. The estimated Assyrian population of Sydney is close to 35,000.</p>

<p><b>Veerapandiya Kattabomman</b> ('Veerapandiyan' means 'brave one in the pandiyan line') also known as Kattabomman or Katta Bommu hails from Panchalankurichi, a historically important place, in the present day Thoothukudi, a district in Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
<p><b>Background</b> Veerapandya Kattabomman was born in Tamil nadu in a Aadi Kattabommu and Aarumugathammal on January 3, 1760 and became the 47th king of Panchalankurichi at an age of 30. Veerapandya Kattabomman's father Aadi Kattabommu was a minister in the court of Jagaveera Pandyan, a desendent in the Pandya line. Jagaveera pandyan was issueless and declared Kattabomman as his successor. Since Kattabomman was the first of the new clan, he came to be known as Adi Kattabomman (aadi means first or beginning in Sanskrit and Tamil).</p>
<p><b>Revolt against British rule</b> Veerapandiya Kattabomman is among the kings in southern India who resisted the British East India Company. He initially evaded tax that the British demanded and ignored repeated summons to meet collector Jackson. Later his meeting with Jackson ended in a physical combat in which Deputy Commandant of the Company’s forces, Clarke, was slain. He later revolted against the British by refusing to pay taxes when a new collector was assigned to retrieve due taxes. This resulted in the British East India Company, under the leadership of Major Bannerman, dispatchng the army to capture Kattabomman. The Company's army circled Kattabomman's fort at Salikulam, a few miles from Panchalanckurichi, intending to arrest him there. This later turned out to be lossful battle for the British with them losing a great fraction of the assigned troops including Lieutenant Collins. Immediately after the retreat of the British forces, Kattabomman vacated his fort suspecting impending cannon attacks from the British which his fort may not have withstood. The East India Company put a price on his head. He was later betrayed by the Raja of Pudukottai which resulted in his arrest and subsequent execution. He was hung from a tamarind tree in 1799 at kayathar. After that his fort was completely demolished by the British and his wealth was looted.</p>
<p><b>National Hero</b> The government of Tamil Nadu honored the hero by raising a monumental fort at Panchalankurichi in his memory. His name is remembered among the people as a brave tamil hero who stood against the British long before the first war of Indian independence that would be instigated by Mangal Pandey on 1857.</p>

<p>Adventure tourism typically involves travelling into remote, inaccessible and possibly hostile areas. It may include the performance of acts that require significant effort and grit and may also involve some degree of risk.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Eco-Tourism The concept of 'Eco-tourism' came into its own in 2002, when the United Nations celebrated the "International Year of Eco-tourism". The International Eco-tourism Society defines eco-tourism as "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people".</p>
<p>Eco-tourism puts focus on local cultures, wilderness adventures, volunteering, cultural and individual growth, and learning new and better ways to exist in our world. It is classically defined as travel to destinations where the flora, fauna, and cultural heritage are the primary attractions. Responsible eco-tourism includes programs that minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment, and enhance the cultural uprightness of local people. In addition to evaluating environmental and cultural factors, there are initiatives by hospitality providers to promote recycling, energy efficiency, water re-use, and the creation of economic opportunities for local communities. All of these factors form an integral part of eco-tourism.</p>

<p>LAING’S NEK 28 JANUARY 1881</p>
<p>Two days after arriving at Mount Prospect, Colley was determined to dislodge the Boers from Laing’s Nek and open the road to the Transvaal. Leaving the camp at 07h00 he advanced some 8 km to an assembly area at the foot of the pass. His plan of attack was to send the mounted men to drive back the Boer left flank and at the same time attack a high feature, Deane’s Hill (Tafelkop to the Boers) to the east of the nek with the 58th Regiment. The mounted attack failed while the infantry came under heavy fire from well placed Boer sangars and shallow trenches. The British artillery and rocket fire had little effect. The 58th Regiment were forced to withdraw and by noon the action was broken off.</p>
<p>Colley obtained a truce to care for the wounded and bury the dead. The British losses were 7 officers and 76 other ranks killed, 2 taken prisoners of war and 111 wounded. According to custom the men were buried in mass graves near where they fell, but the officers’ bodies were carried back to camp for burial.</p>
<p>The Boers lost 14 killed and possibly as many as 70 wounded. The latter were cared for by Dr. Merensky at Meek’s farm house near Volksrust which had been converted into a hospital. The dead were buried nearby at Rooibult.</p>

<p>68.163.140.85 13:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)In 1986, the first MBTA type 7 cars; made by manufacturer Kinki-Sharyo, were delivered to the MBTA. Since then, theyare the most popular cars in the MBTA. The Type 7 cars are used on the MBTA's Green Line. Many of them have been modified to be used with the MBTA's newer Type 8 cars, made by Breda. In 1997, newer Type 7 cars were ordered; following those, the new Type 8's began service.</p>

The <b>Grand Challenge Cup</b> is the top eights race at the prestigious annual <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henley_Royal_Regatta_8f31.html" title="Henley Royal Regatta">Henley Royal Regatta</a> and is open to male crews from all eligible clubs. Two or more clubs may combine to make an entry and in non-olympic years international development crews have been known to take part in this event.</p>
<p>The event dates from 1839 and was originally called the "Henley Grand Challenge Cup". The Stewards resolved that a Silver Cup, worth 100 guineas, was to be competed for annually by amateur crews in eight-oared boats. One of the prize medals awarded at this first race was presented to the Regatta in 1969, and is on display in the Prize Tent.</p>
<p>The Grand Challenge Cup has since been competed for annually with the notable exception of the years affected by the two World Wars. The eligibility rules have varied over the years, but the premise that the Cup has always been open to all established amateur clubs has remained at its core. In its history the Cup has been won by foreign crews 43 times - 12 times by crews from Germany, 11 from the US, 9 from the former USSR, 3 times each from Australia and Belgium and once each by crews from Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, France and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Cup itself records the names of all winning crews since 1839. The base was added in 1896 and subsequently extended in 1954 and again in 1986. The Book of Honour was added as an integral part of the trophy in 1954. In 1964, the winning Harvard crew of 1914 presented the Regatta with a new cup, identical to the original of 1839, which is now very fragile. This new cup continues to be used as the trophy awarded to the winning crew on finals day.</p>

<b>Scrope v. Grosvenor</b> was one of the earliest <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">heraldic</a> law cases brought in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The case resulted from the fact that two different families were using the same undifferenced <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a>. In the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_century.html" title="Twelfth century">twelfth</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth centuries</a>, the composition of coats of arms was very simple. Most shields consisted of only one <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charge.html" title="Charge">charge</a> and two <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinctures.html" title="Tinctures">tinctures</a>, and there were times when two families bore the same coat of arms in the same jurisdiction. In the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_century.html" title="Fourteenth century">fourteenth century</a> though, cases of two unrelated families bearing the same coat of arms were tolerated less. When this happened, the local <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">monarch</a> was usually called on to make a decision.</p>

<p>In 1385, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_II_of_England_5f00.html" title="Richard II of England">King Richard II of England</a> invaded <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> with his army. During this invasion, two of the king’s <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knights</a> realized that they were using the same coat of arms. Sir Richard Scrope from Bolton in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and Sir Robert Grosvenor from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> were both bearing arms <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazon.html" title="Blazon">blazoned</a> <i>Azure a Bend Or</i>. When Scrope brought an action, Grosvenor maintained that his ancestor had come to England with <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a> bearing these arms and that the family had borne them since. The case was brought before a military court and presided over by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constable.html" title="Constable">constable</a> of England. Several hundred witnesses were heard and these included Jean de Gand, King of Castile and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Lancaster_ba42.html" title="Duke of Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Chaucer_fbe6.html" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>. It was not until 1389 that the case was finally decided in Scrope’s favor. Grosvenor was allowed to continue bearing the arms within a bordure argent for difference. Neither party was happy with the decision, so when King Richard II gave his personal verdict on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../1/3/9/1390.html" title="1390">1390</a> he confirmed declared that Grosvenor could not bear the differenced arms. His opinion was that these two shields were too similar for unrelated families in the same country to bear.</p>

<p>According to many of the witnesses, there was a third person who bore the arms <i>Azure a Bend Or</i>. During an expedition to France in 1360, Grosvenor challenged the right of Thomas Carminow of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> to bear the arms. It is unclear what the outcome of this case was, but both parties continued to use the arms undifferenced. On a separate occasion, Carminow challenged the right of Scrope to bear the arms. In this case, the constable declared that both claimants had established their right to the arms. Carminow had proven that his family had borne the arms from the time of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Arthur_40ce.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a>, while the Scrope family had only used the arms from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Conquest_6c94.html" title="Norman Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> of England.</p>
<p>Since the judgement of 1390, both the Carminow and Scrope families have used the arms undifferenced. Grosvenor had to choose a new shield, though. He assumed arms of <i>Azure a Gard Or</i> and these arms are still used by the family's descendant, the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Westminster_24df.html" title="Duke of Westminster">Duke of Westminster</a>.</p>

<p>Fordham Brewing is a brewery based in Annapolis, MD. It was established in 1703 by Benjamin Fordham, under the orders of Queen Anne of England. This makes it one of the oldest breweries in the United States. On June 11th, 1995 the brewery began brewing beer at the Ram's Head Tavern in Annapolis. Due to increasing demand for its products, the brewery has added another brewing operation in Alexandria, VA. Further growth has led Fordham to a permanent 15,000 sqf brewing location in Dover, DE.</p>

<p>Andy Yorke is the younger brother of famously known <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiohead.html" title="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>, front man <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thom_Yorke_3edf.html" title="Thom Yorke">Thom Yorke</a>. He formed the band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbelievable_Truth" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbelievable_Truth" rel="nofollow">Unbelievable Truth</a> in 1994.</p>
<p>Unbelieavable truth was a three piece band from Oxford, with Yorke as the leading man on guitars and vocals, Nigel Powell on drums and piano and Jason Moulster on guitar and backing vocals. The band signed a record deal with Virgin and released their debut album "Almost gone" in 1997. The album recieved positive reviews by musical press and eventually topped the UK chart at N°40. Yet, the band could not reach commercial success due to lack of support from Virgin records. In 2000, they released their second album "Sorry Thankyou" on Shifty Disco, an oxford independant label which lunched the band at the beginning of their carreer. The album recieved average critics but failed to reach commercial grounds. In 2001, Andy Yorke left the band to persue other interests and went to russia to work with GreenPeace. The band split up 2001 and released a double live album later in the year.</p>
<p>Andy Yorke returned to Oxford a few years later and On the 19th of February 2005,in Zodiac, Oxford, Unbelievable Truth reunited for a single show as a tribute to asian tsunami that had hit India and Thailand in Late 2004. The band played a set of 8 songs yet there is no confirmation of a reformation of the band.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andy Yorke has lunched his official site <a href="http://www.andyyorke.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.andyyorke.com/" rel="nofollow">Andy Yorke official site</a> and is currently working on a solo album.</p>

The Demon Hunter forums is an underground Wiccan stronghold and common worship place that is maintained by a council of Wiccan lords (identified as DismalDemise, Hitokiri, xonetruedesirex, Zhou Tai 04, and Negativity Crusher) and one mysterious supreme-lord who is only known as "admin". The members of Demon Hunter are largely absent from these forums although they have several alter-egos that frequent the forums especially for the monthly ceremonial rituals. Dating back at least four years, these forums provide an interface for the followers of Demon Hunter and the Wiccan religion to converse, share views, discuss extreme dark music, and devise new morbid rituals.</p>

<p>Since these forums have existed for several years, there is a tight-knit community. Existing members have free access to the forums whenever the hideout is discovered and promply destroyed by Christian hackers, but lately the council has ammended the charter to include initiation rites to ensure that only the most devout and hardcore Wiccans and/or Satanists are accepted. Initiates are required to repeat the mantra "Demon Hunter is Wicca" several times over and over until the council has deemed him or her worthy. However, the supreme-lord "admin" alone possesses the ability to secretely murder and cover-up members who either defect or break the Demon Hunter oath.</p>

<p><b>admin -</b> A Luciferian arch-mage who has existed since the times of the crusades. After war, he made his living writing short yet very blasphemous fiddle songs. In the year 2002 AD, however, he converted to Wicca due to a lack of interest in Luciferian fiddle music.</p>
<p><b>DismalDemise -</b> A veteran necromancer who is actually the result of a cloning experiment performed on the admin during a brief time when he was cryogenically frozen by Ronald Reagan in the late 1980's. A defect in the admin's fiddle muisc gene gifted DismalDemise with an extensive and rabid love of nearly every form of music imaginable. He has also written several dark poems that are said to turn people into ash.</p>
<p><b>Zhou Tai 04 -</b> A Viking demi-god who also shares DismalDemise's love of music, although on a much shorter scale. Extreme tribal music and druidic fire dances are some of Zhou Tai 04's favorite things to listen to. His knack for burning and pillaging earned him a spot on Demon Hunter's elite council.</p>
<p><b>Hitokiri -</b> A Japanese occultist who also has a soft-spot for cute animals. He has several pet goats as well as an entire gallery of blasphemous Asian comic books.</p>
<p><b>xonetruedesirex -</b> An American alchemist who is also heavily involved in the hardcore death metal scene. Said to have an unescapable and fiery temper, his judgment is also known to strike deep into his victims' heart. Entire threads have been wiped-off the earth as a result of his anger against those who don't agree with his very interesting form of Wicca, referred to simply as "hardcore". The hardcore followers are known to use scythes to carve the letter "x" onto their person and also add that letter to their code names.</p>
<p><b>Negativity Crusher -</b> Not much is known about this Earth golem from Belgium except that he is the one of the Druidic percussionists that Zhou Tai 04 supports.</p>
<p><b>AugustWinterman -</b> A snow wizard from Alabama, AugustWinterman is said to be one of the most intelligent snow wizards in existance. He is also the leader of a Wiccan sect that oftentimes butts-heads with the hardcore sect.</p>
<p><b>OFlightXandSHADE -</b> Co-overlord of the hardcore sect, he also has a fascination with Hindu lute music. Being an accomplished lute player himself, he has hundreds of musical performance groups such as "The Rescue!", "Take a Hike!", "Rise Up!", "As If!", "Whatever!", "Shut Up!", "Go Suck a Lemon!", and "xBlondeCorex".</p>
<p><b>Unskathed -</b> The bassist of a renowned ritualistic chamber music group, Unskathed is quite knowledgible in the field of human heavy metal music. He is also in the process of training an apprentice (code-name SHIV) in order to dominate their native Hungary and spread their violent music across the world.</p>
<p><b>angel_without_wings -</b> The most veteran of the common mages on the forums, it is unknown as to why he has not been promoted to the council yet. He spends his days in an asylum and constantly schemes of new ways to take over the Christian music scene.</p>
<p><b>Bleeding Love -</b> A Transylvanian car-salesman who has a knack for writing nightmare-inducing short stories and chants. He is also a stark supporter of fellow Wiccan band As I Lay Dying.</p>
<p><b>Sombre Romantic -</b> A German mortician who relishes in gothic art as well as Satanic opera and Satanic experimental theater. Rumored to have over 666 wives and 666 offspring.</p>
<p><b>Angel of Metal -</b> A violinist and organ player in a musical group dedicated to artistic funeral music, this Icelandic impressionist and still-life painter listens to over 183,000 artists in an attempt to destroy his musical competition. He is also somehow married to Spanish gothic-movie actress.</p>
<p><b>puppetrevolt -</b> A Portugese travelling salesmen who specializes in derrogatory poety and cartoons that satire Mesopotamian religions. Another veteran member of the Demon Hunter forums who is rumored to have deadly good-looks.</p>
<p><b>demonslayer -</b> A Swiss yodeler who is also a devout follower of Sombre Romantic. After meating Sombre Romantic, demonslayer changed his yodelling to gothic yodelling and painted his outfit and horn black.</p>
<p><b>bluelightspecial -</b> An electric violin virtuoso whose scream can cause people to implode.</p>
<p><b>billyneverdies -</b> A shape-shifter and violent schizophrenic, some say that billyneverdies is invincible as he has been witnessed recovering from two separate deaths. His pasttimes include grilling ignorant christian "nubs", terrifying bible-thumpers wtith his dashing wit, and other shady activites. Arch enemies include xonetruedesirex, kendall, (as well as his evil whoress assasin, brightjen), and any DH fanboy "nub" that walks the face of the forum. He has recently attracted the following of a young Wiccan apprentice name Jedo</p>
<p><b>i_am legion -</b> a truly demonic entity whose roots are centered deep in wicca, legion is known to have the wit and intelligence of, well, a legion of demons! he is said to have defeated nearly every member of the forums in mortal combat, except for his seductive yet venomous apprentice, morbid overdose.</p>
<p><b>LibertyMetalHead -</b> perhaps the most influential wiccan freedom fighter in memory, liberty metalhead is said to have been raped by satan himself as a child, filling him with bitterness and seethed rage of all flavors. these often came to a head in arguements with christian interlopers, in which liberty fought and won many a battle. however, his divine hatred was eventually his downfall. when he began firing on fellow wiccans, libertymetal head was silently assasinated by the archmage admin, despite many protests among the high council. The Slaughter of LMH by the Coward Admin, as it is known to this day, is said to have divided the demon hunter boards and its wiccans in half: those who mourn his valiant presence, and those who were glad to have seen him die--a group that is mostly composed of the wretched christians he defeated. LMH has been reportedly reincarnated in another forum--an unidentified outpost supposedly run by lord Hitokiri, although he denied such treason.</p>
<p><b>bleeding_ophelia -</b> a young witch whose hair color knows no constant, ophelia has been reportedly courted by wiccan death metal freak, made4eternity. cunning and beautiful, ophelia's alligences within the dark council are quite enigmic.</p>

<p>Monkeyface is a slang term for a sexual technique focused on degradation of the victim (see Donkeypunch). The technique is usually performed by a male on a female, and as such has strong misogynist overtones. Like other terms of its kind, the main function of the term is to get shock value and humor through describing the technique to others.</p>
<p>Procedure The technique involves the man first completely shaving his pubic hair and placing it all where it can be easily reached, e.g. a bedside table. The man then has his woman perform fellatio on him to completion. As the man ejaculates, he attempts to coat the woman's face with his semen. Upon finishing, the man then grabs all of his loose pubic hair, throws it so that it sticks to the woman's face, and then points and yells, "Monkeyface!"</p>
<p><br />
This technique is also refered to as the Abraham Lincoln because of the resulting beard. In some variations, the man does not cut his pubic hair first, but instead rips out a fistful at orgasm. Often, the man may rip out his partner's pubic hair instead.</p>

<p>History: Phoenix, AZ ---Maricopa County started a free library system the day after the stock market crash in 1929. The County Library had a part in helping start, or establish, almost every public library system in the County.</p>
<p>The enormous population increases in the 1960s and 1970s led the County Library System to undergo reorganization to meet the demands of the residents. In 1986 the State Legislature passed a bill allowing Arizona counties to establish library districts. In 1987 the County Board of Supervisors voted to form the Maricopa County Library District (separate governmental and tax entities). The County Supervisors serve as the District’s Board of Library Directors.</p>
<p>Maricopa County is one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. The Library District serves unincorporated areas plus it partners with cities/towns and even school districts to run their libraries. The District has averaged opening two new libraries a year since 1999—either new libraries or larger buildings for existing libraries! It now operates 14 libraries with more on the way. Its libraries are located in Aguila, Anthem, Avondale, El Mirage, Fountain Hills, Gila Bend, Gilbert, Guadalupe, Litchfield Park, Phoenix (George L. Campbell Branch), Queen Creek, Sun Lakes, and two in Surprise. The District also runs Bookmobile and Books-By-Mail Services.</p>
<p>An emphasis on a popular materials collection along with the marketing slogan, Your Unexpected Oasis, echoes the District’s spirit of giving customers what they want. Multiple copies of best-sellers are prominently displayed on bookstore-like shelves near library entrances and a large collection of DVDs is extremely popular with library customers. 24x7 ASK! ---is another way the District enhances customer service---one can get an answer to a question from a librarian, anytime day or night seven days a week, with this online chat service.</p>
<p>The District has been a leader in the library world in using technology to enhance the provision of quality services, to keep pace with the rapid growth it is experiencing, and to continue to keep pace with its evolving role as an information provider in one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. Technology has enhanced customer service with self-service such as “SmartCard” library cards with a chip imbedded so that customers can reserve computers, pay for printing and save favorite Web sites.</p>
<p>Check it out…with SelfCheck machines and check it in with the SmartCheck Automatic Book Return System…gets books back on the shelves in fours hours instead of the several days it used to take. The faster items get back on the shelves, the faster they’re available for others. The Library District was actually the first library in the United States to try this new technology and it was the beta test site for the 3M system.</p>
<p>The Library District receives national awards for it innovative programs and technology. It’s a pioneer in creating outstanding children’s programs that go beyond what a library generally offers. Its award-winning Original Online Serial Novels for Kids project is available online for any library, school, child reader or parent to access and enjoy.</p>
<p>The District’s latest project was to turn the book Tomás and the Library Lady by Pat Mora into a World Premiere stage play adapted and performed by a professional children’s theater company that toured schools and reached over 70,000 children—First Lady Laura Bush saw the play on invitation from the District. The theater company will tour it nationally in 2007.</p>

<p>Unusual for Southwest Florida, Point of Rocks is a shallow formation of limestone rock that extends into the Gulf of Mexico from mid Siesta Key. This very distinctive site is habitat to a wide variety of fish and is, perhaps, the only good snorkeling beach on the west coast of Florida.</p>
<p>For centuries, Point of Rocks has been a mariners' landmark and legend has it as a burial place for treasures plundered by pirates.</p>

Unusual for Southwest Florida, Point of Rocks is a shallow formation of limestone rock that extends into the Gulf of Mexico from mid Siesta Key. This very distinctive site is habitat to a wide variety of fish and is, perhaps, the only good snorkeling beach on the west coast of Florida.</p>
<p>For centuries, Point of Rocks has been a mariners' landmark and legend has it as a burial place for treasures plundered by pirates.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-31_6d2d.html" title="Edit section: Jesse (The Prize Fighter Inferno)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jesse (The Prize Fighter Inferno)</span></h2>
<p>Jesse is the third IRO-Bot to be created by Dr. Leonard Hohenberger in the epic story <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amory_Wars_a2f5.html" title="The Amory Wars">The Amory Wars</a> by the band <a href="../../../c/o/h/Coheed_and_Cambria_5b54.html" title="Coheed and Cambria">Coheed and Cambria</a>.</p>
<p>Jesse is an enhanced clone of Hohenberger. He is often portrayed as muscular, dark-haired, and bearded. Jesse may also possess <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrokinesis.html" title="Pyrokinesis">Pyrokinesis</a> or some self-resurrecting ability, hence the code-name Inferno. He is a more than able combatant, and boxes as a hobby, hence the nickname Prize Fighter. He also possesses Hohenberger's intellect, having enough genius to create IRO-Bots of his own.</p>
<p>In the Amory Wars, out of Coheed, Cambria, and Jesse, he is the only one left with his memories upon the KBI's destruction on orders of Wilhem Ryan. While speculation, it is commonly believed that the Monstar virus implanted in Coheed (which, according to Ryan's right-hand man Mayo Detinwolf, has the ability to decimate the universe) was part of Hohenberger's plan to end Ryan's reign.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Second_Stage_Turbine_Blade_%28comic%29_6348.html" title="The Second Stage Turbine Blade (comic)">The Second Stage Turbine Blade (comic)</a> opens with a mysterious scene involving Jesse, one of his men, and two IRO-Bots. He is incinerating one of the IRO-Bots named Longicinda for malfunctioning. Jesse plays no other part in events of The Second Stage Turbine Blade, and his part in <a href="../../../3/_/_/In_Keeping_Secrets_of_Silent_Earth%7E_3_ecca.html" title="In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3">In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</a> can only be speculated as only the album has been released. It is common belief that the title track is about a battle Jesse is leading, and that he is involved in the events of Cuts Marked in the March of Men, Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow), and Blood Red Summer as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/r/o/Good_Apollo_I%27m_Burning_Star_IV_Volume_One%7E_From_Fear_Through_the_Eyes_of_Madness_%28graphic_novel%29_25fd.html" title="Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness (graphic novel)">Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness (graphic novel)</a> features Inferno prominently. At this point in the story, the protagonist, Claudio Kilgannon, Jesse's 'nephew', is on board his ship; the Grail Arbor. Jesse has attempted to explain to Claudio that his restless dreams are from souls trapped inside the Keywork (the energy source for their solar system), and the only way to release them is for Claudio to take up his mantle as the Crowing and destroy the Keywork, effectively ending Ryan's reign and the rebellion Jesse has been leading against him.</p>
<p>Jesse's plan is to penetrate the defenses of Ryan's homeworld of Apity Prime in the Omega System and land in the city of Kaline next to Ryan's stronghold, House Atlantic. Some of Jesse's men are already on the planet and this sleeper cell is in place to destroy a shield generator, giving the Grail Arbor a chance to enter. The weakness Jesse plans on exploiting may or may not be a trap, but the crew presses on. Upon success, Detinwolf's plan springs into action. An Onstantine Priest, a ghoulish Mage twisted to serve Ryan, eviscerates the entire strike team. Jackhammers, massive laser cannons, pummel the Grail Arbor as it attempts to land. Jesse, Claudio, Claudio's companion Ambellina, and Chase &amp; Jesse's other IRO-Bots all land on the planet safely. Jesse explains what Claudio must do, and tells Claudio his parents would be as proud of him as he is. Claudio and Ambellina split off, and Jesse and the others remain to confront Mayo. Jesse addresses his IRO-Bot 'children', telling them:</p>
<p><i>“Chase, you asked me once long ago, why I incinerated Longcindia. It was for this day. There is no room for mistakes me children. For as I have been told…Today is the day I die. I’m sorry I never played the part as your father, as I should of, and from the looks on your faces…It seems that’s all you’ve ever asked of me. It’s time for you to go into these worlds alone…With all my love. I love you. I love you so very much.”</i></p>
<p>At this point, the IRO-Bots all 'become what they were meant to be': they mutate into colossal beast, and start assaulting the soldiers. In all of this chaos, Mayo and Jesse are left to themselves, and make eye contact. Both legendary soldiers charge at each other. Jesse attempts to assault Detinwolf with a large stick, but Mayo manages to keep Inferno at bay. They struggle, but briefly. Jesse falls to the ground, and Detinwolf stands over him holding his heart in his hand. Thus Jesse, the last of the KBI, is killed.</p>
<p>Jesse may or may not have survived, however.

<p>A Chaotropic agent is an agent which causes molecular structure to be disrupted; in particular, those formed by nonbonding forces such as hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals interactions, and the hydrophobic effect. Often structural features, as detected by means such as circular dichroism can be titrated in a chaotrope concentration-dependent fashion.</p>
<p>The most commonly used chaotropes are 6~8M urea and 6M guanidinium chloride, with urea being an uncharged molecule and guanidinium chloride being a hydrochloride salt.</p>
<p>High generic salts can have chaotropic properties, by shielding charges and preventing the stabilization of salt bridges. Hydrogen bonding is stronger in nonpolar media, so salts, which increase the dipole moment of the solvent, can also destabilize hydrogen bonding</p>

<p>The Game Review (also known as 'TGR') was an underground text e-zine published between 1995-1999. The text based game review was created by 'Ionizer' as originally part of WWN (Weekly Warez Newsletter). After approximately 4-5 issues in WWN, TGR took on its own following and became a separate e-zine.</p>
<p>The review magazine took the format of reviewing games in a manner that was to the point and let readers know if a game was worthy of playing. Short paragraph reviews, usually no longer than 3-4 sentences and a rating based out of a total score of 100 were published.</p>
<p>The review was published weekly, but as time went on became less frequent. TGR's claim to fame was being the longest running game review magazine in the early development of the internet. With over 60 issues originally distributed via IRC, the popularity forced Ionizer to eventually create a simplistic website to help distribute. Eventually text parodies to songs were posted in conjunction with the review as a bonus for readers. The magazine took pride in not only telling gamers whether a game was worth playing in a few short sentences, but also entertaining them in the process.</p>
<p>Originally the reviews were based solely on DOS games which were the majority of games. As time went on, Win95 based games became more prevalent. As Ionizer refused to install Win95 at the time, he recruited 'path0s' to assist in reviewing the Win95 based games, while Ionizer reviewed the DOS/Win 3.1 games.</p>

<p>There are NO sources for this as I have just discovered it. If you search Google.com for "maxleng" several profiles will come up...only a couple still have the script and they will force you to a login page.

<p><b>Shadow Kune Do</b> ("The Way of the Unseen Fist") is a martial art concept created by Evan Salas. Evan Salas started the martial arts when he was 5 years old in his hometown of St.Charles, Illionis. He start learing Tae Kwon Do and Karate. When he turned 9 he moved to Weston, Florida and enrolled into a Kung-Fu school where he learned the 5 animal styles of Kung-Fu (White Crane, Tiger Claw, Eagle Claw, Monkey, and Praying Manthis Kung-Fu). He also learned Jeet Kune Do, Ninjistu, and Zui Ba Xian Quan (8 Spirit Drunken Fist). Soon after he left the school at the age of 14 he enrolled into a Muay-Thai school. From there he learned Brazilian Jujistu, Muay-Thai, Sambo, Krav Maga, and more of Jeet Kune Do. Evan soon fell in love with Bruce Lee's concept of the martial arts Jeet Kune Do. After he left the Muay-Thai school at the age of 18 he bagan self training himself in the martial arts. After many years of learning many different martial arts be began to create his own concept just like his martial art idle, Bruce Lee. Evan has been working on his own concept since he was 16 years old. He only teaches himself, but he hopes to teach someone some day.</p>

<p>Shadow Kune Do is the combination of the martial arts of Jeet Kune Do (as the name states "Kune Do"), Zui Ba Xian Quan, Muay-Thai, Krav Maga, and Western Boxing. Evan follows the way of Jeet Kune Do in every way and adds the teachings of Zui Ba Xian Quan, Muay-Thai, Krav Maga, and Boxing to Shadow Kune Do. Evan believes in a well-balanced sytem of fighting. When training he focuses more on speed and agility. He knows with his size (120 pounds), he would not be a bulky musclear fighter. The name describes "The Way of the Unseen Fist" has a statment of raw speed. Hitting so fast that the opponent(s) cannot see him like a shadow moving all around them. Shadow Kune Do is not only a broken rythme, but also unbalance is balance. This comes from Zui Ba Xian Quan and Jeet Kune Do.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-31_6d2d.html" title="Edit section: Principles of Shadow Kune Do">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Principles of Shadow Kune Do</span></h3>
<p>The following are principles that Salas incorporated into Shadow Kune Do just like Bruce Lee with Jeet Kune Do. He felt these were universal combat truths that were self evident and would lead to combat success if followed. The "4 Combat Ranges" in particular are what he felt were instrumental in becoming a "total" martial artist. This is also the principle most related to mixed martial arts. JKD practitioners also subscribe to the notion that the best defense is a strong offense, hence the principal of "Intercpeting". Lee believed that in order for an opponent to attack someone they had to move towards them. This provided an opportunity to "intercept" that attack or movement. The principal of interception covers more than just intercepting physical attacks. Lee believed that many non-verbals and telegraphs (subtle movements that an opponent is unaware of) could be percieved or "intercepted" and thus be used to one's advantage. The "5 Ways of Attack" are attacking categories that help Jeet Kune Do practitioners organize their fighting repertoire and comprise the offensive portion of JKD. The concepts of Stop hits &amp; stop kicks and simultaneous parrying &amp; punching were borrowed from western Fencing and comprise the defensive portion of JKD. These concepts were modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Lee. These concepts also compliment the other principal of interception.</p>
<p>I. Be like water</p>
<p>Lee believed that martial systems should be as flexible as possible. He often used water as an analogy for describing why flexibility is a desired trait in martial arts. Water is infinitely flexible. It can be seen through, and yet at other times it can obscure things from sight. It can split and go around things, rejoining on the other side, or it can crash through things. It can erode the hardest rocks by gently lapping away at them or it can go pass the tiniest pebble. Lee believed that a martial system should have these attributes. JKD students reject traditional systems of training, fighting styles and the Confucian pedagogy used in traditional kung fu schools because of this lack of flexibility. JKD is claimed to be a dynamic concept that is forever changing, thus being extremely flexible. "Absorb what is useful; Disregard that which is useless" is an often quoted Bruce Lee maxim. JKD students are encouraged to study every form of combat possible. This is believed to expand one's knowledge of other fighting systems; to both add to one's arsenal as well as to know how to defend against such tactics.</p>
<p>II. Economy of motion</p>
<p>JKD students are told to waste no time or movement. When it comes to combat JKD practitioners believe the simplest things work best.</p>
<p>A. Stop hits &amp; stop kicks</p>
<p>This means intercepting an opponent's attack with an attack of your own instead of a simple block. JKD practitioners believe that this is the most difficult defensive skill to develop. This strategy can be a feature of some traditional Chinese martial arts.</p>
<p>B. Simultaneous parrying &amp; punching</p>
<p>When confronting an incoming attack; the attack is parried or deflected and a counter attack is delivered at the same time. Not as advanced as a stop hit but more effective than blocking and counter attacking in sequence. This is also practiced by some Chinese martial arts.</p>
<p>C. No high kicks</p>
<p>JKD practitioners believe they should target their kicks to their opponent's shins, knees, thighs, and mid section. These targets are the closest to the foot, provide more stability and are more difficult to defend against. However, as with all other JKD principles nothing is "written in stone". If a target of opportunity presents itself; even a target above the waist one could take advantage of the situation without feeling hampered by this principle.</p>
<p>III. Learn the 4 ranges of combat</p>
<p>Kicking Punching Trapping Grappling Jeet Kune Do students train in each of these ranges equally. According to Lee, this range of training serves to differentiate JKD from other martial arts. Lee stated that most but not all traditional martial systems specialize in training at one or two ranges. Bruce Lee's theories have been especially influential and substantiated in the field of Mixed Martial Arts, as the MMA Phases of Combat are essentially the same concept as the JKD combat ranges.</p>
<p>IV. Five Ways Of Attack</p>
<p>A. Single Angular Attack (SAA) and its converse Single Direct Attack (SDA).</p>
<p>B. Hand Immobilization Attack (HIA) and its counterpart Foot Immobilization attack, which make use of “trapping” to limit the opponent to function with that appendage.</p>
<p>C. Progressive Indirect Attack (PIA). Attacking one part of the opponent's body followed by attacking another part as a means of creating an opening.</p>
<p>D. Attack By Combinations (ABC). This is using multiple rapid attacks as a means of using volume of attack to overcoming the opponent.</p>
<p>E. Attack By Drawing (ABD). This is creating an opening with positioning as a means of counter attacking.</p>
<p>V. Three Parts of JKD</p>
<p>Jeet Kune Do practitioners believe that techniques should contain the following properties:</p>
<p>Efficiency - An attack that reaches its mark Directness - Doing what comes naturally in a learned way. Simplicity - Thinking in an uncomplicated manner; without ornamentation</p>
<p>Salas believes in these principles and follows them as Bruce Lee saw fit.</p>

The big break came at his final school year review where he portreyed his idol (Richard "the voice" Mercer)which met with wide spread acclaim and even saw his face don the front cover of Radio Afficianardo.</p>
