<li>Because you simply formerly did not know of Druvianism, does that automatically constitute its necessity for deletion? Is not that the purpose of an encyclopedia? To educate, to spread knowledge to other people around the world. I could not think of a better venue for knowledge than an online encyclopedia that can be edited by every single person around the world. I think Druvianism is exactly the thing wikipedia was created to serve. To be a highway for knowledge, to support it and spread it and make it available to everyone for not a single penny at their cost. For the sake of deleting an entire article, something that so much work and dedication has gone into, ask yourself this - "Is it really necessary?" The whole purpose of this discussion is to answer that very simple question. I agree whole-heartedly that wikipedia is not the place for random and nonsensical articles to spread about, that serve no purpose but diluting the already very diluted knowledge pool and draining it of its potency, however Druvianism is clearly not one of these cases. Take a moment and think about this, and do not respond out of passion but rather respond with logic and reason. -- <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewry_9e4f.html" title="User:Drewry">Drewry</a> 14:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>"Is it really necessary?"</i> Yes. Every week somebody has a new philosophy or movement or religion that basically nobody has ever heard of, and wants to use Wikipedia to let people know about it. Become notable first. Then get the article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not doubt that the above mentioned happens regularly and I understand your voice for concern. However this is not the case with Druvianism. Druvianism has about as many supporters as the extreme <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-nazism.html" title="Neo-nazism">radical movements</a>, however these articles are allowed to exist un-contested. My case is that simply because you may or may not have formerly heard of Druvianism, that alone is not enough to constitute the destruction of an entire article.

<ul>
<li>Everyone trying to promote their unknown project/movement/whatever believes, sincerely, that theirs is different. To try to compare yourself with a movement like neo-nazism, the link you posted, is ludicrous. They have tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of followers.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Even though the article is well written on its own terms (organized, clear, etc.) that isn't enough for it to merit being on an encyclopedia. It needs verifiability, neutral point of view and lack of originality. That last one might seem odd (why would we only want things that lack something good, like originality), but it's what an encyclopedia does, and it's what makes an encyclopedia different from periodicals, pamphlets and other media of communication. The author of this article wants a wider audience, and I support that. No one here, even those urging a delete, is denying the author the right to express his/her opinions. There are many sites on the Internet for precisely this kind of ORIGINAL research, but that's not what Wikipedia is about. I wish the author the best of success in spreading the ideas of Druvianism, and once it achieves sufficient coverage so that there are secondary (not primary) sources that can be used as citations, the author by all means should re-submit an article on this topic. Until then, I'd like to invite the author to participate in the many other aspects of Wikipedia that need dedicated editors. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:44, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I cannot say I fully agree with the above said, I do fully understand the reasoning behind it. In my effort on the movement's behalf, I will proceed to follow consensus. Druvianism as a movement will pursue new outlets for spreading the ideas stated in the movement, in order to gain credibility and notability. When if in the course of the following days this community finds that the article should be deleted, given that such was decided after fair and meaningful debate, no permanent damage would be taken to me personally - and I feel strongly that the same could be said to the supporters and leaders of this movement. Despite the statements of some, my intentions have always been focused on the advancement of the encyclopedia as a whole. If the decision of this discussion is in favour of deletion I would like to apologize having failed wikipedia as a community. The future of my editions to this community I hope will be prosperous, and I can only hope that no hard feelings have been made as a result of the decision of this article, or the creation of it herein. -- <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewry_9e4f.html" title="User:Drewry">Drewry</a> 16:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
