<p>Lucian moynihan's interest in his beard is second only to his interest in himself. Lucian prefers to eat whole live children for breakfast, so that he can see the fledgling intelligence dieing in their eyes, however he has been known to eat babies, if that is all he is able to rustle up. These practice's go unheeded or punished because as we like to say around here, it's just lucian, he's like that</p>

<p>== <b>Rev Brant Baker of Shekinah Fellowship</b></p>
<p><br />
Rev Brant Baker <a href="http://groups.msn.com/DesertMinistry/revbrantbaker.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=433" class="external text" title="http://groups.msn.com/DesertMinistry/revbrantbaker.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=433" rel="nofollow">Photo of Brant</a>of Shekinah Fellowship had a tremendous impact upon southern California through his <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical.html" title="Evangelical">evangelical</a> ministry. He was with Channel 40 (TBN) before it was established. In fact, one of the first specials that was produced on <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Broadcast_Network_1ed3.html" title="Trinity Broadcast Network">Trinity Broadcast Network</a> involved the Shekinah Fellowship.</p>
<p>Brant Baker was born March 12, 1948, in Santa Monica, California. He died November 26, 1985, in a Glendale hospital at 37 years old from complications of HIV.</p>
<p>In the late sixties, Brant owned a clothing store in Costa Mesa, California. At one point, he gave away all the clothing in the store to the “Jesus People” associated with nearby <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvary_Chapel_f14c.html" title="Calvary Chapel">Calvary Chapel</a>. A spiritual transition had somehow taken place and soon he felt compelled to start Bible studies.</p>
<p>In 1971, he attended a <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathryn_Kuhlman_12bd.html" title="Kathryn Kuhlman">Kathryn Kuhlman</a> youth rally. Kuhlman’s message moved him deeply and he attended every meeting he could at LA’s <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrine_Auditorium_9d12.html" title="Shrine Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a>. He was so moved that after those meetings, he would sit outside the auditorium and plead with God to anoint him with the gift of healing. He continued to speak to the Lord and one day, as Brant was praying for people, God started to heal them. As word spread that God was moving through Brant at the Shekinah Fellowship, people from all walks of life began to come forth. <a href="http://groups.msn.com/DesertMinistry/revbrantbaker.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=426" class="external text" title="http://groups.msn.com/DesertMinistry/revbrantbaker.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=426" rel="nofollow">Photo</a></p>
<p>As Brant continued to pattern his ministry after Kathryn Kuhlman’s, at one point he rented out the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Beach_Arena_90a7.html" title="Long Beach Arena">Long Beach Arena</a> . It was full of people who had come to see the miracles. Brant continued to rent auditoriums in order to share the gift of healing which God had given him.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Brant’s ministry began to touch the hearts of many Christians throughout the land. Even the Trinity Broadcast Network began to take note of his Shekinah ministry as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Crouch_5020.html" title="Paul Crouch">Paul Crouch</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Crouch_bd04.html" title="Jan Crouch">Jan Crouch</a> “courted” him to their program.

<p>Nick Petros is rarely given his due in history. His accomplishment are usually claimed by others and he is to modest to take credit. He is a music officionado who rivals according to himself, his music rivals the Beatles. He is incredibly strong, who strengths rivals any man. His vuisage is highly recognizable, with his unibrow, curly fro hair, and nonstop smile. He has knowledge in all areas and is not afraid to tell you.His typical events are building an engine from scratch even though he has no mechanical training. His knowledge of relationships can rival Dr. Ruths,and he has a libido to match. He will volunteer this "truly must needed advice" to all even if the subject is not being talked about. Women find him irrestiable, it must be his bass skill which rival all. His playing was said to sound like God crying. If you are fortunate enough to meet him he will never let you forget that you are in the presence of greatness.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-15_9c49.html" title="Edit section: Beachrock">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beachrock</span></h2>
<p>The rapid cementation of beach sediments in the intertidal zone leads to the formation of characteristic synsedimentary lithified structures termed as beachrocks. Beachrock units form under a thin cover of sediment and generally overlie unconsolidated sand. They typically consist of multiple units, representing multiple episodes of cementation and exposure. The mineralogy of beachrocks is mainly high-magnesium calcite or aragonite. The main processes involved in the cementation are : supersaturation with CaCO3 through direct evaporation of seawater (Scoffin, 1970), groundwater CO2 degassing in the vadose zone (Hanor, 1978), mixing of marine and meteoric water fluxes (Schmalz, 1971) and precipitation of micritic calcium carbonate as a byproduct of microbiological activity (Neumeier, 1999). On retreating coasts, outcrops of beachrock may be evident offshore where they may act as a barrier against coastal erosion. Beachrock presence can also induce sediment deficiency in a beach and out-synch its wave regime. Because beachrock is lithified within the intertidal zone and because it commonly forms in a few years, its potential as an indicator of past sea level is important.</p>
<p><br />
Cementation and position of beachrock</p>
<p>Beachrocks are located along the coastline in a parallel term and they are usually a few meters offshore. They are generally separated in several levels which may correspond to different generations of beachrock cementation. Thus, the older zones are located in the outer part of the formation when the younger ones are on the side of the beach, possibly under the unconsolidated sand. They also seem to have a general inclination to the sea (50 – 150). There are several appearances of beachrock formations which are characterized by multiple cracks and gasps. The result from this fact is an interruptible formation of separated blocks of beachrock, which may be of the same formation. The length of beachrocks varies from meters to kilometers, its width can reach up to 300 meters and its height starts from 30 cm and reaches 3 meters.</p>

<p>Following the process of coastal erosion, beachrock formation may be uncovered. Coastal erosion may be the result of sea level rise or deficit in sedimentary equilibrium. One way or another, unconsolidated sand that covers the beachrock draws away and the formation is revealed. If the process of cementation continues, new beachrock would be formed in a new position in the intertidal zone. Successive phases of sea level change may result in sequential zones of beachrock.</p>

<p>Barcode Battler refers to a series of games released from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and related products, based around barcodes.</p>
<p>The main products were the hand held games - Barcode Battler and Barcode Battler II - released as Barcode Battler outside of Japan.</p>
<p>The Barcode Battler series included:</p>
<pre>
Barcode Battler
Barcode Battler II (Barcode Battler)
Barcode World
Barcode Battler Senki - Coveni Wars
BBII Interface
Legend of Zelda Barcode Battler II Cards
Noodle Barcode Battler Cards
Barcode Fighter Comic
Barcode Battler Barcode Books
</pre>
<p>Barcode Battler This hand held games console was released in the late 1980s or early 1990s, and such was its popularity that it had a sequel: Barcode Battler II</p>
<p>Barcode Battler II Released as Barcode Battler outside of Japan, this console was very similar to the original Barcode Battler, except that it included extra play modes and linked to the Famicom and Super Famicom.</p>
<p>Barcode World A Famicom game based around Barcode Battler, it involved a very similar combat method to the hand held games. The box included a cable to link the Barcode Battler to the Famicom to scan barcodes in.</p>
<p>Barcode Battler Senki Coveni Ward A Super Famicom game based around Barcode Battler, it required the BBII Interface to connect to the second Super Faicom controller port to allow barcodes to be scanned in. The game's combat included a hexagonal based map to move characters around and fight with, with the actual combat engine being still very similar to the original Barcode Battler hand held consoles.</p>
<p>BBII Interface A device that connected the Barcode Battler II to the second controller port of the Super Famicom. This appears to allow the scanning of barcodes for the game Barcode battler Senki Coveni Wars.</p>
<p>Legend of Zelda Barcode Battler II Cards These cards were sold as a pack with various monsters and items from the Super Famicom game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. It also included Link and Link(Magic) as a warrior and wizard respectively.</p>
<p>Noodle Barcode Battler Cards Bell Foods Ltd., a subsidiary of Kanebo Ltd., a leading cosmetics company, used the games to help launch their instant noodles. Each pack of noodles came with a set of cards that could be used in barcode games. Meanwhile Myojo Foods gave away a custom-made battler to a lucky 3,000 who bought their noodles. "We reckon this upped our sales by 10%," said a Myojo spokesman.</p>
<p>Barcode Fighter Comic This Manga, comic book, ended in 2004, after controvtial issues were raised, and its popularity failed.</p>
<p>Barcode Battler Barcode Books In Japan books were reportedly released listing which products had good barcodes.</p>

<p>Tenzin Tsundue is a restless young Tibetan, who after graduating from Madras, South India, braved snowstorms and treacherous mountains, broke all rules and restrictions, crossed the Himalayas on foot and went into forbidden Tibet! The purpose? To see the situation under Chinese occupation for himself and find out if he could lend a hand or two in the freedom struggle. He was arrested by the Chinese border police, and after cooling his feet in prison in Lhasa for three months, was finally pushed back to India.</p>
<p><br />
Born to a Tibetan refugee family who laboured on India's border roads around Manali, North India, during the chaotic era of Tibetan refugee resettlement in the early seventies. Tenzin Tsundue is a writer-activist, a rare blend in the Tibetan community in exile.</p>
<p><br />
He published a book of poems 'Crossing The Border' with the money begged and borrowed from his classmates while studying in Mumbai. His literary skills won him the first-ever 'Outlook-Picador Award for Non-Fiction' in 2001. In this all-India essay contest Tsundue took first prize from 900 other entries. His writings have been published in International PEN, The Indian PEN, The Indian Literary Panorama, The Little Magazine, Outlook, The Times of India, The Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Better Photography, The Economic Times, Tehelka, Mid-Day (Mumbai), Afternoon (Mumbai), The Daily Star (Bangladesh), Today (Singapore), Tibetan Review, Tibetan Bulletin, Freedom First, Tibetan World, and Gandhi Marg. He represented Tibet in the Second South Asian Literary Conference in New Delhi in January 2005, which was organised by the premier Indian literary association, Sahitya Academy.</p>
<p>Tsundue joined Friends of Tibet (India) in 1999. Since then he's been working with the organisation as its general secretary. In January 2002 his profile peaked when he scaled scaffolding to the 14th floor of the Oberoi Towers in Mumbai to unfurl a Tibetan national flag and a banner which read "Free Tibet" down the hotel's facade. China's Premier Zhu Rongji was inside the hotel addressing a conference of Indian business tycoons. The world's media featured Tsundue's antics and Indian police officials reportedly congratulated him in prison for standing up for his rights. Recently, in April, he repeated a similar feat with a stunning protest that captured the imagination of the world. Single-handedly, he snatched the world media attention from the visiting Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jia Bao in the south Indian city, Bangalore.</p>

"Seeking Buddhahood is one thing, and freedom for a country is another. We are fighting for freedom in the world and not freedom from the world." Tenzin Tsundue</p>

<p>Also called Rule Of The Community, one of the most important documents produced by the Essene community of Jews, who settled at Qumran in the Judaean desert in the early 2nd century BC. They did so to remove themselves from what they considered a corrupt religion symbolized by the religiopolitical high priests of the Hasmonean dynasty centred in Jerusalem. The major portion of the scroll was discovered in Cave I at Qumran in 1947, and fragments of 11 other versions of the Manual were found in Caves IV and V the same year. Modern scholars have suggested that, when the Qumran sect was forced to abandon its community life because of the great Jewish revolt against Rome in AD 66–70, its members hid their library in nearby caves. The large number of preserved manuscripts indicate the importance of the Manual to the Essene community.</p>
<p>This scroll was probably intended for the Essene sect's leaders, including priests who supervised the sacrificial, liturgical, and possibly exegetical religious functions, and also guardians who controlled the admission and instruction of new members into the community. The document contains an explanation of the sect's religious and moral ideals, a description of its admission ceremony, a long catechetical discourse on its mystical doctrine of the primordial spirits of truth and perversity, organizational and disciplinary statutes, and a final hymn or psalm praising obedience and setting forth the sacred seasons. The first of two appendices, the Rule of the Congregation, or “Messianic Rule,” contains additional statutes and instructions about a messianic feast. The second is a liturgical collection of benedictions: Blessings.</p>
<p>Although this work cannot be dated with precision, it was probably compiled after the community had settled in Qumran. Some scholars have connected part of it to an enigmatic figure, the unknown Teacher of Righteousness, whose ministry within the community probably fell in the latter half of the 2nd century BC. See also Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>

<p>It's a river in Nunavut, above the arctic circle and tree line. On this river is wilberforce falls, the tallest waterfall above the arctic circle. A lot of people canoe down this spectacular river. Camps and tripping companies come to this river from around the continent like blackfeather or Hurontario. Lake trout are plentiful and almost a metre long. The upper lakes of the Hood can be frozen until July, and on the banks of the river, grizzlies, wolves, wolverines, and muskox are plentiful. The water is cold and crisp and there are glaciers along the river. The river leads into the Arctic ocean, ending at Arctic Sound in Nunavut. There are numerous rapids and waterfalls along this great river.</p>

<p>While Carey Hall was first over the line, he was stripped of all placings due to a positive drugs test. Gold was awarded to F. Colas of France. Stephen Pate was also stripped of his third place in the same championship for the very same reason, same drug in fact, stanizolol. Carey therefore has the dubious honour of being the only <b>winner</b> of the world sprint title to be stripped of the title for drug use.</p>

<p>Carlos Aruzza was a natural in bullfighting. One amazing story of this fine man is when he was young and was training at a bullfighting school. Their teacher was teaching them how to place banderilleros. The mechanical bull was sitting in place, and in the middle of the lecture, Aruzza ran up to the bull and perfectly placed the banderilleros! His teacher responded by saying: "That is how you place your banderilleros!"</p>

<p>Sturiosoma catfish are often grouped with the Rineloricaria and Farlowella genuses. Sturiosoma and Rieloricaria species are whiptail catfish, and can grow to a full size of 20cm to 25cm. The genus Farlowella is composed of the slightly smaller and more delecate twig catfish, which grow to a length of about 15cm. All three genuses are in the family Loricaridae, and have sucking mouths, complete with rasping mouth teeth on the roof and floor, which are used to stick onto rocks, plants, etc.</p>

Manuel Colom Argueta (b-, assasinated on March 22, 1979)
</pre>
<p>Manuel Colom Argueta popular former Mayor of Guatemala City and leader of the progressive political party, Frente Unido de la Revolucion (FUR) was machine gunned to death in broad daylight on March 22, 1979. Colom Argueta was assasinated just 2 days after the military government had officially recognized FUR as a legitimate party. Colom Argueta's popularity was widely seen as a direct challenge to right wing military forces that dominate the Guatemalan political landscape. His sister Luisa Colom de Herarte and his brother Guillermo Colom Argueta publicly declared that the "G-2", Police Intelligence Division had assasinated their brother. Prior to Manuel Colom Argueta's assasination a wave of killings by right wing death squad killings swept the country underscored by the assasination of Dr. Alberto Fuentes Mohr, leader of the progressive Social Democratic Party (PSD) on January 25, 1979 near the American Embassy.</p>

<p>A man who is at the top of a female's non-sexual ladder. (See the Ladder Theory). Also known as the "cuddle bunny", this male provides a strong friendship for the female, a man whom the female will call for advice, comments, venting, and feedback. Sometimes the male wishes he were on the sexual ladder, so he chooses to stay the intellectual whore in order to stay close to the female, with hopes that one day she will see him in a sexual way.</p>

<ul>
<li>The uncontested facts:*</li>
</ul>
<p>After leaving the Tyson fight on Saturday September 7, 1996 Tupac was allegedly shot 5 times. He lived through the shooting and was taken to a nearby hospital. He was pronounced dead on Friday September 13, 1996.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The suspicious facts:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Friday the 13th is a very suspicious day.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were never any pictures released of Tupac in the hospital. (Yes there is; however, the autopsy picture looks deceiving. The picture leaked on the Internet in '97)</p>
<p>In the song "Life Goes On", Tupac raps about his own funeral. (He firsts gets a call from his old homie in high school. "2Pac drinks a 5th of a Hennessey glass when he passed" Then he imagined his own funeral. Because life goes on)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket have a party at my funeral let every rapper rock it let tha hoes that I usta know from way before kiss me from my head to my toe give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin a couple bottles of Gin incase I don't get in tell all my people i'm a Ridah nobody cries when we die we outlaws</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the song "God Blessed the Dead, how is he able to predict the future when Biggie died after him?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls</li>
</ul>
<p>That's right boy, it's goin on Right here, Thug Life God bless the dead*</p>
<ul>
<li>God bless the dead buried nigga</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt a brew* Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game If you a baller, money went as quick as it came My role models gone or they locked in the pen Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie Sayin shit don't stop, nigga, no pity We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams Money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time</p>
<ul>
<li>My epitaph will read "Was the last of Gs*</li>
</ul>
<p>Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed</p>
<ul>
<li>Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early</li>
</ul>
<p>All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you Biggie*</p>
<p><br />
The driver of the car in which Tupac was riding, Suge Knight (the executive producer of Death Row Records), didn't show up for questioning about the shooting.</p>
<p>The video "I ain't Mad at Cha" was released only a few days after his death. "I ain't Mad at Cha" is track 13 on the album *All Eyes On Me*. The video shows Tupac as an angel in heaven. In the video, Tupac was shot after leaving a theater with a friend, which is very similar to how he was shot in real life. Interestingly, Tupac dies in his last video released under the name "Tupac". His new video "Toss It Up" from the new album was released under the name "Makaveli".</p>
<p>The second video to be released by the name Makaveli is "To Live and Die in L.A." But how could they shoot the second video when he is "dead". Do you really think the video was shot 4 months ago, back in August of '96? Think about it.</p>
<p><br />
In the video "Hail Mary" released under the name Makaveli, there is a gravestone that says Makaveli. But the gravestone is cracked and there is a hole right in front of it, inferring that Makaveli rose from the dead.</p>
<p>A shooting involving Snoop Doggy Dogg occurred close to the release of his album *Doggystyle*. The shooting made Snoop appear more "real" and showed his fans that he really was a gangsta. The shooting gave him respect because everyone that bought his album believed what he was talking about. Within one week of its release, *Doggystyle* went platinum. Snoop is signed to the same label as Tupac which is Death Row Records. In December '96, Tupac's new album went platinum.</p>
<p>In interviews prior to the shooting, Tupac talked about how he wanted to stop rapping and being a gangsta and get out of the limelight. What is the only way Tupac could completely escape the media spotlight? (Answer: if the public thought he was dead.)</p>
<p>There are no suspects for the shooting.</p>
<p>Press wasn't going to be allowed at the funeral, but then the funeral was cancelled for unknown reasons. (Probably because of family)</p>
<p>Tupac always wore a bulletproof vest, no matter where he went. Why didn't he wear it to a very public event like a Tyson fight? (Because he wanted to make it seem like he could be shot.)</p>
<p>In most of his songs he talks about being buried, so why was he allegedly cremated the day after he "died"? And since when do they cremate someone the day after death without an autopsy? Furthermore, it is illegal to bury someone who has been murdered without an autopsy.</p>
<p>The new Tupac album released on Nov. 5, and was originally supposed to be an EP of 6 songs, but was then extended to a full length album of 12 songs.</p>
<p>Tupac's alias is Makaveli. Though the spelling is different, Machiavelli was a 16th century italian philosopher who advocated the staging of one's death in order to evade one's enemies and gain power.</p>
<p>In Machiavelli's book *Discourses Upon the First Ten Books of Titus Livy*, in Book 2 Chapter XIII he says "a prince who wishes to achieve great things must learn to deceive". This is Machiavelli's main idea and is the connection between Tupac and the writings of Machiavelli. Tupac read Machiavelli.</p>
<p>The title of the new album by Makaveli (Tupac) is *The 7 Day Theory*. He was shot on September 7th; and survived on the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and"died" the 13th. Hence the title: *The 7 Day Theory*.</p>
<p>Tupac's album *All Eyes on Me* was released on Feb.13, 1996. Tupac "died" on Sept.13, 1996. It is quite a coincidence that the two dates are *exactly</p>
<ul>
<li>7 months apart.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tupac officially died at 4:03 PM. 4+3 = 7. Also he "died" at an age of 25 years. 2+5 = 7. It seems as if seven is Tupac's number.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the new album that says TUPAC RIP 1971-1996. Wouldn't it make sense to include something like that in the first album after his "death"? The only thing mentioned is "EXIT TUPAC ENTER MAKAVELI".</p>
<p>The executive producer of *The 7 Day Theory* , as listed in the CD booklet of the album, is Simon (who is a previously unknown producer in the rap music industry). In the bible, Simon was an apostle of Jesus. Simon was one of the first witnesses of the Resurrection listed by Saint Paul (I Cor. 15:5). Could Simon be a reference to Suge Knight (the executive producer of Death Row records)? Simon was renamed "Peter, the rock" (John 1:42).</p>
<p>In Richie Rich's album *Seasoned Veteran*, which was released on the same day as *The 7 Day Theory*, on the song "N*ggas Done Changed" which is a duet with Tupac, Tupac says the following lyrics: "I've been shot and murdered, can't tell you how it happened word for word / but best believe that n*ggas' gonna get what they deserve." This phrase implies that Tupac knows he will be dead when Richie Rich's album is released.</p>
<p>In Makaveli's (Tupac's) song "White Man's World" on album *The 7 Day Theory*, he says "We ain't never gonna walk off this planet unless ya'll choose to." Did he choose to walk off the planet by faking his death?</p>
<p>In Tupac's song "Ambitionz Az A Ridah" on the album *All Eyes On Me*, he says "Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers so now I'm back to be a muthaf*ckin' menace, they cowards thats why they tried to set me up, had b*tch *ss n*ggas on my team so indeed they wet me up, BUT I'M BACK REINCARNATED." This implies that Tupac is reincarnated as Makaveli. (The song was about Tupac getting shot 5 times)</p>
<p>In Tupac's song "Life of an Outlaw" on the album *The 7 Day Theory*, he says "All for the street fame on how to be managed, to plan sh*t, 6 months in advance to what we plotted, approved to go on swore and now I got it"-Life Of An Outlaw. This implies that Tupac planned his "death" in advance and now he is enjoying the success of his plan.</p>
<p>In Tupac's song "Made Niggaz" from the Supercop Soundtrack, he says "F*ck 'em all who don't understand my plot to get richer... Outlaw to the grave, a muthaf*ckin' made nigga I got a plan to get richer. Take my picture." Once again he mentions his "plan" to get rich.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In E-40's album *Hall of Game* in the song "Million Dollar Spot" which is a duet with Tupac, Tupac says, "Fans can't understand my ghetto slang, so I evade and plot and plan a life of better things...." Once again Tupac mentions his "plan".</p>
<p>In Tupac's song "Ain't Hard 2 Find" on the album *All Eyes On Me, *he says "I heard rumors I died, murdered in cold blood, traumatized pictures of me in my final states, you know momma cried, but that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted." It seems as if Tupac foretold the future.</p>
<p>Scarface's song "Smile", which is a duet with Tupac, was supposedly recorded in September of '96, before Tupac was "shot". But the video for the song was released in May of '97 and the video depicts Tupac rapping while he appears to be crucified. At the end of the video, Tupac falls off the cross and stands up...which is another image of resurrection. Towards the end of the video, it becomes slightly apparent that Tupac is actually portrayed by a look-alike. I still wonder if he is really dead, why do they keep making everyone so suspicious.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the video for "I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto" the town it takes place in is called Rukahs. "Rukahs" spelled backwards is "Shakur". The room he goes into with the girl is room number 7. The clock in the background at the end is at 4:03...the same time he officially died. More funny stuff from the video producers. My question still remains, why?</p>
<p>In Tupac's song "No More Pain" on the album *All Eyes On Me,* he says "A heart of a soldier with the brains to teach a whole nation." Could this be a reference to Machiavelli or Jesus?</p>
<p><br />
On the cover of *The 7 Day Theory*, there is a picture of Tupac being crucified. This fits with the idea that Tupac "died" so he could be reincarnated as Makaveli. In the picture, there are five bullet holes. Interestingly, Tupac was "shot" 7 times. He was shot 5 times earlier.</p>
<p>The only witness to the shooting, Yafeu Fula, was found shot to death on Nov. 10th in a hallway of an apartment building in East Orange, NJ. Hmm...now no one will get any info out of him. (for more info on his death, click here .)</p>
<p>After the shooting of Notorious B.I.G. on March 9th, 1997 Lieutenant Wayne Petersen of the the homicide division of the Las Vegas Police Department who has been investigating Shakur's alleged killing said, "Before yesterday, I had never even heard of the Notorious B.I.G. There is no link between the two murders. We think the only connection is in the minds of the media. The media wants to connect the two." If you asked anyone who knows anything about the Tupac case, they would say something about the rivalry between Biggie and Tupac. How will the Las Vegas police ever solve the case if they don't know the basics? The answer is that they won't. C'mon guys, that is pretty pathetic.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>According to my friend Roger as well as numerous other sources, in the first three seconds of *The 7 Day Theory*, the words "Suge shot me" are spoken very softly. Check it out for yourself, but that certainly is suspicious and it must mean something. Click here for the sample as it appears on the CD.</p>
<p>According to Neal , on the song "Thug Luv" which is a duet with Tupac on Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's double CD *Art Of War* after Tupac says "whuz poppin' n*gga", Bizzy Bone can be heard saying "He's Alive He's Alive He's Alive" in the background. Click here from the site Exit-2Pac-Enter-Makaveli. The rapper sounds like Tupac, at least to me. Check it out for yourself. (Blac has the 2Pac Flow, the 2Pac pace, the 2Pac curse, and the 2Pac breaths that sounds like this nigga been smokin. He's from the Florida Keys though. He sound old skol with the ol skol beatz. When he asks "Do You Know?" Reply "Yes, cuz he's 2Pac."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>How ya gonna die? When ya die, nigga I'mma die a hustla I'mma die makin money (repeat) I'mma die a hustla I'm smokin weed and sh*t My baby mama keep sayin she don't need this sh*t She said I ain't doin nothin for my Shorty I'm like "Whatever" As I'm sippin on the forty Uhh, Yeah I got my mind on the come up Cause I'm a G 36 ounces to a key I need to be, On the road with my niggaz from the hood Screamin "It's all good, It's all good, It's all good" I often wonder should I stay in the game Cause I got too many enemies takin aim I learned that niggaz that beef Be tryin to kill niggaz So if you see me hangin I'm hangin with real niggaz And I'll be bustin at b*tches and sh*t Tryin to get the ? out Swervin at my ride bout to wreck out Damn I can't complain cause that's the life I chose Nigga I'ma be a hustler til my casket close And everbody's tellin me "You movin too fast" The street life don't last Look at your homie's that past And even though deep inside I know they talkin true sh*t I still wanna do sh*t Nigga I'mma die a hustla [Chorus] Ain't got no time for f**kin with hoes They gotta wait Cause a nigga gotta get his money straight Cause niggaz be actin shady When it come to green Don't be f**kin with my money If you come then come clean You fools better wise up I'm like ? Cause I'ma to the nigga Ask questions later If I'ma die nigga I'm not dyin alone I'll be until my bullets gone And only real niggaz, can feel my pain I once thought I was crazy But now I know I'm insane Smokin out I'm the king of the base point Me and my niggaz rollin up a fat laced joint Tryin to survive I need paper to fold Every other day I'm violatin parole Am I going back to jail? I'll be damned if I will I ain't shootin to stop a nigga I'm shootin to kill I lived my whole entire life in the fast lane That's why I'm burned out Never thought the streets would have a niggaz soul turned out I'ma get me, no matter how I get it And tell the police that Blac Haze did it I'mma die a hustla (For real, yeah) [Chorus] Could it be the street life? Or am I really losin my mind? I get the trippin nigga with my nine When I low my sh*t you better stand clear And call the coroner cause there's a dead man here See, I be watchin the niggaz who wanna be large Or maybe bigger I catch a hot one and get to pullin on the trigger That's why I'm packin five When I'm packin key's So many homies, that turned into my enemies So don't be fakin this sh*t Like if you gonna blast Cause when I turn out the lights You all outta gas They got me caught up in the drama of the inner city Who can a nigga trust?

<p><br /></p>
<p>These are the responses:</p>
<p>Ø i Reckon that is tupac its sounds like him and also has his style of music TUPAC RESURECTION</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ø The Beat sounds like pac [beats] more his style. It sounds like he's (pac) singing a few verses and the other guy comes in sing a verse or two.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ø This is Pac no doubt bout it...he just made is voice a little aigu ....have u listen i give a shout on ras-sa-rec-shun cd...this is Pac! he just try to put some confusion!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ø listen to this mug, it aint pac for sure. its kinda tight but it aint pac. i think pac is alive but that aint him. this dude is pretty raw but he aint quite pac.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Blac Haze has the same intention with nigga enemies and confronting bitches. The pictures however always have "blac" with a hat or his head ducking down. He's always wearing some shirt that covers his whole body and there are some features that are not similar such as no mustache and no jewelry flashing. They both however treat death the same way.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the video "Heaven Gotta Ghetto", the license plate of the car that he gets in with the older man reads "61671". Another obvious occurrence is the number seven and the sum of seven (6+1).</p>
<p>This bit of info comes from Michael Penn: In the CD booklet of the "R U Still Down" album it is written "Keep the faith in me I won't let u down...love 2pac". Can he be advising us not to dwell on his "death" because he is coming back?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This comes from Mike Frankel: If you rearrange the letters in the album title "Makaveli The Don Killuminati The 7 Day Theory" You can make the sentence "Ok on tha 7th u think I'm dead yet I'm really alive". Mike explains "7th meaning the 7th day after he was shot, he supposedly died but is really alive." That's quite amazing, try it for yourself.</p>

<p>In the song "Hell 4 a Hustler," 2Pac raps about black Jesus.</p>

<p>No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social ni**az shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu ni**az do unto these snitches, before it's done to you And if the cops come arrest me in the evening best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug Tell me will my ni**az mourn me? Gettin blowed out High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify Strikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life And if you dream be a part of my team From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends Keep yo' eyes on the prize, ni**a watch for bustaz Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler</p>
<p>This is how we ride Not knowin if we'll live or die Catch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild til they all die This is how we ride Not knowin if we'll live or die Catch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild until they all die, Outlaw Yes (change my ways) yes The Black Jesuz guide us through this Weary weary weary weary</p>
<p>Only God can save us Nuttin but boss players Outlawz and thugs</p>
<p>Doesn't all this sound a bit too ridiculous, although there is no specific fact that makes my theory valid, there is nothing the obviously disproves it, but it all adds up to something, there must be something funny going on. What Do You Think?</p>

<p>Lucian moynihan's interest in his beard is second only to his interest in himself. Lucian prefers to eat whole live children for breakfast, so that he can see the fledgling intelligence dieing in their eyes, however he has been known to eat babies, if that is all he is able to rustle up.

<p>The Oriental Theater is a shining example of the Exotic Revival architectural style popularized in late 1920s movie theaters. Built at a time when a theater’s décor prepared patrons for the excitement and glamour of a film, the Oriental Theater’s interior created for theatergoers the atmosphere of a Middle Eastern palace at twilight. The Persian courtyard theme is evident in realistic murals depicting desert themes, minarets, domes, arches and palm fronds. Plaster friezes, terracotta accents, recesses designed to resemble porticos and balconies, rich draperies and rose-colored seats completed the scene. A small orchestra pit was built in front of the stage, joined by a large pipe organ.</p>
<p>Located in Northwest Denver's Berkeley Highlands neighborhood, The Oriental Theater is under new management and presents a fresh face to the world. New owners 44th Avenue Productions, in January 2006, completed a four-month, quarter-million dollar renovation that makes the Oriental Theater one of Denver’s premiere entertainment venues.</p>
<p>The Oriental Theater is a live music theater that features comedy, drama, dance and independent film and offer tableside food service during most performances.</p>
<p>The Oriental Theater was built as a movie theater, but even in 1928 it hosted vaudeville and music performances. Through the 1930s and 1940s the theater flourished with daily features that included the Depression Era concept of “bank night” where groceries and small household goods were given to lucky patrons.</p>
<p>The age of the automobile and the rise of the suburbs in the 1950s marked the beginning of rough, dark days for the Oriental Theater. In the 1960s to boost withering attendance, plush seating, new carpet, fresh paint, fluorescent lighting and a bigger projection screen were added. But by 1969 the owners had resorted to showing adult films in order to stay afloat, a business decision that inflamed the community. All that the neighbors wanted, they said, was a little variety.</p>
<p>Through the 1970s and 1980s the Oriental Theater slid into a steady state of shabby disrepair, as a dollar movie house catering mostly to college students from nearby Regis University, and by 1987 the theater was untenable and shuttered. For a while the theater was home to a church, but subsequently, except for the very rare special performance, it lay vacant for years.</p>
<p>In the 1990s several attempts were made to revive the Oriental Theater but none of the owners in those years had the vision or staying power to keep in front of trends and capitalize on the theater’s substantial assets.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-15_9c49.html" title="Edit section: Heaven in Islam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Heaven in Islam</span></h2>
<p>The concept of heaven in Islam is similar to that found in Judaism and Christianity. The Quran is filled with references to an afterlife in Eden for those who do good deeds. Heaven itself is commonly described in the Quran in verse 35 of Surah Al-Ra¹d: "The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised! Beneath it flow rivers: Perpetual is the fruits thereof and the shade therein:Such is the End of the Righteous; and the end of the unbelievers is the Fire." wherein a person dwells forever. Since Islam rejects the concept of original sin, Muslims believe that all human beings are born pure and will naturally turn to God, but it is their environment which influences them to choose ungodly ways of life. In Islam, therefore, a child who dies automatically goes to heaven, regardless of the religion of his or her parents. The highest level of heaven is Firdaws (فردوس), which is where the prophets, the martyrs and the most truthful and pious people will dwell.</p>
<p><br />
Quranic Names of Heaven:</p>
<p>Jannat–This name has been used most commonly in the Qur’an and Hadith. (Al-Baqarah: 35, Al-e-Imran: 133, 142, Al-Maidah: 72)</p>
<p>Dar-us-Salam–This means the Home of Peace (Yunus: 25)</p>
<p>Jannat-ul-Khuld–The Eternal Gardens. (Al-Furqan: 15)</p>
<p>Darul-Maqamah–The Home (Fatir: 35)</p>
<p>Jannat-e-Adan–Gardens of Everlasting Bliss (Tauba: 72, Ar-Rad: 23)</p>
<p>Darul-Hywan–But verily the Home in the Hereafter–that is life indeed, if they but knew. (Al-Ankabut: 64)</p>
<p>Jannat-un-Naeem–The Gardens of Delight. (Al-Maida: 65 Yunus: 9 Al-Haj: 56)</p>
<p>Al-Maqam-al-Ameen–The House of Security (Ad-Dukhan: 51)</p>
<p>Jannat-ul-Mawa–Garden of Abode (An-Najm: 15)</p>
<p>Maqad-as-Sidq–Assembly of Truth (Al-Qawr: 55)</p>
<p>Qadam-as-Sidq-Assembly ofTruth (Al-Qawr:55).</p>
<p>Firdous–The Highest Gardens of the Heaven (Al-Kahaf: 107, Al-Muminoon: 11)</p>
<p>Small Description of Jannath :</p>
<p>The Prophet of Allah (Sallalahou Al'aihe Was-salam) said:</p>
<p>Hadith implies that the heaven has eight doors: Whoever performed a perfect ablution and recited shahadah then all the eight doors of the heaven are thrust open for him–he may enter from whichever door he likes. (Sahih Muslim).</p>
<p>By Him in whose hands my soul is, the distance between the two gate posts of paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Himyar or between Makkah and Basra (Bukhari).</p>
<p>Indeed, there are hundred grades of the Heaven and the distance between the two grades is as great as between the heaven and earth. Allah has prepared these grades for those who perform Jihad in the way of Allah. (Bukhari)</p>
<p>When you pray ask for Firdous, for it is in the middle of heaven and is higher in grade than the heaven and above Firdous is Allah’s throne, moreover the canals of heaven flow from Firdous. (Bukhari)</p>
<p>"And then I was showed in the heaven, I saw there were camps made of pearls and the soil was of musk." (Bukhari)</p>
<p>The Qur’an says of the dwellers of the heaven: They will see there neither the sun’s (excessive heat) nor the moon’s excessive cold.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a tree in heaven so big that if a person keeps riding on a brisk Madhamar (a specially bred horse) for a hundred years even then he would not reach the end of that tree. (Bukhari)</p>
<p>Abu Huraira (RA) reported that the Prophet of Allah (SAW) said:</p>
<p>There is no tree in the heaven that does not have a trunk of gold. (Muslim)</p>
<p>There is a tree in the heaven, which will manufacture robes for the dwellers of the heaven. That tree is called Tuba.</p>
<p>A hadith has these words about this tree.</p>
<p>Tuba is a tree in the heaven, which spreads out as much as a distance that can be covered in a hundred years. Robes for the dwellers of the heaven will sprout from its buds.</p>
<p>The Prophet of Allah (SAW) said:</p>
<p>In the night of Isra when I met Ibrahim (AS) he said: O Muhammad (SAW) tell your people that the heaven has pure soil and sweet water but the land is bare. If they want to plant trees in the heaven, they should say Subhan Allah Al-Hamdulillah and Allah Akbar.</p>
<p>Indeed, there will be a mansion made of pearls for a believer. It will be spread over an area of 60 miles, and in it will be the household of a believer who will visit them but they will not be able to see each other. (Bukhari)</p>
<p>Sleep is the sisiter of death and the dwellers of the heaven will not sleep (Silsalatul Ahadith)</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a bazaar in the heaven where the dwellers of the Heaven will come on every Friday. The northerly wind will spray scent on them and this will enhance their beauty. And when they will return to their homes, their households will say "By Allah, your beauty has enhanced." "So has yours," they will return the compliment. (Muslim)</p>
<p>In short, they will be overwhelmed by Allah’s favours.</p>
<p>And when you look, it is there you will see a bliss and a realm magnificent. (Ad-Dahr: 20)</p>
<p>When Allah Almighty created the heaven and the hell, He asked Jibraeel to go and take a look at what He has prepared for believers in the Heaven. Jibraeel went and had a look at what was there in the Heaven, and then he came back and expressed himself thus: By your dignity! Whoever will hear of this Heaven will certainly strive for it. Then it was said that the road to the heaven is littered with hardships, and Jibraeel was asked to take another look at the Heaven. He came back and said, "By your dignity I am afraid that nobody will be able to enter it. (Tirmizee)</p>

<p>Jake and Addie kiss in the Dark Side , because he and Randy both dressed as Dark Vader, and she was sent to the closet with a dark vader - in spin the bottle. She kissed the dark vader, thinking he was randy but it was jake. Addie did not realise that Jake and Randy were both dressed as Dark Vader until after she came out of the closet.</p>

<p>Sir Jack spent a large proportion of his life in the United Kingdom, having been born in 1916 in Leeds, Yorkshire, where his late father, Samuel Henry Lyons had established a clothing empire called Alexandre Stores, with a factory and several dozen retail shops. Sir Jack started at the bottom of the business, in the factory and the shops until gaining sufficient experience and ability to be appointed a director in 1937, in charge of sales and marketing and later becoming Managing Director. He contributed considerably to the growth of the original business with the expansion of branches and the development of a very lucrative export division during the early post War period which enabled the business to grow rapidly and the business merged in 1955 with Sir Edward Mountain's United Drapery Stores with Sir Jack running the giant conglomerate.</p>

<p>The Space of flows is a high level cultural conceptual abstraction of space, time, and their dynamic interaction with society in the digital age. Complicated and mostly academic in nature, It was created by the prolific writer Manuel Castells in order to "reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm" (Castells 146). It was first mentioned in The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process, published in 1989.</p>

<p>Traditionally we find a prevalent idea of space being a passive form, while time is considered a separate and active entity. Castells makes the argument that space should not be disconnected from time. He asserts that space is a dynamic entity related to time, and rejects the concept that it will disappear as to create a global city. Space is defined by this idea as "the material support of time-sharing social practices". He goes on to define the space of flows as "the material organization of time-sharing social practices that work through flows" (147).</p>

<p>As with most abstractions, the true meaning and usefulness of this conceptualization can be elusive to casual readers. It might be helpful to step through Castells’ definitions in order to come to a conclusion on what he's getting at. Castells is defining space as the physical support of the way we live in time. The space and time we are used to, "real world time", is referred to by him as a space of places. This is because it lacks three elements central to a space of flows. It lacks a proper medium through which to flow, and the proper items to flow through it; it lacks nodes through which these things flow through and circulate (Stadler, 3). Castells wants to conceptualize a world wherein human action and interaction occurs by dynamic movement and distance can also be completely dynamic rather than static (2). This is his space of flows. It involves the medium of technology, time sensitive and continous data that runs (flows) across it, and nodes of circuitry and computer systems all over the world.This movement brings people together into a continuous and real time arena that seems to be to be differentiated from the idea of a global village by the fact that interacting groups are enhanced by their position in time, rather than that position dissapearing altogether.</p>

<p>Delivered Audio Quality, abreviated as DAQ, is a measure of audio quality over a transmission medium. This metric is often used to quantify the quality of audio heard over a radio system. DAQ levels are defined by the following scale.</p>
<p><br />

<p>"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is a book written by Washington Irving about a schoolteacher by the name of Ichabod Crane. Set in early dutch New York, it is one of the only remaining pure American folktales left. The story goes that Ichabod fell in love with the beautiful Katrina van Tassle, but he couldn't court her because she was wealthy and he was not. He actually decides to do it anyway, but is opposed by the handsom, yet brutish Brom Bones, who himself is courting Katrina. He tells Ichabod of the legend of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow, who rides his horse across the bridge, seeking vengeance for the head that he lost. He will dissapear only if you cross the bridge fast enough. Of course, Brom Bones and his friends only thought it was a joke. Upset and a little frightened, Ichabod rides his horse home, going across the bridge, which is the only way to get home. Off in the distance, he hears hoofbeats and a curious neighing sound. He looks around and there is a rider and his horse behind him galloping at full speed. The strange thing is, his head is not attatched to his shoulders, but under his arm. Ichabod gallops away, frightened, though whether or not he actually made it across is cause for debate. Some versions say, he died of fright and that the horseman was in fact Brom Bones in a costume. Others, however, say the horseman got him and he was never seen again. Still, others say he made it across the bridge and the horseman disappeared in a whisp of smoke, which scared him so bad, he left the city and no one knows what happened to him si0nce. No matter what the ending, it is a popular story, come Halloween</p>

<p>Laura Bryne began her acting career in her mid twenties, after throwing in the towel on her career in teaching. After initially finding it hard to seek out employment in the industry, her lucky break came when she was offered a role performing alongside the likes of Judy Finnegan in; "The Vagina Monlogues". This proved to be her big break, and soon casting agents across the UK were keen on snapping the tubster up. After her big screen debut in "Night People", Laura went on to a respeticable enough singing career, topping the UK album charts with her debut album; "Biffa Tibs". Most recently, Laura has been involved in a heated fued with celtic crooner Enya, and the two still refuse to talk to each other.</p>

<p>Do You Sedu? Knotty. Gnarled. Snarled. Twisted. Tangled. Frizzy. If any of these words have been used to describe your hair, it’s time to Sedu™ your hair!</p>
<p>Plainsboro, New Jersey — The Sedu Ceramic Ionic Professional Flat Iron, from American Beauty Supply, was created to rid the world of damaged hair one Seductive woman at a time. (Sedu comes from "seduction" — because every woman should be able to be transformed into a seductive beauty.) Sedu’s patented ultra-smooth surface reduces hair damage and doesn’t pull, snag or break your hair.</p>
<p><br />
Dennis Huang, the creator of the Sedu, had listened to his wife continuously grumble that her hair was damaged and fried from using flat irons. “I chose to focus my efforts on flat irons because I knew that they could be made better,” comments Huang.</p>
<p><br />
The science behind Sedu is simple. Most people thought that hair damage was due to heat alone. Huang, along with a team of stylists and engineers, determined that the rough surface of the plates is the major provider of hair damage. Huang describes the findings by saying that ordinary flat irons are essentially the same as using “heated sand paper” on your hair.</p>
<p><br />
“We set out to produce an iron with an ultra-smooth surface. We were searching for materials that could produce more negative ions, to counteract the positive ions that ruffle the hair shaft causing frizz and split ends. Tourmaline (a precious stone) was the way to progress with my vision because it produces more negative ions and gentler heat; both of these factors help to defend your hair from damage. We tried different materials (Titanium-sapphire, etc); Tourmaline is the best. Ceramic alone does not generate enough negative ions. All of Sedu’s ceramic/tourmaline plates are finished with a special "surface-polishing" process.”</p>
<p><br />
Sedu is available in only the finest salons around the country and online exclusively at Folica.com and Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Sedu Ionic Ceramic Professional Flat Iron straightens, smoothes and tames frizzy or rebellious hair for long-lasting results.</p>

Want lustrous, shiny hair? It’s time to Sedu your hair!</p>

<p>Built in 1968, it remains the tallest building in Ireland. It is the headquarters of Cork County Council as well as regional planning offices for the Munster region and civil service offices too. It was officially opened in April 1968 and was once again refurbished in 2005 making it one of Ireland's most modern buildings. It is 64m (211ft) in height and has 50 feet of piles penetrating the underlying rock as a foundation to the building. There will be an increase in useable office space from 3,000M2 in the existing building to a final total of 7,000M2 in the refurbished building and proposed extension. The increase in floor area will allow for the accommodation of around 600 staff in excellent working conditions within Cork County Hall.</p>

<p>There once was a guy named Jim Smith. Jim was a Beekeeper who lived in Trabuco Canyon around the 1870's. All that is known is he was half native American, half European decent. Jim used to live in what is now known as "Holy Jim Canyon" with his huge family and friends. His family had lived there since the early 1800's. Many generations of his family were born an raised there. Jim enjoyed fishing, hiking, hunting, and long walks along the creek(known as "Trabuco Creek"), named after his second wife "Grace Trabuco". Jim loved his families canyon. He swore he would live there forever until he died, and would see his Grandchildren frolic around the same canyon. Then all of a sudden all these strange people started bringing motor vehicles in his canyon. He was then forced out by all of the burnt leaded gas in the air, and the noisy motors. Jim was forced into the hills, now known as "Portolla hills", named after his first born Son, "Portolla". Portolla soon after died from Cancer, which Jim blamed on all the gas pollution in the air from these crazy "motor mobiles". Jim went crazy. Grace soon after left Jim for a man named Julio Silverado. Jim started a journey up the mountains, with his Sheppard dog "saddleback". Saddleback was born with a small hunch in his back, but was Jim's best friend. Jim encountered many epic dangers on his journey to the top of the mountains, but he was guided by two Native Spirits. The first one was "Modjeska", and the second one was "Santiago". Jim finally made it to the very tip top of the mountains, and wrote a scroll of his life story. The scroll never tolled what happened after Jim got to the top. What is known is that Jim named the mountains after his loyal Sheppard "Saddleback, and named the two peaks of the mountain "Modjeska" peak, and "Santiago" peak.</p>
<p>Rumor has it, that every moring, around 3:30 AM, his spirit comes back to the canyon and makes as many holes in the dirt road as possible. To discourage the same type of folk that drove him off of his land, and drove him to insanity.</p>
<p>That's how he got the name Holy Jim, and That's how Holy Jim canyon was named, and that's why the road is so messed up. Jim will never give up. As long as his spirit is around. Some claim to still here Jim's sheppard still howl in the darkness of the night on occasions. Some also believe that his sheppard mated with a coyote, and belive that his sheppard's blood is still found in today's coyotes in the area.</p>
