<p>Non-notable is an interesting term. Just who gets to decide that and what are the implications to one of throwing it around flippantly? 105 people appoint someone a ranging expert...the august REDVERS...on whatever he wishes to rudely lambast and that is the basis of governance? Talk about the Wild West!</p>
<p>I notice there are not articles concerning Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones--easily two of the most important active political scientists in America by any serious expert's opinion...but no article on them? Obviously not notable. No article on Charles Perrow? Insignificant? No, forgive me, not notable. What would qualify one to call Charles Perrow or Dwight Waldo not notable, I wonder. Waldo has probably been read in Korean more than the sum total of all the people who will ever gaze upon REDVER's obscure writings he lists so pridefully at the bottom of his user page. What expertise and degree would you have called upon to state that Frederick C. Mosher is not notable when his work is translated in 8 languages and could probably be discussed by senior government officials in 10s of countries? I'm just curious what sort of definition of encyclopedia that might fulfill?</p>
<p>I was obviously mistaken in thinking that the purpose here is to start a thread that expands underexplored knowledge based on one's legitimate and demonstrable learning as expressed in articles. Now I find I did that only to have it ridiculed by the ignorant Mr. X...or REDVERS as he prefers. The Encyclopedia of Public Administration which would mirror most of what I put in here costs hundreds of dollars but would have been neither succinct nor wholly accurate. Just what is the point of the silly articles on obscure European punk bands and photos of even more obscure Belgian fountains you seem to prefer as content (if WP is not a free resource) when there is almost no discussion of the primary field that studies government bureaucracy and dozens of allied areas? I suppose it's just yet another Internet power trip of some frustrated and indenty-starved persons without the guts to sign their name or to discuss their qualifications on their web pages or in their edits. I suppose this resort to insult by REDVERS when someone has donated their time and expertise is deemed acceptable etiquette here. Shame. What a puny thing to do...to use your administrative authority to go through a contrib file to systematically delete contributions. That is strikingly ugly and remarkably small. People like you are exactly what the idea of free software and knowledge is not about. Oh dear. I had heard this was the deal of late here, but I was so naively hopeful. What a bizarre ethic you have; thank goodness we have relatively few power abusers as serious editors in the print world.

Next, please read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The best usage of your time here would be to argue why these people meet the criteria for inclusion laid out at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> rather than disparaging REDVERS for nominating your articles for deletion. You might want to read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> too and lay out a case for keeping your articles based on the criteria there. I should also mention that REDVERS isn't an admin to the best of my knowledge, so he has no power to abuse... I will say though that REDVERS should have notified you on your talk page when he nominated these articles per AfD ettiquette... bad form on his part.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 03:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your kind response. First, I had read the BIO page specifically on professors just before reading your note. All of the above easily qualify if anyone bothered to speak to a human about their reputations and works. I was myself setting place markers in a field I was encouraging others including world famous professors regularly invited to speak to many persons listed in wiki articles (deemed now not-notable by REDVERS) to contribute. Dream on concerning that point now. Second, it was not me who launched into a systematic edit begun with a rather sociopathic insult. I believe REDVERS claims to be an administrator on his user page. I hope it is not the case, but he claimed 105 users gave him the "keys to the janitor closet." NPA is a fine policy. Where does the right to self-defense get written up? Where does the right to know what you are talking about prior to using an AfD get described? As an academic I am inclined to defend my words. Criticize the merit, but if you delete because you believe you think things are not significant, the burden should fall to you for justification in print prior to having the AfD power. I accept your other points and agree with them.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please also be mindful of the need for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. It is not enough for you to assert that the accomplishments of these scholars is notable in their fields; each article needs to point to some independent reliable sources (as Uppland shows below through JSTOR). Also, the burden for any edit (whether a minor content change or the creation of a new article) is on the editor, to show with reference to Notability and Verifiability that the edit or article is justified. However, it certainly would have been more polite for someone to contact you and refer you to these policies, giving you a few days to work on the articles, before proposing them for deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:14, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>, I revoked my delete opinion above based on <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a>'s reasoning, which is rather sound. I think it is worthwhile to give Ryan a chance to source these articles and prove that they meet accepted wikipedia guidelines. I want to reiterate what Thatcher said above though... speaking to a human about their reputations would constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and is not going to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. These articles need to be sourced with written citations (web or good old-fashioned print) that support the claims made in the articles. This shouldn't be too difficult for some (if not all) of these articles based on what <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> has stated below.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you Thatcher131. Does verifiability mean consensus? Or does it mean expert opinion? There are trivially hundreds of articles written with facts that are not "verifiable" in some hard form every day. I am all for journalistic standards--to pitifully invoke credentialism, I have worked for someone on the Pulitizer Committee (who is not in Wikipedia) for the last two years. That is easily discoverable by someone who wishes to search about me. Is it "verified?" No. It is counter-sourced. I think this is a good and worthy project overall, but the goverance and the standards are where the hardcore should vett their expertise, not in AfD'ing article stubs. That should be a democratic process of the marketplace. If a new article is now hit within 30 days by an outsider, simply bot delete it as insignificant. Don't rely on the power-crazed to serial AfD with a two-word explanation. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Lanham_450b.html" title="User:Ryan Lanham">Ryan Lanham</a> 13:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verifability does not mean consensus or expert opinion. It means the claims are sourced in what would be considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As it states on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> page: "the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> Yes, there are loads of article out there that are not verifiably sourced... and there are at least a few people around here who go around tagging them for missing sources, contacting creators, etc. That's pretty much the nature of an open collaboration such as Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:54, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verifiability in some respects depends on the claim being made. If you are writing an article on John Smith that says he teaches and writes in the field of public administration, you should be able to provide a bibliography; not his entire CV, but selections showing his more notable accomplishments. If you want to say john Smith is the leading PA theoretician of the 21st century, you will need rather stronger proof, such as winning important prizes, or being recognized by the leading expert group in the field (for science in the US this would be the National Academy; I don't know what it would be in PA). If it is the unwritten consensus of the field that he is a leading figure, you will have a problem, but maybe he was the keynote speaker at an international conference, which would validate the unwritten consensus. To give one specific example, <i>you</i> can't say that Waldo's <i>The Administrative State</i> is the classic work in PA but you can quote <i>other sources</i> as saying so (such as textbooks, articles or reviews in peer-reviewed journals, and so forth). Post to my talk page if you want to discuss it further. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks again Isotope23. I apologize for my ignorance and will be more thoughtful in laying out pointers to sourcing in the future if I cool down enough to write again. What Uppland quite authoritatively and appropriately researched and wrote below I could have written off the top of my head, but I did not...I was trying to learn how to start writing here...what the style is. Perhaps one could tag new authors for particularly helpful comments until they reach a standard deemed "experienced" rather than spanking and alienating them. That is what many academic journals try to do. It is what all newspaper editors do. Regardless, I understand the point you make and that which is in the rules, and I agree to comply with it. Still, I would not be so quick to fall back on the rules as perfected. Those with more experience, I reiterate, probably can do more good by thinking through how those can work better and offering encouragement rather than using a heavy hand which is alienating in the extreme--accuracy is great as a norm in WP--public is an even better norm. There are trade-offs.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep all</b>, as this mass-nomination is clearly insufficiently researched. Recognized academic fields, recognized academic journals and leading academics in those fields are all notable. I just made a sample search for <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Waldo_6335.html" title="Dwight Waldo">Dwight Waldo</a>, as his was the longest of the biographical articles. "Dwight Waldo" gets 16,500 Google hits, 573 <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Books_5e58.html" title="Google Books">Google Books</a> hits and 906 <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Scholar_5e38.html" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> hits. "Dwight Waldo" also gets 1096 hits in the academic journals incuded in <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>. Hits on Waldo include books titled <i>Mastering Public Administration: From <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> to Dwight Waldo</i> (Chatham, N.J.: Chatham House, cop. 1989) and <i>A Search for Public Administration: The Ideas and Career of Dwight Waldo</i>, by Brack Brown &amp; Richard J. Stillman, II (College Station, Texas: Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1986). I am convinced of the good faith of the author and suspect that we would get similar results with several of the other articles. I might add that I had personally never heard of Waldo before. The <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Waldo_6335.html" title="Dwight Waldo">Dwight Waldo</a> article is actually posted on April 23 – any reason not to just give it more time, and perhaps add a {{unreferenced}} tag or something? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 03:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here is an ethic I can admire even if it serves my interests. Frankly, Max Stephenson is iffy at best. The rest are no brainers to public administration experts--as was budget theory which was summarily deleted--perhaps the most important topic in PA. On that I would frankly sign my name and stake my reputation--that is what academics do every day. Imagine the power of the summary delete. Imagine it. You can erase the words of another with 5 characters--that sort of power without a review--without a countersignature? This is the sort of governance issue that should constitute the meat of what is meant by "verifiability"--in short, checks and balances--not reputation is what should matter. Why not make all new articles provisional until they have been edited by at least 5 independent persons? Again, I would argue that these are the sorts of administrative ethical processes that need to exist in WP...not some empowered idea of an administrator who relies hugely on discretion. By the way, anyone who knows something about administrative discretion of public bureaucrats--which clearly WP administrators are--would associate the idea with the "not-notable" John A. Rohr and his not-notable contributions to Refounding Public Administration while he was at an non-notable CPAP studying the non-notable theorist Dwight Waldo and other things. Sorry for this and the other rants...they are overboard I admit.<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Lanham_450b.html" title="User:Ryan Lanham">Ryan Lanham</a> 13:52, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../n/p/p/WP%7ENPP_2bb0.html" title="WP:NPP">New Pages Patrol</a> is generally a good thing, as you will see if you stick around, but some of the editors there need to have <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_changes_patrol_3ff8.html#Suggestions_for_patrollers" title="Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol">Suggestions for patrollers</a> inked on their monitors in large black letters. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:07, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

Ryan, if you are uncertain about how to best write and format articles on Wikipedia, you can work on them in your user space until they are ready to go out in the main article space. Just make a temporary subpage of your userpage with a slash, like this: User:Ryan Lanham/Dwight Waldo. And always keep in mind that you are not writing for a limited academic audience, but for people who in most cases have not the slightest idea about your field. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 14:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep all</b> Yet another case of articles sent for deletion before they ever really get started. There's no harm in leaving them alone, tagging for references or cleanup, and coming back in a week or so.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the reason this appears to be a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> is very likely that it is an underrepresented area of little interest to most authors on Wikipedia, as opposed to the <i>hundreds</i> of articles in <a href="../../../b/u/f/Category%7EBuffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_bf4e.html" title="Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> and its subcategories and subsubcategories, i.e. a case of <i><a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>.</i> <i>That does not make the academic field of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_administration.html" title="Public administration">public administration</a> in some objective sense less important than <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i>, its theorists less important than <a href="../../../b/u/f/Category%7EBuffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_characters_6bef.html" title="Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters">Buffyverse characters</a> or its journals or institutions less important than <a href="../../../b/u/f/Category%7EBuffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_fe04.html" title="Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">individual Buffy episodes</a>. This is not a case of "if we keep <i>that</i> cruft, we might as well keep <i>this</i> cruft". This is a case where we keep enormous amounts of cruft because of a determined fanbase blocking any attempt to delete it (not that I really mind it so much), while some AfD participants apparently aren't interested in listening to people who actually seem to know something about and are willing to contribute to articles on key persons, concepts and institutions in an underrepresented but established and recognized social science (the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Books_5e58.html" title="Google Books">Google Books</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Scholar_5e38.html" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> hits I mentioned prove this to be the case) which Wikipedia <i>should</i> cover. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Public administration is a legitimate field, and one I have a faint dream of getting into should I ever become independently wealthy. IMHO, it is more notable than basically any computer game, which are inherently ephemeral. Give the author, and other contributors, time to bring the articles up to full speed. I'd rather see articles that aren't fully ready for prime time be in a nearly walled garden state than linked to from everywhere. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> per Silence, Uppland, Dbachmann, and others. This mass nomination seems to have missed the mark. Wikipedia's not going anywhere, and these can be renominated once the articles have had sufficient time to develop and once the author has been allowed and helped to climb a bit more of Wikipedia's learning curve. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:55, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>When someone nominates an entire collection of articles, I'm going to spot check one or two, and then pass judgement on the whole lot. I did that checking and I'm convinced; this is important enough stuff to merit having articles at this level of detail. Further, the arguments of the other keep folk are persuasive. So is this: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Are_academic_disciplines_less_notable_than_Buffycruft.3F_.28AfD_revisited.29" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">VP posting</a>. So then... <b>Keep the entire lot</b> and without any aspersion, strongly recommend that Redvers do a bit more research in future before nominating academic articles in wholesale lots this way.

<li><b>Keep all</b> per Uppland, and thanks for his principled intervention. "Non-notable" is too easily thrown around here for non-pop culture subjects.

Take the Waldo article, for example. It sets off with: <i>Perhaps the defining figure in modern public administration and public management and recognized the world over for his contributions to the theory of bureaucratic government, Waldo is only now taking his place as one of the most important political scientists of the last 100 years.</i> That's quite a congeries of claims, and, intended or otherwise, it has a strong reek of PoV. The author may wish to bone up on, say, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> to see how bio articles are written -- WP being WP, there seems to be an inverse relationship between genuine significance and care evident in the article -- although an article on an academic who's not a <a href="http://www.improbable.com/projects/hair/hair-club-top.html" class="external text" title="http://www.improbable.com/projects/hair/hair-club-top.html" rel="nofollow">hirsute scientist</a> needn't have such elements as a lengthy, photographically illustrated section on "image and personal life".
