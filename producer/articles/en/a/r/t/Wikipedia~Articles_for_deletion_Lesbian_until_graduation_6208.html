If the tongue-in-cheek LUG is encyclopedic, then so are the tongue-in-cheek fraternities I Tappa Kegga and I Spreada Thigh. Perhaps I should add those articles, just to make sure that everyone's clever college slang has a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Largely as Optikos. Take it to urban dictionary, where it belings alongside BOBFOC. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate list of everything every mentioned in the press. Non-notable College slang that <i>once</i> got mentioned in the NYT is still non-notable college slang. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The concept is real, the phonomenon is real, and the term is well beyond the stage of neologism. It's mentioned within <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> circles as often as (if not more often) than it is by people who made it up because they thought it was cute. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 08:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per GWO. The NYT is useful as an independant reference on lots of things, but that does not mean that everything in the NYT should have an article here. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 08:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I do think that the term can contain an element of homophobia/misogyny -- I've certainly seen some people use it in such a manner. (That is not to say that all uses of this term involve homophobia or misogyny -- it all depends on context/intentions.) But in any case, I feel that the fact that people invented this term &amp; spread it is notable. The present article is less than impressive, but I still don't think it should go -- its more than just a dictionary entry. And besides, we have articles on heaps of other pejorative/derisive (or potentially pejorative/derisive) sexual or group terms... I think so long as we can talk about the terms origins, motivations, history, the ways in which it is used, etc., its more than a dicdef. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 09:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable neologism.

<dd>The New York Times article cited here is not one of those, however. It is a 1993 article titled <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00616FE395C0C768CDDAF0894DB494D81" class="external text" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00616FE395C0C768CDDAF0894DB494D81" rel="nofollow">Campus Lesbians Step Into Unfamiliar Light</a>.

<dd>I'm confused by this. Are you suggesting that once slang has become old or "out of use," the article should be deleted?

<dd>No, quite the opposite. (Note that I said Keep above.)
