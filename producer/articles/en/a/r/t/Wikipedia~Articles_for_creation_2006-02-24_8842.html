<p>Flemish-Netherlandic poet and spiritual writer. Flourished 1st half of the <a href="../../../x/i/i/XIII_f8c1.html" title="XIII">XIII</a> century.</p>
<p>Little or nothing is known of her biography, as no medieval <i>vita</i> seems to have survived. Her work was certainly known to Jan van Ruusbroec and perhaps other <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a> spiritual figures of the <a href="../../../x/i/v/XIV_b2aa.html" title="XIV">XIV</a> and <a href="../../../x/v/_/XV_9db5.html" title="XV">XV</a> centuries. Soon thereafter, however, the religious movement to which she belonged became suspect, with the result that her manuscript literary remains were never printed. By the <a href="../../../x/v/i/XVI_e50e.html" title="XVI">XVI</a> century her name was totally forgotten.</p>
<p>It was only in the 1870s that a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex.html" title="Codex">codex</a> containing her writings was noticed at the Royal Library in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Three manuscripts, two from the <a href="../../../x/i/v/XIV_b2aa.html" title="XIV">XIV</a> century and one from the <a href="../../../x/v/i/XVI_e50e.html" title="XVI">XVI</a>, have survived. Only one of these actually gives the name of the author as "Hadewijch van <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>", i.e., Hedwig of Antwerp. Hadewijch's Works first appeared in print at <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>.</p>
<p>Internal evidence from her writings suggests that she was a <a href="../../../b/e/g/Beguine.html" title="Beguine">Beguine</a>, that is to say, not a <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nun</a>, but a laywoman, living, without <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vows.html" title="Vows">vows</a>, in a beginnage—a working, non-<a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloistered.html" title="Cloistered">cloistered</a>, religious community, prior to <a href="../../../1/2/4/1244.html" title="1244">1244</a>.</p>
<p>It is not accurate or appropriate to call Hadewijch a "Dutch" writer. The language she uses is the Brabantine dialect of medieval <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Flemish (linguistics)">Flemish</a>, a language related to <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch.html" title="Dutch">Dutch</a> but certainly not <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> Dutch. Before the separation of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> from Holland in 1830, the duchy of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brabant.html" title="Brabant">Brabant</a> constituted a single geographical and historical unit. In any case, Hadewijch flourished in Southern Brabant, which today is in Belgium. She evidences a good knowledge of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_literature.html" title="French literature">French literature</a>, particularly the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundian.html" title="Burgundian">Burgundian</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivalric.html" title="Chivalric">chivalric</a> tradition, which suggests that she was a well-educated gentlewoman probably belonging to the gentry in and around Brussels.</p>
<p>Her work consists of two kinds of poem: an <a href="../../../o/d/e/Ode.html" title="Ode">ode</a>-like stanzaic <b>lied</b>, consisting of four to seven often-rhymed <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanza.html" title="Stanza">stanzas</a>; and contiguous, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance.html" title="Romance">romance</a>-like <i>mengeldichten</i>. She also left a collection of prose <b>Visions</b>, relating her <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystical.html" title="Mystical">mystical</a> experiences, as well as a series of <b>Letters</b> of spiritual counsel.</p>
<p>Hadewijch's principal theme is the concept of <b>Minne</b> ['love' in medieval Flemish] by which she meant the whole, direct, mystical, psychological, <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential.html" title="Existential">existential</a> and literary experience of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> on the part of a "touched" human <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>. Her pregnant vocabulary, dense variety of literary moods and memorable psychological insights make her, without a doubt, one of the most remarkable and valuable of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> writers.</p>

<p>The Cabin Motorcycle has been used in Europe since the Mauser Monotrace was introduced in the 1920s. They are enclosed motorcycles (like an auto or airplane)and are the only practical motorcycle in areas where there is a great deal of rainfall. In 1986, Arnold Wagner introduced the ECOMOBILE, the first aerodynamic cabin motorcycle. It looks like a small airplane without wings, accomodates the rider and passenger. It also has a trunk for luggage, climate control, windshield wiper and washer, and is available with most of the luxuries found in cars. Performance wise it gets 57 miles per gallon at 55 miles per hour and can reach a top speed of 150 miles per hour or more. It solves many of the aerodymanic problems that have robbed conventional motorcycles of higher efficiency. It can travel faster and has a greater range than any conventional motorcycle of equal horsepower.</p>

<p>Mario's Moon Adventure is a Hack of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Bros._8a96.html" title="Super Mario Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a> and it uses instead of most hacks just pallete and graphic hacks, it also changes some of the games physics and motion, like as if you were on the moon. Pressing the jump button longer now makes Mario jump lower, and Mario jumps so high he is off the screen when you tap it, and you must adjust to this system of jumping. The story behind it is that Mario is abducted by one of Bowser's henchmen and put onto the moon, and Mario must find his rocket to get back to earth. None of the levels are edited more than graphics and pallete, except the water level, which acts the same but looks like there is no water.</p>

<p>The DuBois Campus of the Pennsylvania State University is a member of the university's Commonwealth Campus system. The campus is located in the city of DuBois near the DuBois Area High School. The current chancelor is Dr. Anita McDonald.</p>
<p>The Campus is supported by several guiding bodies. First is the DuBois Educational Foundation which is comprised of various community members whose goal is to act as an advisory council and to help maintain continual support for the university at the location. The other guiding board is the DuBois Campus Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Comprised of ten buildings, the campus serves approximately 1,000 students that generally live within commuting distance.</p>
<p>The campus is home to one of the state's most ambitious projects, the DEF Workforce Development and Technology Center. The building is home to several pieces of research equiptment involved in the production of powdered metals. The unique facility serves to enhance student education as well as enrich technological knowledge within the region. The building is also home to DuBois's PACareerLink office, the joint operation for several former state-run employment service centers. The photo features the chancelor of the DuBois Campus as well as the former DEF president, Dr. Ross. D. Donahue, in the atrium of the DEF building.</p>

<p>US President George W. Bush, September 24 2001 - ‘We will starve the terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, root them out of their safe hiding places and bring them to justice.’ ‘To follow the money as a trail to the terrorists, to follow their money so we can find out where they are and to freeze the money to disrupt their actions.’ ‘Money is the life-blood of terrorist operations. Today, we're asking the world to stop payment.’ Terrorist financing is ‘a complicated and multi-dimensional problem that both domestically and internationally implicates a range of legal, regulatory, financial, intelligence and law enforcement interests. There is a deadly, symbiotic relationship between the illicit drug trade and international terrorism. Drug trafficking groups are today a merger of international organised crime and terror.</p>
<p><br />
William J. Fox, Director FinCEN at the Cambridge Symposium, September 2004 - ”…the government and private sector must act in true partnership….The 20th Century paradigm of governments alone protecting their citizens from outside threats is no longer valid in a post-September 11th world”. “Economic crime, including terrorist financing, has a global reach… Both the government and the private sector must pursue greater international cooperation and collaboration on these issues…”</p>
<p><br />
Underscoring the importance of anti-terrorist financing, the 9/11 Commission report concluded in July 2004 that ‘Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center in U.S. counter terrorism efforts. The government has recognized that information about terrorist money helps us to understand their networks, search them out, and disrupt their operations.’ The Commission’s conclusion is based upon the simple fact that financial transactions remain an Achilles heel for terrorists and their organizations. Money – albeit often in very modest amounts – is needed to carry out terrorist operations, and money trails leave footprints. These trails connect dots – establishing previously unknown connections – so that organizations and networks can be defined and attacked. And most of the time, the money trails do not lie. Information in financial transactions is, for obvious reasons, generally reliable and, therefore, valuable to law enforcement and intelligence operatives. As Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) like the US FinCEN and the NCIS have developed and shared financial information throughout their government departments and between governments, they have learned that these trails are critical ways for law enforcement and security services to identify, locate, and arrest or capture terrorists, their networks and their supporters.</p>
<p><br />
The most significant progress of the US Government has been in bringing about a change in mind-set. There is now a near-unanimous recognition among nations that terrorist financing and money laundering pose threats that cannot be ignored and there is widespread agreement upon a shared set of standards to combat these dangers. The US government states that it will not accept the protest that ideological differences or bureaucratic obstacles excuse nations from the obligation to comply with global standards.</p>
<p><br />
The Asia-Pacific region and South Asia figure prominently in the global war on terrorism. US efforts in the war on terrorism in Asia have been largely successful - many attacks have been thwarted, terrorist cells have been disrupted, and governments in the region have joined the fight. But much remains to be done including finding Osama Bin Laden. However, Al Qaeda's current and prospective ability to raise and move funds with impunity has been significantly diminished. Nonetheless, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations still have ready access to financial resources, and that fact constitutes an ongoing threat.</p>

<p>These four guys from Durban, South Africa have been pumping out a spine chilling breed of positive and progressive energetic hardcore since 1998. Today the band are best described as playing a passionate and often brutal synthesis of metal and punk with a positive, relevant message.</p>
<p>In a world where heavy music is slowly being embraced by a wider audience, many bands have watered down their message to suit the listener. Where it used to be about an uncompromising message in response to societal problems, these days it seems to mostly be about the sound, with any sort of message being secondary. Crossingpoint have stayed true to their roots by playing creative, energy-driven music with a message that demands application. It's hard to go to a crossingpoint show and leave unchanged. Whether you're screaming your lungs out with the band or following their lyrics on their lyric sheets handed out before each show, theirs is a power and a passion that few bands consistently achieve.</p>
<p>Crossingpoint recorded &amp; released their self-titled album independently in october 2004. All stops have been pulled out in terms of its recording, production and presentation. In what is a first for a South African band, it comes as an eye catching 6 panel 'digipak' package!</p>
<p>Real change happens in the minds and hearts of individuals who can go on to affect others. Crossingpoint's urgent and honest message deals with issues such as sexism, loyalty and personal responsibility, and is aimed at reaching the individual in a thoughtful and inspiring way.</p>

<p>The common names of Yerba Santa include Mountain Balm, Bear's Weed, Gum Plant, Consumptive Weed, and Sacred Herb. It was used medicinally by Native America healers for many centuries, and then taken up by the Spanish settlers, who gave it its current name, meaning "Holy Herb." Yerba Santa is an evergreen aromatic shrub with woody rhizomes, typically growing to a height of 3 to 4 feet (1 m +) The dark green, leathery leaves are oblong to lanceolate and covered with shiny resin. They grow in an alternate arrangement and are pinnately veined and usually serrate. The taste of the leaves is balsamic and the flowers and leaves smell pleasantly aromatic on a warm day.</p>
<p>Yerba Santa is native to the western and southwestern regions of North America, and is somewhat native to northern Mexico. It grows 2-6 feet in height at elevations ranging from 2000 to 3,500 ft. It is typically found in dry areas that are sparse of other vegetation. The flowers are a delicate whitish-lavender color, found in curved tubular clusters (helicoid cymes) at the top of the plant, and are pollinated by butterflies. Yerba Santa blooms from May to July, depending on the elevation. The fruit forms a grayish-brown seed capsule, oval in shape, which contains hardened black seeds.</p>
<p>Yerba Santa is an exceptional member of the Waterleaf Family (Hydrophyllaceae) which also contains Phacelia, Baby Blue Eyes and Fiesta Flower. Most of these family members grow in cool, moist habitats, indicating a strong relationship to the watery element. Yerba Santa also has a relationship with water, although in an opposite way. With its tough, resinous leaves, it holds and conserves its water from the inside to meet the intense fire of its environment. This quality helps us to understand the medicinal use of Yerba Santa as a regulator of the water element. Yerba Santa coats the mucous membranes and holds the aqueous component in contact with the cells, reestablishing mucopolysaccharides. As such, it is an excellent herbal remedy for chronic respiratory ailments, used as an expectorant used to treat coughs and congestion, as well as aiding in loosening and expelling phlegm. It dilates bronchial tubes, and thus is used to ease asthma and allergy attacks. A tea, tincture or syrup is typically made from the leaves, sometimes including the flowers, or as a smoke from the leaves.</p>

<p>Khalid Al-Mash'al (12)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mash’al was appointed the new leader of Hamas on March 24, 2004, shortly after Yassin’s death, but he remained in semi-hiding in Damascus. He promptly re-affirmed Hamas’ central tenet, the destruction of Israel via a holy war.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Al-Mash'al was born in 1956 in the village of Silwan, near East Jerusalem, then under Jordanian rule. Following the 1967 war, when Silwan came under Israeli sovereignty, Al-Mash'al and his family moved to Kuwait to join his father, who had gone there for employment several years earlier., where al-Mash’al completed his education. Like all of the Hamas founders, Al-Mash'al was initially a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was active in Brotherhood agitation in Kuwait. Following the expulsion of all Palestinians as retribution for their support of Saddam Hussein's 1990 conquest of Kuwait, Al-Mash'al and his family left for Jordan.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon his arrival there in 1990, Al-Mash'al assumed responsibility for the international fundraising efforts of Hamas at the organization's office in Amman. After the arrest of Abu Marzuq in 1995, the fifty-member Hamas Consultative Council, or Shura, elected Al-Mash'al chairman of the Political Bureau. Al-Mash'al also assumed responsibility for the terror activities of the 'Iz Ad-Din Al- Qassam Brigades, which were relocated to Hamas offices in Amman, Jordan, in 1995.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From 1992 until 1999, Al-Mash'al led the Political Bureau from Amman, Jordan. He and three other Hamas representatives were expelled from Jordan on August 31, 1999, and from then until 2001 Al-Mash'al divided his time between Qatar, and Syria. Since 2001, Al-Mash'al has directed the organization's activities from Hamas offices located in Damascus</p>

<p>The World Currency Unit is an indexed unit of account that stands for a unit of stable global purchasing power. Proposed by Ho(2000), it was first intended to be the basis for denominating global bonds, a debt instrument that is issued globally and subscribable by people around the world. Since each unit by design represents a stable unit of purchasing power, the stipulated interest rate on WCU-denominated bonds represents a real interest rate. In principle, the common denomination of bonds using the WCU will produce more efficient capital markets, as savers and borrowers converge in their understanding of what each basis point of interest means.</p>
<p>Irving Fisher in his 1911 book The Purchasing Power of Money had advised that to serve as a unit of account, a trusted medium of exchange, and a reliable store of value the purchasing power of money should be stable. Unfortunately, substances that exist by the bounty of nature, such as gold or silver, cannot have such property since their values fluctuate with changing supply and demand.</p>
<p>To be meaningful in terms of stable global purchasing power, a WCU will have to represent a basket of global output. By definition, the WCU represents the sum of the gross domestic products of key market economies in the world, namely the US, the Euro zone and UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Addition of these GDPs, each in a separate currency, is done by converting all GDPs into US dollar values in the base year.</p>
<p>The sum of these GDPs are then scaled down to equal $100 in the base year. The scaling factor then becomes part of the definition of the WCU, as it defines the size of the GDP basket.</p>
<p>The nominal value of this unit will rise with inflation in each economy. Moreover, the nominal value of this unit will rise if the base currency appreciates against the US dollar. Savers who purchase such bonds not only enjoy protection against inflation, but the benefit of diversification of exchange risks.</p>

<p>In the United States, a demand draft is a check created by a seller with a buyers checking account number on it, but instead of the buyers signature, it has verbage such as "authorized by depositor (the buyer), lack of endorsement garunteed by XYZ Bank". The seller deposits the check into his bank account, which then clears out of the buyers account. Since there is a huge potential for fraud, and becuase the buyer has a three year or longer time frame to dispute the transactions, most banks will only allow larger companies with security collateral to deposit demand drafts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a great deal of fraud commited by using demand drafts, with some bank industry professionals alleging that more often then not a demand draft is fraudulent.</p>
<p>Demand draft fraud is often frustrating for consumers, because unlike credit card disputes, consumers aren't often given any funds back until after investigation finds that the draft was unauthorized. In addition, to file a dispute many times requires a notarized signature, since this is the only way one bank can dispute a paper item with another bank. Unauthorized demand drats create losses for the bank to, because often is it not worth the effort to actually attempt to get the money back from the other bank, and instead banks will simply pay their customers amounts up to five hundred dollars out of their own pocket. This encourages scammers as they get to keep the money, and aren't yet discovered.</p>

<p>Best known as an entertainment journalist for such magazines as Femme Fatales, Cinefantastique, The Dark Side, Film Threat and Sirens of Cinema (for which he took over as editor in 2005), Watt is also a screenwriter and director, active in the Independent horror movie industry.</p>
<p>An exceptional student throughout high school and college, he was often a social outsider due to his eccentric personality. An avid reader, he started writing short fiction at an early age, and wrote four novels in long hand during his classes. The first of these novels, <i>The Adventures of Rune</i>, a parody of science fiction epics, was polished and published as an e-book in 1995.</p>
<p>He came into his element during his early college years, studying theater and creative writing at the Community College of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh. It was during this period that he joined a local cast of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_04d4.html" title="The Rocky Horror Picture Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, where he met many of his closest friends, including his future wife, Amy Lynn Best, his future business partner, Bill Homan, and filmmaker Justin Wingenfeld.</p>
<p>In 1993, he enrolled at Pittsburgh Filmmakers, through Point Park University, where he began to pursue his first love, film. Though enthusiastic for the art, and despite limited prowess as an animator, he judged himself to be a mediocre filmmaker at first, and determined that he was technically insufficient to make movies on his own. In desperation, he gave himself his senior year to improve. With Best’s invaluable help as an actress and a producer, he wrote and directed a haunted house short, <i>Tenants</i>, intending it to be his senior thesis film (which he had to make in order to graduate). Basically a low-rent reworking of Robert Wise’s version of <i>The Haunting</i>, it stood out at a time when most of his fellow classmates were aspiring to be the next <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Smith_0957.html" title="Kevin Smith">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quentin_Tarantino_858b.html" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>. The movie received an A, allowing him to graduate with a BFA in "Film and Video Production".</p>
<p>Within six months of graduation, Watt entered the movie into the first "B-Movie Film Festival", held in Syracuse, NY, by Salt City Video owner, Ron Bonk. The movie was accepted and was later bought for distribution on the anthology <i>The Cutting Edge</i>. Later, it was added onto Paul Talbot's <i>Campfire Tales</i> DVD, the main title of which Watt provided the audio commentary as a "film scholar".</p>
<p>In 1997, Watt, Best and Homan formed Happy Cloud Pictures in order to produce their first feature-length film, <i>The Resurrection Game</i>. They shot the movie on 16mm over a period of two years, though it would take until 2005 for the trio to fully complete the movie. Within a few weeks of completion, it won "Best Production" in the "Pittsburgh Film Workers Film Festival".</p>
<p>Prior to shooting <i>The Resurrection Game</i>, Watt was further honing his craft as a writer. He had two one-act plays produced by Pittsburgh theater companies and a third won an international competition and was staged in California. They were, respectively, the anti-war satire <i>PFC Everyman</i>; the disturbing comedy <i>So Nice to Have the Family Together Again</i> and <i>Who Speaks for the Non-Existent?</i>. He also found himself on the writing staff for GC Magazine, Femme Fatales and Cinefantastique, where he worked as an entertainment journalist, interviewing such luminaries as <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Gaiman_bd49.html" title="Neil Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Barker_c378.html" title="Clive Barker">Clive Barker</a> and the late <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Wishman_4938.html" title="Doris Wishman">Doris Wishman</a>. It was through these magazines that he became friends with actress/producer <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Rochon_1107.html" title="Debbie Rochon">Debbie Rochon</a>, who gracious agreed to make a cameo in <i>The Resurrection Game</i>.</p>
<p>Watt primarily served Happy Cloud Pictures as a screenwriter, cameraman and editor, feeling that his directing skills were still too underdeveloped. He handed over the bulk of the directing duties to Best (who he married in 1999), and wrote her directorial debut movies, <i>Were-Grrl</i> and <i>Severe Injuries</i>.</p>
<p>In 2005, Watt found his greatest level of success, selling the screenplay <i>Dead Men Walking</i> to the LA-based company The Asylum. Later that year he became editor of <i>Sirens of Cinema Magazine</i> and wrote the original screenplay for <i>24 Frames Per Slaughter</i>, the movie that would become the debut film of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Romero_c99e.html" title="George Romero">George Romero</a>'s oldest son, G. Cameron Romero (a.k.a. <i>The Screening</i>).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-24_8842.html" title="Edit section: Music Population Project">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music Population Project</span></h2>
<p>The Music Population Project is an effort to bring chamber music back to the people, invoking times when performances were public spectacles, when operas were performed in front of enthusiastic audiences, when uprisings followed premieres and classical music was pop music.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, classical music has become far removed from its origins. The MPP liberates chamber music from the concert hall, breaking through boundaries to make chamber music accessible to new audiences by offering a series of concerts in clubs, bars and non-traditional venues. At the same time, the MPP encourages a community of composers to write music for chamber ensembles that reflects our era.</p>
<p>The MPP embraces a sustainable model for promoting and performing chamber music, proposing a new way to present concerts without the economic restrictions of a large orchestra or concert hall. Musicians are equipped with a means of creating new ensembles and performing concerts. Venues are no longer limited to formal concert halls and school auditoriums. Performances are given based on a system of donation akin to open source software. The MPP provides music as a gift, not a product, resulting in a fruitful exchange between composers, musicians and audiences. By creating dynamic systems to initiate concerts and allow musicians and composers to connect, the MPP helps to ensure that the chamber music community will continue to flourish.</p>
<p>thempp.com provides a virtual hub where musicians and composers can connect, participate in community forums, share works in progress and find opportunities to collaborate. MPP concerts are documented through audio, video and photography that are available for download. The MPP also encourages others to present concerts in their own cities, providing a place for visitors to download scores, concert posters and promotional materials. The site also allows concert organizers to upload documentation of MPP concerts on the web.</p>
<p>The MPP germinated in Portland, Oregon under the direction of Brede Rørstad, working closely with the Music Population Orchestra, a chamber music ensemble created to fulfill the mission of The MPP. Looking back the his native Norway for inspiration, Rørstad combines classical and electronic influences in what he deems klatronic compositions for chamber ensembles, commercials and short films. Rørstad is currently working on bringing the MPP to Europe, establishing an Oslo-based Music Population Orchestra.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ontario's newspapers contained some details about <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hydro_9c08.html" title="Ontario Hydro">Ontario Hydro</a>'s massive 4-volume study under the title "Balance of Power"; I am looking at page A9 of the April 16, 1990 issue of THE GLOBE AND MAIL. Public Information Centres were set up under the Environmental Assessment Act, 1980, and a graph shows the expected gap between the available electricity power in Gigawatts (GW) up to 2014, if no new power sources are supplied, and the expected electricity demand.</li>
<li>A letter (enclosed with the 4-volume set?) by Chris Taylor of the Public Relations Division, dated February, 1990, mentions a public feedback program during the first six months of 1990.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the 1990s Ontario as well as other parts of the world experienced an economic slowdown, which very likely was the reason why at that time the recommendations of this study were, as I understand it, ignored.</li>
<li>The current request for public comments does not mention that earlier study.</li>

<p>Radio personality Producer Laura was born Laura Heywood, in Oakland, CA. She grew up with plans to be an actress, appearing in commercials and print advertisements for products such as Nintendo, TIME Magazine, Apple Computers, and GTE. She entered college at the University of Puget Sound in 1997 on an acting scholarship, but quickly re-focused her attention to campus radio station KUPS. She became an on-air host of several shows and was hired as General Manager in the fall of 2000. During her college years, she also honed her radio chops with summer internships with KFRC FM and the Sarah &amp; Vinnie Morning show at KLLC (Alice@97.3) in San Francisco.</p>
<p>After graduating from UPS in 2001, Laura moved back to California and immediately went to work as the interim Morning Show Producer for the Gene &amp; Julie Show at KZQZ (Z95.7 FM). This proved to be the perfect kickstart to a successful career in San Francisco radio.</p>
<p>Laura started off 2002 as an assistant producer for the John London Not Just Sports Show on KNBR 680 AM. In no time, Laura became a fun and controversial part of the on-air staff, titillating the audience by arguing with John &amp; the guys about politics and sexuality. She quickly gained a fan following that made her an in-demand presence at station events.</p>
<p>While working at KNBR, Laura filled her schedule with many additional radio projects, including producing pre- and post-game broadcasts for Giants Baseball; hosting a weekend show at hip-hop station KWIN and a night show on light rock station KJOY; working on the production team for NFL game broadcasts; and launching a successful side career as a voice-over artist.</p>
<p>After two years with the John London Not Just Sports Show, Laura joined the staff at sister station 107.7 The Bone (KSAN), where she worked as the producer of the Lamont &amp; Tonelli show as well as hosting the mid-day show. She continued to be extremely popular at live appearances, channeling that popularity into successful fundraising for various charities. She was also featured on a line of Laura Heywood merchandise including t-shirts, panties, lunch boxes, and Christmas ornaments.</p>
<p>In August of 2004, Laura was cast in a high-profile television commercial series for Dove Shampoo as part of the Campaign for Real Beauty. A long form version of the campaign can be seen at <a href="http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779" class="external free" title="http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779" rel="nofollow">http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/scrollpage.asp?url=special_events.asp&amp;;id=1779</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of that year, Laura left Susquehanna Broadcasting (the home of KNBR &amp; The Bone) and made the move to New York City, where she was hired by Sirius Satellite Radio as the producer for The Bower Show on the newly formed Maxim Radio. There, she was given the moniker “Producer Laura” and gained an international fan-base.</p>
<p>Laura continues as the producer and co-host of The Bower Show. Listeners love her ability to simultaneously be one of the guys (she takes charge of sports updates, and can chug a beer like a champ), but also flaunt her sexy side, with frequent references to her buxom frame and the popular contest “Pick Laura’s Panties”.</p>
<p>She is having the time of her life in New York, but hopes to someday return to the Bay Area to raise a family.</p>

Introduction</p>
<p>If you were to see a dolphin you would believe it was a fish because it lives in the water, it’s streamlined like a fish, but it is not a fish. It is an air breather, it doesn’t have gills, it’s warm blooded, it gives birth to live young and it nurses it’s young. It is called a mammal. Dolphins are in the order cetacean in the family delphinine. There are many myths about dolphins: how they pulled Poseidon’s chariot, about how they came to be, how they became intelligent, and how they saved important people and received rewards. People love dolphins either because of their ever-smiling faces, their incredible agility in shows or the beautiful way they swim. There are still many stories about dolphins, about what they can do and what they cannot. Many of the stories are unrealistic or just wishful thinking. I have a personal interest in dolphins because my mother was a dolphin trainer and I have been hearing about them for a long time. In this I will tell you a lot about specifically Atlantic Bottle Nosed dolphins. I hope this report will tell you the facts about dolphins and what part they play in the world.</p>
<p>Behavior</p>
<p>Dolphins develop strong social bonds with the other members of their group also called a pod. Dolphins may play together with objects such as seaweed. They may aid another dolphin if it is hurt or sick. If another dolphin is drowning they will support its blowhole above the water so it can breathe. They also keep to the strategy of “Safety in Numbers” which is staying together so a predator cannot pick them off one by one. They have been seen jumping almost five meters out of the water and landing on their sides or backs, this is called breaching. I think this behavior is a form of fun. Dolphins have been seen riding on the bow waves or the wake of boats. I also think this is a form of fun. They also may join with a different pod for a short while. Two or three adult males may pass from pod to pod together. Each dolphin has a unique combination of sounds that it makes to identify itself, almost like a name. This sound is called a “signature whistle.” A calf will repeatedly call out its signature whistle if it is lost from its mother so the mother can identify the calf. It is not known if the calf gives it self its signature whistle or if the mother gives it. Dolphins seem to have a sense of humor; they have been seen sneaking behind a pelican and snapping at its tail feathers, grabbing fish by their tail and turning slow turtles over and over in the water. Dolphins, many people think, have a language or at least series of sounds and movements used to express themselves. A tail slap may show annoyance or a warning of danger to other dolphins. Snapping the mouth at another animal may be a sign of aggression. Gently touching with a flipper may be a sign of love or calming. Head butting is definitely an aggressive movement along with dragging teeth across a body and biting. Sometimes mothers and calves may join together in nursery groups so they can protect each-other. Dolphins will circle around the young or weak to protect them if they are threatened.</p>
<p>Enemies and Dangers</p>
<p>Sharks and killer whales are dolphins’ biggest natural enemy, and dolphins have been seen attacking them. Humans are the biggest danger of all; dolphins have been killed for meat, leather and oil. Pollution, boat traffic, habitat destruction and fishers taking their food also affect them. Dolphins are caught in fishing nets and drowned.</p>
<p>Hunting and eating</p>
<p>Dolphins like to hunt on the ocean floor in shallow water. They swallow fish whole and head first. It swallows it headfirst so that the scales will not catch in its throat. They often cooperate when hunting such as trapping fish against a sand bar so they can get them more easily. They stun large fish with their tail flukes so they cannot get away. Sometimes if there is a fish hiding in the sand they will dig it out with their snouts (or beaks.) If a fish is too large to swallow they will rub it roughly on the ocean floor to break it into smaller pieces. Dolphins eat fish, shrimps, and squid. The specific kind of food it eats depends on where it lives. They get their water from the fish they eat. A full-grown bottlenose dolphin may eat up to twenty-two pounds of food each day. This is about four to five percent of its body weight. A nursing mother eats about eight percent of her body weight so the milk will have more nutrients for the calf.</p>
<p>Range</p>
<p>Dolphins are found everywhere in the world including harbors, bays, lagoons, and gulfs. The size of the pod seems to increase with water depth and openness of habitat. It also depends on where the pod lives. Some pods have home ranges which is an area that the dolphins will not leave, (the home ranges may overlap.) Variations in water temperature and migrations of fish may cause dolphins to migrate.</p>
<p>Intelligence</p>
<p>Dolphins are proven to be self aware. An experiment was conducted proving this where there was a camera showing the dolphin on a screen that the dolphin could see, the dolphin admired and ‘made faces’ at itself. When given memory tests dolphins most of the times remember what they are supposed to be remembering. People often believe that dolphins think like a human which is probably wrong because they live in a different environment and have different needs. They are similar in some ways. Mothers teach their calves how to behave around other dolphins. An example of this is; if the calf spends too much time around another dolphin and the dolphin begins to show signs of annoyance the mother will gently nudge or slap her tail at the calf. Dolphins may trick either their trainer or another dolphin or both into getting what they want. Martha Hiatt from the Wildlife Conservation Society gave me a personal experience of this via e-mail; in the cold weather there were bubbles around the two dolphin tanks of an aquarium making it warmer inside the pool. The two pools were connected. The dolphins’ trainer, Miss Hiatt, gave them long rubs that were called rubdowns that the dolphins loved. If one dolphin was getting a rubdown one of the dolphins would try to nudge the other dolphin out of the way so it could get the rubdown instead of the other dolphin. One day when their trainer was giving them rubdowns in pool number one a dolphin named Lily started making a racket in pool number two. The dolphins getting the rubdown ignored her. Then she screamed louder so the dolphins came over to pool number two because they were curious about what was wrong. Once they had come over Lily raced in front of their trainer to get the rubdown. Miss Hiatt gave me another example of this; the dolphins’ trainers gave the dolphins a fish if they brought garbage out of the pool because they might get sick from it. One dolphin took one piece of trash and stuck it in a pipe. So whenever the trainer called for a piece of trash the dolphin would take a piece of the trash stuck in the pipe and gave the piece to the trainer so he got not one fish but about ten for each piece of it.</p>
<p>Reproduction</p>
<p>Dolphins mate for a short time. The males fight over who will mate with each of the females. In the end the dominant males get to mate with the female. As I have said the adult males move from pod to pod. Worldwide, calves are born through out the year. A mother may bear a calf every two years. A mother is pregnant for about ten to sixteen months. She usually can only bear one calf at a time. Calves are born tail first. The mother and another female called the “auntie” gently push the calf to the surface so it can take its first breath. When a calf is born it is about ninety to130 centimeters long, and its dorsal fins tail and flukes are flabby and flexible. A calf nurses three to eight times a day under water close to the surface. Each nurse lasts only about five to ten seconds. While the calf is nursing the mother swims slowly. As the calf nurses the mother squirts the milk out very quickly reducing the calf’s time under water. Dolphin milk has ten times the amount of calories of cow’s milk. A calf may nurse for up to eighteen months. The bonds between mother and calf are very strong. Experienced mothers seem to know how to care for their young better then first time mothers showing that they learn how to mother. A mother dolphin will whistle its signature whistle a few days after the calf is born repeatedly so the calf will get used to the sound.</p>
<p>Senses</p>
<p>Dolphins have a very good sense of hearing. Its ears are inside of its head, there is a small opening leading to the ear. The inner ear is encased in a bone called the auditory bulla. Dolphins have good hearing in and out of water. Dolphins have a well-developed high-end sense of touch. Dolphins have good eyesight in and out of water. Scientists who examined dolphins’ brains could not find the section of the brain and nerves used for smelling, indicating that dolphins have barely any, and probably no sense of smell. Dolphins probably have an underdeveloped sense of taste because they do not need it because they swallow their food whole, but they do have taste-buds and they have preferences for certain kinds of food. Echolocation is when an animal shoots sound waves out, they pass through the melon and they bounce back off of in this case the fish’s swim bladder showing the animal where, what, the shape and the size of the fish it is tracking. Echolocation is very important for dolphins to survive because they use it to find food, avoid predators, and to find other dolphins. For dolphins the sound waves have to go through the melon. The melon is a fatty organ in the dolphin’s forehead that looks like a melon.</p>
<p>Structure</p>
<p>Dolphins are shaped like torpedoes to move through the water quickly. Full-grown bottlenose adult males called bulls are six to twelve feet in length. Full-grown bottlenose adult females called cows are a bit smaller then bulls. Their beak is about three inches. They have a dorsal fin twelve to twenty inches tall. Dolphins have bones that look somewhat like a human hand in their flippers.</p>
<p>The lobes on their tail called tail flukes and their dorsal fin has no bones at all. The dorsal fin will act as a keel or stabilizer for balance. Dolphins have a thick layer of fat called blubber that keeps the dolphin warm, acts as a storage place for food and keeps them afloat. Dolphins have a bit of hair around their blow holes. You can estimate a dolphin’s age by the number of rings it has on the inside of its teeth.</p>
<p>Fun Facts The top speed a dolphin can swim is forty miles-per-hour. Dolphins can jump over twenty feet out of the water. Dolphins like to stay in shallow water but can dive to about 1800 feet. Dolphins do not have to come all the way above the surface to breathe; they can just poke their blowhole above the water to breathe. They swim by moving the back part of their body up and down. Dolphins turn and make sudden stops by using their flippers. Dolphins spend one-third of their day sleeping one-third eating and one-third playing and socializing.</p>
<p>Evolution</p>
<p>Dolphin’s ancestors are said to have once lived on land 50,000,000 years ago. Two rod shaped bones buried deep in the muscle which have no purpose are thought to be remnants of a pelvic bone which is a bone that supports the hind legs showing that it might have had hind legs. The animal is thought to have looked like a wolf with hooves. It is believed by scientists that a common ancestor relates dolphins, porpoises and whales.</p>
<p>Species</p>
<p>Dolphins are not endangered; but pollution is killing them in some areas. There are at least 123,700 bottlenose dolphins in the world; but the exact population is not known. Scientists say that there are about fifty different species of dolphins. Dolphins have lived up to sixty years in the wild but they live on average twenty years.</p>
<p>Captivity Many people think that dolphins should not be held captive and trained in shows because they are wild animals. People also believe they are meant to be out in open water because walls mess up their echolocation. They also cannot swim quickly like they are supposed to because of the walls around the tank.</p>
<p>Conclusion I have learned many interesting things about dolphins which cause me to look at them a different way: they are not those cute little things that always smile. They are wild animals and they will do anything they can to survive and may attack humans if they are frightened. The captive ones are also, I must say, very cute, easy going and friendly. The things I have found researching them are very interesting to me; things I did not know. I hope you have gotten a full picture of how they do things, what they do, and what the heck they are.</p>

<p><i>Main article: Education in Bahrain</i></p>
<p>Numerous international educational institutions and schools have established links to Bahrain. One prominent institution is <a href="../../../d/e/p/DePaul_University_8e39.html" title="DePaul University">DePaul University</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Quranic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain at the beginning of the 20th century. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>. Many people of Bahrain had felt that this type of education did not fulfil the academic efficiency that match with the spirit of age. After the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, things changed and Bahrain became widely open upon the modern western renaissance. Political and social changes have occurred in the country that caused the rise of social and cultural awareness among people.</p>
<p>Due to all these, a demand for modern educational institutions different from (Kuttab) has appeared in terms of system, curricula and objectives.</p>
<p>1919 marked the beginning of modern public school system in Bahrain. Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia school for boys was opened in Muharraq. In 1926, the Education Committee had opened the second public school for boys in Manama.</p>
<p>In 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq.</p>
<p>The first institution of higher education in Bahrain, the Gulf Polytechnic, was accomplished in 1968 as the Gulf Technical College. In 1986 Gulf Polytechnic merged with the University College of Art, Science, and Education (UCB), founded in 1979, to create the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bahrain_1a81.html" title="University of Bahrain">University of Bahrain</a>, a national university offering bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees.</p>
