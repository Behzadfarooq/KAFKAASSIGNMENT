<li>This, and the preceding identical complaint, have some basis in the rough language used. But the rough language does not rise to the level of personal attacks, and thus does not justify Dr. Ali's changing of signed contribs under our "remove personal attacks" policy. In fact, IMO even personal attacks would not justify any change other than to
<ul>
<li><b>Del</b>. [Reason given entails a personal attack, and has been removed pending its author's restatement of their reason for their vote]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And IMO the time-stamped sig of the user making the excision should be appended, with notations that clearly distinguish which is the exciser's sig and which the intact sig of the voter. (The purpose of VfD is voting, so votes and their sigs must be left clear; an entry with a sig states that the words are those of the signer, so changing them and leaving the sig is forgery.) As to the etiquette aspects, VfD work is onerous, and IMO those who do it regularly (more regularly than i!) deserve some slack when they try to relieve the drone with some purple prose, as long as personal attacks are avoided. "Horrid" and "Worthless ... rubbish" are value judgements, and VfD can't be done without value judgements; my harshest criticism would be that quality is primarily a question for cleanup, and low quality per se is not a ground for VfD. Quality should not be complained about, IMO, without at least lip service to the issue of whether the low quality (in terms of WP's standards of what an article should be and do) is irremediable bcz it is inherant in the concept of the article. But a vote is a vote in any case; it stands despite any bad etiquette, and the remeid is in the hands of the result-caller for this VfD, who is encouraged to take quality of arguments into account, and may slight a vote for low quality of the reasoning, just as they may discard a registered user's vote for apparent sock-puppethood, and should normally discard IP votes (tho listening to IP arguments).</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand. Merely including a URL isn't advertising â€” having an article that consists of almost nothing but a URL is, or more generally, an article with information coming only from one source, which happens to be the subject. I agree that some votes could be worded more tactfully. Finally: arguments of the form "we have this and therefore we should have this" are not valid; we can't be everywhere at once. Maybe some of those articles should indeed be deleted â€” or expanded. Unless some of them went through VfD already and created precedent, that has no bearing on this particular vote. Present version is moderately better than the original, if not by much. Giving verifiability the benefit of the doubt in the presence of contributors, and given that I don't vote on notability, I'm <b>abstain</b>ing. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 20:58, 2005 Jan 2 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The good news; the article has some content now, and it looks like the original author, or a friend, has signed up as <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbrahams_c48b.html" title="User:Abrahams">User:Abrahams</a> (by the way those images need GFDL or similar copyright tags to avoid deletion). From comments on the article's talk page I was half way convinced that this artist might be notable and despite a shakey start the article could become useful. The bad news; I've been persuaded to do some digging and I can find no evidence of notability. In a Google search on 'Marco of Alexandria', the top three results are all self authored gallery pages - for a notable artist you should be able to find at least one independent reference. www.artfacts.net tends to be pretty inclusive and has plenty of Marco's but no results for Alexandria, similarly www.artcyclopedia.com. The list of international collectors was plausible, but really these could all just be friends from college. The editing behaviour of a number of anon users with very similar IPs doesn't help. I don't know, but without some independent evidence of notability, I'm going to have to go with 'delete'. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 19:15, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Anyway, it up to all of you really to make this a Real online Encyclopedia where you can find info About Any REAL entity or just a weak copy of britannica. I will not talk about this again neither me or any of my college friends!! We were all very excited about this new resource we discovered, but it seems that it isnt a resource after all and that it only serves the purpose of a FEW people, God know for what vested interest! How can friends from college exist in different countries, be of different ages, and have completely different careers!!!!!??? Give me a break Puleeeeeeeez! ...

<li>I checked artfacts.com and it is nothing like wikipedia and does not provide FREE INFORMATION for the sake of Information. No, it is a sponsored site, sponsored by the galleries that are listed on its pages and its main purpose is to promote the works owned by those galleries, and that is why when you check someone like Picasso, you will find that they only show a few unknown pieces of his, simply because there are the pieces available for sale in the sponsoring galleries. They also rank artists according to their value to them!! i.e. which artists have more work shown in sponsoring galleries and thus more dollars into artfacts.com's pockets. The site immediately lost its credibility when i discovered that they didnt rank Vincent Van Gogh among the TOP 100 Artists!!!! but the answer was clear there were only 3 pieces in the sponsoring galleries. I don't think Wikipedia could use such a commercial site to judge who is a notable artist and who is not! <s>Keep</s> 62.114.188.45 04:14, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The last 3 votes include a dialogue which would be more comprehensible if the two replies were indented below the vote they are responding to. (And the votes made as separate single-bullet points, of course.) Rick's argument is not fully developed, but i think i grasp his drift, and i agree: the abusive and even dishonest tactics of the supporters betray insecurity about the unvarnished facts carrying the day.

</li>
<li>Borderline <b>Delete</b>. As far as I can understand, notability is the issue here. Progress towards establishing notability on the article's talk page has not satisfied me that the artist is notable: I would like to see further proof (ie references) to show the artist's notability. I managed to find <a href="http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html</a> but I don't see why one single exhibition renders an artist worthy of an article. The quote don't add much to the article in my opinion either. I have to say that the heated anonymous keep comments (which approach flaming) here do not help the case to keep. If the article is to be kept it needs NPOVing, expansion, distancing from the artist and further proof of notability ie with references. Having said that, the artist might be notable (at least from his own website). But this VfD discussion is about the article and in it's current state I am not satisfied that is is suitable for inclusion.

<li>Perhaps you would have more success in establishing notability via the internet if you understood Arabic. Or perhaps an artist from a developing country doesn't need to have the same web presence as an American artist to be notable. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 13:18, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I accept that might be true; perhaps you might like to provide links to Arabic sites for the purpose of verification/translations rather than nebulous assertions. Perhaps you might even agree to translate them for us or you could put them up for translation. I agree that web presence is not always proportional to notability however in my experience the two are directly proportional. Are there any books which mention Marco's art? If so, why don't we have ISBNs/titles/authors? That would help the keep case somewhat. Printed literature? Newspapers/art journals? Having said that, web presence is not the only thing that I am basing my delete vote on. Just because one company buys someone's art does not make them notable. Example: my friend's mum paints as a hobby and has been bought by BHP Billiton amongst others. Does that make her notable? No. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrox_0da4.html" title="User:Grox">Grox</a> 11:32, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know Arabic. I was not intending to make "nebulous assertions" but what I thought were quite significant points about the difference between developed/English speaking World articles and other articles. There are some people on here who seem to think that not being famous in America makes someone not notable. This guy is an established professional artist. IMO that makes him at least as notable as some actor in a trashy TV series that a few hundred thousand people watch. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 03:28, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your point about Wikipedia's English-speaking world bias is not a new one. I accept it as valid. A least the keep vote lobby could provide real proof that he is notable - even if it isn't online or in English. I do not accept that just being an "established professional artist" makes one notable. The people who chalk up pavements with beautiful pictures in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> are by your standard "established professional artists" but this does not make them notable or deserving of a Wikipedia entry. I for one will change my vote to keep if proof of notability is provided. <i>[Sig omitted by Grox, 03:54, 2005 Jan 7, as noted by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 05:55, 2005 Jan 7 (UTC)]</i>

<li><b>I can provide proof of Notability.</b> In The March 2004 issue of Al-Qahira Newspaper (translates to Cairo) which is the Leading (only as far as I know) cultural newspaper in Egypt, there was an article about Marco's one man show which was held in the same March! I dont think the paper is available online, but I could send xerox copies of the one I have to anyone who is interested.

Yet a Fictionous Character like Kramer is Notable and occupies a whole page on Wikipedia? I mean I love Cosmo, he is the only character on Seinfeld that makes me laugh; but Guess What?!!?

<li>I'd like to point out the fallacy of arguing that purchases by a major corporation (<i>with a market capitalisation of nearly $40 billion</i>, no less) says anything about this artist. Corporations will buy anything to put on the walls; indeed, the larger the art budget the more likely that they'll sweep up something truly insignificant.

<li>I doubt that BAT sends its staff wandering through the back streets and garrets of third world countries in order to "sweep up" bad art for their boardrooms.

<li>In real estate the rule is "there's no such thing as an unsaleable house, there are just overpriced houses." Although there <i>is</i> such a thing as unsalable art, the ability to sell your art if the price goes low enough does not make you notable. Especially since, as Rick notes, art is today a commodity where size and dominant color relative to the rest of the planned decor can easily trump artistic merit. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 10:46, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Actually I came here and started browsing Egypt sites and doing searches on names of Egyptian Towns, historical figures and contemporary artists! I did a search on Marco and was really glad I found him and then I was shocked that some people voted to delete his page!! I really don't understand why or what those people mean by Vanity!!!!!!!!! I see no vanity in that page, just neutral information about the Artist which is all accurate to the best of my knowledge. In fact after my vote I will try to refine the article a bit more, as I think that I might know another fact about Marco that isn't written in the article.

<li><b>Del</b>. May be, or turn into, a notable artist, but the standard is verifiability, and by no means "the benefit of the doubt" or a begged-for "break". If you can't prove it in a language we can easily get translated, your recourse is to work toward publicity in the languages we can use for verification.

<li>This <i>is</i> a global encyclopedia. Everyone owes it to WP to use its resources in a reasonable way, or go start their own project with their own resources. Our monetary resources are limited, but generally adequate to cover our hardware needs and unable to cover hired personnel. Because en: is a volunteer English-language 'pedia, its human resources are generous in the line of English-speaking editors, limited in editors bilingual in English and the languages of industrialized countries, and near zero in editors bilingual in English and the languages of less-developed countries.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>WP is worthless if we don't limit our content to what is verifiable. That combined with our human-resource mix enforces some degree of undercoverage on our contents. If people who have skills we are short in don't want to provide them, that doesn't make them bad people. But people who want us to sacrifice verifiability in order to reduce undercoverage by sacrificing our verifiability criteria are doomed to frustration.</dd>
