<p><s><b>Delete.</b> There are multiple concerns regarding this article:</s></p>
<ol>
<li><s>If you remove the lists of rankings (which are duplicated from the <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/rankings/mba/rankings.html" class="external text" title="http://rankings.ft.com/rankings/mba/rankings.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Financial Times</i> web site</a>), you're left with a nearly verbatim copy of the Rankings section in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> article. This seems like needless duplication.</s></li>
<li><s>The prose contradicts need for ranked lists of schools within the article.</s></li>
<li><s>Wikipedia isn't a place to promote the opinions (i.e. rankings) of one source. The original <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article already provides external links to online MBA rankings from multiple sources, including from <i>Financial Times</i>.</s></li>
<li><s>The prose already fits well in the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article and doesn't really need expanding. It hardly seems worth creating a whole new article around this section, if the only purpose is to regurgitate (and maintain) annual rankings already available online. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 22:15, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Withdrawn</b> per recommendation below.</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>, inherently non-NPOV. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fine with <b>merge</b> without the actual rankings (as edited). <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 21:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> <s><b>Keep</b></s> as acceptable content fork (i.e. not a POV fork). The topic itself is certainly notable, pages and pages have been filled about the MBA rankings controversy, and it isn't really central to the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article, which should be about the degree itself. So I propose to remove most of the text on rankings from the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article and post it here. Btw, I removed the rankings as copyvios. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I thought of that too before I proposed this AfD, but after much thought I felt that the MBA Ranking section's short length wasn't worth its own separate article. It fits better with the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article because anyone looking for MBA ranking information would first look for it there. You're correct that much has been written about this topic, but it's sufficient and proper for such a volume of information to be referenced as citations (which has already been done) rather than expand the article to duplicate what's already written elsewhere. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 23:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure enough. I guess a <b>redirect</b> would serve this purpose better then. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> back to <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a>. <s><b>Abstain</b> for the moment.</s> (Also I changed "keep" above to "redirect" per <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> latest comment.) I'm the author of the original text about rankings in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> article. I admit it bothered me to see my work copied and pasted to a new <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article and then slanted to favor <i>Financial Times</i>. I had considered creating a different article myself, but in the end I decided the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article was a better fit, for reasons described by others above. On the other hand, I don't object to the existence of the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article. I <i>do</i> object to having near-verbatim paragraphs in two places; one of them must go. I presently lean toward keeping it in the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article and redirecting <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> to it as trialsanderrors suggests. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 14:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree it should be in one spot. I think there are reasons to farm it out, since users searching for "MBA rankings" are probably familiar with the general info on the degree and are looking for specific information. As long as the article provides an encyclopedic rundown of the topic we should be home free. I also suggest withdrawing this nomination and leave the decision up to the editors of the article. I don't see an actual rationale for deletion. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Points #1 and #4 in the nomination can be interpreted to support redirection. And there's no reason why a redirect link can't redirect to a specific section in another article, e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html#MBA_program_rankings" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration#MBA program rankings</a>. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 14:31, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. It should be on the MBA page, especially since the rankings are so central to the topic. The rankings themselves are in the public domain seem to be <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, however there's a real duty to explain both views of the pros and cons of rankings in themselves, as well as setting schools on a ladder. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">Duncan</a> 08:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rankings are usually copyrighted (there is no need for fair use of they're in the public domain). I think partial explanatory listings of multiple rankings are acceptable, especially if the purpose is educational, e.g. comparison of methods and outcomes. Why is Stanford #1 in ranking A and #37 in ranking B. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm, I thought I addressed that question in the article; those issues are dealt with pretty well in the referenced sources. The primary reasons for differences is that different publications use different populations of schools, and some rankings are based on subjective opinions given in interviews with alumni and hiring managers. I'll re-check and edit as appropriate. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 14:31, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This wasn't a criticism of your edits, just a general comment on when it is appropriate to use the actual rankings in the article from a coipyright law perspective. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay everyone, I'm new at this deletion process, so help me out. This was my first-ever nomination. If the consensus is "redirect" back to <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> (which to me sounds the same as "delete the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article and redirect the title to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a>", then that's simple enough. But how do I witdraw this nomination before it has run its 5-day course? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 18:03, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just strike out the nomination (Using &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;) and write "withdrawn" below it. You can technically also close it yourself but I can take care of it if you're not comfortable with it. There's also a technical difference between "redirect" and "delete and redirect" as in the second case the edit history gets deleted. I don't see a reason for that here though. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
