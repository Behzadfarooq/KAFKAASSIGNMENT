<li><b>Comment</b>: The existing form of the article is certainly not in optimal form and needs pruning and rewriting. On the other hand, I reverted an edit that overrode the entire article content with a mere redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush.html" title="Rush">Rush</a>: there is too much content here to simply throw away, either. Hopefully some middle ground can be found. N.B.: The personal conflict that has existed regarding this article should be completely absent from this discussion. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merging</a> generally involves moving content from one article to another, and redirecting to the merged article.

<li>(1) Preemptively, but if it was unnecessary and proves irrelevant, so much the better. (2) From the prior talkpage discussion, my understanding is that the current content of Rush in popular culture was taken <i>out</i> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush (band)</a> as the result of a discussion on featured article review, and I didn't see any indication that any of it was reinserted when you changed the former article into a redirect. "Merge," of course, is one plausible outcome to this discussion. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

Circumventing Merge intent with a second AfD Nom by the same editor. Contradicting PhilWelch is that during the Rush page's FA review, it was the recommendation to split the Popular Culture into it's own page, and this was done<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture#Question" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture#Question" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Now Phil suggests that it's plagarised from a website, (the website may well have cribbed from wikipedia), and should be merged. I ask that PhilWelch on the article's talk page substantiate his allegation of plagarism, or rescind the allegation, and the resultant AfD, as it's clear from the relevant talk pages [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture" rel="nofollow">Rush in popular culture</a>], and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_%28band%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_%28band%29" rel="nofollow">Rush</a>], that editors are aware of the need for a merge, but all efforts appeared to stop after 11 Dec, when PhilWelch turned the entire page into a redirect. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 23:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The website didn't take it from Wikipedia. The "in popular culture" used Power Windows as a reference from the point the list really began. Besides, even if it was, that further strengthens the reason to delete, because there would be <i>no reliable sources</i>. Not to metion Power Windows isn't technically a reliable source to begin with. And not to mention the site uses direct quotes and other cites that this Wikipedia article does not. â€” <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 00:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I thought I made it clear that it was an obsolete point, because the article's reliability would be weaker if it was a mirror. But if you insist, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=42128887&amp;oldid=42104511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=42128887&amp;oldid=42104511" rel="nofollow">this</a> was when the initial trivia section was added by <a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisdom89_9409.html" title="User:Wisdom89">User:Wisdom89</a>. This was the first time such information was included. The popular culture section was then added by Wisdom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=42233021&amp;oldid=42229570" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=42233021&amp;oldid=42229570" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Several days later, <i>while going through and sourcing his additions</i>, Wisdom89 added the power windows ref: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44143845" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rush_%28band%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44143845" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Furthermore, the Power Windows site has been operational since 1997, as Phil has explained above. But like I said, it's a moot point; either way, the source is unreliable, because Power Windows is a fansite, and the alternative - no sources (which has been essensially proven otherwise) - means excessive OR and lack of <i>any</i> sourcing for months. â€” <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 02:38, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The mention that Rush has been influenced in popular culture on the main page is fine, becuase virtually <i>all this information comes from that one site, which is already linked to and mentioned in the main article</i>. Redirect is unnecessary, because nothing is merged and most of the edit history we'd be preserving is edit warring and info thrown out.

<li><b>Comment 2</b> there was a general agreement to merge after the last AfD, but nothing ever happened.

<li>I think it needs to be made clear that we cannot "merge" this information without merging the entire thing. Otherwise, we'd be inviting POV. Let's remember that most Movie and band featured articles don't have long lists of "in popular culture" sections. There is a whole fan site devoted to that; we make a cite, and we provide the link. That's our job. That's it. I don't see how a few points can be merged, because then the issue is...what points to merge, and how do we prevent people from including more or their own OR? I'm no deletionist, I lawywer the "preserve the edit history", I'm a mergist to the core, and even I see no way to merge this information logically, based on how Wikipedia is now. â€” <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 00:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I summon a comment! I mean, <b>Delete</b>; it seems there's been a lot of time to deal with the issues raised above and it's not happening. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 02:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's just a large, unencyclopedic list of trivia, two things that we are trying to stay away from in articles: lists and trivia sections, that's all this article is. If the information was needed, it would be in the main Rush article. <i><b><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthgriz98_7610.html" title="User:Darthgriz98"><font color="#084B8A">Darth</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarthgriz98_697d.html" title="User talk:Darthgriz98"><font color="#FF0080">griz</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7EDarthgriz98_d717.html" title="Special:Contributions:Darthgriz98"><font color="#04B4AE">98</font></a></sup></b></i> 02:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
