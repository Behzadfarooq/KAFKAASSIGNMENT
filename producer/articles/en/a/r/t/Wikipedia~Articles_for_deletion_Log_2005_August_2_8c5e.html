<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy</b> looks like someone's RPG or maybe a fanfic at best.

<li>After some investigative googling, I am pretty sure that it is from the 1950's radio show, <i>The Planet Man</i>. However, there isn't even a wiki article on The Planet Man, so this needs to go the way of the <b>Delete</b>d. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">Che Nuevara, the Democratic Revolutionary</a> 04:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it around--eventually someone will come along and do an article on the radio show, at which point this article can be merged and redirected; in the meantime, we can list the radio show on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok, seeing how this vote appears to be going I have to say something. Not long ago there was a VfD on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a>, which everyone rightly noted was a frivolous VfD nomination and the article was speedily kept. Wikipedia is not a web directory, true, but websites that are somehow notable in one way or another rate Wikipedia articles. IMDB has an article because is a standard online reference for film. Politics1 is a standard online reference for state and federal political candidates and has been since the late 1990s, as long as I have been actively on the net. At least *I* have been aware of it and using it that long. The weblog part of the site isn't that high ranked among blogs and in fact is a rather new addition, and I would suspect that Politics1 is no longer as popular as it once was due to the proliferation of other political websites, that and the popularity of the website peaks during election cycles. This is a prime case of where <b>Google hits and Alexa rankings DO NOT establish notability</b>. If this article winds up being deleted it's another sign that the VfD process as it currently exists is broken. I would encourage everyone to rethink your delete votes. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 14:47, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What the guy below said is so true. Chairboy has given no reason why this should be deleted. The only argument here is that "Google" doesn't have it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Your definition of notable is ambiguous and arbitrary. There is no bright line for notable, written anywhere. What I see happening here is people using Google as a method to justify. Besides that, no one else has any negative reason why this should be rejected. Unfortunately, it was in the belief that Wikipedia was an open encyclopedia that this entry was added. By rejecting this entry, you are enforcing a normative mindset, which will lead to impacts such as the destruction or political mindsets, resulting in no way for others to dissent. 12.65.42.195 01:47, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also, nobody is suggesting that the article is 'bad' in a perjorative sense, just that the subject is not notable enough for inclusion. Please note that while there are hundreds of thousands of apartment complexes in the USA, few of them merit inclusion in an encyclopedia.

<li>That's what it is when considered as a judge of the quality of a website. It only judges the popularity. I've seen people seriously argue to delete a website containing unique folk archives simply because, being a library website, it had an extremely low alexa ranking. Here, on the other hand, there is at least arguably a case for looking at Alexa stats. However it's still predicated on the idea, which I reject utterly, that we should only write about high traffic sites. Wikipedia writes about what wikipedia wants to write about, we're all volunteers. The quality of this article is good, it gives verifiable references and it's neutral. It's about a resource that can be of interest and that has been written about. Therefore there is no need to delete it; it isn't damaging Wikipedia, nor is it ever likely to do so. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:27, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I really feel that this VfD is a mistake. All these folks from the Hebrew Vikipedia have descended on this Vfd to oust the Nimrod Kamer article. I don't know why they dislike him so strongly, but clearly they think he is a nogoodnik. The Hebrew wikipedia must have different standards for notability than the English wikipedia. Somebody who has been profiled in multiple mainstream media newspapers and who is the world's very first professional Sudoku teacher should really be a shoo-in for a Wikipedia entry. It looks like Kamer is going to lose this VfD, and I think that's a shame and a mistake. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 08:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> First, this is not any encyclodaedic article, it is simply instructions on how to play a game. Second, as noted, it already has an article. And finally, it should be noted that the best of the fan pages group large numbers of what would otherwise be very minor stubs into single pages, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_03ca.html" title="List of Star Wars planets">List of Star Wars planets</a>.

<ul>
<li>If the content of the article is inappropriate, then it should be altered--but as long as the topic itself is appropriate, the article itself should remain. The topic itself IS appropriate--Wikipedia is a substantial online community, and Wikilinks is well-known to members of that community. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:39, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It's not a self-reference. A self-reference would be like saying "Certain encyclopedias (such as the one you are reading now) do X, Y, and Z". That is inappropriate. Saying "Certain encyclopedias (such as Wikipedia) do X, Y, and Z" is not a self-reference and is perfectly appropriate. An article simply about Wikipedia or a part of it is not a self-reference--which is why there can be an article on Wikipedia itself. See the difference?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A good rule of thumb is, if it mentions Wikipedia in the first person, it's a self-reference; if it mentions it in the third person, it's not. And just because an article may contain a self-reference in the content (which the one in question does not) does not mean that the TOPIC of the article is a self-reference--again, fix the content, don't delete the article.<a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:39, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I propose we fix the content by deleting. The Wikipedia article in question is about playing a game on Wikipedia. It's therefore impossible (or at least useless) to remove the references to Wikipedia. Unless it's notable outside the Wikimedia community, I don't believe Wikimedia articles belong in article namespace. I understand and appreciate other views on this. This is just my opinion which I offer to other voters and the closer of the debate. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 19:50, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the point is, it's perfectly OK for an article to mention Wikipedia, as long as it does so in a manner that does not assume that the reader is viewing the article through en.wikipedia.org. I suggest you take some time and actually read the page you linked to--specifically the paragraph that reads:</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia, but context is important. If you read about Shakespeare's works, you are not interested in reading about Wikipedia's policies or conventions. If, however, you read about online communities, the article may well discuss Wikipedia as an example, in a neutral tone, without specifically implying that the article in question is being read on — or is a part of — Wikipedia. If, in this framework, you link from an article to a Wikipedia page outside the main namespace, use external link style to allow the link to work also in a site with a copy of the main namespace content.</p>

<li>Could you please explain. I don't follow your logic. If someone actually searches for "Maxbats" they can either get nothing from wikipedia or they can get directed to a page about baseball bats in general. From my perspective, it seems helpful to have the redirect.

While its content may be of interest to some members of the gaming community, it really has no place in an encyclopaedia and simply serves as advertisements for the video game manufacturers. This is equivalent to adding an entry for my Tuesday evening bowling league team. I say delete due to its non-notability. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 21:25, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> They are not only a paid team, but they are one of the best teams in their business. They have contracts, salaries, and should be taken very seriously.

I'm in favor of "local landmarks" of significance and have written on three myself (check my user page), but its crucial to stay as NPOV as possible to demonstrate that an encyclopedic article <i>can</i> be written about it (certainly not true for most stores -- where I live now is a wonderful, excellent cafe with a great community, but it's not proper for an article.)

<li><b>Delete</b> Impossible to maintain, and such a compilation would be largely meaningless in the long run. Perhaps the top few winners in real and nominal money should be listed at <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_shows.html" title="Game shows">game shows</a>, and individual shows should list their top winners, but this simply isn't a good way to record this information. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 19:50, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess this is probably <b>delete</b>able, but I have been toying with the idea of a Game show records page, which might incorporate some of this information. Heck, I'll just copy it and put it on a user subpage, if I think it worthwhile.

<li><b>Delete</b> there are hundreds of game shows out there. Not maintainable, not really notable for an encyclopedia either as most champions included, beyond winning a million bucks are not notable.

<li>First time I've seen that happen: I tagged it for deletion and someone beat me to the punch in creating its VfD page. Probably not quite a speedy as inventing 2 programming languages is something of a claim of notability. Still, if someone does choose to speedy it, well, so be it. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:04, 2 August 2005 (UTC) (Oh yeah, that's a <b>delete</b> vote, by the way, in case it wasn't obvious.)</li>
<li>R. fiend: I agree with you that learning 2 programming languages is notable but I disagree with you in the sense that this entry should be deleted. This young man deserves credit for his hard work. The same can be said with the Wikipedia entries of Bill Gates and Britney Spears. Why should our Dylan's hard work not be seen and admired? - <small>Unsigned comment by article's initial creator at 69.212.2.162</small>
<ul>
<li>Britney Spears is a nationally known celebrity. Why? Who knows. But she is. Dylan is not. Bill Gates. Can you honestly say you don't know why Bill Gates is more deserving of his own article than your Dylan? Compare apples to apples. When Dylan does something that is notable (not just interesting) then try the article again.

<li>CONGRATULATIONS, FOLKS -- not only have you made fun of me, told me how useless my languages are (even though they developed an entire os -- that's their purpose, you twat) ... and i learned C when i was eleven. i never said how many languages i can understand. i can probably UNDERSTAND nearly about three dozen as well, because learning a programming language is similar to learning a spoken world/foreign language. I know 5 world languages. How many do you know? Stop making fun of me, just request deletion of the topic. You take this FAR too seriously. Here's a bright idea, stop talking about my family, because I have none. My dad died when I was five and my mom was killed in a car accident last week. And onto the topic of taking up server space? TALKING ABOUT DELETING MY ARTICLE IS EASILY TAKING UP MORE SPACE THAN WHAT I WROTE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO JUST DELETE THE ARTICLE AND STOP MOCKING/BELITTLING A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. I DID THIS TO IMPRESS MY COMPUTER TEACHER. I DID WRITE AN OS. I DONT SEE YOU WRITING AN OPERATING SYSTEM AT AGE FIFTEEN. And by the way, I don't care that I just composed that last couple sentences in all caps, because it doesnt matter! This will be deleted momentarily, hopefully. I don't deserve to be mocked, and my beautiful Bluefeather creation is NOT A UNIX CLONE. I BUILT THAT FROM SCRATCH.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may be vain, but you are critical. Stop doing this to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow up. If you can't take criticism you are doomed in life. Let's see...you learned 5 languages and 36 programing languages by age 15 and you are trying to impress your computer teacher by posting an inappropriate article on Wikipedia? Sounds fishy. Regardless, no one here attacked you, but only commented why your article wasn't appropriate. I think you're a troll, fishing for attention. I guess you got what you wanted. This will be the last time you get it from me. Good luck in life. With an attitude like yours, you'll need it. --<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 03:07, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well in that respect, thanks for the luck. Literally speaking, I'm far from a troll - six feet five inches tall to be exact. Sorry for taking up 10KB of server space...My attitude towards like is actually quite positive, I'm just having a hard time, seeing as I just lost my mother. It's not fishy, actually the primary purpose of the article was to get back at my evil computer applications teacher (which in reality is no more than a little bit of DOS and Word, Excel during class) who made fun of me now that I have no parents, and she bet me that I couldn't make Wikipedia if I tried. And so a wise man said "Negative attention is better than no attention at all." Good day and keep up the great work you guys here at Wikipedia have been doing! Looks like my computer teacher will have the best of me ... once again&#160;:( Good night. <b>PS</b> Just for the record, Bluefeather is not a UNIX clone. If you want the ISOs, email me: dylan [at] binaryopinion [dot] com</li>

<ul>
<li>Right. I've <b>abstained</b> from voting because I see a lot of what I used to be in you. And I'm only a few years older. I can understand all kinds of languages, but I never use that to make myself sound impressive. If you'd like some advice, you'll stop "not caring." Now, I apologise if Bluefeather is a genuine OS and of course I'll consider taking a look - you have to appreciate so many script kiddies think of Unix clones as new systems. Just take it gracefully, Dylan, and one day; someone'll be writing about you. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 02:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks, Rob -- I appreciate the support and will take advantage of whatever constructive criticism you can give me.

<li>My final piece of advice, for what it's worth, and you're entitled to not follow it, is to abstain, given the argument and the fact that you're the subject here. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 22:15, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is one of the worst I've read on Wikipedia. It is churlishly written, full of factual and detail errors obvious to any reader of the book and is wildly inconsistent from paragraph to paragraph. There is not a single paragraph in this article that doesn't contain major errors. In fact, the first sentence in the article contained no fewer than two glaring errors. This article was probably not written in good faith and by someone who hasn't even read the book. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowwarrior1977_bac3.html" title="User:Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a> 21:34, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Since you seem to be more familiar with the book, a more useful route might be for you to either rewrite the article, correcting the inaccuracies, or start over with a new article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The subject is one that is worthy of being in Wikipedia, and the criticisms you cite are not sufficient to delete the article. If you know stuff about the article, but think that is is SO poorly written, delete all the text and start again!

<li><b>Comment</b>.I started to make corrections, like changing 1963 to 1964 in the first paragraph, but there are simply too many factual errors to efficiently correct. Just about every statement in this article contains a factual error. Listing them all right now would take all day, but lets take the first sentence. It had 1963 as the year the novel took place, not 1964, introduced the "Kripo" without explanation, or even calling it by its name (Kripo is a slang term), the Kripo is only a division of the SS for administrative purposes, as were all police officers, while the article makes it sound like it was a "division" of the main SS. The ideological split between the "police SS" and the old "military/ideological SS" is a major point of this novel. Lastly, the detective is investigating ONE death in Berlin, not a "series of deaths." He only realizes there are more deaths much later in the novel, not when the story beings. So there you have it, in the first sentence alone, there are FOUR major errors. Trust me when I say that almost EVERY single sentence in this rather long article holds at least one major factual or interpretational error. I WILL re-write this article AFTER this fallacious one is deleted, however.<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowwarrior1977_bac3.html" title="User:Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a> 22:37, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I do not think you understand what we are saying. I have not read the novel, and it sounds like you know far more about it than us. You would be the ideal person to write an excellent article about the novel. But we are not going to delete it, because what is the point? If you want to start now, just go to the article, go to "edit the article", highlight all the text and press "delete" on your keyboard. Bingo! Then you can start writing the new article. Deleting an article, however, is a more permanent measure. This involves deleting the ENTIRE article, including its name, history and all edits. Read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">The Deletion Policy</a>. We only delete things that should not have been in Wikipedia <i>in the first place</i>. Fatherland should. And you are the person to make it so. So, best of luck. If you need help, there is plenty available. But start on that rewriting, and soon it will be <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_article_2aff.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect article">the perfect article</a>!

<li><b>Comment</b>. Are you an administrator? Are you saying I have permission to wipe out this article and start over again? The thing is, I've had bad experiences making changes before; whenever I've changed anything substantive, and believe me, this page needs it, the previous authors get really nasty and threatening for days on end.

<dd>I'm not an admin, but I know a couple of the posters are. In any event, it would be much more prudent to rewrite those portions of the article that are incorrect. I shouldn't think it would need to be gutted entirely. At least portions are correct, for example, most of the character descriptions.

<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks to RainbowWarrior1977 for his insightful and diplomatically worded insults. I wrote the article on Fatherland which seems to be causing him so much distress. When I began editing, the article simply ststed that the book "is a 1992 novel written by Robert Harris". It contained nothing more. I wrote the paragraphs on the plot, the list of characters, and the connections with <i>Nineten Eighty-Four</i>. And let me assure you, RainbowWarrior, that I have read the book (several times) and am well aware of the plotline. Yes, there were one or two little errors here and there, and I thank you for correcting them. However, I am not convinced that your other amendments have improved the quality of the article in any way. Finally, I would advise you to avoid using phrases such as "churlishly written" in the future, particularly when referring to an article written by a Cambridge historian! Thanks to everyone else for their support, it's very much appreciated! &#160;:) <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 15:23, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just read your lovely little comment, Mr RainbowWarrior, calling me a "troll". I don't wish to be threatening, but you really need to acquire some diplomacy. If you want to be an administrator, you're going to have to demonstrate the ability to debate constructively and present logical, coherent arguments. And it will seriously damage your reputation if you start calling editors - whether they are Cambridge students like me, or Mr Everybody chipping in with their knowledge - trolls.

<li>I'm abstaining for now, but I note that this article is far from NPOV. Obviously the writer thinks the police were in the wrong and doesn't bother telling their side of the story. I also note that the author's only other contribution was to the <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charles_de_Menezes_a252.html" title="Jean Charles de Menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> article. Obviously he has an interest in police violence. On the other hand, Rodney King gets his own article (but Rodney King recieved national attention as well). If this case recieved sustained attention outside of it's locality, then I would vote keep, but only after a POV clean-up. --<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 22:22, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unencyclopædic; the notion is inherently PoV, and involves speculation (who's to say whether a question is unanswerable rather than unanswered?).

<li>An answer and a proof are different things, whatever the logical positivists say. The only possible way a question can be unanswerable is if it is not asked (if one takes the strictest definition of answer). Therefore the presence of this list automatically precludes anything from appearing on it, which is plainly nonsense. As none of that even touches near deletion policy, I'll suggest inherent POV and unencyclopaediocity (or whatever). If it were possible to write (and I don't think it is), it is a philosophical point, not an encyclopedic one. <b>Delete</b>, by the way. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 22:20, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just incase it is not read, here is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphrase.html" title="Paraphrase">paraphrase</a> of the disscussion page:
<ul>
<li>This page should be expanded first and <i>then</i> decided whether to be deleted. There are plently of lists on Wikipedia that have no ending. So "unmaintainable list" is not a good excuse at all. Also, many have said that the only possible way a question can be unanswerable is if it is not asked. This is not true. If it was not asked, it would not be unanswerable in the first place. But since it <i>is</i> asked, and there is <i>no</i> answer that has solid proof, it is unanswerable. And just because the list is very short doesn't mean it should be deleted. It should exist for at least 20 days before even being considered for deletion. There isn't much of a difference between "Unanswerable" and "Unanswered". The only difference is that "Unanswerable" means it will never be answered. But regardless of this technicality, the main idea is still the same. And also, how is this topic POV when anybody can add to it, and the questions added to the list are the same that many different cultures have been asking for centuries? (For example, there are many questions that are never meant to be answered in the first place, and trying to answer them creates a POV. But since this list is only meant to have questions and not answers, it isn't POV.) Also, because this list falls under the catagory of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EIncomplete_lists_470b.html" title="Wikipedia:Incomplete lists">Wikipedia:Incomplete lists</a>, it <i>does</i> go along with Wikipedia standards.</li>

The items on this page could also refer to other articles, but currently does not. I belive it should be kept, and relevant articles linked. I would say that a problem in philosophy is "unsolved" if people are still talking about it. I like the idea of collections of unsolved problems because it gives people somewhere to go when they are looking for something interesting to think about.

<li>Schools are generally regarded as eminently noteworthy. I don't know about your country, but my country has lists of the institutions and sends inspectors round. We spend billions of pounds maintaining them, our kids spend most of their waking lives in them, and to put it briefly schools are a huge part of the society in my country--far more so than, say, the armed forces, and second only to the public health service. As to encyclopedic, that usually comes down to neutrality and verifiability. Because of the aforementioned inspections and the public appetite for information on schools, there is plenty of verifiable information about them. I shouldn't worry that anyone would mistake a school article for "meaningless garbage" and delete it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:51, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That was meant as rhetoric... I did say <i>every</i> hospital, thinking that the absurdity of that was obvious.</li>
<li>That list is difficult to get an accurate number on (it has sub-lists) but it does not appear to contain "hundreds" of hospitals.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b></p>
<ul>
<li>FIRST, this article qualifies under the Wikipedia definition of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Importance</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The policy on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Importance</a> states the following:
<ul>
<li>"An article is <b>important</b> and deserving of inclusion in Wikipedia if...: it is an expansion (of reasonable length, not a stub) upon an established subject."</li>
<li>"If an article is "important" according to the above then it should not be deleted on the basis of it being: (1) insufficiently important, famous or relevant, or (2) currently small or a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>, or (3) obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's pretty hard to find them by accident.)"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clearly <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Phi_Epsilon_ca66.html" title="Sigma Phi Epsilon">Sigma Phi Epsilon</a> and the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">Fraternity and Sorority system</a> qualify as established subjects. An offshoot of a fraternity is therefore "an expansion upon an established subject."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SECOND, this is NOT vandalism. Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">"vandalism"</a> as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Vandalism</b> is any indisputably bad-faith addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia. The largest quantity of vandalism consists of replacement of prominent articles with obscenities, namecalling, or other wholly irrelevant content. Any <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good-faith</a> effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism...."</li>
<li>There is absolutely no reason to believe that any of this content is inaccurate in any way. There are no obscenities and no attempt was made to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please note Dan Granahan's revisions to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Phi_Epsilon_ca66.html" title="Sigma Phi Epsilon">Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>. He has TWICE accused me of vandalism simply because I listed The Annex (SigEp) as a "Related Organization." I take offense at his accusation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>THIRD, since when is "silly" grounds for deletion. On that basis, perhaps we should delete <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> since many people would consider it "silly." Just because an organization starts at a university does not mean it should not be included here. See <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_Society_c568.html" title="Federalist Society">Federalist Society</a>. To think otherwise would mean that any organization, no matter how silly, should be included here simply for having a prominent member or two. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.65.118.221 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.65.118.221_9f85.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.65.118.221">contribs</a>) 00:40, 3 August 2005.</small></li>
<li>FOURTH, a comparison of other fraternity-related articles demonstrates that there is a precedent for this page:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Delta (chapter) A specific chapter of <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Omega_4d0e.html" title="Alpha Phi Omega">Alpha Phi Omega</a> sorority.</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsilon_Iota_18d3.html" title="Epsilon Iota">Epsilon Iota</a> A local chapter of <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psi_Upsilon_81c2.html" title="Psi Upsilon">Psi Upsilon</a> fraternity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Response</i>: Obviously you changed the article since when I first put up the deletion tag when you referred to members by nicknames. I apologize for labeling it vandalism. Nevertheless, this article is <b>extremely point of view</b>. To call <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> silly is a ridiculous charge. People know about Skull and Bones but there is absolutely nothing on the web to even verify that this article is about a real organization, so where is the precedent in that? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECollective-DZYN_a940.html" title="User:Collective-DZYN">Collective-DZYN</a></li>

<li>Yes, yes, it's not vandalism, and I apologise if your feelings were hurt by that, o article creator.

I simply reverted your edits. Regardless, this article still qualifies for deletion. It is a simply an elaborate vanity page with no encyclopedic information. Though it is nicely formatted, the article is clearly just bragging about your fraternity. Note phrasing such as:</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The new brothers looked promising, but their hidden agendas and absence of partying skills soon rose to the surface.</i></dd>

<li>Anyone who wants to know the origin of this please look at the very beginning drafts of this article. One will see that this was originally created as a joke article. For your accusation "So basically a single web page and submission to a few major search engines would be sufficient, right???". You misinterepret the entire point. NO ONE can verify this and this is contrary to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> policy. Also, I retract what I said that this is not vandalism. This IS vandalism. Refer to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a> section under <b>silly vandalism</b> where it explains "joke articles".

<li>REPLY: Once again I take offense to your characterization of the article as vandalism. Do you find something untrue about the earlier versions??? You can complain all you want about a lack of verifiability or notability. I concede that those points are debatable.
