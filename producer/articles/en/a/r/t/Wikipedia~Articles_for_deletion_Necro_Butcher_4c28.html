<p><s>Article on a professional wrestler that does not illustrate the subject's notability or reason for inclusion in Wikipedia. It appears that he has never wrestled on national television or for a major promotion. As it stands now, it seems that he is a non-notable indy wrestler waiting for his big break.

<dd><b>Comment</b> His feuds are just one aspect of his character indeed, however being in a notable fed with a notable feud establishes notability. He is not a brand new wrestler he has been wrestlign for several years at this point and has recently begun to establish his notability. For the most part people who have been in a notable fed in a notable feud have articles about them. The information is verifiable. And he isn't wretling washed up superstars, he is wrestling the top stars in the industry today, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoa_Joe_5d67.html" title="Samoa Joe">Samoa Joe</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homicide_%28wrestler%29.html" title="Homicide (wrestler)">Homicide (wrestler)</a> just to name a scant few.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Just being an indy wrestler should not automatically make a subject <i>non-notable</i>. As far as indy wrestlers go, my impression is that he is notorious, if nothing else, and that places him above the undistinguished masses of people just "waiting for a break", even if he's not at the highest level of indy notability. If his article lacks mention of his notability, it should be added rather than deleting the article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffg_946b.html" title="User:Geoffg">Geoffg</a> 03:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This AFD gives it that chance. The article has to proove it's notable, if no notability is established before 5 days then it should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 04:15, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Combat Zone Wrestling has been on TV, I have seen him in RoH on TV. That is noticeable to me And he has more accomplishments than most other wrestlers around.

<li>Do you mean "notable" or "noticable?" Also, remember that a characters "accomplishments" are the work of scriptwriters. We also try to avoid writing and including articles on pro wrestlers for markish reason. (I've gotten pwned for that myself, when I tried to insert the section heading "The Big Red Machine" in the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Jacobs_42a9.html" title="Glen Jacobs">Glen Jacobs</a> article&#160;:) ). <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy hoy</a>)</small> 01:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes accomplishments are the work of writers and bookers, but if the wrestler isn't either talented enough, or popular enough, those bookers and writers wouldn't put him in that spot to begin with. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 15:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Combat Zone Wrestling, Chikara, Ring of Honour in the States; Frontier Wrestling Alliance in the UK; Big Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can see where you are coming from, but playing AAA baseball, D-I college sports, or being in an indy flick do not inherently impart notability. While all of those feds notable themselves, many of their wrestlers do not quite reach that level. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy hoy</a>)</small> 00:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd argue that the comparison between AAA baseball and pro wrestling independants isn't an accurate one. A fairer comparison would be to idependant movies as the structures of the movie industry and pro wrestling have more similarities. A major idependant movie actor is notable enough for inclusion just as a major idependant wrestler is. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 03:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as he is among the bigger names in independent wrestling. If this was some guy who had wrestled in minor independent promotions, I could see the page being deleted, but it isn't.
