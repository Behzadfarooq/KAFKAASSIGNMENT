<li>Why do you continue to post anonymously, from different IP addresses? The foundation for his page is his works, publications both private and public. I knew Ebony personally for about a decade and attended his funeral. Although I have much first-person evidence from him directly, all content for his wiki should be taken directly from solid sources. The inclusion of "Fan Pages" is to show the full scope of his influence on Thelemic culture, from an Anthropological perspective. I realize the wording of his biography is rough, but hey I just made this page yesterday. You sound like you knew him... why not contribute to the project rather than snipe? &lt;3 <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 00:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ebony Anpu influenced the lives of many notable people. His work is known _Internationally_. The article is currently only a stub - still in progress of being compiled. Please give it time to be edited and polished. Destroying articles before they can be worked on by other editors (to create a NPOV) is not the Wiki way. Wiki is based on obtaining collective knowledge and peer-review. Ebony has possibly thousands of peers and it is a travesty to knowledge if his Wiki get's deleted before a complete entry is accomplished. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 16:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

"Nutcase" is qualitative and contributes nothing. He died in 1999, so the majority of his work was created and distributed _before_ the wide-spread use of the internet.

<li>Comment and Question: I read this on WP:CSK "nominations which are made solely to provide a forum for disruption (e.g., a userpage of a contestant in a heated edit war by their opponent(s) solely for harassment)." It seems to me this is what has happened. All delete requests, AfD nominations, and the CopyrightVio have come from two similar "new user" IP's in Austen Texas and Germany. Discussion history shows these IPS saying "he was a nutcase" and "I am choronzon (a mythical demon)". I think it is very clear that these postings reflect a "edit war" and _no_ valid reasons for nomination. I had a feeling this would happen, that's why I put "topic of heated debate" on the disc page. Boy Ebony is popular! &lt;3 <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 17:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Independent sources: Two published books, by Stellar Visions Inc. Four separate web archives of Official Ordo Templi Orientis Publications which all bring supporting evidence, One published autobiography (by an unrelated party) with many details of Grady and Ebony's relationship, plus many more "unverifiable" personal pages. Also Bill Hiedrick is a highly prominant and respected IX degree in the O.T.O., with many research credits attatched to him. In matters of OTO history, many would agree that he is verified.

<li>Better Comment:Ok. Here I am, fresh from reading Wikipedia:Reference and Wikipedia:Original Research. From this study I have gathered several things. First: it seems to me that all of Ebony's writings fall squarely in the category of "Primary Resource." They hold his copyright (although I have not found it at the copyright office, I believe writers are given automatic copyright to their own work, just by putting the little "c" on it. Evidence from google tells me these writing exist independent of him, in multiple locations around the world in the same form with copyright notice on them). Second: I am a primary source. I knew him very well. Though I recognize and bow to the need for proper citations. Third: Stellar Visions counts as a Primary Source as a published work. Fourth: Satyrs work counts as a Primary Source. Fifth: Bill Heidricks work and all publications of the OTO count as Secondary Sources and are totally valid contributions. Sixth: This is up in the air, but I think the various hawk and jackal covens and sites "unverifiable" web sites made to honor him should be considered Tertiary Sorces. Thank yo for motivating me to study the approproate wiki sections. &lt;3 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captainbarrett</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainbarrett_ed50.html" title="User talk:Captainbarrett">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captainbarrett_8915.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captainbarrett">contribs</a>) 04:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small><a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 04:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm no proxy, and I had no knowledge of the subject before reading the article just now. I can now more exactly say that I have no Verifiable knowledge of the subject. Every one of the sources is self-published or a blog. I'm tempted to classify this as in-universe. If anyone can find some sources, it might be an article someday. At the moment there is not even any RS evidence that the entire body of materials is more than a hoax. Not everything originated by Aleister Crowley has much connection with reality. speedy isn't for hoaxes, as it is rightly felt they need fuller exposure. This one has had it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am sorry, I do not understand. What is a hoax? He lived. He did everything I have referenced. If this is a hoax, why do it? Its not like it's funny, the man is dead. I am in touch with his living Daughter. I have found many sources as described on the wiki:reference page. It takes time to get sources on very interesting people. If you delete the article now you will have no chance to _ever_ get more sources. If wiki deleted every article they were unsure about, the day after it's creation, we would not have a good encyclopedia. Wiki is based on collective work, please do not subvert the process. &lt;3<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainbarrett_48a2.html" title="User:Captainbarrett">Captain Barrett</a> 05:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
