<p>The article was written by his friend, he's unnotable, very few people would know who he is, and most of the article's factual accuracy is tenuous at best Reubensutton 20:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The above comments are wholly incorrect. The article is perfectly accurate with many statements referencing newspaper articles and a number of existing links to Wikipedia clearly visible. Mr Roundhill's career and creative contribution is of note in 21st century London literary and artistic circles. His extensive personal archive is relevant to students and researchers. ElizabethQ 15:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ElizabethQ, i will make a list of the statements which have citations and are therefore proved to be true:
<ul>
<li>his father being a canon</li>
<li>him having a bit part in absolute beginners</li>
<li>the balachada part</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I see nothing in the citation for the public relations that even mentions roundhill.</dd>
<dd>There is no proof he wrote saga also.</dd>
<dd>So, if the article is kept it is an article for a bit part actor from 20 years ago with a defunct website devoted to pete doherty.</dd>

<dd>"Mr Roundhill's career and creative contribution is of note in 21st century London literary and artistic circles". Filming Pete Doherty on a camcorder is hardly a significant contribution - I'll admit that he's noteworthy amongst certain East London circles though (and we all know what kind of circles). <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERaskazz_9ba3.html" title="User:Raskazz">Raskazz</a> 21:11, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Roundhill co-wrote a song on a recent <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_%28album%29_d531.html" title="The Libertines (album)">#1 album</a>; he's the literary agent for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Doherty_4634.html" title="Pete Doherty">one of the most famous musician/poets in the country</a>, and he's featured in dozens of newspaper articles. The citations are adequate for a brand-new article, including documentation of his role as literary agent and publicist for Doherty, and work editing his prison diaries. I would like to add more citations and improve it, so if you see something lacking, please put a "citation needed" tag in, and someone can try to verify it, or remove it if that fails. It's much better than deleting the whole thing outright, especially when the man has been featured in dozens of reputable news articles and meets the standard for notability. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 16:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What song?</dd>
<dd>And your citation about him being a svengali is an article about him being implicated in a murder, I would say this is important. I don't believe you have a NPOV on this subject, which is why i suspect you're either ro or his associate.</dd>
<dd>It maybe does meet the standard for notability though.</dd>
<dd>If it is kept, i think it that it needs completely rewriting.</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, sir, have you read the article? It clearly identifies the song as <i>The Saga</i>. I'm also baffled by your claim not to see anything about public relations in the relevant citation<a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=16767/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=16767/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Almost the whole article consists of Roundhill acting as a PR, defending Pete and explaining the blood paintings, as well as organizing an exhibition of Peter's artwork. A few of the background bits need referencing, which I'm working on, but almost all the major elements of the article are supported by appropriate citations, namely the role as literary agent, PR, and role in creating the heavily-reviewed multimedia archive on balachadha (which is not defunct, but undergoing a redesign and update). As for co-writing a song with Doherty on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_%28album%29_d531.html" title="The Libertines (album)">#1 Libertines album</a>, he's credited by name in the songbook I have. I'm looking for an internet citation at the moment, but in any case, it is indisputably verifiable and very notable.</dd>

<dd>Also, a google search reveals <i>300,000</i> hits on his name, linked to him and his work with Doherty, Wolfman, or the Mark Blanco incident, and I've seen his name on the front page of several major newspapers in recent months.</dd>

<dd>I've been editing here for a long time, and I would appreciate it if you refrained from speculating about my personal life and whom I might or might not be friends with. It's not relevant, and I don't think you have grounds to challenge me on NPOV. People are entitled to their opinions as long as they produce factually correct and neutral articles, and I believe I have done that. I take Wikipedia's policies very seriously, so if you can find something in the article which is biased, please bring it to my attention and make an appropriate edit.</dd>

<dd>Indeed, I might suggest that your neutrality is dubious, like your claim that the <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2006570128,00.html/" class="external text" title="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2006570128,00.html/" rel="nofollow">'svengali' article</a> is "about him being implicated in a murder." The article plainly says no such thing and explicitly states there "is no suggestion that Roundhill had anything to do with it." <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 21:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In regards to your friendship with Ro, it is relevant. Also, it is not a neutral article, the pete doherty article refers to mark blanco, why does the article not mention any of ro's bad qualities, you cite an article in which he is referred to as “a pond-life dealer and junkie.” in addition to: “There are always young kids round and he lets them take drugs. Since Pete started going around to the flat, more and more of them have been turning up there hoping to see him.". Why are none of these bad qualities mentioned? And in regards to the mark blanco incident, he was questioned about it, implicated was a bit strong, i apologise, but he was involved and you did not mention it at all. Why is this? And bala v2 has not changed in the 7 months i have been aware of it. (assuming it is still at the thinkartful address. I don't have any feelings for or against the man, indeed, he does sound interesting. You've convinced me that it should be kept too.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has clearly been written by an associate of its subject and omits the unsavoury aspects of Roundhill's character - notably the death of Mark Blanco, the drug-dealing and the scam Babyshambles 'gig' that he arranged in 2005. However, subject to prudent editing and NPOV maintenance it is worthy of inclusion IMO. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERaskazz_9ba3.html" title="User:Raskazz">Raskazz</a> 21:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
