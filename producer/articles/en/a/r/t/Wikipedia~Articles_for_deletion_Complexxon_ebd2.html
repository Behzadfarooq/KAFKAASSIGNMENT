<li>I would like to invite you to better study content of 'Casus Europae' (Tychon v. Dell) and state proper citations:</li>
<li>I do not claim nor enjoy a trademark victory against Exxon.</li>
<li>My European Opposition against registration of Dell's Community Trade Mark (CTM)was succesful and is fully documented on xxell.com <a href="http://www.xxell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xxell.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, notwithstanding Dell's appeal and strategic countering before Dutch courts.</li>
<li>Casus Europa clearly defines implementing of TM-supported firmware computer programs as they link mental processes (like instant 'branding' of this new method of 'implicit patenting') to software programs. Compare the Macrossan Patent-case where the assembly-function of computer programs is discussed.</li>
<li>The .E trademark is uniquely self-patenting because there is no way around this business-method other than copying it with less distinctive internet icons.</li>
<li>I persist in my oppinion that Dell and Exxon are imposing gibberish and a global threat to fair and independent research, innovation, progress, real change and development and thus being the global cause and main force behind the structural and startegic complexxon of enduring error sustained by information-terror where energy-fundamentals determine foreign affairs and international diplomacy endangering state-sovereignty usually misperceived and dubbed as state-failures: the global P3-tangle of incorporated governance guided by the primacy of economic fundamentalism.</li>
<li>The root cause of the information war (Silent War) cannot even be silenced by Wikipedians, but you are all free to try.</li>
<li>I wish you good luck in persuing to unveil the truth and sustain the global battle against mingled corporate arrogance and public ignorance.</li>

<dd>Mr Tychon</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am very sorry that you feel so put upon, and I wanted to write this <i>final</i> comment to try to explain to you why I have been giving such negative feedback. I would reassure you that I carefully read all of your articles and your website before putting forward my vote for deletion. The reason for my voting to delete your articles is not because I do not agree with your point of view, or because I do not think you are correct in your point of view, but because it simply <i>is not possible</i> to understand what you are trying to say. I am afraid that your command of the English language does not appear to be good enough to get your points across and I can see no possibilty of improving the situation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My first comment, noting that you may not be an English speaker, was intended to be supportive. The fact that English is not your first language should be taken into account and extra effort put into trying to understand what you want to say. I have made that extra effort and still do not understand you. If I may make a friendly suggestion, why not create articles on the Dutch Wiki (I've run a seach under Complexxon, Tychon and xxell and can find nothing), so that you are writing in your own language. When you have a stable and accepted article, I'm sure there would be an opportunity to have it translated into English by someone with a better command of the language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry for my error in saying that you had a victory over Exxon, rather than saying that it was a victory over Dell. This was an honest mistake. I have now reviewed the complete decisions in the Tychon V Dell case and the subsequent appeal. As a registered (but non-practicing) European Trade Mark Attorney I am sorry to have to tell you that you clearly do not have a full grasp of intellectual property law and are not qualified to comment on it. For example, I note that OHIM's decision was based entirely on their own reasoning and that very little you had to say was taken into account. Your submissions that Dell had stolen your trademark and had bad advertising practices were completely ignored. Your submissions that your own trademark had achieved recognition were rejected. OHIM rejected Dell's trademark for some of the goods and services under which they had requested it to be registered, giving you only a partial victory. The subsequent appeal (filed by you) was found to be inadmissible because you failed to pay an appeal fee. Apparently, you said that you should not be required to pay an appeal fee. I am afraid that that strikes me as a very arrogant submission to make and I am not surprised that your appeal was thrown out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, as I mentioned before, your partial victory over Dell <i>only</i> shows that you have previously registered a trade mark that was similar to the trade mark that Dell wished to register. It does not support your point of view expressed in any of the articles that are proposed for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, as a registered (and practicing) European Patent Attorney from the UK, I can say with utter certainty that there is no such thing as an "implicit patent". <a href="http://www.xxell.com/index.php?page=64" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xxell.com/index.php?page=64" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> There is also no such thing as a global patent. The Macrossan decision in the UK does not support the patenting of computer-implemented mental processes, does not have global importance and the appeal filed by Mr Macrossan has not yet been judged on. A trademark does not give you patent rights and is not a "business method". Having run a search on [ep.espacenet.org], I find that you do not appear to have any granted or pending patents. Therefore, someone can provide exactly the same services as you so long as they use a different trade mark. Your comments on software patents are therefore completely misguided. They also do not appear to have any relevance to the articles that have been proposed for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, having carefully reviewed all of the materials made available to me, I can make no sense and can see no merit in any of your articles and maintain my vote to have them deleted.</dd>
