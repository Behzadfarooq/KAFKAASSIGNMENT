<p>Not the work of <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENintendude_b487.html" title="User:Nintendude">Nintendude</a>, for a change, but still a list of songs selected by arbitrary and inconsistent criteria (you're the <i>one</i> is not the same as <i>one</i> man went to mow, but no comparable widespread usage exists for other numbers). The major problem here is that the concept - songs with numbers in the title - is not probvably significant; if it were a list of ballads, there would be an encyclopaedic topic to back it up, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballad.html" title="Ballad">ballad</a>; in this case there is no evident encyclopaedic significance for the concept of a song with a number in the title. Previous Keep votes were on the grounds of "interesting" or "good", deletes were on a firmer basis, in my view (indiscriminate, unmaintainable). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:21, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> and I think the nom brings up a very interesting way of identifing listcruft. If the concept that defines the list isint significant then it is usually listcruft IMO. I'm definatly going to remember that in future. Thanks JzG <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 14:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The current state of contributions to the page (inconsistent criteria or not) isn't really reason to delete the whole thing. How does this nomination differ from the previous rejected one? How is absence of a topic to backup <i>the existence of a number in a song title</i> a 'major problem' with the concept's significance? Certainly you don't need a page to tell you a song <i>you already know</i> has a number in its title, but if you need to find songs you <i>don't know</i> (or have forgotten) with a certain number in the title, this is a handy page and it would be annoying to find it removed.

<li>Hi InShanee, thanks for contributing. In future could you confine your comments to the merits of the article and points for/against, and leave commentary on other users to the Talk pages? Thanks. Towelie 07:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You will note that the current state of the page had little or no part in my nomination. The problem is that it is a list whose premise appears to be of no verifiable significance - a list of arbitraray type of entertainment matching arbitrary (and inconsistently applied) criteria. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Up to a point, Lord Copper. Even if we had a double jeopardy rule, which we don't, no consensus does not mean the community has said it should not be deleted, it means that the community (or rather the ten members who showed up at the debate) did not make up its mind one way or another. I think this article violates policy, and I can't find a policy which says that an previous no-consensus AfD requires an article be kept in perpetuity. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:23, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> since the distinction between a song with a number in the name and a song without a number in the name is simply unimportant.

<li>Okay I'll bite: someone who will find this useful, to take just <b>one</b> example, is a person responsible for compiling an audio clip that includes sung numbers. One could go on. Failure of imagination re the utility of a page to anyone but oneself is a lousy excuse to go around removing the work of other Wikipedians. Towelie 07:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
