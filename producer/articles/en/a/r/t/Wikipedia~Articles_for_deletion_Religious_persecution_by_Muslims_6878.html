<p>Fork of Persecution of non-Muslims to avoid get around VFD of that article.

<p>Update: This VfD seems to be an attempt to support the RfC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Germen" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Germen" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> complaint against me: one of the charges which are levelled against me is the "spurious" creation of articles. Note that it is not Wikipedia policy to forbid the creation of articles and that this article describes a real-world and proven phenomenon. Note that the ones who sponsor the VfD (like Ril and Axon) support a delete vote just for one reason: the supposed bad-faith of undersigned. The propable reason is my supposed anti-islam bias. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 08:48, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note that one of the accusations in aforementioned RfC is the spurious creation of articles, as manifest by the frequent VfD votes on them. These VfD votes originate from users with a known pro-Islam bias, e.g. Irishpunktom, which propably mobilize supporters in order to win the vote.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think if you change the word "By" (in the title and some of the sub-sections) to the word "OF" this article makes alot more sense. The author seems to be writing in terms of persecution OF Muslims. I read the article and much of its information seems to be covered in the blue links I followed. Perhaps some of this material should be <b>Re-Directed</b> or <b>Merged</b> with the existing material. I think an <b>edit</b> would help this page. A historical record of the persecution of any population certainly warrants notable topic status, and the tone of this one seems largely historical rather than an opinion piece. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 07:50, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is already a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Muslims_79ae.html" title="Persecution of Muslims">Persecution of Muslims</a> article, this page is yet another opportunity for Germen to spread his anti-muslim propaganda (he's already created numerous pester pages that have all been deleted through lengthy VfD). I see no reason not to cover the same subject matter in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article. Also I'm not sure that religious persecution can be used in this sense: when I hear the term I generally think of people being persecuted for their religion, not people being persecuted because of religion. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 09:07, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Persecution OF muslims is completely different of persecution BY Muslims. Failing to see this difference is symptomatic for <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">user:Axon</a>. I did cite verifiable sources, so what I wrote cannot be classified as biased anti-Muslim propaganda. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 12:19, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I was referring to Hamster Sandwich's remarks. Your continued attempts to contradict votes and harrass voters here and on other VfDs are not welcommed.

<li>Legitimate comments on factual inaccurate statements cannot be classified as harassment.

<li>You haven't actually highlighted any "factual inaccuracies" other than mis-reading my remarks. Your continued attempts to shout down opposing votes is not doing you any favors or making people more inclined to vote in your favor. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 13:13, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said, responding to remarks is a valid discussion practice and cannot be considered <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harassment.html" title="Harassment">harassment</a>. Thus your remarks are logically inacurate. Note that your continued attempts to shout down opposing voices are not doing you any favours of making people motre inclined to vote in your favour, for as far that matters. Wikipedia is not a democracy, so arguments are more important than votes. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 13:26, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

In fact, it is totally different, making yours a moot point. I don't see how you can miss this (or expect anyone to fall for it). Furthermore, I would think that more people were persecuted for <i>not being of a certain religion</i>, than for <i>being of a certain religion</i>, which in my opinion makes this article more relevant than <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Muslims_79ae.html" title="Persecution of Muslims">Persecution of Muslims</a>.

<li>To say that ONLY the Koran makes statements like 5:51 is a generalization and is not accurate. What did Jesus mean when he said "If you are not with me, then you are against me"? Have you read of the Israelite's campaigns against their neighbors? Making statements like "only the Koran" suggest that you have some beef against Muslems, thus diluting the arguement to keep the article, which I support as long as it is historically accurate.--<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 19:02, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Fine. I admit I was too lazy to look the verse up, but my paraphrase isn't that far off and the context seems the same. The point of both 5:51 and Jesus' statement is that there is only one way to salvation and, frankly, I don't see the problem with 5:51 in that it reserves the punishment of sinners to Allah. Not one of the three religions is innocent of bloodshed and if you have articles about Christian and Jewish attrocities, then you are obligated to examine Islam as well. If there ever were Christian, Jewish, or Muslem attrocities against other religions (and there certainly were), you are obligated to to examine them. The "Persecution by..." series seems legitimate. If the content of the articles needs cleaned up, then clean them up, but I don't see how you can justify deleting them just because someone might get offended by them.--<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 19:36, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> For the same reasons as I gave, for deleting "Religious persecution by Jews." I will jus copypast those reasons here: "The name of the article is not encyclopedic. Something like: "Religious persecution in Israel" could get an entry, but for sure not this. It is simply a generalization of an ethnic group, and the support of a POV, the POV being that, an ethnic group is more than a social construct, all this, in the articles name alone. I think there should be appropriate rules here in Wikipedia, on what is an encyclopedic entry, this will spare us all the trouble of having to vote the deletion of articles that should not exist in the first place. This sort of article will only get answered by similar articles(I just hope they don't already exist), which the subject, and probably the aim, will be generalization. There is a distinction between directly criticizing a group of people, and criticizing an aspect... If I write an article like: "Religious persecution under king David's reign" or something such, I could write an encyclopedic article. I could of course, as well, write something like: "Religious persecution under Judaism." While this seems to be about the same thing as the article voted for deletion, it is not. In the same token, I could write an article, like; "Religious persecution under Islam." This will be an encyclopedic name, but not: "Religious persecutions by Muslims," or even more direct: "Religious persecution by Arabs" (I'm making the comparison, because being a "Jew," is not only being part of a religion, but as includes the ethnic group.) But I could write: "Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes." It is permitted to write about an aspect, or a system, etc. but not to generalize directly. Guilt by association is simply not encyclopedic. One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization. Having said all this, I think that the problem is not only with the name, but what the name could permit to write in the article, in this cases. We can not write with such a subject(the name of the article/subject), a real NPOV article, so it will be unwiki, and it's existence will inevitably lead to failure." <font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 20:23, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You say: <i>One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization</i>, but you suggest that <i>Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes</i> would be a valid title, which is inconsistent because the latter title is also a generalisation. You fail to give a reason why such generalisations should be avoided. Obviously, the article with a title like <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> does not imply that all muslims persecute all the time, merely that at some point in time group(s) was(were) persecuted by Muslims in a manner which warrants an encyclopedic article. Quite frankly, I don't understand the point you are trying to make I suspect that there is none. -<a href="../../../d/v/_/User%7EDv_9a01.html" title="User:Dv">Dv</a> 20:45, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

It lacks some information concerning internacine persecution of various Muslim factions. I only hope it might be helpful in deciding the issue.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> because religious intolerance is a real and important phenomenon, both past and present. It cannot be properly studied just focusing on victims, because then you lose sight of its causes.

<dd>I agree, that should be the <i>final</i> solution. Just one article with an overview section (dedicated to <i>general</i> forms of intolerance: the "how's") and then specialised historical sections on "intolerance by whom, where and when". However this requires putting together historical knowledge from widely different fields.

<li>I agree with you, but I don't think this article (or the other 2) has much potential, as the title alone assumes Muslims (or Jews or Christians) are monolithic in their (mis)behavior.

<li>The historical fact itself is not POV, it's the way it's framed.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> all three, the template, and everything else related to this project. It's just a bad idea, destined to piss off everyone at the same time. In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>

<dd>German, how do we know whether the reasons are religious? How would you define the examples above? In one case it was a group of Christians slaughtering Jews for the crime of being Jews, but it was not explicitly religiously motivated. In the next case, it was a lone crazy Jew who killed Muslims because of their religion, but did not represent a wider religious group. In the final case, Islamists were attacking others for religious reasons, but it is not clear whether the attack was persecution or not. The issue is that these articles seem destined to turn into a dumping ground for a list of everything that anyone of that religious affiliation has ever done wrong. Until someone defines the article series better, and what religious persecution is (as opposed to nationalist persecution, etc.), I would strongly urge to delete. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:29, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>GoodOldPolonius, I think it is not so difficult to find that out. If the perpetrators of persecution cite religious sources and religious reasons and those reasons are supported by theological evidence, we safely can assume it is religious persecution. Exactly because of that reason I added a section "Theological justification for/against persecution" in order to make this clear. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 07:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That begs the question - lots of people appeal to religious motives, others do not cite religious reasons, but their actions are clearly religiously motivated. And what "religious persection" is remains anyone's guess. A good way to start would be for you to catagorize the three examples I gave as religious persecution or not. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 04:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Difficult indeed, Goodoldpolonius. Because people consider a religion to be their supreme frame of reference, it would be more logical for someone to attribute non-religious violence to religion than the opposite (unless it is all part of a propaganda war, in which it would be opposite in order to prevent defamation of the own religion). It is quite impossible to look into the perpetrators brain, so we have just their words and actions available as a reference. And the validity of the religious motives they gave.</dd>

<li>Christians killing a Jew for being a Jew per se are not acting per religious reasons, as there are no reasons in the Bible to kill Jews, except for the supposed responsability of the Jews for the crucifixion of Christ. This, however, contradicts the Christian dogma that Jesus died for all sins, including the sins of the Jewish perpetrators and the fact that according to the canonical <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a> Jesus asked for forgiveness for the ones who persecuted him. It can be cited as a (misguided) religious motivation, however.</li>
<li>The lone Jew who kills Muslims because of their religion can act because of religious reasons or not, I do not know enough about Talmud and other contemporary Jewish writings. The <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenach.html" title="Tenach">Tenach</a> does not mention Islam, so cannot be used as a source for anti-Muslim violence. Only when Muslims are considered to be enemies of the people of Israel (as some right-wing Zionist groups do) there exists a religious reason for killing them as far as I understand Judaism.</li>
<li>The Sharm el-Sheikh attacks are partially motivated by religious reasons because of the suicide bomber element. A secular terrorist will attribute more value to hios life and will not expect a reward by God for his act (thus will choose another method of terrorism, like remote-control), while a religiously miotivated terrorist will and therefore prefers suicide as a sure means for achieving Paradise. There are some theories, however, that the harsh treatment by the <a href="../../../m/u/k/Mukhabarat.html" title="Mukhabarat">Mukhabarat</a> of Sinai Bedouins has motivated the killers. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 09:14, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Now you have me truly baffled (leaving aside the Jews killed Jesus bit which seems to be in your first response). Christian persecutions of a group is not religious persecutions unless the source documents of Christianity demand that that group be persecuted? So attacks on witches are religious persecution because of the commandment against witches, but the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel_against_Jews_e798.html" title="Blood libel against Jews">blood libels</a> are not, because there is no commandment to persecute Jews? I am not even sure what your definition is, but it seems to require at the very least knowing the motivation of the persecution (which is often unclear) and a universal interpretation of each religion (which is not possible). Motivations for persecutions against other religions are usually multicausal, so how would you decide what is religiously motivated and what is not? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 15:37, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Right, you summarize it well. Note, however, that everything which violates the Highest Commandment as per Jesus, is in violation of Christian teachings. So persecuting witches is wrong, but Christianity commands them to be banned from a church or other religious group of Christians. However, agreed to some extent: religiously motivated persecution can still be a violation of the teachings of that religion. The persecution then results from a twisted interpretation of the religion. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 12:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The persecutions of Jews because of the host libel are indeed persecutions and they were committed by Roman-Catholic Christians. It seems like a kind of cooked-up story to motivate antisemitism.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this should be dealt with by Religious persecution by Mu'tazilites, or by early Hanafis or whatever group... as SlimVirgin said it's a POV magnet and there is no persecution by Muslims as a whole entity, but different groups and schools of thought have persecuted different things, there is no doubt in that. I would have no problem if this was a disambig page called Religious persecution by Muslim groups that linked to persecution by sects, that seems reasonable because at that level this can be dealt with in a way that is sane and not blanketing saying Qur'an quotes for and against persecution. Because, it is obvious that different groups have interpretted those verses differently. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 16:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Gren, according to what you say, there seems to be a lot of confusion between Muslims themselves whether persecution is allowed or not and which incarnations of persecution are allowed or recommended. So, exposing the reasons why Muslims persecute others and what is the textual evidence which allows or contradicts persecution seems to be of encyclopedic interest. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGermen_dad1.html" title="User talk:Germen">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Germen_c63b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Germen">Contribs</a> <a href="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/a/ab/Nl_small.gif" alt="" width="25" height="11" longdesc="../../../n/l/_/Image%7ENl_small.gif_5a64.html" /></a>) 16:32, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no Islamic ruling on persecution different Muslims have interpretted it in different ways. Also it is impossible to tell teh difference between political / power / and religious motivations. While I have no problem reporting what motivations can be cited for a Muslim group's persecution of another I think that what you want is exactly why this article should not stand as it does now. There is no answer that will give you the magical key to why some Muslims do what they do. And citing the Qur'an without references because an editor feels they justify persecution is original research... and that is precisely what is to be avoided. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 16:48, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>That doesn't prove that this article has an anti-Islam agenda. It proves that it is his opinion that the world would be better off without Islam.

<li>At the same article you can read why I believe a NPOV is sufficient to state my point, because I have objective reasons for this belief.
