<li>We really should have a "Wikipedia is not a memorial" page that we can link to in cases like this - I miss my grandfather too; he was a wonderful person and I know lots of stories about him and he loved to paint so my parents' house is full of his paintings, but he never became famous for it.

<li>I believe that articles about every one publication is in no way necesarry. But I think it is appropriate to have a list over Watchtower publications. So the articles about brochures and books should be kept going, but with some changes. Some of the books, however, could be described in their own articles. Summer Song</li>

<dd>Changing my vote to <b>delete</b> as I think the article in its' present form + the misspelling of the title is bad. I intende to reincarnate it as a description of these types of publications by JW's with proper spelling of the title and no links for each publication.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. While there was a majority decision to delete the current version, there was a promise to improve the article which influenced subsequent votes. I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one a <b>keep for now</b> and mark it with a "cleanup" tag. If not substantially improved in a reasonable amount of time, it may become appropriate to renominate the article for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>. All of this is publicly available, factual, and provable with no more than a quick internet search. You will also note that there is not a single statement of opinion in the article. I would ask you to consider what I have written and not who has written it. Also I would note that <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcore_fe59.html" title="User:Darkcore">Darkcore</a>, who nominated this article for deletion, has been quarreling with me for quite some time on another matter. You were stressing the importance of a NPOV? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisritch_ea5d.html" title="User:Travisritch">Travisritch</a> 01:57, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Umm... this has nothing to do with old, old discussions (which I would hardly call quarreling) regarding the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_College_6480.html" title="Upper Canada College">Upper Canada College</a> article, where you were quick to infuse your pro-UCC propaganda.

<li>You only have to look at the Talk page for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> article to see that a number of people find the heavy use of titles to be POV. Also phrases such as 'His accomplishments have earned him great respect in the islands' tend to be viewed as too subjective for an encyclopedia. Personally, I feel receiving an OBE is a sign of notability, but I'd need the article to be edited for tone in some sections. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 11:18, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Granted, although that isn't really a matter of opinion. You will find similar phrasing in many sources if you use a search engine from "Mr. Ritch is a self-styled known quantity when it comes to holding public office" to "one of the best commercial lawyers on the island." If it has to be edited to remain, I'd be willing to do that. Also, encyclopedias need to provide current and complete information. Just because he is a private citizen does not mean the use of his post-nominal titles is POV. Are we approaching a concensus here? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisritch_ea5d.html" title="User:Travisritch">Travisritch</a> 01:52, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>No.</b> A Google search of "David E. Ritch" brings 29 hits, at least 4 of which are from Wikipedia. A similar search of "David Ritch" "Cayman Islands" reveals less than 100 hits, most of which are lists (and not articles about him). In any other situation, that would fall under the bar of notability, regardless of how well regarded he may be in the Cayman Islands. Doing a search on my own lawyer revealed more hits than that, and he does not have a Wikipedia article (nor would I feel compelled to write one about him). <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcore_fe59.html" title="User:Darkcore">Darkcore</a> 02:09, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A powerful argument, to be sure. But, a gaping hole emerges: by that logic, ANYONE who hits high is a notable person! Notability is not defined by clout. Does Paris Hilton have an OBE? That is the whole point of the Honours system and more specifically the Order of the British Empire, which was created to honour notable private citizens <b>across the Commonwealth</b>. And what's with the perjorative comment about Cayman? It has world famous tourism, prominence amongst the remaining colonies, the 5th largest financial center <b>in the world</b>, etc. etc. Lastly, I'd just like to say, that this page is by far much less nonsensical, better written, and more deserving of being kept than the large majority of articles posted on VfD. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisritch_ea5d.html" title="User:Travisritch">Travisritch</a> 02:30, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My comment was hardly pejorative; calm down. We aren't talking about the Cayman Islands anyway.

<p>He received some 550 letters of congratulation for that, most of which said it was the best deserved honour the person had ever seen. It was the only investiture singled out for publication in the newspaper, even pictures of the Governor's CMG were not in the paper and he has an article on wikipedia chronicling his career. If you understood the amount of change that has gone on in Cayman in the last 25 years, you would know why the work he has done for the community and the Government is considered so significant. Gave up millions of dollars of his professional time to do this work. There are articles which are much more useless that you could be spending your time on. A lot of these VfD articles are bands without a record! Anyway, I'm really tiring of arguing with you conventionalist hawks. You prowl the VfD page, chanting and rechanting 'what Wikipedia is not,' and defining notability from your basement, and I'm just tired of it. I resign the fate of this discussion to the admin who reviews it. Travis Ritch</p>

<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s>. I suspect it could be rewritten as much less of a vanity piece/CV and focus on what establishes notability. Try starting with a strong lead paragraph. If you think you've salvaged it, drop me a note and I might vote to keep it. The way it reads now, it looks just below the bar. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:36, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Now there is something there to suggest why this person is notable. Unfortunately, it still reads too much like a CV and there is not enough <i>about</i> the notable aspects of this person. Still, I think there is enough there to establish <i>potential</i> for an encycolopedia article, so keep on the same basis we would keep a good stub. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:39, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What RedWordSmith said. Right now, what we have isn't much more than the technical specs but they would certainly be worth putting in a real article. It should be retitled as <a href="../../../m/s/c/MSC_Armonia_54ac.html" title="MSC Armonia">MSC Armonia</a> in the meantime. Given the cost, complexity and relative rarity of cruise ships, I believe they're more than encyclopedic. Many are promoted worldwide. In fact, I saw a couple docked in Puerto Vallarta that were absolute leviathans. I don't know which ships they were, but I can tell you they were a lot more substantial than the average Pokémon character. &#160;:^) - Lucky 6.9 18:23, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li>I believe there <i>was</i> something going that could fairly be called vote-stacking. I don't think this activity helps Wikipedia. But it is an obvious way in which it has always been possible to game the VfD system. It's also nothing new; the members of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AIW" class="extiw" title="m:AIW">m:AIW</a> have never made any secret about their intentions to act as a bloc, and have often publicized school VfD discussions on their page in Meta. I also believe there is absolutely no cure for this than wouldn't be worse than the disease. If I were the acting sysop on this I would count all the votes made by people to whom GRider sent emails, as I don't suspect any of them of being socks. GRider should not be surprised if this sort of activity engenders mistrust on my part, but perhaps he feels he will never have occasion to seek my cooperation. Meanwhile, I intend to continue to read VfD, vote in those discussions where I think I can contribute or have strong feelings, cast my vote, and move on, and I advise others to do the same. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> makes a compelling point. (The school that I went to is just shy — no-one is completely sure about the founding date — of being 1100 years old at this point.) Being 150 years old may make a school stand out from the crowd in the United States, but it does not <i>in India</i>.<br />
There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of schools in the world. An encyclopaedia is not simply a directory. It contains knowledge, not mere information. To be worthy of an individual article an entity in a crowd of hundreds of thousands or millions has to stand out from that crowd. For a school, there has to be something more than can be inferred from the fact that it is a school (and thus has all of the acoutrements that that entails, such as enrollment, teachers, songs, crests, buildings, sports teams, and so forth). As <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> points out, this one has nothing.<br />
Furthermore: It is both saddening and amusing to see the block votes above. It's saddening to see <i>identical</i> votes being cast across all of the <i>different</i> articles, giving the impression that the voters have not in fact read the actual articles that they are purporting to be commenting upon. It's amusing to see the votes being cast in this case, given that <b>this school doesn't actually exist</b> by the name given. There is a Mahajana Pre-University College in Erode, which has gone by that name since 1971-1972. But even before that its name was Mahajana Higher Secondary School. The only <b>Mahajana High School</b> is in <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysore.html" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>, not <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erode.html" title="Erode">Erode</a>.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> but major rewrite needed. Hello everybody. Thank you for bringing up this discussion. I am the person who wrote this article. True. The article is biased. I worked for the Score Group for three years and have come to learn the operation in-depth. I came into contact with all aspects of their business and work very closely with the owners themselves, who I learn to sincerely appreciate. Having had some experience in this industry I came to the realization that what Mr. Fox had done over the years was not only a highly professional, respectful endeavour but also a benchmark to others in this field. Mr. Fox himself spent not less than 12 hours a day at the office and his attention to detail was unbearable to us, employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can call this smut, you can call it self-promotion, but the truth is that I felt I could truly make a contribution in this particular niche and about this particular magazine. I no longer work for them. I quit my job on October 2003 and presently do not maintain contact with anybody at the office so this article could hardly be construed as self-promotional. All this data can be easily verified by calling the company and talking to any of the owners or Human Resources Dpt.</p>
<p>Indeed, the article is biased but because of my personal appreciation of what they had given me over the years. This is why I agree that a rewrite may be needed. As you can see in my profile (contributions) I could not seriously be considered a spammer for this is the only article I wrote. I would specially take note at how hard I worked on this article given all the rewrite that took place. Some of the free samples about the magazine are mine, such as adult-magazine.ws. Other sites had been found on the net.</p>
<p>I am aware there could be conflicts of interest in this area and that some of the opinions voiced here may carry, perhaps, ulterior motives, but I may also be wrong about this and everyone participating here might have a sincere desire to make this article as impartial as possible. My understanding of the essence of wikipedia is that contributors are welcomed as long as they can prove to have some expertise in some areas and be willing to offer an impartial, wholesome view. I failed in the second aim but I invite others to help me rewrite this article in a way that can be accepted. Please bear in mind that I have left open most of the local links so that OTHERS could contribute as well. Further proof that I was not attempting to spam or create a promotional page. The article had been reviewed by others months ago (about 4 months) and was never objected. This makes me think twice about why it has raised concerns now...</p>
<p>Finally, I must apologize because of my language is not english, but spanish. So my effort in writing the article and communicating with you has been and is considerable.</p>
<p>Thank you. Wikirober 11:13, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Added: Regarding the comment 'Plus, I recommend replacing the cover scan with just the logo, as the illustration might cause offense'... I understand some people may prefer not to have breast models (dressed) pictured on wikipedia, even if it does not violate TOS, but if you remove this cover you remove the heart of what SCORE is about. Both showcased models, Julia Miles and Linsey Dawn Mckenzie (under contract) are closest to the true essence of what this organization is about. That cover hasn't been placed randomly but has been carefully selected among hundreds because of what those two ladies represent. There is NO other model that carries The Score Group legacy better than LDM. I believe this particular cover is an honest representation of their mark.</p>

<ul>
<li>A notability barrier is implicit for <i>the lists themselves as a whole</i>, but <i>not</i> necessarily for their individual entries. Indeed, one of the ways of including information that does not warrant an article in its own right is to include it within a list, providing context. Unfortunately, there's a tendency to over-wikify lists, especially lists of people. Then as a consequence of that people "helpfully" re-colour redlinks by adding sub-stub biographical articles that will never expand. And as the edit history of this article shows, we've <i>already had</i> non-notable deaf people added to it as redlinks at least once. <i>This</i> article does not make the inclusion criteria clear. It's title gives no clue that it is <i>not a "list of deaf people"</i>, neither does its opening paragraph, and one has to read to the <i>very end</i> of the preamble to see the phrase "notable for their leadership and accomplishments" occur at all. The case for renaming is a strong one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:27, 2005 Mar 2 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the author of the contentious entry, checking in to give his view. My reason for thinking that each chaper of this novel deserves a Wikipedia entry is best summed up in one of the comments above: 'We have articles for individual Star Trek episodes.' My reason for not starting out by putting all of this material on one page is that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_%28Chapter_11%29_ab57.html" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray (Chapter 11)">this one</a> is already getting prohibitively long. However, I appreciate that the preferred approach on Wikipedia is to develop material on one page and then divvy it up into separate pages when necessary. So if I've been presumptious in creating entries for individual chapters, and people vote to delete, merge, or whatever, then I will accept the decision with good grace and even help to do whatever is decided upon without losing any more of the content than is necessary. My ultimate ambition is to have as definitive a set of resources for a msterpiece of 19th century literature on Wikipedia as already exist for such geeky fictional universes as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>. But if I need to go about it in a different way, then I am happy to do so.<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientHaemovore_54c4.html" title="User:AncientHaemovore">AncientHaemovore</a> 17:59, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Addendum</i>. As an interim measure to clarify matters, I have created <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_%28chapters%29_b4dc.html" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray (chapters)">this new page</a> linking to each chapter entry I have created. If it is decided that these chapter entries are <i>not</i> to be deleted, then I will incorporate the list of links to them into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_9a90.html" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">this page</a>. If it is decided that these entries <i>are</i> to be deleted, then I will follow the good guidance of my fellow Wikipedians in sticking the material wherever they think it should go, if indeed they think it belongs on Wikipedia at all.</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and delete the empty shell, although I admire and encourage the author's attempts to write about the book. My central reservation is that I don't believe the chapters can be dealt with as individual items, without a lot of clumsy cross-referencing. If we are to assume that each chapter will be read about separately, we would have to re-introduce the characters, plot, setting, themes and so on with each article; and if we are to assume that the reader is to read about each chapter sequentially, they should all be in one single page. I believe that whereas deliberately episodic works such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Martian_Chronicles_3d14.html" title="The Martian Chronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a>, perhaps <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robinson_Crusoe_f001.html" title="Robinson Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Scarlet_f447.html" title="Captain Scarlet">Captain Scarlet</a> lend themselves to such atom-splitting, this book does not. On an equally important level, we must all remember that Wikipedia's articles are a journalistic collection of ordered, referenced facts from external sources, and not original essays, no matter how well-written. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 18:21, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You offer cogent reasons for merging the chapter entries that I've created, in particular your point that items to be read sequentially should only exist on a single page. One could argue that such items should spill over into vertically subordinate pages if they become too long, but that's not the same thing as creating a series of horizontally equivalent pages, as I've done with Oscar Wilde's novel. Whatever the outcome of this vote for deletion (and I repeat my offer to tidy up the mess myself if necessary, rather than leave the admins with the headache of 20 content-rich pages to merge and/or delete), I welcome the opportunity to reflect on what a Wikipedia entry should be. I'm sure this isn't the first time that a pedantic devotee of a book (or film, piece of music, etc) has come up against the limits of how minutely detailed Wikipedia content should be, and it certainly won't be the last. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientHaemovore_54c4.html" title="User:AncientHaemovore">AncientHaemovore</a> 19:29, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep, Merge, and Condense</b>. This is a lot of good work, and if there are entries on individual Star Trek episodes, as has been pointed out, a detailed entry on a very excellent book is only natural. Twenty detailed pages is too much, so make it one very good one.--SpiritGlyph 21:28, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>. This vote for deletion is no longer necessary, as I've just put the contentious page and all similar pages out of their misery myself. Ashley Pomeroy and SpiritGlyph have succeeded in convincing me that all of this content should be <b>kept</b>, <b>merged</b>, and <b>condensed</b>. I've therefore come up with a solution that will allow me to present the same information clearly, in significantly condensed form, on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_9a90.html" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">the existing page for The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>. If you go to that page and look under the heading '<b>Individuals referred to in the novel'</b>, you'll see that I've begun to do exactly that. I've also converted my 20 chapter pages, and my interim page of links to these 20 chapter pages, into redirects pointing to the main page for the novel. It only remains now for people to stick all of these redirects on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Redirects for deletion</a>, if they're considered redundant. Thank you for all your constructive criticism.

<dl>
<dd>Caughtem is a word of particular interest in Florida. It's origins are unknown, although it is suspected to be similar in meaning to gotem(speech). The word can be used in jubilant or otherwise celebratory situations, as well as if a person, place, or thing (see noun) is in a difficult situation requiring outside intervention. Caughtem is a controversial word because its similarity to gotem(speech) sometimes invokes cognitive dissonance during colloquial speeches as listeners are unable to distinguish differences in meaning.</dd>

<p>And here is another minor character from <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>.

ASoIaF is not as popular as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a>, but I'd say it rivals <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wheel_of_Time_a73a.html" title="The Wheel of Time">The Wheel of Time</a> or even <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28novel%29.html" title="Dune (novel)">Dune</a> in the fantasy genre. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 01:53, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Asha is hardly an important secondary character. She has only appeared in three or four chapters out of over 150 and has not done much of note.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I'll give Ms. de Bruyn the benefit of the doubt and assume she knew nothing about this absurd attempt to delete the article on the untrue premise that "one MUST ask for permission in advance". If such a principle was actually true, no journalism could take place except by permission of the subjects. I suspect what really happened is that someone created the article to be unilateral praise of Ms. de Bruyn and didn't realize it would be edited to NPOV. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:17, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC) <i>Update</i>: changing my vote to <b>Weak keep</b>. It's still of course quite ridiculous that we would delete an article just because the subject was under the mistaken impression that their permission was required.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was apparently created by an anonymous fan of hers. Several of us cleaned up the puffery, but that was months ago, so I don't think the deletion request is based on the NPOVing. Any copyvio has likely been reworded. Notability: She's one of the columnists listed at <a href="http://www.blueagle.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.blueagle.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueagle.com/</a> (though I admit I don't know their criteria), and she has a nonfiction book coming out later this year, so I'd be inclined to keep even without the Dutch notability. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:45, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, she doesn't seem all that notable, which the article makes reasonably clear. If this had been proposed for VfD in the normal way, I don't know that I would have voted to keep it, even though I don't think we should delete the article just because the subject objects to it. Actually, I don't see any reason why someone would object to it, either -- unless she finds it "damning by faint praise", or in this case, non-praise. I suspect that Antaeus Feldspar has pegged the situation pretty well. I'm inclined to vote delete anyway because of the notability issue, but the unreasonable demand to delete it makes me feel contrary. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 03:17, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm curious, if her book were published would that make a difference for you? Part of my thinking is that, with the article already in place, we might as well keep it, instead of deleting and then re-creating it later this year because her book has pushed her over the bar. My personal opinion, which I know others don't share, is that, if someone has written a serious nonfiction book, published by a genuine (non-vanity) publisher, and someone else has created an article about the author, then the article shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:17, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please,</b> will the people asserting that she is notable help the rest of us understand <i>why</i>?

She gets zero hits in Google groups (USENET), where right-wing commentators are frequently discussed.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonnotable, regardless of whether that's what the rude anonymous poster claiming to be her wants or not, because it's the right thing to do. I also would like to add that I have a big problem with the assumption that someone would be notable enough for an English language encyclopedia based solely upon Dutch notability. Google hits in Dutch are completely irrelevant for this vote.

<dd>Clarify: Dutch notability <i>is</i> relevant. This is the English language Wikipedia, not the culture-of-English-speaking-countries Wikipedia (<i>de facto</i> by practical considerations, perhaps, but not <i>de iure</i>). If, say, Dieter Bratwurst is notable enough in Austria to have an article in the German Wikipedia, he could have an article in English too, regardless of whether anyone has heard of him internationally. It's true that notability is <i>more readily established</i> on the Dutch Wikipedia, but that doesn't make it "irrelevant" here. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 01:49, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The idea of segregating adult themes -- especially on an article about a childrens' cartoon -- had ocurred to me when I first responded to Woohookitty's adding this to VfD. (I suspect it was probably one of the reasons the article was created separately in the first place, before I started adding to it.) That is, I believe, the only possible reason for not merging here, and I'm not convinced it's a strong enough reason.

<li>So does the article need to be re-written to be more encyclopedic, with verifiable sources? Yes, I think it does. I will volunteer to do that, once a decision is made as to where the article is going: Is it going to be a subsection of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>, or will it be a separate article? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 17:44, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd say <b>Merge</b>. I'm not too sold on keeping this subarticle seperate from the main one, and I made the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> article shorter on purpose (by moving the info on the various versions of the show to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_series_guide_8ca6.html" title="Scooby-Doo series guide">Scooby-Doo series guide</a>) so that more information about the show could be listed here. --<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b. Touch</a> 03:49, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. While interesting and valid, this information is not important enough for its own article. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 03:49, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
