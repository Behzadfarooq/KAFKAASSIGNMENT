Once worn to school by an innocent member of Whitecross G.A.C, little did we know that the bag upon young Paul Toners shoulders would one day represent the growth in football domination for the 'green nd whites', becoming a symbol of the titans that are Whitecross.</p>
<p>Now recgonised throughout d modern-day world as the eigth wonder of d world, the Whitecross Bag is not only a sporting statment, not only a fashion statment, not only a republican statment, but is now also a statment for general respect for Gaels throughout Ireland.</p>
<p>One day this bag will pass through the doors to Croke Park on the shoulders of an All-Ireland finalist (or a tourist), and until that day...we salute it! God bless Whitecross! nd God Bless the Whitecross bag!</p>

<p>Egro the troll is a notably underground creature, found in the deep forests of Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu. He is famously known as the father of Mephisto! Kim. Sightings have described him as an abnormally large, with cancerous freckles above his left eye, to which he is at slight unease. A Mohawk extruded from the fine hairs of his skull, which he made an effort to shape everyday. His teeth are described by witnesses as large and pointed; bearing in a manner that would scare the poor souls to undistinguishable liquids. Though normally an underground creature, Egro the troll can be witnessed in outbreaks of anger, usually caused by the confusion of his name to the word "Ergo." On other occasions, however, he may be found peacefully resting within the confines of his obese tree home, nestling between the tree bark and the liquid sap. He usually spends his days chewing on freshly stolen carrot sticks, as he is primarily an herbivore, despite his violent nature.</p>

<p>As a child, Egro would constantly frolic in daisies (never petunias, for he was extremely allergic) with a carrot out of his mouth; replicating an old man with an awkwardly placed cigar. These actions were immediately dropped once poor Egro ventured into the forest of Ents, where he met his arch enemy, THE Ent. Upon finding THE Ent, he was somewhat amused that an ugly creature besides himself rested within the area. Overcome with joy, but hiding his shyness, he devoted the first years of his life observing THE Ent, through a telescope he hand-carved from a sugar cane. It was during these somewhat stalking adventures that Egro encountered The Humble Living Tree, to whom he was automatically attached.</p>

<p>Making the Humble Living Tree into a suitable living area was a heavy task for young Egro, as he was young and unknowing to how to perform such tasks. He already decided that it was the interior that he wanted to live in, but to hurt the poor tree was against Egro's conduct. Rather, with a stick in hand, he started jotting down complicated mathematical solutions to which he would master the art of invisibility. He decided that that would be the only method allowing him to enter the tree at will, without causing any unfavourable harm to it. Beginning his discovery, Egro mastered the art of carving numbers into the hard dirt, his strength able to move rocks aside to complete his task. Decades later, when the plan was finalized, Ergo was an adolescent, with the art of invisibility within him. Centuries later, his work can still be witnessed in the dirt ground, where it reads in heavy strokes:</p>
<p><i>To be invisible,</i> <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i><i>f</i><i>X</i> + 9023478 + <i>a</i>5 / 8423487239 − −</span></p>
<p>Alas, the last numer was scratched away, thus proving why the 21st century has yet to learn from Egro's genius ways. Scientists have searched for years to uncover the number, though without success. This unknown final number has been recently called, "Egro's number."</p>
<p>After entering the Humble Living Tree, Egro automatically made himself at home, attaching a bed and feeding from the sap leaking from the wooden walls.</p>

<p>THE Ent had been secretly watching Egro while he endured on his quest for invisibility, secretly writing down every number of his sacred formula. Within their lair, they had grown an eventual army of mutant foxes to which they refused to name. They understood that Egro would eventually find out of their scheme to steal his plans, so they prepared the foxes at a ready to when he would start the first attack. However, this army seemed at lack of cause for large periods of time, as Egro did not realize for centuries that his plans had indeed been stolen (he did place valid copyright laws, so the fools were not only deceiving him, but breaking the law). To mobilize their troops of foxes, they spent these monotonous centuries scaring young children in their homes.</p>
<p>Egro did finally learn of THE Ent's deception, as he trembled upon the alteration to his precious formulas. Where the final number of the formula had been, he saw the root-print of what had once been his fatal attraction, THE Ent. Comparing his mental images of THE Ent to the markings where the number had been, he discovered an identical match. Following this, he was outraged. From then on, he understood that his soul purpose in life would be to destroy THE Ent.</p>

<p>Among many arguments and petty battles, one is known as the most history-altering. Previously, all battles have been held outside THE Ent's homeland: a secret land that has been uncovered only during the Battle of THE Ent Lair. On this glorious battle, THE Ent's nameless fox henchmen and Egro fought bravely, resulting in what seemed like no more than a stale-mate. Finally, mustering remaining strength he pushed them towards their homeland.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Egro was forced to flee from the battle because of the regrouping nameless fox, but he did uncover the lair. In further excursions, Egro became more tactful in his maneuvers, sneaking into the Ent's lair when it was vacant. This was not often the case, so he was forced to use his invisibility skills, though it weakened him greatly.</p>
<p>One excursion, he uncovers a pearl scent chest, bearing an enormous apple at the top. He was at first tempted to eat the fruit, but he resisted his temptation, realizing that it was most definitely a trap by THE Ent. Rather, he opened it slowly, revealing a small seed. Tucking the seed beneath his thick arm, he quickly escaped the lair unseen; besides a single nameless fox who sniffed the air the second that he left the entranceway.</p>

<p>It was within due time that Egro discovered that the stolen seedling was the son of THE Ent. With this in regard, his clever mind put together the facts like the pieces of a puzzle: surely this was an apple tree, like the one he witnessed on the glorious chest. He planted the seed a finger length from his beloved home, but found that it was not an apple tree that sprouted from the ground.</p>
<p>Coming out from his home one fateful morning on the 24th of February, he witnessed a child Ent extruding from the ground. At first, he was filled with anger that it was not an apple that he saw, but he was eventually filled for emotion for the small, crying Ent. As he placed the baby in his strong arms, he exclaimed, "MEPHISTO!" (It was customary in troll tradition to exclaim the child's first name).</p>
<p>Egro refused to tell Mephisto! of his original parentage, as he thought that the child would betray him had he found out the truth. Nonetheless, he raised him in the traditional troll ways, until Mephisto! became a wonderful replica of him. They traveled on several adventures, and Mephisto! soon learned all of Egro's passageways and safe-trails around Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu.</p>

<p>Egro was living a good life with Mephisto!, without ever once more returning to the Lair of THE Ent. However, when he was alone in the Humble Living Tree, his mind would often drift to the lair, where he witnessed the beautiful apple. It was, of course, that very apple that had caused him so many sleepless nights, drifting to pleasant dreams to when he would taste the apple in his mouth. However, it was only centuries later that Egro finally gave into his temptation.</p>
<p>On a starless night, when the sky was littered with no more than black, Egro left his Humble Living Tree, sneaking past a sleeping Mephisto! However, he had forgotten that he once trained Mephisto! the art of hearing your enemy at night, and Mephisto! had indeed heard Egro's departure. Slowly getting up, he followed him into the midst of the forest.</p>
<p>Upon entering the lair, Mephisto! could easily identify a spark in Egro's eyes. Once Egro met the pear scent, without warning he lunged towards it, his heavy weight slumping nearby. It was at this the Mephisto! exclaimed, though he was too late to witness his fatherly figure with an enormous, red apple in his mouth, chewing greedily. Following is an excerpt of their final conversation, recorded by a nameless fox henchman who was watching nearby:</p>
<p>"The temptation has overwhelmed me, Mephisto!Kim. You must understand what I am to say to you, for I will surely die for my grace mistake," was the voice of Egro, speaking shakily, as his body drew closer to the ground.</p>
<p>Mephisto! hurried beside him, laying down his blade and watching him, confusion trailing his eyes.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" was all he was able to muster.</p>
<p>"I am not your father, for you were a seedling of THE Ent," Egro spat, tears filling his eyes for the first time in his existence.</p>
<p>Mephisto! looked dumbstruck, and Egro continued before he was able to remark.</p>
<p>"You may despise me for the rest of your living life for what I have lied, but please... hold your anger until my very last breath."</p>
<p>"No!" was what Mephisto! exclaimed, throwing himself at the troll, while explaining that Egro would always be his father. He said it over and over, in voices so loud that it was sure to wake the entire forest of Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu was to hear, but surely not one. Not the one that had fallen to his death beside him: with his breath empty and his body lifeless. The only living thing was the luscious apple by the side of his arm; half-eaten, red, and still in a way that a killer would stand, immediately after destroying its victim.</p>

<b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>Starlight Temple Society is a secretive organization with ties to various <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">Occult</a> and political fringe groups as well as the black metal underground scene via a label &amp; distribution service. STS states that it's goals are to aid in the deconstruction of modern civilization so that a new and better civilization may take it's place. (1)</p>
<p><b>Label</b></p>
<p>Starlight Temple Society uses a label/mailorder service in order to connect with various individuals worldwide. They have a small (but seemingly growing) list of items that span the genres of literature &amp; music, ranging from Occult books to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a> literature to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkwave.html" title="Darkwave">darkwave</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic.html" title="Electronic">electronic</a> music. Their first release was by a band known as <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alioth.html" title="Alioth">Alioth</a> (featuring Cult Of Daath members) which compose a style of atmospheric/death metal music similar to bands like <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varathron.html" title="Varathron">Varathron</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorphis.html" title="Amorphis">Amorphis</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetary.html" title="Cemetary">Cemetary</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acheron.html" title="Acheron">Acheron</a> &amp; <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septic_Flesh_6cbd.html" title="Septic Flesh">Septic Flesh</a>. (2)</p>
<p>The goal for STS's label/distro service is mostly ambiguous, however the official website states that they wish to disseminate quality items while networking with their contacts. (1)</p>

  Visual memory is held in the iconic membrane.  These memories don't last as long as auditory memories last.  'Seen' memories only last for approximately half a second.  Also like auditory memories; visual memories can become long-term memories.

<pre>
    Fred Stein was born on July 3, 1909 in Dresden, Germany. His father was a rabbi and his mother was a religion teacher. As a teenager he was deeply interested in politics and became an early anti-Nazi activist. He was a brilliant student, and went to Leipzig University, full of humanist ideals, to study law. He obtained a law degree in an impressively short time, but was denied admission to the German bar by the Nazi government for “racial and political reasons.” The threat of Fascism grew more and more dangerous and after the SS began making inquiries about him, Stein fled to Paris in 1933 with his new wife, Liselotte Salzburg, under the pretext of taking a honeymoon.
</pre>
<pre>
    In Paris they were in the center of a circle of expatriates, intellectuals and artists. In the midst of upheaval, gathering war, and personal penury, Stein began taking photographs. He was a pioneer of the small, hand-held camera, and with the Leica which he and his wife had purchased as a joint wedding present, he went into the streets to photograph scenes of life in Paris. He saw hope and beauty where most people would only see despair. He also became acquainted with and photographed some of the leading personalities of Europe.
</pre>
<pre>
    When Germany declared war on France in 1939, Stein was put in an internment camp for enemy aliens near Paris. He managed to escape, and after a hazardous clandestine journey through the countryside, met his wife and baby girl in Marseilles, where they obtained visas through the efforts of the International Rescue Committee. On May 7, 1941, the three boarded the S.S. Winnipeg, one of the last boats to leave France. They carried only the Leica and some negatives.
</pre>
<pre>
    New York was a vibrant center of culture, and Stein seized the opportunity. He met and photographed writers, artists, scientists, politicians, and philosophers whose work he knew through his extensive reading and study. This enabled him to engage them in conversation during portrait sessions. He continued his fascination with humanity, walking through the streets of New York, documenting life from Fifth Avenue to Harlem. He worked unobtrusively and quickly, valuing the freedom to capture the telling moment that reveals the subject in its own light, not as incidental material for photographic interpretation. He preferred natural or minimal lighting, and avoided elaborate setups as well as dramatic effects. He did not retouch or manipulate the negative. Stein was a member of the Photo League until he became disenchanted with their pro-Communist sympathies. Though portraits were his main income-generating work and he photographed many people on commission, he generally worked without assignment, shooting people and scenes that interested him. He would then offer his work to publishers and photo editors of magazines, newspapers, and books.
</pre>
<pre>
    Stein died in 1967 at the age of 58. Though not a self-promoter, his portraits and reportage had appeared in newspapers, magazines, and books throughout the world. His portrait of Albert Einstein is his most famous picture: an iconic image of a great soul. He also lectured and held a number of one-man exhibitions and had several books published

<p>AJ Price was not a common household name when he played football in the 1970's. Price had a short, 6 year career as an NFL Defensive End. His career lasted until 1977 Price played on one team, the Denver Broncos. Price was a backup defensive lineman, that was only known byhis teammates for his ability to speak. Price was always trying to call the plays, and would not let the referees do their jobs. in the locker room, he would lead the team in war chants to get them ready for the game. Price now lives in texas where he lives with his wife Trisha.</p>

<p>This list uses the following conventions. Heirs are determined according to cognatic primogeniture as currentlt in use in the United Kindom. However, where the throne was usurped the heir has been determined by reference to the actual King.</p>
<p>In the list, subsequent Kings and Queens are in CAPITALS. Heirs apparent are in normal typeface and heirs presumptive are in italics.</p>
<p>William I claimed the throne of England by right of conquest on 14 Oct 1066. His eldest son, Robert, was his heir although William reportedly wanted to disinherit him. He was persuaded to divide his dominions between his two eldest sons. Robert succeeded to the Duchy of Normandy and his brother William to the throne of England. At the time of their father's death, the two brothers made an agreement to be each other's heir so Robert remained the heir.</p>
<p>When William II died on August 2, 1100, Robert should have inherited the throne of England. However he was on his return journey from the First Crusade which enabled his youngest brother, Henry, to seize the throne of England. Robert then led an invasion of England to retake the throne. This failed and he was was forced to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. However, had Henry died at this time we assume that Robert would have succeeded to the throne despite the treaty as there are no other heirs.</p>
<p>On the birth of Henry’s first child that child became the heir. Some records have William Atheling born in 1101 and his sister Matilda born in 1103. Others have Matilda born in Feb 1102 and William Atheling in Nov 1103. We assume the former to be correct.</p>
<p>The list therefore starts as follows:</p>
<p>14 Oct 1066 Robert (as heir to William I) 9 Sept 1087 Robert (as heir to William II) 2 Aug 1100 Robert (as heir to Henry I) 1101 William Atheling 26 Nov 1119 Richard (drowned on the White Ship with his brother but under modern legal doctrine, being younger, deemed to have died after his brother) 26 Nov 1119 Matilda</p>
<p>On the death of her brothers in 1119 Matilda received the oath of fealty as Heiress Presumptive. However, on Henry I’s death on 1 Dec 1135, Matilda’s claim to the throne was usurped by Henry’s nephew, Stephen.</p>
<p>1 Dec 1135 Baudouin Dec 1135 Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne, 10 Aug 1152 William II, Count of Mortain and Boulogne</p>
<p>In 1152, Matilda renounced her claim to England in favour of Stephen for his life with remainder to her son, Henry. By virtue of the Treaty of Wallingford, also known as the Treaty of Winchester and as the Treaty of Westminster, finally signed at Westminster in November 1153, it was confirmed that Henry was Stephen’s heir.</p>
<p>Nov 1153 HENRY (subsequently Henry II) 25 Oct 1154 William 1156 Henry, Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, the Young King 11 June 1183. RICHARD (subsequently Richard I) 6 July 1189 Arthur, Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond</p>
<p>On Richard I’s death on 6 April 1199, his younger brother, John, usurped Arthur’s right to the throne and proclaimed himself King. However, in the absence of any sons or living brothers, John’s heir must have been Arthur.</p>
<p>6 April 1199 Arthur, Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond 3 April 1203 Eleanor of Brittany 10 Oct 1206 HENRY (subsequently Henry III) 19 Oct 1216 Richard, Earl of Cornwall 17 June 1239 EDWARD (subsequently Edward I) 16 Nov 1272 Henry 14 Oct 1274 Alphonso 19 Aug 1284 EDWARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward II) 8 July 1307 Thomas, of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk 13 Nov 1312 EDWARD (subsequently Edward III) 7 Jan 1327 John, of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall 15 June 1330 Edward, The Black Prince, Prince of Wales 8 June 1376 RICHARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Richard II) 22 June 1377 Philippa, Countess of Ulster, 5 Jan 1378 Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March 20 July 1398 Edmund, 5th Earl of March,</p>
<p>Richard II was deposed by his cousin Henry IV on 30 Sept. 1399 and Edmund, Earl of March’s claim to the throne was ignored.</p>
<p>30 Sept 1399 HENRY Prince of Wales (subsequently Henry V) 21 March 1413 Thomas, Duke of Clarence 22 March 1421 John, Duke of Bedford 6 Dec 1421 HENRY Prince of Wales (subsequently Henry VI) 31 Aug 1422 John, Duke of Bedford 15 Sept 1435 Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,</p>
<p>With the death of the last of the King’s uncles, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, on 23 Feb. 1447 the heir is unclear. None of his uncles or aunts had any heirs so it is necessary to revert to his great uncles and great aunts, the children of John of Gaunt. Following this line the line descends through his daughter Philippa who married John I, King of Portugal. The heir is then Afonso V, King of Portugal.</p>
<p>If foreigners are ignored the line descends through Elizabeth, second daughter of John of Gaunt. The heir is then John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter.</p>
<p>If, however, the Beauforts, legitimated children of John of Gaunt, were entitled to inherit the crown, the heir would be Margaret Beaufort, subsequently Margaret Tudor and mother of Henry VII. We ignore this claim as the Beauforts were legitimated by Statute 20 Rec. II (1397), but were not thereby enabled to inherit the Crown.</p>
<p>We prefer the claim of the Duke of Exeter.</p>
<p>23 Feb 1447 John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter 5 August 1447 Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter 13 Oct 1453 Edward, Prince of Wales</p>
<p>Please note that with reference to the next few heirs, the heirs to Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III are all called Edward, Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>Henry VI was deposed by his cousin Edward IV on 4 March, 1461</p>
<p>4 March 1461 George, Duke of Clarence</p>
<p>Henry VI was restored in place of his cousin Edward IV on 9 Oct 1470</p>
<p>9 Oct 1470 Edward, Prince of Wales</p>
<p>Edward IV was restored on 4 May, 1471</p>
<p>4 May 1471 EDWARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward V) 9 April 1483 Richard. Duke of York</p>
<p>Edward V was deposed by Richard III who was proclaimed King on June 22, 1483</p>
<p>22 June 1483 Edward, Prince of Wales</p>
<p>Edward, Prince of Wales died on 31 March, 1484. In the absence of other information we must conclude that Richard’s heir was his niece, the eldest daughter of Edward IV and sister to Edward V.</p>
<p>31 March 1484 Elizabeth</p>
<p>Richard III was killed at Bosworth Field on 22 Aug. 1485 and was succeeded by Henry VII.</p>
<p>The heir at this time is unclear. The strict lineal heir (according to modern doctrine) of Edward III is Princess Elizabeth as she is the senior heir of Lionel of Antwerp through the marriage of Anne (sister to Edmund, 5th Earl of March, Heir Presumptive to Richard II – see above) to Richard of Coisburgh, Earl of Cambridge (heir of 2nd Duke of York). Henry VII was the Lancastrian Heir in right of his mother Margaret Tudor but her claim depended on whether the Beauforts were able to succeed to the Crown (see above). There was no other Beaufort claimant. The next heirs were the House of York, the legal representative of whom was Princess Elizabeth. We, therefore, conclude that Princess Elizabeth was Henry VII’s heir.</p>
<p>22 Aug 1485 Elizabeth (subsequently Queen Elizabeth as Henry VII’s Queen Consort) 20 Sept 1486 Arthur, Prince of Wales 2 April 1502 HENRY Prince of Wales (subsequently Henry VIII) 21 April 1509 Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland 1 Jan 1511 Henry, Duke of Cornwall 22 Feb 1511 Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland Nov 1513 Unnamed son Nov 1513 Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland Dec 1514 Henry, Duke of Cornwall Dec 1514 Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland 18 Feb 1516 MARY (subsequently Mary I)</p>
<p>The Princess Mary was disqualified from the succession by the First Succession Act of 1534</p>
<p>March 1534 ELIZABETH (subsequently Elizabeth I) 29 Jan 1536. Unnamed son 29 Jan 1536. ELIZABETH</p>
<p>The Princess Elizabeth was disqualified from the succession by the Second Succession Act of 1536. There was, therefore, either no heir or it was Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland. We prefer the latter.</p>
<p>1536 Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland 12 Oct 1537 EDWARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VI) 28 Jan 1547 MARY (restored to line of succession by Third Succession Act of 1543)</p>
<p>Having been brought up a Protestant, Edward VI had concerns about the succession having no desire to be succeeded by his older half-sister and devout Catholic, Mary. A will was, therefore, drafted leaving the Throne to his cousin Lady Jane Grey and her heirs-male. Lady Jane was the granddaughter of Mary, youngest daughter of Henry VII. Those senior to her in order of succession were disqualified as follows: Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because they were officially illegitimate, the heirs of Margaret, eldest daughter of HenryVII were excluded as being Scottish and the Duchess of Suffolk agreed to renounce her own claims. The will was illegal for many reasons; first, a minor did not have the authority to make a will and, secondly, Edward's will had not been authorised by any Act of Parliament, whilst Henry's will had been specifically authorised by an Act passed in 1544. We do not accept that Lady Jane Grey became Heiress Presumptive or Queen.</p>
<p>6 July 1553. ELIZABETH (restored to line of succession by Third Succession Act of 1543)</p>
<p>On her succession there was no clear heir to Elizabeth. The lineal heir was Mary, Queen of Scots although she wasn’t acknowledged as heir. However, as her son, James VI of Scotland, ultimately succeeded we regard Mary as Heiress Presumptive.</p>
<p>13 Sep 1558 Mary, Queen of Scots 8 Feb 1587 JAMES VI, King of Scotland (subsequently King James I of England) 24 March 1603 Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales 6 Nov 1612 CHARLES, Prince of Wales (subsequently Charles I) 27 March 1625 Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia 18 May 1629 Charles James, Duke of Cornwall 18 May, 1629 Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia 29 May 1630 CHARLES, Prince of Wales (subsequently Charles II) 30 Jan 1649 JAMES, Duke of York (subsequently James II &amp; VII) 6 Feb 1685 MARY (subsequently Mary II) 10 June 1688 James, Prince of Wales</p>
<p>Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689, the Convention Parliament convened and declared that James's flight from England on 23 December 1688 amounted to abdication. Mary, and her husband, William of Orange were then offered the throne as joint rulers. They officially acceeded to the throne on February 13, 1689. From 23 December 1688 to 13 February 1689 there was, therefore, an interregnum. However, we view Mary as the heir at that time.</p>
<p>23 December 1688 MARY 13 February 1689 ANNE (subsequently Queen Anne)</p>
<p>William III derived his throne from the hereditary right of his wife. We do not believe that any children of a subsequent marriage following the death of Mary II would be entitled to inherit the thrones of England and Scotland. Anne, therefore, became Heiress Apparent.</p>
<p>28 Dec 1694 ANNE (as Heiress Apparent) 8 March 1702 Electress Sophia of Hanover (granddaughter of James I) 8 June 1714 GEORGE, Elector of Hanover (subsequently George I) 1 Aug 1714 GEORGE, Prince of Wales (subsequently George II) 11 June 1727 Frederick, Prince of Wales 20 March 1751 GEORGE, Prince of Wales (subsequently George III) 25 Oct 1760 Edward, Duke of York and Albany 12 Aug 1762 GEORGE, Prince of Wales (subsequently George IV) 29 Jan 1820 Frederick, Duke of York and Albany 5 Jan 1827 WILLIAM, Duke of Clarence (subsequently William IV). 26 June 1830 ALEXANDRINA VICTORIA (subsequently Queen Victoria). 20 June 1837 Ernest Augustus, 1st Duke of Cumberland, King of Hanover, 21 Nov 1840 Victoria (Princess Royal) 9 Nov 1841 ALBERT EDWARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VII) 22 Jan 1901 GEORGE, Prince of Wales (subsequently George V) 6 May 1910 EDWARD, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VIII) 20 Jan 1936 ALBERT, Duke of York (subsequently George VI) 10 Dec 1936 ELIZABETH (subsequently Elizabeth II) 6 Feb 1952 Charles, Prince of Wales, current Heir Apparent</p>

In Hinduism, Manasa is a naga and goddess of fertility. She is popularly known as the goddess of wish fulfilment and one who protects against snakebite. She is also associated with the earth and higher knowledge. Though she is venerated mostly in eastern India, some of her well known temples can also be found in other regions, such as Hardwar and Chandigarh.</p>
<p>Manasa is said to be the daughter of Kasyapa, a famous sage, and Kadru, the sister of the serpent-king Sesha. Unlike her uncle, Manasa is still actively worshipped as a goddess who protects and saves humans from snake-bites. Her cult is most prevalent in Bengal where she is ceremoniously worshipped in temples. She is also attributed with the powers of curing infectious diseases like small-pox and of bringing wealth and prosperity. At the onset of the rainy season, when the snakes are most active, she is ritually invoked with sacrifices and offerings. She is probably a pre-Aryan goddess but this tale is of more recent vintage and comes from Bengal where she is most revered and tells how she gained recognition for herself as a potent member of the Hindu pantheon.</p>
<p>There is also another legend behind Manasa, who is considered to be daughter (out of wedlock) of Lord Shiva. Manasa requested Shiva to include her in the pantheon, so that she is worshipped by humans. Shiva responded to it by saying, if the merchant (king?) Chand (of Anga kingdom) agrees to worship you, you will be included amongst the goddesses. When Manasa approached Chand, he refused to worship her. This infuriated Manasa, and she killed all his sons. After this event, Chand's wife Sonika gave birth to their seventh son Lakhinder (also referred as Bala). Manasa's wrath had not been pacified even by the time when Lakhinder's marriage to Bihula was fixed. She vowed to kill him on the Suhaag Raat (The night after wedding, when bride and groom sleep together for the first time). To counter the threat, Chand planned to construct an iron room for Lakhinder's Suhaag Raat. However, Manasa threatened the blacksmith as well, and asked him to keep a small pinhole in the room. As nobody noticed this hole, In the night, Manasa sent a very thin snake to enter the room through the pinhole. Once inside the room, this snake turned into a Cobra and bit Lakhinder, killing him instantaneously. Bihula overcame grief and built a boat to go to Heaven to present this injustice to gods. Lakhinder was then revived by the gods. During the return from Heaven, Bihula managed to persuade Chand to worship Manasa. Chanda grudgingly agreed to worship her with his left hand. To this day, Manasa is the only Hindu goddess worshipped by the left hand. In the Anga region, she is also known as Bishahari and worshipped to prevent snake-bite related deaths. The boat created by Bihula was made up of jute straws (Manjusha) and paper. This led to development of Manjusha art, which is now on verge of extinction.</p>

Alan Scott Young, born February 25th 1948 in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, has achieved the highest status of Rittersport eating, star trek watching and Backgammon playing. He also is one of the fittest of his town; playing volleyball every friday, chopping wood, walking the dog when no one else wants to..- his calfs are hard as stone. But what Alan Scott Young is most renowned for is leaving stinkies in the bathroom. For this he is a pro. Stay on your guard when its time to do the dishes, as that is the time of day when he marks his bathroom territory the most frequently. For all these reasons and more, his beautiful French wife and two daughters will always love him! HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY!!!! &lt;img src=<a href="http://a855.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/52/l_0ba717509d5104585004cb0656a16696.jpg" class="external free" title="http://a855.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/52/l_0ba717509d5104585004cb0656a16696.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://a855.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/52/l_0ba717509d5104585004cb0656a16696.jpg</a>&gt;</p>

<p>Baal Dan is a charity that helps children in need in India - street children, orphans, and children who are ill or malnourished. In Hindi, Baal means child, and Dan means gift or donation. Baal Dan was founded by Tanya Pinto in 2006 after she volunteered at an orphanage in Calcutta. There are over 18 million street children in India - the most for any country in the world. Baal Dan provides clothes, food, medicines, toys, school supplies, and other necessities for these children. Baal Dan also supports existing programs that help provide care and an education for street children and orphans so that they can build a future for themselves. The website talks more about their mission, history, and also includes photos, videos, and a blog.</p>

Fred Kaan was born in a terraced house in Voorhelmstraat, a treeless street in the North Holland city of Haarlem on 27 July 1929. The years of early adolescence coincided with the Nazi occupation of Holland. His father was a member of the Dutch Resistance, and for two years the Kaans sheltered a Jewish woman in their home, and later gave refuge to an escaped political prisoner.</p>
<p>In 1952, having offered himself for the Congregational ministry, he left Holland and entered the Western College, Bristol, graduating at Bristol University in 1954. After a postgraduate year which included sociology and pastoral studies, Fred was called to be minister of Windsor Road Congregational Church in Barry, South Wales and ordained in 1955.</p>
<p>Moving to Pilgrim Church in Plymouth in 1963, Fred began work on a home made hymn supplement entitled Pilgrim Praise. Fred’s hymn writing was born of necessity, out of the frustration of not finding what he wanted in the established hymnbook for next Sunday’s worship, and out of eagerness to put into words those things which were close to his heart and conscience.</p>
<p>Fred received the call to office of the Minister-Secretary of the International Congregational Council in Geneva in 1968, a post he held until 1970 when he became an executive secretary of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. His period in Geneva involved many other roles including staff member of the World Council of Churches working on Cantate Domino – the international and ecumenical hymnal.</p>
<p>A decade of work based in Switzerland ended in 1978 when Fred was appointed as Moderator of the West Midlands Province of the United Reformed Church. Characteristically refusing to renew this appointment in 1985, as a gesture against ‘hierarchical thinking’ within the Church, he subsequently became team minister of the Central (Ecumenical) Church, Swindon, and minister of Penhill United Reformed Church.</p>
<p>From 1993-7, Fred combined his busy life of travel and public speaking with the role of Secretary of the Churches’ Human Rights Forum. The internationalism that has been so central to Dr Kaan’s ministry over the years has also characterised his family life. His first wife, Elly Steller (1928-93), was born in Indonesia of German and Dutch missionary parents. His elder son is married to a Swede; his younger son married a Hungarian and his daughter an Englishman.</p>
<p>Fred and his wife Anthea Cooke, have recently moved to the Lake District. ’ The view from the lounge and study is stunning, with mountains all around’, writes Fred on his faithful typewriter. Anthea is the local GP, but her first appointment was at a Church of South India hospital in Madras. Between them the Kaans have a command of nine different languages (not counting Latin, Greek and Hebre</p>

<p>An argument held by young earth creationists that when God created the earth it appeared to be older than it actually is. Therefore the age of the earth is 6000-7000 years old, derived from adding together all the ages patriarchal ancestors of king david.</p>

<p>Teco-Studios is a free gaming website with fun games that were made in macromedia flash pro 8. Their games such as the flash version of brothers in arms were promised to be made 3D in two years though Teco-Studios has alot of games that are possibly made in 3D they only meant <i>Brothers in arms</i>. Teco mainly opened in September 2006 and though they got a place quickly in the gaming world since they are making a 3D version of Brothers in arms which is really what [<a href="http://www.ubi.com/ENCA/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ubi.com/ENCA/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]UBISOFT invented. Teco then moved up with a big start for a beginning with a Studio team which made them real and popular though Teco was not always called Teco-Studios. The reason they did not deal with games long is because of the many accomplishments.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Teco was not only a Studio in history, Gaming was the solution for Teco but there was a problem! Teco needed their own games. They started by studying flash but currently shockwave though they are going for everything at one time.</p>

<p>Teco has tryed to learn it all at a time and always has done so like when they learn how to make a online multiplayer Game right away. Many Teco games were done completly by one person whcih makes Teco rare. Teco Studios was formerly with others things rather then games such as chat. Then they moved on to PC games that were in flash since they just started though now they are studying 3D and the team has a professinal 3D modeler they are planning to need in 2 years or one month after the realese of <i>Brothers in amrs earned in blood flash version</i> that is a online multiplayer game.</p>

<p>This is a person. A person with the nick name of BCor. Some people think that he is quite the cool person. Others think that he is like cow doo doo on the bottom of your shoe. As it writes in the book <i>Italic text</i>That Little Sunovabitch <i>Italic text</i>"He is a person that I am not for or against. Although he was a manic, he has become cool. Really cool" Now, that sounds like the author, John Doe was for the dude. BCor is the 14 year old's nickname, however. His real name is Barney Corkin. The boy has dreams of becoming the buggest actor in Hollywood. His grades are not the best, however. According to public record, the boy has a 61% in math, a 49% in Socal Studies, a 69% (that is an awsome number, by the way) in Gym, an 8% in Science, a 72% in Language Arts (probabily the easist class), and a 48% in Spanish (he's never going to move, anyway). The kid currently lives in a nice little house on 49 East Street in the town of Mansfield, Ohio. He lives there with nobody. He fends for himself. Well, thanks for reading, bye bye now.</p>
