<p>Verminous Skumm was a fictional villain in the animated televeision series <i>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</i>.</p>
<p>Verminous Skumm was a large half-man, half-rat mutant who wore a tattered blue jumpsuit with a red hood. Raised in the sewers, he preferred filth to cleanliness. Skumm hated humanity and declared war against mankind and the environment. In his first appearance(<i>Rain Of Terror</i>), he and an army of those like him start up an abandoned coal factory and burn excess coal to create a massive acid rain cloud to destroy a farming community. He would later steal nuclear weapons and hide them in various "hot spots" around the world(<i>If It's Doomsday, This Must Be Belfast</i>), giving the detonators to each side in a war, to prove that humans were self-destructive. And if they didn't use them, he would use his own detonator. The Planeteers stopped him before the bombs could go off, however. He was also one of the five to gain a Pollution Ring from Dr. Blight, which formed Captain Pollution(<i>Mission To Save Earth Parts I and II</i>).</p>
<p>Skumm also created a toxic mutation spray called Rat Rot(<i>Skumm Lord</i>), which could mutate humans into rat creatures like himself(note that it is never stated if his followers are mutants like him, or Rat Rot victims). He also created the highly addictive designer drug Bliss(<i>Mind Pollution</i>) and spread it throughout Washington, D.C. This led to the death of Linka's cousin Boris. Shortly after, he opened a seafood restaurant in San Francisco, selling highly poisonous food to the city's population(<i>The Big Clam-Up</i>).</p>
<p>Skumm was also the villain in the controversial episode <i>A Formula For Hate</i>, in which he spreads misinformation and lies about the AIDS virus to ruin a young victim's life.</p>
<p>In the Hanna-Barbera produced seasons however, Skumm would turn his focus away from his environmental war and focus more on stealing and selling artifacts to fund his operations, with environmental and monument defacement as a side project(<i>Nothing's Sacred</i>). He also had an interest in street gangs(<i>Talkin' Trash</i>).</p>
<p>Skumm was voiced by Jeff Goldblum in his first appearance, and by Maurice LaMarche in subsequent episodes.</p>

<p>To think you're good according to A.Staltari and A.Prtenjaca(who are both modern day geniuses)means that the person in their mind believes they are good in general in terms of their actions or how they behave in public. However if you think you are good that really means that you are not sure because you only "think". An example of this was produced by D.Staltari, the father of A.Staltari in which he stated that Rocco Faiello's brother (unknown name) thought he was good because of the way he walks. D.Staltari did not have physical evidence that Rock's brother actually said to himself, "I'm good".</p>

<p>東引高粱酒. (東引酒廠的所在地位於高緯度低溫海島型的環境，更是目前唯一採用古法自然發酵技術的台灣官方酒廠。因此唯有東引酒廠，可以,以時程最長的古法低溫發酵及嚴格的製造程序生產國內最高品質的高粱酒，因而造就了東引高粱酒的甘醇潤喉，飲後不口乾不打頭的特優酒質。)</p>

<p>A scratch technique attributed to DJ Flare. This technique was originally developed in the early 90's and transformed the scratch world. There are a number of variations of the scratch including the original flare, the one-click flare and the two-click flare. Flare techniques are a combination of moving the record back and forth while chopping the sound with the cross-fader.</p>
<p>An original flare is composed of a forward movement of the record with the fader open the sound is cut then out once, making two sounds on the forward stroke. You then cut the fader again and quickly pull the record back while opening the fader to catch the closing "chirp" of the sample.</p>

<p>www.hvafor.no is a webpage created by Christopher Conradi and Kim-Eigard Hines in a desperate attempt to mark ttheir spot in history, to leave something behind. even tough both are born in 1985 and are still considered young, the lust for creation was high.</p>
<p>Hvafor.no is norwegian and means is "what is it". This page is supposed to answer irrelevant and stupid questions from readers input.</p>

<p>Ryan Hammond was born somewhere in Illinois. We don't care where. He now resides in Frankfort, Illinois. He enjoys attending movies with his family about Black basketball players struggling against the fight with racism and hearing their perspective. He also enjoys feeling he has made people feel insignificant to himself, although, that is not true. Namely, Becca Kemp and Tyler Y. Ryan has been discovered to be a hoss. No one knows exactly what this word means. Quip Ska! Becca has never done anything rude to Ryan as far as I know. Who am i you ask. Ryan's *****</p>

<p>11millionpennies is the effort put forth by students at Plainview Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy Highschool (on Long Island) to commemorate the 11 million people who perished in concentration camps in the Holocaust. The students are going to collect 11 million pennies then put them in the bank and donate it to various charities, at least that is what they plan on so far, the project is still underway but they have currently collected over 4,000 pennies. A website put up by the students is currently underway (www.11millionpennies.org). The students have also registered www.11millionpennies.com in order to prevent anyone else from copying their idea, although it just redirects you to their main site. The project was concieved in their Facing History class in which students learn about stereotyping, prejudice, and genocide.</p>

<p>&lt;Urbano Lazzaro (died January 9, 2006 in Vercelli, Italy.) was a World War II Italian resistance fighter who fought with a Communist resistance group in northern Italy. He is credited with the capturing of Benito Mussolini,Italy's fascist dictator, near the end of the war in Europe. On April 27, 1945 as the resistance fighters searched the trucks, Lazzaro recognized someone disguised as a German soldier as "Il Duce". Lazzaro challenged the official story which was that Mussolini was tried in a summary court-martial and shot with his mistress (Claretta Petacci) Lazarro said that Mussolini and Petacci had in fact been dead for many hours when their "execution" took place. He said they died when Petacci tried to grab a gun from one of their guards. A few shots went off in the struggle and hit Mussolini, who dropped to the ground from the injury. The guards then finished him off on the spot and after that they shot Petacci for causing the mishap.The rest, Lazzaro told Reuters in 1995, was staged: "The times demanded an execution."</p>

<p>Riley Breckinridge is the drummer of experimental hardcore band Thrice. Also the older brother of Thrice bassist Eddie Breckinridge, Riley was asked to join Thrice during the early days of the band by recommendation of Eddie. Refered to as the 'no bullshit guy of the band' by Thrice's tour manager, Riley has made a image of himself as the joking and relaxed member of the group, but also able to be honest and mature when matters are important to him. Although not the 'frontman' of the band, he has still been a mature and reliable spokesperson for Thrice and what they believe in and attempt to achieve as a band, more predominantly so during the bands first formation when he was the eldest member by 6-7 years. He also is said to have the most appeal to women, however never exploits that fact. He is very fond of his family and especially his brother, Eddie, and frequently speaks out about his enjoyment for being apart of the band with his brother.</p>
<p>A Orange County Drum and Percussion endoresee, Riley has been playing the company's drums since after the first record was released. To date he owns 4 of their drum kits. He also used Zildjian cymbals, however experimented with Paiste cymbals during the recording and touring of The Artist In The Ambulance. He is also a Vater sticks endoresee, uses Remo Drum Heads and recently scored an endorsement with Drum Workshop for hardware and pedals. He also plays guitar and has written parts for some Thrice songs, although the band has not been specific about which parts in question.</p>

Mack and Mesh are an increasing popular double act with the successful “Mesh Does…” Series. Mesh is a nervous individual and doesn’t like to play scary games. His friend, Mack, then decided to take advantage of this and posted up a short clip of Mesh playing Doom III for PC onto the internet. Almost immediately thousands started to tune in and watch the show, with the increasing popularity it wasn’t long before more videos were made. It then spread to Mesh playing other popular titles, like Valve’s Half Life 2, for viewers to enjoy Mesh’s humorous comments and amusing reactions to playing video games. All the videos are available to download from their website. The "Mesh Does" series includes...</p>

At The FreeUse Network, members are encouraged to OFFER what they don't need and SEEK what they do!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's person-to-person recycling...using the power of the Internet. Members are encouraged to freeuse, freecycle, freeshare, and freegive...freely and for free.</p>
<p>The Network is based on Yahoo! Groups with each locale having a local volunteer moderator of the group. Groups can be linked to or started at the FreeUse Network's www.freeuse.org. An example of a very active FreeUse site is the one for Baton Rouge, Louisiana at <a href="http://www.freeuse.org" class="external free" title="http://www.freeuse.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.freeuse.org</a> or <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RedStickFreeUse/" class="external free" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RedStickFreeUse/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RedStickFreeUse/</a>.</p>
<p>The FreeUse Network is operated in a manner similar to The Freecycle Network, but it sets itself apart from The Freecycle Network in that FreeUse will never accept cash from a hazardous waste company or other comparable corporate giant, will never provide an income for it's volunteer founder, will never apply for trademark rights for the term 'freeuse', and will always stay true to it's grassroots, volunteer focus.</p>

<p>Yukio Mishima's first novel, Confessions of a Mask launched him to national fame though he was only in his early twenties. It is an account of a latent homosexual growing up in a Japan that is war-torn and consequently militaristic, both in the expectations it has for the behavior of its men, and in the work they must perform. Entirely unsuited by nature to this environment, the narrator must weave an intricate and profoundly self-defeating facade around himself. This mask leads him into a pitiful "affair" with a young woman which only redoubles his fear of his peculiarity, into decieving his parents, and into effectively becoming further estranged from himself the older he becomes. He claims at one point that his mind became like a strip of paper twisted once and attached at the ends; in essence, a circuitous loop that could neither escape from nor reflect upon itself. It also becomes fixated upon the link between sexuality and violence, and the narrator's tendency to dream in this vein is recounted with mixed feelings of horror and fascination. It is a work of emotional power that is muted yet intuitively sensed, of precise articulation of the mind-set of closeted homosexuals, and of gentle humor, albeit self-effacing.</p>

<p>Christoph Bernhard was born on 1 January, 1628, in Kolberg, Pomerania, and died on 14 November, 1692, in Dresden. He studied in Gdansk and Warsaw, and by the age of 20 was singing at the electoral court in Dresden under Heinrich Schütz. He then spent a year in Copenhagen to study singing with Agostino Fontana. After his appointment as assistant Kapellmeister in Dresden in 1655, Bernhard made two sojourns to Italy to further his musical education. When he was 35, he moved to Hamburg to work as the director of music for the Johanneum and for civic musical events. The next ten years were a golden time in the musical tradition of Hamburg: Bernhard and his good friend Matthias Weckmann performed together and directed the latest compositions from Italy and Vienna, as well as composing an important collection of music in finely-wrought counterpoint.</p>
<p>The Elector of Saxony recalled Bernhard to Dresden in 1674, where he returned as assistant Kapellmeister. Six years later, the large - and primarily Italian - musical establishment in the city was greatly reduced, until Bernhard remained the only Kapellmeister at court. He continued composing, directing and caring for the music library in Dresden until his death in 1692, at the age of 64. Bernhard left behind many sacred vocal works, a few secular compositions, and three important treatises on music, the most famous of which is the Tractatus compositionis augmentatus (c. 1657).</p>

<p>Johann Philipp Krieger was born around 27, February, 1649, in Nürnberg, and died on 6, February, 1725, in Weissenfels. He began his music lessons as a child in Nürnberg, studying keyboards with Johannes Dretzel and other instruments with Gabriel Schütz. A child prodigy, Krieger had already garnered praise for his compositions before he entered his teens. Then from around 1665 to 1670, he lived in Copenhagen, studying composition with Kaspar Forster and organ with Johannes Schröder, Court Organist. Immediately afterward, he was appointed Kapellmeister in Bayreuth, a post he held only one year.</p>
<p>After a short time in Zeitz, Krieger spent two years traveling in Italy: he studied with Abbatini and Pasquini in Rome and with Rosenmüller in Venice. On his way back to Germany in 1675, he performed in Vienna for the Hapsburg Emperor Leopold I, who ennobled him out of appreciation for his virtuosity. Passing first through Frankfurt am Main and Kassel, Krieger settled in 1677 in Halle an der Saale as court organist, a post he held for three years. At the age of 31, he was elevated to Kapellmeister in Weissenfels, where he remained until his death 45 years later. During his long and productive career, he composed 18 operas in German for the Weissenfels court, two sets of twelve trio sonatas, and some 2,000 church cantatas, of which only 76 have survived.</p>

<p>Georg von Reutter was born on 6, April, 1708, in Vienna, and died on 11, March, 1772, also in Vienna. He studied music first with his father, Georg Reutter, who was Court Organist to the Hapsburgs, then later with Antonio Caldara, who was Vice Maestro di Cappella in Vienna until his death in 1736. At the age of 22, Reutter enhanced his musical studies with a one-year educational tour of Italy, returning to Vienna to begin his first musical post: court composer.</p>
<p>Having already composed five operas, four oratorios and a serenata before beginning his official service to the Court of Charles VI, the young Reutter produced as his first official work the serenata La Generosità di Artaserse con Temistocle in honor of the emperor's 46th birthday. Soon followed a series of operas and serenatas on texts mostly by Pasquini and Metastasio; Reutter was to continue writing dramatic works for another 29 years, producing some 32 major secular vocal works. His focus moved toward religious music, however, when in 1738 he inherited from his father the post of Music Director at the Cathedral of St. Stephen. In the course of his career, Reutter composed over 500 works for the Church, including 81 masses, 126 motets and 6 requiems.</p>
<p>Despite declining imperial support for the musical establishment in Vienna during the reign of Empress Maria Teresa, who ascended in 1740, Reutter nonetheless was able to garner a series of titles and posts: knighted when he was 32, he became Assistant Maestro di Cappella at age 39, followed four years later by Maestro di Cappella pro-tem, then Director of Music for all of Vienna when he was 61. His mature works were to have a profound influence on the First Viennese School, and he was greatly admired during his lifetime as a composer of importance. The esteem Reutter was accorded was demonstrated at his death by his interment within the Cathedral of St. Stephen.</p>

N00bjabi, is probably a cross between a n00b and a punjab. The name was created 5 years ago, and to this day no one is still sure of the actual meaning of it. n00bjabi.com was officially created on January 14th, 2005.
<p>Before n00bjabi.com BECAME n00bjabi.com, it had an extensive history of no real significance.</p>
<p>August 13, 2004: n00bjabi creates an FTP server (using FileZilla), used to send files to his friends. (<a href="ftp://67.171.2.238" class="external free" title="ftp://67.171.2.238" rel="nofollow">ftp://67.171.2.238</a> was the official address)</p>
<p>August 22, 2004: an HTTP server is brought online (Apache 2.x), the IP address remains the same, but the server was viewed from an http:// url, instead of an <a href="ftp://" class="external free" title="ftp://" rel="nofollow">ftp://</a>. It contained 1 word, 'gaggle', followed by a horizontal rule.</p>
<p>September 14, 2004: n00bjabi.tk is used as a way to remember the website, it still remained the same gaggle followed by a horizontal rule until November.</p>
<p>November 12, 2004: n00bjabi.info goes online - at the time there was a special on .info domains, and the webmaster jumped at the opportunity to get it.</p>
<p>December 27, 2004: an official webpage is made. The page started off as an article about a hat that the webmaster bought in germany, and a rant on asians.</p>
<p>January 14, 2005: n00bjabi.com, is bought as a domain. n00bjabi.com is now a full fledged website, with daily updates. Main features included photoshopped images of students attending Kentridge High School (98031), and daily picture archives of the day-by-day adventures of the webmaster.</p>
<p>Since then, n00bjabi.com has gone downhill, until December 24th, when a new portal went online. The addition of 4 new staffmembers marked an eventual increase of the popularity of n00bjabi.com Lucas, Mikey, Chanimal, and MexiCant work in collaboration with n00bjabi to produce anger-induced rants. The website focuses on offensive views and opinions, as well as a large dose of satire at times - to create the self proclaimed - 'successfully the most unsuccessful website ever.' The website runs on a PHP 5.x/Apache 2.x server maintained at home, since it doesn't receive a significant amount of traffic to begin with. <a name="Sources_44" id="Sources_44"></a></p>

<p><b>Belketre</b> was a French Black Metal band formed in 1992. They were affiliated with the <b>Les Legiones Noires</b>(The Black Legions), a group of French bands who limited their releases to low numbers, usually below 100 hand numbered copies. Orginally they went under the name <b>Chapel of Ghouls</b> in 1989, then became <b>Zelda</b> in 1991, and then finally <b>Belketre</b> in 1992. The members were:</p>
<p>Aäkon Këëtrëh<br />
Vordb Dreagvor Uezeerb(a.k.a. Avaethre)</p>
<p>Former members include:</p>
<p>Arnaud - session bass</p>
<p>They have acheived over the years, like most of the LLN bands, a high cult status amongst fans of Black Metal. In 2005, Tragic Empire Records re-released the split with <b>Vlad Tepes</b>, another LLN band, which is considered one of the best split albums in Black Metal history.</p>
<p><b>Discography:</b></p>
<p><i>Studio Tracks</i> (Demo 1993)<br />
<i>The Dark Promise</i> (Demo 1994)<br />
<i>Twilight of the Black Holocaust(Studio Tracks 1994)</i> (Demo 1994)<br />
