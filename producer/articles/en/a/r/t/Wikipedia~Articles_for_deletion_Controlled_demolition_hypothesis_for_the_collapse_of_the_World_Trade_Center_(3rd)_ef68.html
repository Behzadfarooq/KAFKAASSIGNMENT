<p>Completely unencyclopediac. Part of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> of conspiracy theory articles controlled by a cabal of trolls and POV pushers.

<li><b>Um.</b> There is a big, huge, titanic, enormous problem with this article: the hypothesis has zero basis in peer-reviewed research. 100% of the sources are conspiracy theory websites, whose reliability is slightly below that of an alcoholic crack addict. Why are there no rebuttals in the professional journals? Because the professional journals, without exception, treat the theory as the twaddle it clearly is and won't give it house room. But it <i>has</i> got a lot of coverage in the popular press, albeit again mostly borderline incredulity. I'd say it needs drastic pruning and the lead needs to eb rewritten to reflect the fact that nobody who had not already made their mind up has lent any support to this nonsense. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article documents a social phenomenon - that of the facts of the hypothesis and the existence of the hypothesis. It does not argue for the hypothesis, nor does it argue against it. It simply, correctly and competently documents it as a hypothesis that exists. The topic is suitable for encyclopaedic coverage and the article simply gives it that. There was a certain inevitability that, as soon as a <a href="../../../p/e/e/WP%7EPeer_Review_1eff.html" title="WP:Peer Review">WP:Peer Review</a> was asked for, someone would take the opportunity to propose it for deletion. There is no issue with that since an AfD is, in many ways, a review process. However it is important to make the distinction between the article which documents the demolitionists' hypothesis, which this handles correctly, and the hypothesis itself. A correct and encyclopaedic article, which this strives to be, documents that citable facts of the existence of the hypothesis without either validating or invalidating that hypothesis. The article needs to be judged on the merits of how it handles the topic - a notable, well reported topic - not on the merits of the various opinions people have about the truth or otherwise behind the destruction of the buildings. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The comment "POV Fork" in the nomination is incorrect. The article was created as a <b>content fork</b>, which is a valid, recommended and documented procedure when the parent article has grown too long, and the content which formed it was deleted from the parent article. As for trolls and POV pushers, as someone who has been working on the article itself while absolutely not supporting any thoughts about controlled demolition being respinsible for the destruction of the buildings, I do find that comment rather hard to swallow. You don't need to believe a thing is true when working on making a decent article about it. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 23:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Travb: Your argument here has nothing to do with the question of whether the article should be deleted. 00:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/b/User_talk%7EGabrielF_4fa3.html" title="User talk:GabrielF">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GabrielF_3b60.html" title="Special:Contributions/GabrielF">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here is my argument why it should be kept. I keep repeating myself on all of these AfDs, sorry GabrielF that I didn't repeat myself here again. Even though this hypothesis is kooky and, in my opinion, total bullshit, that doesn't mean that it doesnt have a place on wikipedia. I would not support this hypothesis on the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> page, but there is a small fringe group which support this theory, and which have written a lot of articles supporting the theory.</dd>
<dd>See: <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations.html" title="Apollo moon landing hoax accusations">Apollo moon landing hoax accusations</a> <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a> for others group that believes kooky theories. The first two pages have never been put up for deletion, and the JFK page was closed early because of overwhelming consensus to keep.</dd>
<dd>I think these editors who disagree with this theory should spend there time adding condemnations about this theory on the wikipage, instead of attempting to silence these conspiracy theorists. This takes work and research though. It is much easier to simply delete ideas you disagree with, then researching why those ideas are fallacious and have no merit.

<li><b>Comment</b> That you were present and saw no evidence of controlled demoliton may, if citable, be a useful part of the article. Additionally, the fact that you saw no evidence for it neither makes the article suitable for deletion nor for keeping. It is a valid personal statement but not a valid reason to "vote" either way. The article is not about whether the destructon had any elements of controlled demolition in it. The article is about a hypothesis that some people have proposed to explain the demolition. As one of the editors who have worked on the article I can state that I think the hypothesis is <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a>, but that does not prevent it from being notable. The article is about a notable piece of what appears to be ludicrous folklore.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Exactly. Wikipedia does not operate on the basis of a single known truth - it operates on the basis of reporting verifyable facts. It is easily verifyable that the 9/11 conspiracy theorists include people who hold this opinion of what happened, and that they've written extensively about it. It's notable because enough people believe them. It would be neglegent of us not to report that people believe this, even if every single reasonable rational human being thinks that only crazy people think that way. We should (and do) report on the fringe opinions that we don't agree with; this is no exception. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
