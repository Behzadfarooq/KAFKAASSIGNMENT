<li>This can easily be unorphaned (as I've just done), and, anyway, that isn't even a valid reason to contest for deletion.

<li>So if it's used by child pornographers <i>and</i> some other people that's fine is it then? Would this still apply if one of the child pornographers was abusing a child you know? <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolfcam_2c26.html" title="User:Golfcam">Golfcam</a> 04:34, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is some obscene rhetoric from you. So basically you think this article should be censored because you think it causes child pornography? Do you have any proof of that? I like how you use the old standby argument, "think of the children", except your twist is that it's a child I know. I'm sorry, I don't find your arguments convincing.

<dd>Just having child pornography in your home (including on your computer) is illegal in most countries. You don't even have to watch it. This article, as per its title, is good for only one thing: finding child pornography. If it does what it says it does, this is illegal content since its ONLY use is leading people where they are not allowed to go. One consequence of having this article (unlike an article e.g. *describing* child pornography) <b>will</b> be that in Europe (where ISPs are/will be required to log and archive all Internet traffic that passes through their network) law enforcement officers will be able to access IP numbers and personal details of anyone visiting this specific article. And Wikipedia will have to report all the IP numbers visiting that page on first (official/legal) request in the US. Also, it's just a matter of time until this reaches the media and creates another media debacle. (I am not discounting the possibility that the article does NOT do what it says, in which case it would be completely useless.) <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 10:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No I am refering quite specifically to this article. A discussion of how people look for and find child porn is not illegal, nor for that matter is simply posting "Find lots of good kiddy-porn by using search term XXX". It does have other uses, for one thing file sharing networks can use such info to design filters, if they so choose. Whether it is encyclopedic and notable enough for a spearate article might reasoanbly be debated, and I wouldn't oppose a merge into <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">Child pornography</a> or some other suitable article, but if this is verifiable I see no reason not to keep it soemwhere. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:47, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm aware that the list could, and probably will, be used illegally, which isn't our problem. It could also be argued that half of our street names for drugs are only useful in buying drugs on the street, which is also quite illegal, but again, not our problem. We don't host the contraband, thus it's not a crime. We don't advocate it, thus it's not POV.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems too trivial and webcrufty for its own article. Not encyclopedic. I guess it could be a topic of interest if it addressed stuff like, what pct. of searchengine terms are child-porn terms, how does a non-obvious term like "r@ygold" get spread around, origin of terms like that, other stuff that might be of research interest. If and when someone gets that info, the article can be re-created then.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unencyclopedic. I have to admit I was tempted to do a knee-jerk "keep" based upon some of the slightly hysterical delete reasons presented.

<li><b>Comment</b> - just look what redirects here: as I understand this is a list of search keywords for child pornography suites. One of them <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Petersburg2_5bcb.html" title="St Petersburg2">St Petersburg2</a> (before it was deleted and later ressurrected as a redirect) had a complete list of file sharing services there the word is not blocked.

Somehow I didn't realize that most of those voting here are not aware of the redirects and the automatically generated list. The redirecting articles themselves are harmless (you can only find the terms if you know them already). The article per se is not a problem either. It's the combination that's problematic.
