<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I started this article a few days ago. It definitely fulfills the "notable" requirement because of its large regional cult following and its potential as an influence on current cartoons like South Park, etc. It is definitely not a hoax, I used to collect this comic years ago. I have watched several auctions on ebay regarding this comic over the years. They do not come up very often, though, so it's not surprising that your search of ebay today did not find anything. It also is not surprising that your Google search yielded few results - it hasn't been published in 15 years so obviously it is not going to have an active homepage. This is certainly not a reason to ignore its contribution to underground comic history. Another point - shortly after I made this article, it was edited by another anonymous user and more detail was added. I checked the IP address of this user and it is maps to Milwaukee, the region where this comic was popular. The fact that someone from this area found the page and edited within days of the article's creation clearly indicates interest in the topic. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazinglarry_1a7d.html" title="User:Amazinglarry">Amazinglarry</a> 14:17, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> If there was any chance at all that this comic was a <i>potential influence on current cartoons like South Park</i> then it would be verifiable. As it stands, there is no evidence at all that this thing ever existed. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 19:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Update: I added a clarification regarding the distribution of the comic to the article (it was available around the midwest, not just Wisconsin), maybe this will address some of your concerns. If anyone has any other suggestions please let me know. I would love to keep this article here and I am very serious about becoming a regular contributor of high quality content to Wikipedia. I have been reading the site for years and finally decided to start adding some of my own input, and I hope you will not simply decide to can this article because I am a new user. Please see <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-homologous_end_joining.html" title="Non-homologous end joining">non-homologous end joining</a> for tangible evidence of my desire to improve wikipedia, I've added some detailed informatin to the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-homologous_end_joining.html" title="Non-homologous end joining">NHEJ</a> article and I am going to add some citations in the next few days.

<li><b>Comment</b> I tagged it as db-nonsense, but another editor removed my tag. I maintain that this portion of the definion of patent nonsense fits: <i>Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever.</i> Even if it doesn't, certainly this "Tone" fellow and his friends are non-notable. So delete it as a vanity article. This is most certainly an "addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia." So speedy it as vandalism. This article gives us no context on which to base expansion. That's another criterion for an article speedy. So pick one - A1, A7, G1, G3 - just speedy it. &#160;;) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:24, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to Wikipedia, 11,099 people competed at the 2004 Olympics. The Olympics occur every two years, and while there is a lot of overlap (i.e. many people compete in two Olympics), even if we assume that half of all competitors will do so, that's still over 5000 new biographies every two years. Of course, what really happens is that the athletes from countries with better technology access have stub bios put up regardless of how well they did, and the athletes from other nations are ignored (Nigerian bronze medalist Christy Opara-Thompson has no bio despite her bronze medal; Jamaican multi-medalist Juliet Cuthbert, ditto). I recognize that I am not an established Wikipedia editor and therefore unlikely to change the minds of those who are, but the staggering number of cheap bios that would result from a genuine policy of "all Olympians are notable," or the nationalistic bias that is what really occurs, were what led me to nominate for deletion the three-sentence bios of Olympians who have never medalled nor competed professionally. However, if so many are passionately committed to the inclusion of every Olympian, perhaps they could put some work into those bios and also reduce the tendency of profiling only people from wealthier and English-speaking nations.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.143.30.51 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.143.30.51.html" title="User talk:69.143.30.51">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.143.30.51_bacd.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.143.30.51">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-defined list with obvious appeal for users who want to know if a film has a sequel. That would seem rather important given the amount of money that is invested/made on these sequels.

<li><b>Delete</b> as useless and would have to be continually updated. Technically two films constitutes a series, anyway, so that topic is already covered. I would, however, support a listing of true duologies -- not sequels, but actual continuations of the storyline. Had there only been two Lord of the Rings books, for example, then Fellowship and Two Towers would be a true duology.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Hyperactive Forums are different to other forums. They have a unique and diverse culture that cannot be found anywhere else. Just look at how the forumers have banded together in an attempt to keep the work they have worked so hard to create. These forums have over 3000 registered users, many who contribute in their own way. In a way, the forums are really a community of gamers. Being the Internet, how else is it possible for a community to exist without a way of communicating? -FrozenSoul80202.61.229.215 14:12, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's the largest multiplatform magazine in Australia. It’s been around for over 10 years. I just find it odd that a game editor as yourself has only briefly heard of it, even if you are from another country. I guess Australia is ever more isolated from the rest of the world than I originally thought. By the way, we also have electricity!&#160;:) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.239.94.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.239.94.127_0ac1.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.239.94.127">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - there is such a thing as an animal-human hybrid. Specifically, if one were to include the nuclear DNA of a human but the mitochondria of a pig ovum, then you'd have a plausible creature (and one that is probably technically possible today).

It's a nice little article (or would be once you take out the commentary about Bush's religion) that references a political discussion that has attracted notice of the President and references National Geographic. Also probably lose the picture, whatever it is.

<li><b>Speedy close of AfD Debate</b>. What has occured here is a bit out of process, although I'm pretty sure that there would be no objection by the community. Considering that the article initially didn't have any information at all, it should probably have been initially made into redirect or perhaps a speedy delete CSD A3. I think that there would be no objections to the redirect that has now been made (albeit out of process). <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">DarthVad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">r</a> 10:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> If you look at the bottom there are two books that are citing the legitimacy of this man. One, Lonely Planet Papua New Guinea &amp; Solomon Islands (Lonely Planet Papua New Guinea), by Andrew Burke speaks briefly of Vincent finding the region of Papua New Guinea. In the other book, Lonely Planet Papua, New Guinea (Lonely Planet Papua New Guinea), by Adrian Lipscomb it speaks in more depth of the region and also more about the explorer Vincent DePalo. That is where it mentions his early life and later life, along with his expedition involving professor Caron. Although DePalo isn't a significant character in history, he is still a person in history and deserves recognition. I feel both of these sources are sufficient for keeping this post on this illustrious website. User:Reddog1234</li>

I had the wonderful opportunity of taking an anthropology course taught by Professor Christopher Caron, DePalo's colleague. I am somewhat offended by the doubt expressed by the wikipedia community.

<p>Namrevlis 03:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC) I have proposed deletion of this page for two reasons. 1.) It is simply a listing page, the topic of which would be better as a category, and 2). Many of its entries are links to unrelated subjects or are dead links.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Lists and categories serve different functions. Lists are important because they can hold "dead links", unlike categories. I've removed the links which were mis-directs. This list is on a subject which is list-worthy as well, as such an important genre should have a list to itself. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 05:06, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This looks pretty worth keeping.--<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakart_88fd.html" title="User:Dakart">Dakart</a> 05:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Mak. I've reinstated the links which were mis-directs, for the sake of completeness, but they're not mis-directs anymore. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 12:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ensure all members of list are in Category:Contemporary Classical Music (or a subcategory for groups?) then <b>Delete</b>. Kudos to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">User:TheMadBaron</a> for cleaning it up, but per nom this would be more suitable as a category rather than a list. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 13:52, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The category exists at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EContemporary_classical_music_ensembles_f6fc.html" title="Category:Contemporary classical music ensembles">Category:Contemporary classical music ensembles</a> (darned capitalisation). However, I'd just like to reiterate that it's important to have lists because, at the moment, the category trees are a mess, and Lists are important in areas which are not complete, in order to give good ideas of new articles which are needed. Although a lot of good work has been done in classical music by a few good editors, it still is far from complete. I don't think the time for lists has passed, they just need good stewards. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 22:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I know you really want to believe we're a Zionist conspiracy, but the simple fact is that we "mob up like a flock of seagulls" whenever somebody tries to use Wikipedia to publicize an unknown website, like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hyperactive_Forums_e19b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hyperactive Forums">this one</a>, for example. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:47, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I may not share the views of the site, the statement is substiated and not an accusation. Show one page on the site that is pro-Zionist, pro-Isreal, or pro-Jewish. I am neutral on the topic and I believe that point of view is essential to any rational debate. The issue at hand, however, is not the site's content as has been noted, but the fact it's not notable and we could just as easily link to a pro-Zionist, pro-Zionist, pro-Isreal, and pro-Jewish site that is non-notable to balance the extremism, but if it's an unimporant site, there's not need. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter Görlitz">Walter Görlitz</a> 20:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

What you guys are doing is mobbing up against an entry on a site that contains views that you dislike. This is nothing but blatant censureship.

<dd>Comment. You keep saying that. If you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> you will notice that it is sufficient for an AfD voter to assert that it fails WP:WEB. It is up to the editors of the article in question to <i>disprove</i> the claim that it fails WP:WEB by <i>proving</i> (i.e. supplying, in the article) suitable references of the type described in WP:WEB.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia does not follow the US Constitution, because it's not actually the US Government. You do not have the right to bear arms on Wikipedia. And you are not on trial. As the person who wants to keep the article, and presumably the one who knows the most about the subject since you are the founder and author of the article, you need to find <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and notable sources for your article. A Google search is not a reliable source. If, however, this website has been mentioned somewhere like the New York Times, the Guardian, or even something like Salon.com, that would be good. I doubt it has been. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 03:40, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply</b> This is not about the US Constitution. Requiring the accuser to prove the guilt rather than the accused having to prove his innocence in a universal legal principle. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Andrewwinkler (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andrewwinkler_4737.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andrewwinkler">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the accuser having to prove guilt is <i>not</i> a universal legal principle, but either way it's irrevelant to the point. You need to (a) stop taking this so personally and (b) stop thinking about this within the guilt/innocence paradigm and instead <i>read what people are saying</i> (oh, and sign your comments! Just add four tildes at the end). There are two questions being discussed...</dd>
<dd>The question being discussed is not about whether the RMG exists or not, or whether it is a worthwhile company or not, or whether the people there are decent or not, but whether RMG is notable enough to be included in an encyclopaedia. Among the criteria for notability is whether there is at least one but preferable several non-trivial references to the subject in question in verifiable sources that are independent of the group in question. For example, if an independent magazine had written an article about something interesting the group was doing, that would most likely meet the criteria for notability. If it was an advertorial then it probably wouldn't. Provide some references like this, and the notability question will be resolved.</dd>
<dd>The second question being discussed is the style of the article. At the moment, it reads like a marketing piece, not an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not for marketing and publicity</a>, even of notable entities. If Bono, George W Bush and Fidel Castro formed a punk band, it would be worthy of an entry - but a WP article advertising their current world tour would be deleted. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 08:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The couch gags are very notable and having a list is more convenient to users of Wikipedia than requiring them to flip thorugh 200+ episode articles, especially when they're looking for a particular couch gag. Quick, which episode featured The Flintstones sitting on the couch? The most efficient way is to go to this list and do a "Find" in your browser. Otherwise it'll take ages to go through the episodes. All that said, if there's a copyvio issue here that will need to be addressed.

I was approached by Lambian about this article (since I created it) and he suggested that I create the article about N-parasitic number and merge this and others to it. I agreed to it and contacted Arthur Rubin (the nominator who {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed it initially) to ask if he agreed to the notability of N-parasitic numbers. I intended to create the article as soon as I got his reply, but unfortunately he hasn't replied to my message left since yesterday and started the AfD today.

<p>I smell a hoax.</p>
<p>As a religion or a website, this fails miserably. Apparently it's a sect of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordianism.html" title="Discordianism">Discordianism</a> practiced by a small circle of followers, and the <a href="http://www.loveshade.org" class="external text" title="http://www.loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> isn't even rated on Alexa, and has only one incoming link.<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.loveshade.org&amp;url=loveshade.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.loveshade.org&amp;url=loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>Well, okay, if it's not a notable religion or notable website, is it a notable criminal case? I'd say yes, but I can't find any evidence whatsoever that the child pornography or terrorism allegations exist. Google searches only turn up forum/blog posts obviously made by Loveshade/Ek-sen-trik-kuh posters.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind keeping this if some real evidence of the criminal charges could be offered, but I'm betting this one's a hoax. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:25, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know much about an Alexa rating, but the site <a href="http://discordia.loveshade.org" class="external free" title="http://discordia.loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">http://discordia.loveshade.org</a> hasn't been there very long. The beginnings of the work Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, though, has been around since 1994 and online since 1995. Read the sources I link to in the article--there are references going back to the 1990s. Check the index of the BloodStar site at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84</a> (it was last updated in 2001); or groups.yahoo.com/groups/illuminatusinnersanctum; or <a href="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" class="external free" title="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" rel="nofollow">http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/</a>; or <a href="http://www.23ae.com" class="external free" title="http://www.23ae.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.23ae.com</a>; or <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html</a> (check the index--it was last updated in 1997).</dd>

<dd>Also the Alexa search engine you mentioned gave 388 hits for rev loveshade and 549 for reverend loveshade. Check it out yourself if you don't believe me. And check any version of the published Rev. DrJon Swabey's version of <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> and you'll find Reverend Loveshade and BloodStar in it. You can also find this has been translated into German.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While it's a joke site, Reverend Loveshade is popular enough that there's an article about him at <a href="http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade" class="external free" title="http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade" rel="nofollow">http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade</a> that's been there for months. If an article there isn't about something important enough for people to get the jokes about, it's deleted. Do a search on Uncyclopedia for Reverend Loveshade and see how many references you can find. I got 22.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the legal parts, the sites are there that show that too. "Stripping Away American Freedom: A Call to Action" which deals with the terrorism is on both BloodStar's site and the new Loveshade site. Check the index of the BloodStar site and you'll see it was posted in December 2001 just like it says. Check my article for the links to the legal problems in Illuminatus Inner Sanctum posted in 2003, or the profile of 2002. Check the links!</dd>

<dd>I know I'm not supposed to take comments personally, but Gerina and I worked on this article for a month.

We were encouraged to write the article by DrJon and even by <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a>. Denis was against it at first until he realized that Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia was originally called "the non-existent Apocrypha Discordia," and had been around and well-know for years. And DrJon compiled the 2001 Apocrypha Discordia, and also encouraged us.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Damn Straight! All of these other commenters are members of those Sinister Ministers the Bavarian Illuminati. I know some of them and have had to face off with them over a number of issues. They are trying to infiltrate Wikipedia, you must stop them and their mad dash to get people to think that just because many Discordians are aware of Rev Loveshade, his work, his legal issues and the correctness of his facts, that somehow its actually worthy of the Grand Wikipedia. I warn you, if you do not delete this entry soon, the Illuminati will overtake Wikipedia and all will be lost. The next thing you know servers will get hit with golden apples dunked in fire and brimstone (like carmel but more spicy!).

<li><b>Response</b> - What I meant to say was that you hadn't contributed to anything except contributing information about the SUBJECT in question, and only a few edits at that (I have edited my comment to be more specific). And I never said that anyone had contributed "0 edits". Please don't put words in my mouth or text in my edit. I am merely pointing about how you and your friends have only contributed to this single article's subject, so you might not realize the fuller scope of Wikipedia, that is all.

<li><b>Response</b> - I'm going to assume you really are as ignorant as you're acting (my ohter option is to assume you're lying). "I never said that anyone had contributed '0 edits'" You're right, you didn't. You said, more or less (I see you'd edited your own comment) there are "all these users on WP who have never contributed before except to this single <s>article</s> subject."

<li><b>Response</b> - Yes, I know basic English. So let me explain. If, with the exception of this article, you've done something zero times, then, with the exception of this article, you've never done it. You're focusing on semantics instead of the fact that you made a bold assertion that was verifiably not true.

<p>I was going to stay out of all this, as I am obviously biased. Just for my posting a comment here, some of you may be motivated to rip me to shreds. Go ahead, rip. I've had a lot of life experience and I've been ripped to shreds before. I've learned to lick my wounds, heal, and move on.</p>
<p>But you've torn not only into me and the work of myself and other Discordians, but into <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinky_The_WonderSkull_365b.html" title="User:Binky The WonderSkull">Binky The WonderSkull</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerina_a4d6.html" title="User:Gerina">Gerina</a> who wrote this article. That is completely uncalled for. Call my work crap, call me crap, say I deserve to burn in Hell. But please don't hurt them. Maybe they're hoaxers, maybe they're lying. But if they are at least attempting to tell the truth, this is both of their first article on Wikipedia. They worked on it very hard for a month together.</p>
<p>Binky is very hurt, as I think you can tell from her posts. And Gerina, who is fresh out of high school and was very excited about this, is now afraid to even post comments here for fear she'll be torn to pieces. Both of them had been encouraged to write this article by active posters and administrators (see the Apocrypha and Ek-sen-trik-kuh discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism</a>). Now, I don't know if either one of them will feel comfortable ever posting here again. Maybe some of you don't care. But I'm hoping some of you do.</p>
<p>Please look at your comments again, and see if you might want to consider an apology to them. They are people, they are human beings, they have feelings. Please consider that. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverend_Loveshade_ce75.html" title="User:Reverend Loveshade">Reverend Loveshade</a> 05:20, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Revrend Loveshade is a heretical follower of the Bavarian Illuminati and has long been known as a Discordian Triple Agent (He was a double agent but converted). He has worked closely with Cecil Weishaupt (Great Great Grandson of Adam Weishaupt) in the development of this work. We cannot allow these false groups to overtake the sacred works of Eris K. Discordia. We know that She speaks only to those that have a pineal gland (and we have medical proof that Rev. Loveshade's pineal gland was removed in a secret Masonic rite on the 20th of last month). Therefore, this no-ledge could not have come from Eris, but instead from the False Non-Prophet, known as Auntie Kryst. Could one imagine granting a Wikipedia entry to The Gospel of Judas?!!! Surely not, for Judas' gospel is little known and (until it became popularized by the media) would have turned up few Google entries. This obviously is the same. Revrend Loveshade's apocryphal work sould not only be removed from Wikipedia, but all copies should be found, burned and his additional works banned! - Ratatosk, Squirrel of Discord, Muncher of the ChaoAcorn, Chatterer of The Words of Eris, POEE of The Great Googlie Mooglie Cabal <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.72.211.132 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.72.211.132_a7f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.72.211.132">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Well, I hate to argue with someone who agrees with me, but notability isn't really at issue here. D&amp;D is eminently notable; I'm simply arguing that this article has no subject but is instead a list of facts with a common attribute. Since there's no subject, there's no way to decide if the subject is notable or not. (If someone could demonstrate to me that there's a trend illustrated here or some other similar subject, then I'd probably withdraw the nom.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - My two cents: The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha_Discordia_0ade.html" title="Apocrypha Discordia">Apocrypha Discordia</a> was created and evolved as a separate work to what's now known as the <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>. The title was influenced by the mention by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jackson_e31d.html" title="Steve Jackson">Steve Jackson</a>, not by the subsequent Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and the research for the work itself stretched back to the 1970s. Although one of the extant three short pieces from Rev.Loveshade's work was included, that piece shares space with over a hundred other works - the primary ones being "apocryphal" but genuine passages omitted from the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a>. The Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia (although no doubt a worthy work) is entirely incidental to <i>this</i> Apocrypha Discordia. <b>Keep</b> or <b>Delete</b> the entry as you will (I would argue that it seems to have become rather beloved of modern Discordians--I receive fan emails at a slow but steady pace--and it <i>is</i> in the Library of Congress), but the work is wholly separate to the Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and if the wikipedia cares about accuracy at all, it will not merge the entries for two uniquely different works. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 09:32, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was commenting on Fan1967's comment at 18:27, not trying to make another argument towards keeping the article; I was saying that amounts of followers aren't directly correlated to notability, as demonstrated by the invisible pink unicorn and flying spaghetti monster, which both have approximately 0 real followers. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus"><font color="green"><b>Vore</b></font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVoretus_e700.html" title="User talk:Voretus"><b><font color="blue">tus</font></b></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Voretus_d90a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Voretus"><b><font color="black">the Benevolent</font></b></a> 19:19, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree. The fundamental definition of "notability," as we use it here, is "a lot of people care/know about it." Wikipedia standards of notability involve being in a bunch of libraries (for a book), receiving significant media coverage and/or sales rankings (for a company), reached a significant number of album sales or radio airplay (for a band), or with high Google and Alexa rankings (for a website). That there is not one shred more verifiable, NPOV evidence of the existence of Allah than there is of the Lint God that lives in my navel doesn't remotely make the latter an equivalent faith to the former. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability isn't based on the number of followers. It's based on how many people are aware of it (which of course does include the followers themselves). <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_5d0a.html" title="Heaven's Gate">Heaven's Gate</a> had very few followers but became, poshumously, quite notable.

<dd>Why is this non-notable if Discoridianism itself is notable?

<p><b>Keep</b> Despite not being as well known as the Principia, mainly because <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminatus.html" title="Illuminatus">Illuminatus</a> was written before its creation, the Apocrypha is still an important text in the Discordian canon.

The 1994 reference to <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> was to a <i>possible</i> work that Steve Jackson Games was considering, but never did. The first works to claim to be part of <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> were written by Reverend Loveshade, and appeared online in 1995. (As proof, the dates on the index of both <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html</a> will show these works were posted in the 1990s). While DrJon wrote that he had been collecting Discordian works for over 20 years, he didn't publicly use the title <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> until he published his collection using that name in 2001. I think we should keep the articles on both works, or at least <b>Merge</b> them. But realize that some of the arguments here for DrJon's Apocrypha Discordia actually refer to Reverend Loveshade's work, <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>. 207.67.146.218 03:09, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Egads, you all keep putting up those links to geocities sites - give it a rest. Geocities could not possible be less of a reliable and notable source, so please try a notable source, such as CNN, Newsweek or online sources similar to Slashdot or CNET. I'm tired of these weak arguments backed up with Geocities. If this really was notable, you could come up with a convincing set of sources that didn't involve Geocities. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:50, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe the point the poster was making was that the Date Stamp on the article verified when it was posted. The Date Stamp is set by clocks based on International Standards, and can't be changed by a Yahoo!, Geocities, Angelfire, or whatever user. In fact, they have been used as evidence in court, and falsifying them is a violation of international law. The whole structure of the Internet is based on that--determining who first registers a domain name, for example. It's possible with the right program to fake the date stamp on an email; it's almost impossible to fake one on a website. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 06:11, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> - Ok... thats nice.... I don't think how old this hoax is in under questioning or if anyone asked for proof regarding that. What we want is proof of notability, not age.

<li><b>Response</b> - Ermm... yes. That is the long and short of it. We need evidence that this is notable. I don't know how I'm being not being impartial.

<li><b>Response</b> I was pointing out the history of the concept of the Apocrypha which, particularly in something like Discordianism, is an important thing. The fact that Steve Jackson created the idea in 1994 shows that the concept has been in the consciousness of Discordians, and non-Discordians, for 12 years. I was not attempting to write Rev Loveshade out of history or anything. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrenna_09f5.html" title="User:Prenna">Prenna</a> 08:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What precedent are you referring to? Dawn and Drew already underwent 2 AfD's, one ended in <i>Keep</i> on fairly low vote numbers and the second was withdrawn (incorrectly formated nom; appears nominator mistook the first AfD's votes for a quick tally of keeps and withdrew the nomination). Dawn and Drew is arguably one of the most popular podcasts out there. Personally, I don't know why anyone bothers with the mindless drivel that is D&amp;D, but it is obviously quite popular. Are you suggesting that Anime pulse is on the same level of popularity as D&amp;D? Can you provide some evidence of this? Where does it rank on some of the Podcast ranking sites (Podcast Alley for instance)?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:44, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as per all above. 3500 downloads per cast may seem small to you, but it's 3499 more than is needed for a fan-base. Just because it's small doesn't mean it shouldn't be included in the wiki. I don't understand the _need_ for the deletion. If you don't find the podcast or this associated wiki page interesting, that's grand, everyone is obviously entitled to an opinion, but why remove a wiki page that other people may be interested in&#160;? <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerophyte_d685.html" title="User:Zerophyte">Zerophyte</a> 16:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Because Wikipedia, being an encyclopedia, has standards for admission, and those standards rest upon verifiability and notability; I commend <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to you in this particular case. As it happens, the Dawn &amp; Drew podcast cited above has an Alexa rank of 10,924, which is decent. By contrast, Anime Pulse's website has an Alexa rank of <b>1,051,956</b>, which is downright horrible, and has so little traffic that it doesn't even rank in the top hundred thousand of websites for daily traffic. Comparing the two podcasts is like comparing apple trees with apple seeds. <i>When</i> your cast become notable, <i>then</i> you should feel free to have an article written about your site. It is certainly not so now. (And beyond that, as long as you folks rank other people's works with the phrase ""burn it and piss on the ashes", you really don't have much of a leg to stand on to claim insult.) <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:04, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: 1. Last I checked, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> doesn't have Alexa listed as a valid way to determine notability, and 2. 10924 is the rank for www.podshow.com, of which Dawn and Drew are <b>1</b> subdomain. Their site itself is not near that high, so get your own facts straight before trying to look cool. Psiclopz 18:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why delete it? Wikipedia exists to provide information to any and every user. If a rigid doctrine on restricting what is or isn't admissable is going to be enforced, then I strongly suggest people look at the "unnecessary" pages that are already here. The page is harmless, constructive even, providing information for the podcast's growing fanbase. Yes, I said <i>growing</i>. Got it memorised? Because while the fanbase isn't the strongest, it is increasing weekly. Look at the podcast's site and forum for proof. Lunatic raveV 00:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, now a few things to mention first. One: the editors who have put this page together have done a good job, and should be congratualted for it. It is nicely laid out, and well referenced. But please do not consider the quality of the article; at AFD we must consider whether or not the <i>subject</i> of the article is encyclopaedic with regards <i>only</i> to the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. Two: this is not a "bad faith nom"; I said I would do this when it was at WP:FAC because I want to see what other people think. I think this page is an important example of what is currently happening a lot on Wikipedia: short-term (often US-centric) phenomenon that get extensive pages, with almost all web-based sources, because they are recent and well-covered. However, I think we should resort to ten year test (I would prefer one hundred, but I am willing to be disagreed with). Will anyone remember - or want to remember - this event in ten years? It was a comedian, doing a comedy routine. That happens <i>all the time</i>. It is not anything special, not notable and in a few years no-one will care. Thus I urge a delete. This could act as a litmus for a whole lot of other pages, so please think hard, vote wisely (whichever way you vote), and let's have a nice, harmonious discussion. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 09:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Tricky one this. A well put argument from Batmanand which goes to the heart of what wikipedia is. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and from that definition this type of article doesn't fit, this is a news article and not a encyclopedia entry. However, perhaps part of the joy of wikipedia is that the articles can go beyond what is normal strict encyclopedia content, the impact of a slightly out-of-place article may be felt insignificant due to the format of wikipedia. But, then where do you draw the line? There have to be firm rules. So, after much consideration, I vote <b>delete</b>. This is an event which gives a good news story, but it is not an encyclopedic article. I know there are lots of other comparable topics on here that have not been deleted, but that is not an argument to keep this one. As Batmanand states, each article must be considered only against the deletion policy. Well done Batmanand, you've raised a good topic. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/c/o/User_talk%7EKcordina_5ecd.html" title="User talk:Kcordina">Talk</a></sup> 10:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a WikiNews story, not an encyclopedia entry. It's a news event in one country out of over 200, and the precedent that articles like this set is difficult. I appreciate that Wikipedia is not paper, and can accomodate a near-infinite amount of information. However, at some point editors have to exercise <i>judgement and selectivity</i>. This raw mass of citations and data should have been placed within the Stephen Colbert article, and pruned down massively to take account of the ten year test. I agree with Batmanand where he says "It is not anything special, not notable and in a few years no-one will care." A record could still be kept, but on the Colbert pages (and maybe on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a> page, as a small footnote, and as an anecdote on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_53cf.html" title="White House Correspondents' Association">White House Correspondents Association Dinner</a> article).<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:50, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Normally I would vote merge but given the length and detail of this article I support spinning it off in to it's own article. As for Batmanand's argument, I agree that in future peeople will be less interested in it but I'm not sure that should be a reason to delete it. It is a notable subject now but in the future it won't cease to have <i>been</i> a notable event it will just cease <i>being</i> a notable event. Pretty much the same as any current event. <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 10:55, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I do not think that this performance will be very notable in a few months. Once the "OMG DID YOU SEE THAT?!" factor dies out in a bit, it will be memorable each correpondents' dinner as a litimus test: "Oh, he was funny, but not on the Colbert scale." It's just like the opening monologue of the Oscars or something, we don't have individual articles on each performance by an Oscars host, just mentions of it in their own articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The nub of the argument in favour of deletion is that, in the future, it will be non-notable. Clearly, the article on <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association_53cf.html" title="White House Correspondents' Association">White House Correspondents' Associations</a> contradicts this. If the event will be non-notable ten years after the event, why is it that the article notes that Al Fraken presented it ten years ago? Why, indeed, does it have more than just a name for Bill Clinton's bit in 2000 or Richard Nixon's in 1969? Surely, if it is non-notable, nobody would remember. That editors do remember (or have evidence of it) proves that it <i>is</i> notable, and will remain so into the future. Why it has a long article is quite another matter, but an article it must definitely should have. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that the <i>fact</i> that Stephen Colbert was the speaker at this particular occasion is notable.

<dd>My comparison to Nixon/Clinton/Franken was not a necessary condition of it deserving an article. However, you asked the question, "Will anyone remember - or want to remember - this event in ten years?" Perhaps people won't remember - or want to remember - the ratings boost to the Colbert Report or to its Google ranking, but they will want to remember that he did the gig, and the approximate content of it. Hence, in my opinion, it fits the notability criterion. As long as the WHCA holds a dinner and invites comedians to perform, people will want to remember Stephen Colbert's performance. Perhaps that's because (as an inclusionist), I believe that each and every WHCAD performance should have an article (if it has enough information), or maybe it's because Colbert's was one of the most notable in the history of the event. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Great, so Al Franken hosted this dinner ten years ago. That's a factoid deserving of about as many words as I just used. Deciding that this particular comic's routine at some minor event is worthy of a full scale article? That's like writing an article based around Nixon's post-Watergate resignation speech -- something which surely has an order of magnitude more historical significance -- for which I'm sure I could dredge up five hundred contemporary quotes parsing every particular, and which surely is remembered. (No such article exists, needless to say.) Great, so the blogosphere went mental in the forty-eight hours after the act, but the only difference between Colbert's gig and Jay Leno is that the President was present and Leno does it every night. The nom is exactly right; this is pop culture ephemera no one will remember six months from now.

<li><b>Merge</b> Even now, I had to go and read the article to remind myself what this was about. In 6 months I am sure noone will remember at all. This does not deserve its own article. Should either be merged to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, or a general article about the White House Correspondent's dinner.

<li><b>Merge or delete</b> per Mrjeff. Humourous political commentary happens frequently; while this may have been a good sample (and acknowleding the effort the editor/s have put into writing the article), I don't see what makes it <i>so</i> notable beyond that of other similar events as to warrant its own entry in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 14:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I don't buy this whole "US-centric bias" argument. If it's notable in the U.S., it's notable period, regardless of what the rest of the world thinks. This is a demonstrably notable and highly-publicized event, and articles like these are precisely what make Wikipedia great. If you were to hear about this event, where else would you go to get such an in-depth description of it other than Wikipedia? <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 14:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is not what I said.

I am <i>not</i> some sort of US-phobe.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very interesting discussion from my point of view, and I can understand both sides to a certain extent. Personally, I believe that the core question (as it has been pointed out) restated is: <i>will be this speech important in the course of the history?</i>. Well, in my opinion, we can't possibly know at the moment. In order to answer to this question we should look back on it in the <i>far</i> future, we don't have now enough context to judge the historical impact of the speech. However, we can say it has been a remarkable event at the moment and, given the quality of the article is relatively high, why don't we leave it and let the future contributors (with enough context) judge the importance of it?. <a href="../../../p/a/f/User%7EPafmon_8f73.html" title="User:Pafmon">Pafmon</a> 17:31, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> - This is the very definition of an invented news story. Remember when Jon Stewart delivered that blistering attack on Crossfire last year? Me neither. That's why it only merits a section on the Jon Stewart article. Just as this only deserves a section in the Colbert article. This story gained traction because the blogging community (a lot of whom happen to be in Colbert's target demographic) made a stink over it. The increase in ratings his show got is nice, but I would remind people that if his show aired on a non-cable network its low ratings would've led to it being cancelled a long time ago. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> 20:30, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

I think that the dinner as an event is notable, given the tradition of Presidents attending and the usual element of satirical presentations.

<dd>Two things. Firstly, in answer to the point made by Kizzle, we delete things all the time as non-notable, even though there is no policy on notability. Unless you advocate not deleting anything for the reason non-notable, I suggest you rethink your accusations. To Brian.fsm, I quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project Wikinews does exactly that).

<dd>Justifying deletion because "we delete things all the time as non-notable" is a fallacy; just because it happens doesn't mean it's right. If you want to delete a page, <i>it is incumbant on you to provide why this page fits criteria within the deletion policy</i>, not your subjective implications based upon things that aren't policy. I re-assert my stance that you are misusing policy by not providing the specific criteria within the deletion policy that this applies to (and no, it's not a "breaking news story"). Finally, for those people who say that comedic routines like this happen all the time, you're entirely missing the point. How many of those examples given on this page, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and other stand-up comedians, say such commentary with the president sitting 10 feet away? This is why its notable, not because it's just another comedic routine, but that it was right in front of the president. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 22:51, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, you have misrepresented what I said. You seemed to be saying that, because we do not currently have a policy on notability, I should not be using notability as an argument for the deletion of this page. I said that that is patently ridiculous, because a) it <i>does</i> say in <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> that "They [participants in the deletion process] should bear in mind <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>"; and that in WP:NOT, the guidelines on news stories say that only ones on events of historical significance should be kept; and b) that if we never deleted anything on the basis of notability, at least half of all deletions would not happen. I am unsure how familiar you are with AfD, so I will assume you are unfamiliar, because if you look at any random day, the number of "Delete, nn"-type comments is enormous. Unless you believe that they are all invalid - in which case I fear you will find yourself in a very small minority - then you surely have to accept that the <i>principle</i> of notability is central to AfD, even if the <i>policy</i> is not yet fully formed. Then this argument becomes about whether or not this event is notable enough, which is an argument I am more than willing to have. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 08:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Arguing whether this page should be kept based upon other pages, whether its all the random pages such as television episodes that get kept or the pages that get deleted because of notability, is a bad argument. You're correct in saying that I'm not familliar with AfD, but I <i>am</i> familliar with <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, and so far you haven't shown this page to fit any criteria within that policy. One cannot gauge historical significance from an event only 3 weeks ago, and just because you seem to think the event is trivial, the sheer amount of keeps on this page seem to imply this event has a little bit more significance than you'd like to believe. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 16:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, you are right that my opinion on this matter appears to not be the consensus opinion.

<dd>There is a big difference between hurricanes and a speech. Hurricanes are individual, unique, touch millions of people in many countries. The Atlantic Hurricane season, under any conception of notability, is a keeper. An individual member of it deserves its own article because each event in the whole season also has substantial long-term effects. Each speech that a comedian makes does not have this effect. Again, I beg the question: should everyone that Time magazine rates as the 100 most influential people of the year (who obviously all deserve articles) have every detail that can be acquired about them be added? Of course not. There is some material that is not needed or wanted on Wikipedia. The colour of George W Bush's underwear is one of them. A minor speech by a comedian, that is effectively one of many that happen every day, that will be forgotten in a few weeks, is another. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 21:16, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

Removing an actual event that affects politics and news, and puts people like Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame in the same room with the current president that is presently trying to reconstruct the CIA and the power of the president is more than just a news headline, much less one that for sports "writers" to jabber about for a week or 2 because someone might win a championship of uselessness.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well-researched, in-depth article depicting a notable event, for not only the performance itself, but the reaction illustrating the U.S. political climate and the accusations of self-censorship against the U.S. print media, as well as the internet phenomenon it became. It is also well used in the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> article to illustrate <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html#Roman_irony" title="Irony">Roman irony</a> in a modern context. A merge into the 'Stephen Colbert' article would simply force the article to split due to size.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Furthermore, I argue against the apparent belief that something is 'US-centric' simply because it documents an event within the U.S., and believe that simply attempting to deny notable events in the U.S. because other countries do not feature comparable coverage, and to test notability by the number of people who know about it, is fallacious. One must remember that conditions besides just population affect internet coverage of a country, such as the sizes and types of groups with internet access. If more coverage of events in countries besides the U.S. is wanted, then more people with knowledge of such events should contribute. I am well aware of the technical constraints of inclusionist policy, but these must be balanced against the informational constraints of deletionism. -- <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> 22:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>US-centricism works two ways. Of course, the US has more coverage than most countries simply because (in percentage terms and in also in raw numbers) the US has more people with internet access, and as such more Wikipedians (it helps that the Government doesn't block or censor the site either...). But if the criteria that we compare things against for notability are lower - either explicitly or implicity - for the US than for other countries, then we are compounding the problem. IMO we fail this second part of the test; although it appears that I do not share the consensus view. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 22:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well I found this paper about Iranian Planarian and Dr Ghorbani. Apparently there is no doubt about the truth of the article, nevertheless the article in the encyclopedia is not informative. In order to show some references including the following scientific paper&#160;:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>© 1998 The Japan Mendel Society Cytologia 63: 441—445, 1998 Cytomorphological Studies in Dugesia Species of Iran Ghorbani Behzad1, Sheidai Masoud2* and Khazab Mahmood3 Biological Department, Tehran University, Tehran, Iran 2 Biological Department, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran Genetic Section, Razi Research Institute, Karaj, Iran Accepted September 2, 1998 Summary Dugesia species of Karaj river in Iran were investigated from cytologial, and morphoanatomical point of view. Two different populations were studied. Individuals from Gajereh region possessed 2n=25 and those of Gachsar possessed 2n—26. They varied in details of karyotypes, GBanding pattern and morpho-anatomical features. Cluster analysis separated the two populations of Duge.cia in different clusters. Two new species of Dugesia with new chromosome number having complete asexual reproduction are reported. The fresh water planarians belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes, an old monophyletic group which branched from the rest of metazoans at an early stage and can be considered as the sister group of the other bilateral triploblastic organisms (Riutort et a!. 1992, Addoutte and Philippe 1993). They possess a great morphological plasticity and regeneration power and are remarkable for the occurrence of local polyploid populations and the occasional presence of mixoploidy and mosaics having both diploid and triploid tissues (Hoshino eta!. 1991, Benazzi and Lentati 1976, Oki et al. 1981). Although there have been extensive cytological studies on planarian species in many countries (Hoshino ci a!. 1991, Benazzi and Lentati 1976, Oki ci a!. 1981, Tamura ci a!. 1988, Ribas et a!. 1988), there has been no report from Iran. The present article is the first report on cytotaxonomy of Dugesia species from Iran.</p>

<p>This is a copy of Personal rapid transit/UniModal (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Personal_rapid_transit_UniModal_8355.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Personal rapid transit/UniModal">deletion debate</a>, endorsed at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>) which has been worked on to try to fix the major problems with that article. In my view the fundamental problem remains that <i>this does not exist</i>. It is a <i>concept</i> for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> (PRT), which is in turn a <i>concept</i> for a mode of transit. No system of this scale or with many of these parameters has even been prototyped, and the system as described does not exist even in mockup form. To my mind this is a fork of PRT without the balancing effect of the few real-world trials which have been undertaken. There is no evidence presented that the proponent of this system is viewed as sufficiently influential as to make implementation a realistic prospect in the short to medium term, as the UniModal website acknowledged before the damaging admission was removed, "there ain't no such thing" - but Malewicki is certainly pitching hard for money and I guess this article helps him to establish credibility. The article starts by saying this proposal is different from other forms of PRT, but that is a rather naughty claim since at present there pretty much <i>are</i> no other forms. Two small-scale trials of systems nothing like this are planned, one long-term small scale trial ran for a while and was wound up, another small scale trial is no longer considered PRT due to its having increased the capacity to 12 passengers per pod, and so on. Fan fiction is all very well, but Wikipedia is not the place for it. This subject is best covered (as it already is) in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - sadly, given the amount of love and attention which has been lavished on the article. The article is very readable, but I feel that without a concrete plan to actually make the system, the system itself fails on notability. As an untested concept with niche interest on WP, the article cannot sustain NPOV over time. The merge with PRT was severe, but allows the section on Unimodal to be expanded with extra references as these become available, and also provides a wider audience within WP. If it is built (almost certainly in a modified form), WP will be a good place to record this fact and provide a neutral analysis, and it will no doubt get a good article of its own. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 18:20, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - First: Malewicki has not been involved in editing this article, so the statement that <i>"this article helps him to establish credibility"</i> is misleading and irrelevant. Second: SkyTran is a novel variation of PRT with several important differences from most other PRT designs (i.e. very small vehicles, high speed, vehicles suspended below the track, maglev, ADA compliance provided via an external mechanism). Third: the claims about cost are clearly speculative, but can easily be qualified by a statement that those cost projections rely on untested concepts. Fourth: on the notability debate, SkyTran is certainly not a household word, but (a) the design has been out there for several years now, (b) Malewicki has presented technical papers on it, and (c) it's even received some treatment in the mainstream media (i.e. New York Times Magazine, Popular Science). I think SkyTran, even as an unproven design concept, merits a small article. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 20:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - First of all, the article is not a copy of anything. It is a <i>very</i> scaled down version of the aformentioned article that was at Personal rapid transit/UniModal. JzG's points seem quite irrelevant, as Malewiki has absolutely nothing to do with the article. Although I disagree with Stephen Streater, he brings up *valid* points. However, the article (as a subpage) is meant to be a proposal, not an actual page (I hope thats obvious). I think that SkyTran has received enough media recognition to at least be its own very small page. I've tried to scale it down, but others are welcome to scale further. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 10:48, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The section you quote says nothing about <i>contacting</i> the creator. I did <b>share my concerns</b> with the creator by posting <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> in the PROD. Anyway, I routinely contact the creator in cases where I think that the article can be saved; in fact, I created one of the templates used to facilitate that process.

<li>sharing your concerns with a new editor by referencing a wiki guideline shortcut like WP:BAND doesn't really meet the spirit of the text in my opinion. Think about this... If you were a new user and created a new article, then someone tagged it for PROD with a reason WP:BAND, would you have the faintest idea what they were talking about? It's obscure and doesn't really tell someone who is not familiar with the arcana of Wikipedia anything at all.

<li><b>Delete</b> - unless they can expand on the references to the popularity of their live shows and demonstate that they are a regular national <i>touring</i> act. If they can do that, they would be a keepie. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 18:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm the creater of the mista mushroom page. Mista Mushroom are unsigned. Thus, if the necessary criteria for a band to be on this website is to be signed then they must sadly be removed. However, if this is not so clearly defined then I would like to argue for its presence to remain. Firstly, the Bestival is not such a small festival as mentioned by someone: Broadcasted on Radio1, voted second best music festival by the guardian last summer, and with names such as fatboy slim, basement jaxx and lee scratch perry. The band toured last Summer accross the South West and the Midlands. They've had airplay on the Radio1 twice and are preparing a tour for this summer. As I said above they aren't signed so this post might be pointless, but given the difficulty it is to be a 'successful band' without being signed, I think that the festival playing alone is a factor that sets them apart from most other bands. I don't really know how a band can be 'successful' before being signed with achievements such as this band already have. What do you think?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - as I stated above, we need <i>evidence</i> that they are a regular national touring act; just saying that they are is no use when it's the only part of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> that appears to be passed. Playing a festival doesn't entail immediately notability - it's just one gig, regardless of the numbers involved - that said, if you can show that the BBC broadcast included the band's set then you might be onto something. There are artists on Wiki who have never been "signed" in the ordinary sense, working with various lables or even exclusively their own so it's not an immediate bar to an entry.<a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I also want to add that, unlike with most other articles, being deleted is not the end of the world for a band. A band that is non-notable today could secure a couple of reviews in newspapers and magazines or land a major-label record deal, and suddenly they would qualify for an article. In the interim, you may copy the contents of the page over to your user page. User pages are a good place to store material that you hope to spin into an article, because bascially the only things that can ever be deleted from user pages are things that break the law, like threats and copyright violations. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">ē</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 19:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I am the author of this page. Having just discovered the criteria for putting a band onto this website I would like to dispute the deletion of this band due to the following criteria: "A musician or ensemble...is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria...Has won or placed in a major music competition". The Bestival auditions clearly qualify as a major music competition - for the reasons noted above - and they won this. Therefore as only one criteria needs to be satisfied I see no reason for deleting this and will remove the 'to be deleted' headnote. --tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - "Bestival Auditions" brings up a grand total of 4 Google hits, one of which is this page. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 10:47, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Are you sure you didn't make a typo? I just ran a search for it and it came up with a lot more. Secondly, how can an audition for a festival that triggures 362,000 results in google, and which has such major names as mentioned above, not be considered a major music competition? And if this is the case, what sort of music competitions that cater for this genre are any bigger? This is to my knowledge the biggest British music festival that holds auditions - Glastonbury, Leeds &amp; Reading and global gathering don't! --tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - finally, I've been searching for other bands that are unsigned to see what credentials they hold. One example, [InVersion], is a band that has had airplay on phoenix fm (unknown to me) and the only credible competition they have won is a battle of the bands. Incidentally, Mista Mushroom have won two separate botb competitions: Isle of Wight and Central South England. Why therefore has this band been allowed to remain with apparently smaller achievements than mista mushroom? I guess if you go on your 'google hits' criteria then they win, but that's because they name has other meanings, unlike mista mushroom. It just seems rather unfair that's all.--tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>

<p>Proposed for deletion, but I feel we should debate it. Prod concern was "Lack of noteriety, flamebait hotspot (see history)," and prod was applied to an essentially wiped version of the article. I've restored the article so we can see the problems during this debate; I agree the tone is inappropriate and it might in some ways be an attack page, but calling it a "hotspot" doesn't seem right to me. I think this comes down to whether or not this cracker is notable, and whether anyone will bother cleaning up the article. I say <b>delete,</b> because I doubt it on both fronts, but perhaps someone who knows more about <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skulltag.html" title="Skulltag">Skulltag</a> would disagree. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:08, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When scanning the newly created articles, I saw this sharp-<i>looking</i> article, but something didn't seem right. I polled a few opinions at the reference desk/miscellaneous and it appears there's consensus that it's nn. I initially stamped it with a Prod (reason: appears to be a non-notable porn starlet, article sure looks pretty though); however a "mysterious" anon user went in and removed the prod tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Noir&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53624877" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christina_Noir&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=53624877" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Needless to say, this appears to be a <b>vanity page</b> (or possibly even an attack page) but it boils down to one simple thing: Non-Notablity.

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN and vanity, no verification of claims or notability. The creator of the article admits to being her husband in the comment on the image creation. There's a bar for adult performers to reach, and I can't see that this gal approaches it.

<li><b>Wait</b> - Are we sure this is vanity? Why don't we ask people who are involved with this article to provide verifiable links that show that this is not just self promotion?

And when it comes to notability, it is subjective and purely POV. I've never heard of her. However, maybe she has a large fan base. I notice there is absolutely nothing on this articles talk page. Why not start discussions there, post a warning that there may be issues, prod if nothing is done, then go to AfD. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielZimmerman_601c.html" title="User:DanielZimmerman">DanielZimmerman</a> 16:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Herein lies is the problem... everyone thinks it is "extra effort by nominator to inform prior to prodding or afd" when it is a courtesy that should be done on <i>every</i> AfD that isn't a Speedy of blatent vandalism (and it takes all of 3-5 minutes to post something on the article talk page or creator talk page). <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#Before_nominating_an_AfD</a> doesn't mandate it, but it does suggest it.

<dd>That's a pretty broad brush. I wrote that nothing in <i>this article...</i> which quickly became "everyone thinks." The implication of that language was that other articles may be appropriate for pre-notice while this one is not. I approach awarding for deletion on a case-by-case basis. As for biting, you're suggesting that the act of nominating an article for deletion is itself a form of biting in the absence of pre-notice and always shows a lack of courtesy. We'll just have to disagree on that score. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 22:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the implication is that <i>every</i> article brought to AfD/PROD should start with a good faith attempt to contact the creator (or in the case of articles with a large number of editors, comment on the Talk page) and this article is no exception. This should not be seen as extra effort; this should be seen a common courtesy and an extention of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. You are correct; I am of the opinion that AfD/PROD of an article that has existed for less than 1 day and was created by an editor who has been around for 2 days without an attempt to contact him/her and explain the issues with the article does show a distinct lack of courtesy and runs counter to the spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> (unless of course the article is an obvious and blatent case of vandalism/hoax).

<li><b>Comment</b>. You don't look at the number of search results found through google, you look at the number of <i>unique hits</i>, by scrolling to the end of the pages.

This means that of the 799 listed in the intitial search (the amount listed as total found before scrolling to the end), 723 were mirrors, internal pages of the same sites, etc. Not that google is the ultimate authority. Some subjects do not lend themselves to lots of webpage listings while still being notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Then by this method the Paizley Adams example above would return only 423 entries than the 80,000 cited above?

<p>No evidence in the article that seems to claim notability corresponds to any of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">notability standards</a>. For example, while the artist has released several albums, none were on a significant label (those mentioned lack articles themselves). Again, while the artist has been featured in a publish work, that work was not demonstrated as non-trivial.

He has also collaborated with notable blues musicians and had his songs covered by many. 3) He has been featured in multiple journals, magazines and television programs; the most recent of which was an article in "Sing Out!" magazine. 4) He has become known as a figure head in the resurgance of the folk and folk-blues style. 5) He has been nominaed for several east coast awards for his albums, and won several music competitions. 6) He has had his music in rotation on major radio networks. 7) He is frequently referenced or covered in publications devoted to the folk and folk-blues sub culture.

He was a significant member of the Estonian Government in Exile during the Soviet years. As for my comment, I can assure you, as creator of the article, I am not in the habit of "making people up" for Wiki entries - as my other contributions will show. And he is indeed included in the link you claiim he isn't. <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 20:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN; I'm sorry, but I'd dispute the premise that he's "well known" to Estonians.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per ExRat. The degree to which anyone <i>needs</i> to be active or meaningful as the War Minister of a government in exile for 50 years, and without an army, is probably the answer to RGTraynor's question; I imagine it was a completely ceremonial duty.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have two things to add to this. Firstly, I have little doubt that this article I created was listed for deletion by <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack O'Lantern</a> as retaliation for for reverting one of his edits and finding an internet source which proved him to be wrong. It just so happened, the following day, my article came up for deletion by him. I think it is exceptionally poor form to not be able to work well with others. I generally try to work well with others and certainly never stoop so low in a pedantic war with someone as a revenge tactic. I am finding the whole thing petty and deplorable. I have been a member of Wikipedia for nearly a year now and have never had such a problem with another individual. I tended to use Wikipedia as as a personal hobby and rarely interacted with others (for good or bad). This really sours my experience.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, on Avdy Andresson - I would think (obviously, just my opinion) that someone who served with distinction in two world wars, was a government official, organized the Estonian Defence League in the 1970s and was the oldest living member of the Estonian Government in Exile (and from March 1, 1990 to June 20, 1990 techinically acting as Prime Minister) would be worthy of at least a stub article. I find it extraordinary that there are individual articles on each contestant (yes, even every <i>losing</i> contestant) of <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Next_Top_Model_9535.html" title="America's Next Top Model">America's Next Top Model</a></i>, yet my article on Andresson is considered "non-notable". <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 21:07, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rather than getting into the personal conflict, can you tell us what you used for your sources? Just the gravestone? Did you know him personally? I still can't find Andresson in the page from that first link, can you help? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <small><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></small> 21:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I did not know the man personally - I had however heard of him. Apparently I am not the only one, considering someone else had left information on his talk page. I am currently unable to find the links that I had used to gather information on him. If this results in the article being deleted, then so be it. This is the only other link I could find currently, however it is not one of the links I had used prior: <a href="http://mss3.libraries.rutgers.edu/dlr/output.php?demono=rutgers-lib:4047&amp;ds=DS3" class="external autonumber" title="http://mss3.libraries.rutgers.edu/dlr/output.php?demono=rutgers-lib:4047&amp;ds=DS3" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. That is just for the verification that he is not an individual I "made up". I am not involved in a "personal confilct" with anyone, nor have I been. There is only one individual who is involved in a personal conflict, and that is the individual who listed the article for deletion in retaliation for another matter. If it's that big of a deal, just delete the thing, since I am unable to currently find the internet sources I used for the article. I look forward to all those "notable" articles on such contemporary greats as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Breckenridge_3c69.html" title="Alex Breckenridge">Alex Breckenridge</a>, Ashley Black, <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebony_Taylor_b5f6.html" title="Ebony Taylor">Ebony Taylor</a> and Diane Hernandez. <a href="../../../e/x/r/User%7EExRat_dd16.html" title="User:ExRat">ExRat</a> 22:12, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Y'know ... I'm really wanting now to see some sourcing, <i>any</i> sourcing, on this guy. First we're supposed to think he's notable because he served in two World Wars (like, oh, about ten million other people) and that he was a minister of a government-in-exile that wasn't internationally recognized (like, oh, many other such bodies). He doesn't show up on that Estonian website, he doesn't appear in the Estonian Wikipedia, and he has only eight Google hits, <b>every single one</b> which is either this article or a Wikimirror. Right now this article has <i>no</i> verifiability, and fails per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 00:31, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This urban legend is discussed at both Snopes and Straight Dope, both of which are reliable sources on the validity of urban legends. This topic is also mentioned in the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_Library_f5d6.html" title="Vatican Library">Vatican Library</a> article, and a Google search on "Vatican pornography collection" indicates this is a fairly common meme. Given that the Vatican Library is <i>also</i> supposed to house the world's largest collection of occult texts, perhaps the article could be renamed <b>Vatican Library urban legends</b> or <b>Catholic Church urban legends</b>, combining similar urban legends and conspiracy theories. Also, I'm sure there are references to this concept in various fictional works, which should be added to the article, with references. - <a href="../../../c/n/i/User%7ECNichols_7db0.html" title="User:CNichols">CNichols</a> 22:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You would have a lot more credibility if you were able to give objective reasons why you consider the article "pretentious". Ageist disrimination defeats part of the beauty of wikipedia and we currently have 136 citizens. Sorry RHaworth, it's the first democratic art community (and please correct me if I'm wrong, the only democratic virtual community) and many people out there would consider that something worth noting. -- <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiphyte_54f6.html" title="User:Epiphyte">epiphyte</a> 19:54, 17 May 2006 PST</li>

<dd>(I think we treat the above as a <b>keep</b> vote!) What's pretentious? Virtually every sentence but mainly the use of "citizen" rather than a straightforward "user". Using <u>your</u> terminology, you have 143 "freeriders" and 1 "active citizen" who has popped up in the last few minutes. But if you want to say it's not pretentious, I won't press the point. But I would like to take you up on the "ageist" remark: who is being ageist and in which direction are you suggesting Wikipedia has an ageist slant? Personally I think WP has a systemic bias towards the young - witness stuff like Thomas the Tank Engine cruft and the non-notable bands of which we delete three or four every day. I try in a small way to offset that bias. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 09:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A citizen is generally thought of as an individual who has certain inalienable rights, especially with regards to political participation. Nonetheless, I went through and changed "citizen" to "member" where appropriate. The term "freeriders" is what is used to refer to "members" who do not pay taxes. Just because a wikipedia member is not active or has not "donated to keep wikipedia running" does not mean that they are not members. You were being ageist when you criticized the article because it covered a subject that was "created last week". You may feel that WP has a bias towards the young but instead of saying something is not notable because it's too new it's more helpful if you offer objective criterion that define whether or not something is "notable". I've studied virtual communities fairly extensively and when compared to the sociopolitical and economic structures of other communities (past and present) I would say ArtRemains is quite "notable". Yes it is new, no, it doesn't get many hits on google or alexis, but I don't think media coverage should equal "notability". <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiphyte_54f6.html" title="User:Epiphyte">epiphyte</a> 8:01, 18 May 2006 PST</dd>

<p>I know that Wikipedia is drowned with bogus articles. I find ArtRemains to be different from any other community before it because of it's structure. I would argue that the way the site is set up is notable; it is extremely unique. I suggest you take a look before spraying weed killer. I understand if Wikipedia does not want the article at this time. I would like to know what exactly it is about the article that makes it deletable. I am curious as to how notability matters at this time. This article was put up early because the people on the site were thinking ahead. The site will likely be notable when it is operational. It is not out of beta yet and it is extremely interesting. Many things are going to happen in the near future. I would appreciate a "wait and see" approach to this deletion rather than a "start swinging your sword and ask questions later" approach. Sincerely, ZekiBaka.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's rather annoying that how the word "student film" is being thrown around. If you are a student and make a film, it's not immedially a "student film." It is a student film if made for a class, anything on your own is a "film." And if something is a student film that doesn't imply that it is bad or poor (i.e. THX1138).

<dd>I think that's a fair point. To my mind, if the film gets a distribution deal, it graduates from "student film" to "indie". That ok? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't. I wouldn't expect a film that has apparantly just recently gone through post-production to be released at this time. The Web site for the production company says that it will premiere this fall, which is a reasonable schedule for any film. A film that has professional actors cast, has a score written and recorded by a symphony orchestra, and has all of the other necessary crew is not easily abandoned - it has a producer, an insurer (required by the Screen Actor's Guild and other unions) and most important, a contract dictating its release. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 16:30, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We see indy films here all the time that have been completed but never released. That's why they schedule all these festivals, looking for a distributor.

<dd>If you were familiar with the workings of the film industry, you would know that no actor in the Screen Actor's Guide can work on a movie without a contract. The contract ALWAYS stipulates the release of the film. In this case, the article cited in the comment below (strangely, Arniep alleges a hoax and then posts evidence disproving his allegation) indicates the use of an Experimental Contract which stipulates that the actors don't get paid until the film is <i>distributed</i>. You confuse the use of the terms <i>released</i> and <i>distributed</i>. A film is released when it is screened. This film will be screened barring extreme circumstances, and plenty. If a distributor decides to put the movie into theatres and/or DVD, that is another thing - and that decision is based on the potential commercial viability of the film. So what you are really arguing here is that art forms that are not deemed marketable by large corporate distributors are inherently non-notable and should therefore not be covered in Wikipedia. Am I correct? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:13, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, and I respect that opinion even if I disagree. I just wanted to clear the table of "to release or not release" and hoax discussions and get the real issue out there. If you can build a consensus that art has to be seen by a significant number of people to be notable, then so it shall be. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:28, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if there was some confusion over terms. I suspect to most people, "release" means more than a few showings. The main point, I believe is that if a movie is not distributed, and 99% of the country will never even have a chance to hear of it, much less see it, it can't be regarded as notable. It's not a judgement on the quality of the work. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, there is good evidence that these students have deliberately conducted a hoax campaign of inserting a large amount of false information to Wikipedia and releasing false press releases as part of a hyping campaign. We shouldn't have any articles on anything minor that hasn't been released full stop as it's just an encouragement to use Wikipedia for that sort of manipulation. This article <a href="http://screenmag.tv/feature.aspx?fid=676" class="external autonumber" title="http://screenmag.tv/feature.aspx?fid=676" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> states that the film was directed by Will Slocombe <i>of the award-winning student film “Stoke Mechanics”</i>. Google shows no results for any film of that name or any award it supposedly received (which would be expected if the film or award were of any significance). Arniep 17:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Last month there was a lot of sockpuppetry over the AfD for Riki Lee Travolta, who is in this movie; and Arniep has found blog posts by the creators of the film that he believes shows they were using wikipedia to hype the film. I'm not (entirely) convinced but more importantly it's an <i>ad hominem</i> attack; judge the article on its own merits. There doesn't seem to be a specific notability guideline for films. So it comes down to whether you believe an unfinished independent film that has not (yet) been shown at a notable festival and does not (yet) have a distribution agreement should have an article here at the present time. If instead of notabilty you simply wish to consider verifiability, the film has no Lexis/Nexis hits (even in Illinois regional newspapers) and the only sources currently available are IMDB and the U of Chicago student newspaper. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:46, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Where does it says that English language support for verifiability is necessary? Please tell me that, I would like to know. In WP:RS we can find <i>... foreign-language sources are acceptable in terms of verifiability, subject to the same criteria as English-language sources.</i>. Don't create your own policies. This article is verifiable! It is a valid article, political parties are notable. And by the way, the title is perfectly translated.

<ul>
<li>You are indeed right about the actual text of the official policy. However, when a topic has no verifiability in English that raises immediate notability flags in my mind. When a purported organization title gets no google hits, that probably means the organization isn't notable or someone has translated the title incorrectly. For that reason, I have stressed the need for English sources. If the title was translated perfectly (which I believe it probably was), doesn't it concern you that no one else in the English speaking world with an internet connection seems to know or care about the "Proletarian Union" Committee of the Portuguese Marxist-Leninist Communist Organization (in reorganization)? The other reason that I have asked for English language sources is that I, and probably most English language Wikipedia readers, can not read Portuguese. While I always try to assume good faith, believing an article solely on the basis of sources I can't understand is difficult for me. If several Portuguese speaking Wikipedians will independently confirm the content of the sources, I am willing to accept that the article is verifiable and concentrate solely on notability concerns. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 17:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - what needs to be clarified is if this was the faction that took part in the 1979, 1980 and 1983 elections as OCMLP.

<dd>This isn't the best place to have this discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wing-Time and its line of Buffalo Wing Sauces is notable and well known in the gourmet food industry, especially amongst folks in the hot sauce circles and aficionados of Buffalo Chicken Wings. The sauces are available widely throughout the United States and also many other countries. I know that most of the major food chains here in Seattle carry Wing-Time and have seen it in Hawaii and other places I frequent. In fact, I suspect Wing-Time to be one of the largest manufacturers of Buffalo Wing Sauces world-wide even though it is a somewhat niche market. Also, you might consider other related Wikipedia topics which involve similar type companies that have been approved in the past (although I realize this is not in and of itself a legitimate criteria for approval).
