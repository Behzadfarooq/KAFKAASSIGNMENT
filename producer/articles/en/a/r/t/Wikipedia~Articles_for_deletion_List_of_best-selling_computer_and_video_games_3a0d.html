<dd><b>Speedy Keep</b>, close per it being a bad faith nomination. The only time the user ever suggested that the article should be deleted is because a website, VGCharts, had been proven to be a poor source for Wikipedia, and when that happened, the user talked about deleting it if they are removed. And how can you not see how it can be salvaged? Just because a page which is no better than a Geocities page isn't verifiable does not mean that NeoGAF, IGN, GameSpot, et al. are suddenly not verifiable. At no point is it insisted that the article have exact numbers, either. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First of all the only reason I suggested the article be deleted is because most of the entries are unsourced due to the fact that the majority of the entries were sourced by VGCharts which was recently removed by <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a>. Secondly, I was not the only user to suggest the article be deleted, several users have recently stated that they think the article should be deleted due to unverifiability. If you or someone can greatly improve the state of the article, I'd gladly remove the nomination, unfortunately I do not think that is possible. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 06:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And you can prove it unverifiable how so? We get NPD, Media Create, Famitsu, etc. information every week (NPD every month). And VGCharts was deleted because no one could prove verifiability and the one supporting it the most more or less gave up. How can you claim unverifiability when we have several multi-million dollar companies who provide sales information for all three major regions? Their existence shows verifiability. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mean because people were actively searching for replacement links to VGCharts, right? The fact that I have not worked my ass off to get sources for this article does not indicate that they are not anywhere in the universe. NPD numbers are verifiable, and NPD numbers are available.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Whew. I was really, really tempted to vote speedy keep on this because I am positive this is a bad faith nomination (if you have a lot of time and a strong stomach feel free to see the talk page of this article to see what I mean), but I think that the article as it exists must fail for lack of verifiabilty and therefore is against policy. Now I have no problem with an article about best-selling games, but even after endless rounds of discussion, no one has come up with a good source for most of this material, while all attempts to remove the bad material and leave what is verifiable has failed and led to edit wars. The fact of the matter is that video game sales data is jealously guarded by the NPD, and virtually the only time reliable data comes out is when a company wants to tout its own success (see this article for more background: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200401/ai_ziff117173" class="external autonumber" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200401/ai_ziff117173" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. At this point, the only solutions I can see are an RfC or deletion with protection against recreation.

<p><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b>. 1) The whole point of Wikipedia is to improve articles, and this article has plenty of room for improvement. Our goal should be to fix the article. 2) If the article doesn't have sources, find some. If you can't find them, then nominate it for deletion. If no sources can be found by anyone who's read the nomination for deletion, then it should be deleted. However, I can't imagine that this information isn't out there in one form or another from a reliable source. 3) On the talk page, I found this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=88364020&amp;oldid=88336906" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=88364020&amp;oldid=88336906" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> post by <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a>, in which he states, "The article looks rather empty and silly right now, perhaps it should be deleted" and "if the state of this article doesn't improve soon I will nominate it for deletion." Although I firmly believe <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> has the best intentions, the reasoning behind this article's deletion is flawed for two reasons: a) It is based on some sort of "invisible timer" by which someone has to improve the article to avoid a deletion nomination and b) An article's "silliness" is cause for deletion, and although I certainly agree its current format is anything but helpful, I would argue that that's more of a cause for Wikification. Thus, I cannot support this nomination in its current state while the article remains salvagable. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 07:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nice job avoiding the statement that shows that what TJ Spyke says is incorrect. Anyone who subscribes to NPD can get the numbers.

<li>ALTTP, it's not just a matter of money, NPD has to agree to provide it to you (the same way that can't just pay $2,000 to Nintendo and expect them to give you a Wii development kit). They have in the past stopped providing data to subscribers they have caught providing the data to the public (like on a messageboard).

<li>To add to the above, this is by far the most reliable source for sales of video games in North America and the primary source used by everyone from the media to the video game companies themselves. Some of this info trickles out at various times in various ways, but as NPD makes its profit by sharing this info with subscribers, they zealously guard their data from public consumption. As a result, getting good sales figures for video games can be extremely difficult, though is certainly not impossible. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 08:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> This is one article that I have personally found useful on a number of occasions, as I'm sure have others. The "original research" claims are ridiculous: <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> prohibits <i>unpublished theories</i> and <i>self-conducted experiments</i> and such. For this to qualify as original research, perhaps the authors have secretly installed hidden cameras in every retail outlet in the world so they know who sold how many of what? Far more likely, these are sourced either from gaming magazines or reports such as NPD group's annual overview of the video game industry. I agree there should be more of a push to determine sources on these, but the article itself must be kept. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We do not judge the sources from the source, but the source itself. As an example, suppose blogger ZZZ says "YYY sucks". Now, we would not go to article YYY and add a controversy section stating that "ZZZ thinks YYY sucks" or "YYY sucks" and referencing such blogger, because the blogger is not reliable. However, if IGN or Gamespot have an article that reads "Initial response about YYY is negative, with even some bloggers like ZZZ stating it sucks", we would be add such information to the YYY article. ZZZ, the blogger, is still a unreliable source. However, IGN or Gamespot are considered reliable in terms of video games, and although the fact they quoted ZZZ does not make the blogger more reliable than before, at least we now can quote a reliable site with basically the same information from the blogger. VGCharts hasn't got the reputation from IGN, Gamespot or Gamasutra, thus it is not considered a reliable source and should not be quoted directly. However, if IGN posts VGCharts numbers, we would be able to quote IGN using VGCharts numbers, but not VGCharts directly. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 20:18, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I've always had a bit of trouble applying WP:V to an AfD debate. There are some for which it's obvious - Bigfoot Exists! would be an example because the very subject of the article is not verifiable. But <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games.html" title="List of best-selling computer and video games">List of best-selling computer and video games</a>? That seems much less clear - there are obviously such things as computer and video games. They're sold. Some sell better than others. Some sell best...ergo, there are best-selling computer and video games, and it's possible to make a list with the proper information. So it's only a question of what to include, how to cite it, and how to format it. That's the proper dispute, and it's the dispute A Link to the Past and Dionysus were in before this was taken to AfD. (I agree that the AfD was almost certainly done in bad faith. Any AfD that follows three reverts is almost always going to be in bad faith.) There's a good question of how to cite these things - but as the above discussion illustrates, there are ideas. Someone has this data - as discussed above, it exists. The question is how to access the proper data, apply it, cite it, etc. That's not a verifiability dispute; that's a citation dispute.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First of all, aggregating and ordering material from sources is not Original Research; it's <i>not</i> original research if your sources say "Game X was produced for console Z", "Game X sold W copies", and you order all games for console X by number of copies they sold. Original research implies <i>conclusions</i> and allegations not explained anywhere; it doesn't mean you can't put work in the article and organise it in a manner that makes it more useful for the reader.<br />
Secondly, this is a classic case of information for which verifiable sources <i>can</i> be found, and anyone who claims otherwise is obviously not thinking big enough. Seriously, now, what would deleting this article really prove? That we're utterly paranoid about everything, and can't even think of the possibility that there might be reliable lists that list this stuff? That we cannot let <i>potentially</i> badly sourced material live in article history? I'm not pointing you to a source for this stuff because I have no idea where to find the source myself, all I have is a gut feeling that <i>someone just might have compiled such list</i>, <b>duh</b>; all I'm saying is that it's ridiculous to delete the article if people haven't bothered to find <i>that</i> source yet. We're making a mockery out of how Wikipedia is supposed to work in a <i>sane</i> world. This nomination proves <i>exactly</i> what's wrong with the current delete-happiness based on "lack of sources". If I were in a worse mood (and in one of these I might), I might make this AfD the poster-boy.

<li>And please save your over-the-top rhetoric for an issue you have some understanding of. Unfortunately sales information is not available in a reliable way for most games. For every game we have concrete sales figures there are many more which we do not. As a result, the list fails to have meaning. What information we have on game sales is better conveyed in individual articles and perhaps an article, as opposed to a list, on video game sales. At present, this list can never hope to serve its purpose of identifying best-selling video games with any regularlity or accuracy, and it therefore fails to be verifiable, which is the big no-no of wikipedia. While some may have dragged original research into this debate, that is not the policy that is actually impacted here. This is not the movie or music industries, where this stuff is reported all the time. This is also not an industry supported by much secondary scholarship, so I doubt anyone has already put together the big list you speak of. Your vote is your vote, and I know I am not going to change it, but I hope I can point out how your little rant casts you in a somewhat poor light (though, to be fair, I have certainly enganged in worse rants from time to time myself&#160;;) <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, I suppose December 5, 2005 isn't just recently... but I suppose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30996805" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=30996805" rel="nofollow">December 10, 2005</a> is though? And I scoff at your claims that I am twisting anything. There were no VGCharts links in the September version because they had been removed by me! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=78814800&amp;oldid=78760008" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=78814800&amp;oldid=78760008" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> I hope you will stop making false claims. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 04:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>What exactly are you showing with the December 10 link? As for your October link, the version I linked was about 30 days prior to your version. On September 9 2006 <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteMinority_a18f.html" title="User:WhiteMinority">User:WhiteMinority</a> sourced most of the article with VGCharts, which of course now we know it cannot be used. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=74803716&amp;oldid=74784784" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=74803716&amp;oldid=74784784" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 05:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One - Check the Everything and Nothing link.</li>
<li>Two - And on August 8, 2006, I complained about VGCharts' usage.</li>
<li>Three - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74784502" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74784502" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> If VGCharts was only "recently added", with you trying to act as if WhiteMinority just added it, why would it be there before the edit you cite? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:53, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I meant was that the article wasn't heavily sourced by VGCharts until recently, I consider two months to be recent. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 06:28, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, it can be assumed that the unsourced numbers were from EaN, just like the vast majority of the PS2 numbers were from there. The article had been progressively developed with sources and numbers since December 10, 2005. And they were just recently removed. You seem to imply that the article has been unsourced for an entire year. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. From what I can tell, this appears to be a content dispute. As such, it qualifies as a bad-faith nomination, and AfD is NOT for resolving content disputes. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 07:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Not only is nominating an article for AfD for lack of sources after having a content dispute about the sources that were there a bad faith nom, but lack of sources is not a valid reason for deletion. Please keep your arguements on the talk page, and out of AfD. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 19:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually my reason for nominating this article was for unverifiability, a valid reason to delete the article. However I have withdrawn my nomination because the hundreds of unsourced entries have been removed from the article, only sourced entries remain and I believe that's the way it should be. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 22:16, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
