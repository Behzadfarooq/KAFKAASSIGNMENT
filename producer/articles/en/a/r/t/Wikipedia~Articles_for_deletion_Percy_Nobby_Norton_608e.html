<p>This article, I freely admit, is a work of genius. It's funny and creative. Unfortunately, while Percy Nobby Norton does indeed appear to have been an Australian folk singer, he is entirely unnotable, and everything else here is made up. Among many other reasons to believe this are his alleged 1902 publication of "Calvin and Knobes", and the 1923 publication of "Desperate Househusbands". Good joke, but it's gone far enough. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong not delete</b>, Sorry to interfere yet I am a postgraduate student at Monash University in Australia and currently studying Australian and New Zealand Folklore. Last month I completed a reasearch assignment on two ballads called "The Fossicker's Song" and "The Raspberry Picker's Song". As a frequent user of WIKIPEDIA's excellent encyclopedia, I stumbled upon Percy Norton. This article provided me with so much laughs that I had to print it and show it to my Lecturer today! After reading that it would be deleted from WIKIPEDIA I felt quite shocked yet understanding. Perhaps if some explicit passages were ommited and proper facts added, then it would be very amusing yet informative article on a little-known Australian poet.

<li><b>Strong not delete</b>, If something is to be considered for deletion, the information provided must be proven wrong. As it stands, neither those who have written the article or those wishing for the article to be deleted have provided evidence. The author has also suggested he will be adding references and citations, as seen in the first paragraph. I therefore suggest caution is the order of the day, and that this article should remain untoucher. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by HRH MJW (<a href="../../../h/r/h/User_talk%7EHRH_MJW_ae6d.html" title="User talk:HRH MJW">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HRH_MJW_52d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/HRH MJW">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>This 'blog' was started only after this AFD was started, and looks suspiciously similar to that 'started' by the fictitious author <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Trevor_K_Grant_d9ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Trevor K Grant">Trevor K Grant</a> the day after there was an AFD on his article.
