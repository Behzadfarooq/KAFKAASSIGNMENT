<li><b>Keep</b>. I put the search terms "Vidoll kei" in Google and got over 4,600 hits. In addition to being the "flagship" band of the Under Code label (for whatever that is worth), this group is named on fan sites and blogs all over the world (US, Germany, Italy), they were covered in Vol. 1 of <i>Cure</i>, a Japanese magazine on the visual kei and indie scene (see eBay listing <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2245&amp;item=6962638893&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2245&amp;item=6962638893&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and their CD's appear on the lists of many commercial web sites.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- There is no indication from this article that there's anything particularly notable about this station, but there's no harm in keeping it. My thought is that there's no point in writing an article on a cookie-cutter radio station unless it has an interesting history (if it was notable in and of itself in the present, it wouldn't be cookie-cutter), but if the article's written there's a chance someone might look it up. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 00:10, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That suggestion has some merit. The only problem is that <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">Color</a> is too big and needs to be broken up.

<li>Why to <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple.html" title="Purple">purple</a>, and not to <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet.html" title="Violet">violet</a>? Well, because violet <i>is</i> a purple, for anyone's money. It's not like the results of a "merge" consensus here is binding on article content until time immemorial: for all intents and purposes, voting for "merge" has the effect that the content ought to be kept, but not as a stand-alone article. If it ends up in an article other than the most popular "merge" suggestion, it's not like the VfD police will hunt you down and make you move it back. Placing it in a new article <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colour_perception.html" title="Colour perception">Colour perception</a> would certainly be ideal, but "someone must go forth and write said article" is <i>definitely</i> beyond the competence of the VfD process... <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 00:38, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple.html" title="Purple">Purple</a>. I understand there are perceptual issues involved, but I still don't feel this article frames them well. Firstly, the usual terminology as I understand it is <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo.html" title="Indigo">indigo</a></i> and <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet.html" title="Violet">violet</a>, given Newton's insistence on crowbarring both of these into the spectrum for his own nefarious reasons, despite very few being able to readily distinguish two distinct colours with the naked eye. The implied distinction with purple is to confuse matters enormously, as surely most people would agree both _are_ "shades of purple". Secondly, colour perception is a much broader topic than just this one issue, which makes very little sense picked out in isolation. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 20:10, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Erk! Violet is a purple in much the same way that orange is a red. Purple and violet are enormously different and I think that very few people (one, at least, clearly) would ever think of calling the two the same thing. And no, indigo and violet miss out the red part of the range completely and totally ignore purple - the reason for this being you ignoring the "back-loop" of the spectrum that is necessary if you have colour names for admixtures of the colours at the two ends. If the information is to be merged, it should be merged with b0th parents - as I suggested in my original vote. The idea of a colour perception article isn't bad, though 9and given that my MSc was in visual perception, perhaps I should have a go at it...). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 05:31, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

<li>This is, as far as I can tell, <b>not verifiable</b>. In my understanding, the idea that "purple" and "violet" have specific, encyclopedic differences is debatable. In many contexts, the words purple and violet are synonymous.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it interesting that some people in this debate seem to think that purple and violet are the same and therefore the article is unneccessary, whereas others think it's worth merging this item with purple and/or violet. This debate is therefore a perfect example of what the article is referring to - the confusion as to whether these two quite different hues are or are not the same colour! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 02:47, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

<li>Indigo could be seen as a shade of violet, but it is certainly nothing like purple.

<p>The whole item is fake and entirely invented.</p>
<p>This article is simply complete nonsense! I strongly recommend to remove it instantly, please. This kind of disinformation is dangerous for all wikiusers, because it confuses them with Â´factsÂ´ which are intended to convince the reader of the Â´truthÂ´ of this virtual history (or may be intentional propaganda?). Chinese and asian history are severely distorted in this abstruse fabrication. Viet Nam and Mongolia e.g. both of them firm allies or even satellites of the USSR, had not even diplomatic relations with the PR China in the period (1980-85) discussed. The PR China attacked Viet Nam in February 1979 in order to Â´punishÂ´ Viet Nam for occupying PR Chinas ally Â´khmer rougeÂ´ Cambodia and concluding a military pact with the USSR. After 3 weeks of vicious battles along the sino-vietnamese border approx. 25000 chinese and 15000 vietnamese soldiers were dead; some vietnamese bordertowns razed to the ground and diplomatic relations were only restored in 1991. This item constitutes a provocation for all chinese, vietnamese and korean people. So please remove that crap! 29.5.05 G.R.S</p>
<p>Additionally it is especially bizarre by the author of this fabrication to maintain that PR Mongolia where up to 150000 soviet troops (heavy armour and ballistic missiles included!) were stationed until 1991, did conclude a military pact with USSR archenemy PR China! Quite superfluous to describe the northkorean line of equidistance between PRC and USSR which enabled KIM IL SUNG to exert more influence (and get more material aid from both sides)in this peculiar strategic situation. The DPRK actually had bilateral military pacts with both PRC and USSR. Wikipedia is no place for virtual provocation, please remove this article soon! 29.05.05 G.R.S</p>
<p>Another example for the authors total ignorance of facts is his statement that Angola got into this Â´pactÂ´ 1982. During this time there raged a bitter civil war between the MPLA government faction (in Luanda) allied with the USSR (also with Cuba which sent up to 40000 troops) and the UNITA under warlord JONAS SAVIMBI propped up by the USA, South Africa (Apartheidgovernment), Israel and PR China. Actually PR China was the biggest armssupplier of the UNITA second only to the USA. After 25 years of fighting approx. 1.5 million people were killed in this gruesome war. No further comment needed about the pure idiocy of argumentation in this provocative fake item. I suggest that this insulting piece of anti-chinese propaganda should be removed after this deletion procedure. 30.05.05 G.R.S G.R.S 30.05.05</p>
<p>The in the item mentioned Â´Vientiane TreatyÂ´ seems to have existed between 1985-89 but got invalid after the vietnamese military disengagement (1989 Cambodia, 1991 Laos). Some sources say that this tripartite agreement was only a propaganda coup to legitimize vietnamese domination in indochina and had no real effect on regional security. A bilateral military pact between Laos and Viet Nam concluded in 1977 still exists but Â´onlyÂ´ vietnamese military and intelligence Â´instructorsÂ´ are present in the country today. The vietnamese satellite government of Cambodia lead by khmer rouge dissident HUN SEN initially had a similar pact with Viet Nam but after HanoiÂ´s retreat in the fall 1989 and the subsequent reduction of vietnamese influence Phnom Penh dissolved it. At present HUN SEN and his CPP still control Cambodia in collaboration with the royalist FUNCINPEC of Prince NORODOM RANARRIDH (ever loyal to China!) but he has changed his overlord to the rising superpower PR China. Also in Laos chinese influence is on the rise but the old pathet lao guard still on duty in Vientiane know that they came only to power by vietnamese bajonets and do not want to break with Hanoi for the time being. However it only a question of time when Laos and inevitably also Viet Nam enter orbit around the new (or very old!) asian hegemon.In the next few years eventually even the US will learn that fighting against gravitation is simply a fools game.

<li>The article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Laos_b295.html" title="History of Laos">History of Laos</a> mentions a "Vientiane cease-fire agreement in 1973". I googled with the words <i>Vientiane "cease-fire agreement"</i> and found some more information. In <a href="http://www.neeg.org/emails.215.html" class="external text" title="http://www.neeg.org/emails.215.html" rel="nofollow">this address</a> Victor N. Xiong writes about the "cease-fire agreement between the two Lao factions ... signed ... in Vientiane on February 21, 1973." (It goes on.) It seems that this treaty wasn't very meaningful. This could be a section on the History of Laos page. That way it could still be linked to if ever needed. <b>Redirect</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/p/User%7EWipe_5c27.html" title="User:Wipe">Wipe</a> 14:46, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I agree that this is most likely a fake, I just want to respond to Barfooz's comment. Kim Wong-Shing, or, rather, the surname Wong-Shing is Chinese, definitely not Korean. And it is entirely possible that there are Chinese people living in Guyana. Also, Guyana is a french-speaking country in South America, not Africa. I just wanted to clear that up. But otherwise, I think there is a possibility that there is a novelist by this name in Guyana, but unless a more valid source is found I say delete.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Last year i wrote a term paper on South American (note: south american, not african) authors and Kim Wong-Shing was one of them. So I think that all of you are depending on Google etc. much too much. Also the name Wong-Shing is Chinese not Korean. Kim Wong-Shing is certainly not very well known, but if I could go find the book where I found information on her, I would post it. This isn't the most well written paragraph on her, but at least someone out there was trying.<br /></li>

<dd>Understood. However the founder, Blaise Loong, is a well recognized figure within the martial arts community. He has been on the cover of Full Contact and Filipino Martial Arts magazines, and has written several articles for Black Belt. I'm sure the author of the piece would be willing to re-write the article if you provide the specific problems with the current article.

<dd>Perhaps it seems notability is lacking because the voters are not involved in martial arts or in the martial community? Just my opinion because he is well known among fighters in the community, including UFC and Pride competitors. And anyone serious in the martial arts will definitely come across his name over and over again.</dd>

<li>There is no mention of Amazon.com or any direct links to it.</li>
<li>This article contains information such as opening and ending theme songs, episode titles that are usually included in the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chobits.html" title="Chobits">main article</a> for an anime article. According to the history page, it has existed since Jul 2003, so I supposed people here have agreed that it would be better to spin off this portion into a separate article, just like <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chobits_characters.html" title="Chobits characters">Chobits characters</a> exist on a separate page.</li>
<li>It is not uncommon to mention the publishers of books.

<li><b>Comment.</b> While it is an interesting idea â if Wikipedia did not contain mention of works with non-expired copyright â that is certainly not the case for Wikipedia. It is extremely common for anime/manga articles, save stubs, to include titles listings of chapters/episodes and/or OP/ED theme songs (e.g. <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_%28manga%29.html" title="Naruto (manga)">Naruto (manga)</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mai-HiME_0db6.html" title="Mai-HiME">Mai-HiME</a> articles... pretty much any other with enough length).

<li>Actually, if people want to get speculation, the internet is turgid with Pokemon fansites. This page has a scanned picture of the Pokemon, a name that might be changed before the Pokemon is mentioned in the US, and some speculation about Mr. Mime.

<li>I quote: "No speculation" This is the facts. It appears in a movie released in a month, and is a template for when the games are released. (XD in August and Diamond/Pearl in November.)

<li>"Manene is the (unconfirmed) pre-evolution of Mr. Mime" is speculation. The rest is factual but marginal; it isn't known even known that Manene will be the English-language name, nor is it necessarily known that it will be in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon_XD_5ce7.html" title="Pokemon XD">Pokemon XD</a> or make any more than a cameo appearance in the next movie. (By the time Pearl/Diamond comes out, the Pokeprosal may have changed the way individual Pokemon articles are written, anyway.) Wikipedia still isn't a crystal ball, and, as there is practically zero info now (Here's a picture of a Pokemon, its name is this, Pokemon fans are speculating about it) and likely little information of value in for months if ever (I seriously doubt Manene is going to be the next Pikachu), I stand by my earlier assertions. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 07:52, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>From my experience, notability takes priority over crystal ball. I mentioned the next-gen consoles above, and they are definately notable enough to stay. But one could argue that they are still crystal ball topics. Since crystal ball is the only reason to delete Manene at this time, it is a matter of whether it is notable enough to remain until release.

<li>Serious. On other websites, you see things like <i>"Well, Newlegendarymon is going to be a Bug-Psychic type. This is because the previous legendaries have been alternating as fliers-nonfliers, and elemental-physical-psychic, (as long as you don't count Moltres, because he doesn't count), and the types have been going by reverse Japanese alphabetical order, so we are due for a non-flying Bug Psychic pokÃ©mon."</i> This page is rather free of such speculation. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 16:07, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>"It is widely believed to be the pre-evolution of Mr. Mime" isn't speculation, though. It says what the entire fan-base believes is true now.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article certainly has more references than the pro-Turkish side. In light with recent developments of another user, I think we should keep this and let him share his point of view, just as others have. BTW this is not a duplication of the Cyprus dispute. It only uses the same sources of info. This is not rewriting history. This action is obviously a historical truth. There was an invasion. But if I were not so busy or if I were not on vacation, would I sit back while I see various new articles pop up with a Turkish POV allegedly, which may be historical just as this article is? No I would not. I would state my own opinion as others have done. Nevertheless, I would have done thinks a lot differently than anyone here. I was already branded as a person with a POV but I would not go on a crusade to write articles for the hell of it. By now whoever started it is irrelevant and the fact that it is happening is the issue. I have a lot more to say on this matter but I have to be brief right now. I have to get back to my vacation.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article certainly has more references than the pro-Turkish side. In light with recent developments of another user, I think we should keep this and let him share his point of view, just as others have. BTW this is not a duplication of the Cyprus dispute. It only uses the same sources of info. This is not rewriting history. This action is obviously a historical truth. There was an invasion. But if I were not so busy or if I were not on vacation, would I sit back while I see various new articles pop up with a Turkish POV allegedly, which may be historical just as this article is? No I would not. I would state my own opinion as others have done. Nevertheless, I would have done thinks a lot differently than anyone here. I was already branded as a person with a POV but I would not go on a crusade to write articles for the hell of it. By now whoever started it is irrelevant and the fact that it is happening is the issue. I have a lot more to say on this matter but I have to be brief right now. I have to get back to my vacation.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. While I 100% agree that this article should <b>not</b> only be about some Star Wars character, <i>Handmaid/Handmaiden</i> are important concepts in mythology, history (esp. the history of female occupations and economic classes) and literature. There is definitely an encyclopedia article to be written but it's probably going to be difficult to research online.

<p>Seems to be a spoof. No mention of this product found in any online source except Wikipedia. Name claimed to derive from non-existent Yiddish word "Y'Rem"; happens to be English "merry" spelled backwards. Main ingredient is non-existent "Yppah-root extract" ("happy" backwards).

<li>The hoax was fairly notable, and in fact was somewhat significant. However, since there's no article on the conference nor its parent organization, and no established name for the hoax, the relevant part of the content should be <b>merged</b> to some article like Academic hoaxes or Hoaxes in computing. Mr. Stribling probably does not merit an article, as most of the coverage was about his computer program rather than about him, but the name should be a <b>redirect</b> to whatever article gets the hoax writeup. By the way: I see a number of article on VfD that read as if they were written by Stribling's program.

<p><i>Rationale:</i> There is, in fact, no ELCA congregation in St Paul, MN called Saint Pauls Lutheran. (see <a href="http://www.elca.org/ScriptLib/OS/Congregations/cdsSearch.asp?synod=3H&amp;sort=name" class="external text" title="http://www.elca.org/ScriptLib/OS/Congregations/cdsSearch.asp?synod=3H&amp;sort=name" rel="nofollow">here</a>). This article was originally created as Saint Paul's Lutheran Cathedral and consisted of nonsense text calling it the "servant cathedral" in St Paul. I edited it to remove such reference and make it sort of generic about a congregation in order to match what was done with the article Central Lutheran Cathedral which was edited and moved to Central Lutheran Church. Then I discovered that there isn't even a congregation with that name in St Paul, MN.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is no such thing as a Lutheran cathedral in the US, so I have also requested the deletion of that category. This article is therefore worthless and should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinHJ_27bb.html" title="User:EdwinHJ">EdwinHJ</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinHJ_d1f4.html" title="User talk:EdwinHJ">Talk</a> 20:16, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My guess (though I have no numbers) is that this site is much less popular, in terms of visitors or audience, than many we would delete as non-notable or advertisements. Are we applying a different standard to this article because it is a Wikimedia project? If we do, is that a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">self-reference</a>? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 22:58, 2005 May 30 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is debatable that such standards of self-reference already exist. For example, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a> may be less notable than some articles deleted, but stays for being a major figure within a major internet project.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hordes of people vote keep on bands with one EP, small town radio stations, and schools with only a few dozen students.

<li>"Major web project"? Its own statistics page says that it has "274 pages that are probably legitimate content pages.". That's about the size of <i>my own</i> web site. SPUI's search shows 20 results for what links to this site's main page (6 if one discounts the links that turn out to be from this and other Wikimedia projects). One of my own web pages has four times that many (0 of which are from Wikimedia projects).

I disagree with the height at which you place it. I don't think that this is something that people are going to enter directly into the "Go" box. (As I said earlier, if I did I would have voted Redirect.) For starters: It's not even the name of the project. According to the project's own main page it is called In Memoriam: September 11, 2001. According to Meta it is called 9-11 Memorial. (I'd have voted Redirect for either of those names, as well.) I'd like to see some evidence for any assertion that people are going to look up <i>this</i> name, though, given that it isn't even the name of the project. What makes you think that people are going to look for an article with <i>this</i> name? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:26, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</li>

As <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>'s shoot-self-in-the-foot argument demonstrates, Wikipedia doesn't have a separate article for <a href="http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikispecies:Main_Page">Wikispecies</a>.

And as pointed out above, there are few external references to it. If it were anyone else's wiki, we wouldn't have a separate article on it.

<li><i>Alterego is wrong, in that deleting this article has nothing whatever to do with removing the WikiMedia project.</i> Actually, you're wrong. As you can clearly see from reading the discussions above, it's a good first step. Additionally, you're more wrong than that. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikispecies.html" title="Wikispecies">Wikispecies</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a>, a perfect place on Wikipedia for including short blurbs about the foundation's various aspirations and projects in an encyclopedic context. Just to rub it in how <b>wrong</b> you are, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Commons_7b57.html" title="Wikimedia Commons">Wikimedia Commons</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> all have dedicated articles. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_In_Memoriam_9_11_ba95.html" title="Wikimedia In Memoriam 9/11">Wikimedia In Memoriam 9/11</a>'s existence relies simply in the virtue of whether or not the project's existence is well founded. If the project should be archived, as Angela suggests, then the article should not exist. However, if it is indeed found to be a neutral and existence worthy project then the standard of having articles on Wikimedia Foundation projects at Wikipedia should also be applied to the 9/11 article. Hence my comment: I vote in favor of deleting (or archiving, in the form of only making the database dump available) the entire project. As the merit of the existence of one is reliant on the other, a decision must be made that considers them hand in hand. It clearly calls for a further vote.

<li>It's not any sort of "first step" at all. It has nothing whatever to do with the process of deleting the project, which you still incorrectly seem to think is predicated upon the existence of an encyclopaedia article and vice versa, despite <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a>'s outright example to the contrary. I say again: <i>Wikipedia is not Meta.</i>. Moreover: The "standard of having articles on Wikimedia Foundation projects" should be the standard for having articles on anyone else's MediaWiki projects.

<p>SqueakBox follows me around Wikipedia and vandalizes anything I touch. He tells the lie that I, Rex Judicata, am also Agwiii and has posted this lie in several places. I simply delete the lie. However, the very nature of Wikipedia encourages the behavior of people like SqueakBox. He claims to be a deletionist, but is actually an obsessionist and Cyberstalker.</p>
<p>Law enforcement on the Internet is a challenge for all countries, but we have seen some dramatic events with creators of denial of service, virus, spam, etc. being brought to justice. I am a resident of Florida, and have been an Internet Safety Activist for years.</p>
<p>I have worked to help the passage of Florida 2003 Cyberstalking Law. Those administrators who believe in Wikipedia should question why behavior that is outlawed by Florida (and many other states and countries) would be condoned by Wikipedia. I suggest that this is the case - that Wikipedia allows cyberstalking, harassment and dog posting -- and that it is time for Wikipedia to change.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (I'm the author of the page) Hi all, I'm a newcomer to wikipedia editing, I've read the guide for votes for deletion and I would like to enter into the discussion. <b>Sarg</b> said that the subject of the article is a "protocol implementation that hasn't been released yet". I think it isn't right. CooWS is an implementation of an agent based model. CooWS is an application framework. It doesn't specify any new protocol (even if it uses a lot of common standards among web services world). And it's false that CooWS hasn't been released yet. Even if there isn't any "stable" release, from the project homepage the beta build can be downloaded and tested. The code is 90% mature and the first stable build will be released in the next months. (I'm currently writing the docs and I've thougth that my contribution to wikipedia at this stage would have been less time consuming). Finally, on the last Sarg's comment, yes the application is written by the author's page but the explicit cite on my thesis would have been the start for an "history/origins section". <b>UKPaolo</b> says that the technology is "unnotable". The main subjects of this work are Web Services, agents software and semantic web. I think that, at present, all these technologies are receiving a big attention from the academic and industry world. I think <b>Isaac R</b> makes the same misunderstanding of Sarg. Wikipedia is not IETF, this is right, like CooWS is not a proposal for a new standard.

<li>Hi Luigi, thanks for your detailed comments. Sorry about the confusion about the use of the word "protocol" (never use protocol when it's 2 o'clock on the morning...). However, I stand by my points about notability. It is clear that <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_based_model.html" title="Agent based model">agent based models</a> are notable, as well as many of the technologies mentioned. That's why I haven't nominated <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_based_model.html" title="Agent based model">agent based model</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java programming language</a> for deletion.

It might be in the future, but it is my opinion that this isn't the case now. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 14:28, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed with Sarg, I'm afraid, Luigi, though many thanks for posting your comments. I still consider the page to be self-promotion, however, surely any true encyclopedic article wouldn't include linking to your userpage. That appears to be vanity. As Sarg said, for the time being your project is simply not sufficiently widely used to be considered notable.

<li><b>comment</b>: yes, the article is true (as I said above), and I see that you have wikified it for a npov. I'm still not convinced this person needs a unique article, however, since he is listed on the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff_City_d8ff.html" title="Cardiff City">Cardiff City</a> page. Why does Cameron Jerome require a seperate article, and yet barely any of the other players do? He's no more notable than the others, and the article provides no further info.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the 2008 Democratic National Convention's existence is a sure thing, a little more than three years away,and this article will get more and more definitive as time goes on. Let anyone who is interested start an entry on the Republican or third party conventions. ((User: Zulitz)), 11:42, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> but let redlinks stay. This is my first time voting for deleting a page so here goes. Although there will be a convention, there is no information at this time about the 2008 DNC; it is too early, we don't know the speakers, the venue or city. Although there are rumors and preparations, I believe it is inappropriate to write a page for a nominating convention when we have no nominee or even candidates - no Democratic candidate has officially announced running. In addition, the lack of a 2008 RNC page shows it is too early to write a page for the conventions anyway. Plus, the current page appears to be a copy of (old) speculation from the election page. I recommend this page be restarted from scratch in the future (say, after the 2006 midterms) but I am open to compromise. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue387_7c2a.html" title="User:Blue387">Blue387</a> 05:47, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see some google cached references to Loose Rooster, although it may not be the same thing. If it's a hoax, it's an elaborate one.
