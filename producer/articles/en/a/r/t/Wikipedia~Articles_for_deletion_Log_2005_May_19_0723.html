<li>Either that (the Doc's diagnosis) or (s)he has been doing too much lucid dreaming. From the article: "In other words, a person can become confused."

<li><b>Keep</b>. Once again, this is a case where a little detective work prior to a VFD would have made the VFD unnecessary. Before putting an article up for VFD, you should ALWAYS check "What links here". In this case, several articles on Canadian politics link to the Patrick Flynn article, and some google research indicates that the biography of the Canadian politician Patrick Flynn is indeed <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/bio.asp?lang=E&amp;query=921&amp;s=M" class="external text" title="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/bio.asp?lang=E&amp;query=921&amp;s=M" rel="nofollow">consistent with the info on this page</a>. Matters are a little confused by the fact that Patrick Flynn is a common name. I've therefore turned <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flynn_fa72.html" title="Patrick Flynn">Patrick Flynn</a> into a disambiguation page, and created new pages for <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flynn_%28Olympic_athlete%29_9e2e.html" title="Patrick Flynn (Olympic athlete)">Patrick Flynn (Olympic athlete)</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flynn_%28composer%29_ef75.html" title="Patrick Flynn (composer)">Patrick Flynn (composer)</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Flynn_%28Canadian_politican%29_3c4a.html" title="Patrick Flynn (Canadian politican)">Patrick Flynn (Canadian politican)</a>. However, since I don't want to change the name of a page up for VfD, I can't rename the original page to indicate that it is now a disambiguation page. Perhaps the admin who closes the VfD can do so (assuming the vote ends up being keep.) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobw_974e.html" title="User:Jacobw">Jacobw</a> 11:42, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not entirely needed. A lot of disambig pages are simply "Name" rather than "Name (disambig)". It saves there being a redlink to "Name" which someone inevitably fills with a stub, leading to a duplicate article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a></i></small></font>

<li>I'm tempted to claim that "politican" is an obscure Irish-Canadian spelling, but alas, it was just a rather embarrassing typo on my part. Sorry about that. Thanks for catching it, Grutness.

<li><b>Question</b> -- I'm really not understanding all the keep votes here. Huge malls like the Mall of America or West Edmonton are certainly notable by their size, as are places like Quincy Market in Boston or Providence Place because they provide a shopping hub for their respective cities. But I don't see what's particularly encyclopedic about a minor minimall, especially one in close proximity to a major regional mall. To take another example in Massachusetts, the Wrentham Premium Outlets might be notable for being a fairly huge outlet mall that serves a sizeable portion of southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. But that does not make the Cape Cod Outlet Mall noteable -- it's a much smaller outlet mall about an hour away near the Cape Cod Canal, and fairly well frequented, but it's nothing in comparison. Should both of those malls have their own articles despite the huge difference in size and importance? <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some editors believe that everything should be kept. There are others who believe that many small articles should be deleted. You will get some of both in many of these votes. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:25, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Noone believes that "everything" should be kept. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:05, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also we have a problem with the concept of "have its own article" being a reason for deletion, instead of merging into "Malls in Framingham" for example. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:30, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That seems to make sense. I think a merge with similar articles would be a good idea. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 12:30, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Malls have owners. There are a handful of companies that own the majority of the larger malls. I think that at present, only 1 of the top 5 mall management companies has an article. Building the company article would allow malls to be listed there with some facts. Search would find the malls and if you really found the need, there could be redirects. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:06, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think malls change owners more frequently than they change location. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:08, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A valid point. That would make the issue one of how hard would it be to move the entries to a new owner and leave the question of the need to maintain an ownership history for malls without their own article. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 18:22, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Linuxbeak is making a strong argument here: the purpose is not "to go and play chess with others somewhere"; that, indeed, could be done anywhere and with anyone. The goal is to have fun with your fellow editors—like a LAN party after hours at the office. Except for setting precedent, which is trivially guarded against, and offending those people who don't want to see it on the pure principle of the thing, this is really not harming anyone, and benefitting quite a few. We could conceivably move these things to somewhere else—Wikicities or Meta spring to mind—but too far away from the wiki and it loses its purpose. Strictly speaking, user talk pages shouldn't exist either—anything you cannot say on an article talk page is not directly benefitting articles, after all. But talk pages are very obviously <i>indirectly</i> beneficial. This is just drawing suspicious stares because it's too indirect for some. Yes, the encyclopedia always comes first—but that doesn't mean it's the only thing we can ever focus on. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:56, 2005 May 19 (UTC)</dd>

The right place for this is actually <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">Wikicities</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:27, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: How is it not related to the encyclopedia? You realise that the games played out during the tournament will provide good examples about chess concepts, right? Especially when later tournaments will move on into variants. It has connection to Wikipedia in the idea that also, thus strengthens the community with all the organisation taking place and that moving to WikiCities would defeat the entire purpose. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 03:21, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Using the games as examples of chess concepts in the articles about chess would violate the policy that we keep all meta-activity out of the encyclopedia itself, a rule that is if anything even stricter than any general restrictions on activity unrelated to the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:32, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Compromise:</b> First, we have to distinguish between Wikipedia-related games (which have always been OK) and non-Wikipedia-related ones. A few non-Wikipedia-related games in the Wikipedia: namespace are fine. What could become a problem, I think, is that the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a> is presently an incubator for these things. I suggest getting rid of the game-related subpages. When all games have to be created in the Wikipedia: namespace or User: namespace, the threshold for starting new ones will be increased. The problem is that once a game has a certain number of players, it will be virtually impossible to get rid of it, as all those who play will vote to keep it, and many of those who'd like to try it will do so as well. I hope we are all in agreement that game-related activity on Wikipedia should be limited.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 02:51, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That sounds like a cheap shot to me. Do you want me to calculate the amount of money it costs us to host and serve just these pages? I'm sure the players could pay for it themselves. Shall I also offer a few estimates as to how much it costs us to host all those silly, gimmicky user pages people put up, and the amount of time and storage wasted on talk page messages not immediately related to the encyclopedia? Can we fine people who engage in personal attacks, trollery, petty feuds and edit wars for wasting donated money?

<dd>The "English" Wiktionary's goal is actually to encompass all languages (even fictional ones I'm sure), so this would be a valid entry.

<dd>I did check. I Vfd-ed it because it had been transwikied (just forgot to mention that). As to redirecting to Middle-earth, what's the point. If I came across a redirect like that, I would nominate the redirect for deletion. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue">→Iñgōlemo←</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 05:48, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<dd>I was referring to the voters for "transwiki". But anyway, redirects are cheap, and there's no need to waste effort deleting the unless they are hurtful.

<li>Not at all. 8 tone bleep music is not a composition. There is a difference between a composer and a hack. When composers are sought for games, perhaps, but not when twitch fans simply believe their passtime to be OMG important like, because there is also a difference between the solipcism of adolescents and the criticism of adults. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:36, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe that's why I don't write articles about blip scores, I think they're fancruft. It's a possibility anyway. Otherwise, what you've got is not a "videogame composer," but a composer. Free yourself from the console. If a guy can't stand as a composer, he can't stand as a videogame composer, either. The reason for Ed Kalehoff's inclusion is that film and TV composers are being considered as composers, not as people who satisfy tube addicts. It doesn't matter what I or you think of the quality: are these composers the subject of study? If you have evidence that a SuperMario composer is being studied in Juliard, then bright that forward, please. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:38, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Kalehoff has written enough music for game shows alone to deserve his own entry.

As someone else here said, would you dismiss John Williams because he did a lot of TV work? I think not.

<p>From my post in <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Prior_84f4.html" title="User talk:Ryan Prior">User talk:Ryan Prior</a>:</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>In your opinion what defines "not widely recognized"? <a href="../../../e/d/d/Edd_Kalehoff_6ee7.html" title="Edd Kalehoff">Edd Kalehoff</a> has written some of the most widely recognized music in the United States including the very recognizable and iconic theme to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a> (along with other cues for the show). He has composed music for several television game shows and is well known for that. However, Kalehoff's contributions to music are not limited to television, he is well known within the music industry (especially in New York) as one of the best synth/keyboard players around and has done some innovative things with it, although you would most likely dismiss that since <i>you</i> never heard of him (or at least act as if you do).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now isn't the whole point of an encyclopedia to look information up? If you just <a href="../../../r/t/f/RTFM_dd93.html" title="RTFM">RTFM</a> you would see that the Edd Kalehoff article is just a stub worthy of expansion!</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone put this in for me and I should have wrote that here to start off with. I think the person who proposed the article for deletion may not understand the concept of looking up information. To them I say: I have looked at your track record you seem to advocate deleting a lot of articles that would be better off expanded.

<li>"BMI TV, film, theater and classical composers are equally successful. BMI legends such as Mike Post of "NYPD Blue," fame or Ed Kalehoff, who wrote the opening for "Monday Night Football," Charlie Fox, who penned numerous TV hits, including "Happy Days," and WG Snuffy Walden, whose first big theme was for "ThirtySomething" are a small sample of the composers represented by BMI."</li>
</ul>

Now on a website geared to his peers they call him a legend and mention hime in the same sentence as three major composers, I think it would be bloody foolish not to include hime here. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpotteddogsdotorg_56c5.html" title="User:Spotteddogsdotorg">Spotteddogsdotorg</a> 17:22, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Original research. War propaganda used during the Israeli War of Independence by the Arab States in an attempt to shame Arabs into killing Jews. This has been openly admitted by Arab leaders in the past. Even if that were not so, ### no evidence supports the occurence of such an act.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The massacre most certainly occurred, and there are plenty of evidence in the article, from Arab, Jewish and international sources. <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">User:MSTCrow</a> brings no sources for his denial of the massacre.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 07:01, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Deir Yassin affair is certainly notable. There are these possibilities:-
<ul>
<li>254 people were killed. <i>(original propaganda in 1948)</i></li>
<li>About 100 to 120 people were killed. <i>(later opinion)</i></li>
<li>Nobody was killed (except in battle). <i>(seems to be implied by the sentence marked ### hereinabove)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless we can choose absolutely which is these is true, we better leave the evidence up and let the reader decide.<br />
By "known forgery", do we mean that these quoted reports are not from the papers and publications that they are said to be from? Or what?<br />
I spent some time tidying this article, but I did not alter its meaning or add more matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please can we properly define the difference between "original research" and other ways of getting hold of information?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I share MTG's dislike of list articles, but he's not correct when he claims "WP is not a repository of lists." On the contrary, we have thousands of lists, and they have fanatical supporters. You may succeed in deleting this list, since only its creator seems to care about it.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> and <b>keep</b>. The article credits Stussy had an "Oscar winning documentary". It was "Best short documentary", 1977 with <i>Gravity is my enemy</i>. That I think should raise Mr. Stussy up and beyond the "average college professor" bar for notability. Also, 100*pi google hits is pretty good for a person.

<li>I don't feel this is the right place for this topic, however. The second sentence of VFD states it is to be used for these options to reach a consenus. None of the other tools allows for consenus, they would just be stuck in a category. Also, since there are so many articles this vfd is covering, it's more sensible to propose it on the first one and not all of them, as they would all be deleted if the consensus was to merge or del. &lt;&gt; <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a> 18:52, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Rewrite</b></s>. The most reputable of fansites have long sought to reconcile the chronological problems of the Zelda series using some kind of multiple Links theory. What's more, the existence of multiple Links is not only obvious but verbatim confirmed by Miyamoto and others. However, this article is trying to push one particular theory that doesn't hold too much sway, and is also very poorly written. What we need is a good summary of all of the traditional theories and how the official information fits in.

<li>I've thought about this some more and read some of the latest theories and stuff.

<li>Delete: Independently made record independently distributed. Just a gigging band. Good for them, but an encyclopedia is neither an advertising medium nor a primary research tool. We require validation and substantiation of notability <i>prior</i> to discussion. (In my day, board tapes were not followed by self-produced records. Self-produced records <i>were</i> demos.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't understand the hostility. I was merely putting up an entry for a band in my local scene. I figured if anywhere, an open source encyclopedias users wouldn't put such heavy emphasis on being signed to a label. Geroge, I'm not sure when "your time" was, but most of the influential punk bands in the scene self-produce many of their albums. Notable examples are Minor Threat, Bad Religion, SNFU, The Dead Kennedys, The Vandals, among others. I don't see how this page differs from that of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> or any other "major" band out there, other than possibly a larger interest in their pages. But if traffic is the criteria for a page here, this isn't much of a resource.Equal</li>

<dd>I apologize for myself if I appeared hostile. I agree with you that folks on VfD can be that way. Your impulse to inform was great and not to be discounted. The reason the article fails is simply that, to be encyclopedic content, a topic should be notable and verifiable. When a band is unsigned and unreleased, there is little way for people to independently verify the claims of the article. Since all encyclopedias are <i>secondary sources</i> of information, we shy away from announcements and first-hand accounts wherever possible. Again, I'd like to say that you shouldn't take this hard or take the snippish tone of comments as any reflection on you or your participation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:30, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It doesn't need to expand. If Jerry Pournelle's version of the <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolan_chart.html" title="Nolan chart">Nolan chart</a> were notable, the article would be fine as it is.

<li>I dispute that reasoning. The Pournelle chart is not at all a "minor variation of the Nolan Chart". One axis is a completely original concept; the only similarity is the axis on government authority, which the Nolan Chart splits in two rather than one. That Pournelle is not known for being a political theorist does not affect the merit of the model. That I think his model is absolutely ridiculous is another matter besides. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuan_Ponderas_b110.html" title="User:Juan Ponderas">Juan Ponderas</a></li>
<li>I agree with Juan. This is <b>NOT</b> a "Nolan variant." The only similarity it has to the Nolan Chart is that it is two-dimensional. Any two axes would be two dimensional. It takes more than that to be a Nolan Variant, say by pairing some sort of Civil Liberty axis with some sort of Economics Axis, like Political Compass or Eysenck. This is it's own chart. I just don't yet feel that each individual chart deserves it's own page yet so this should be a <b>Merge and Redirect</b> into <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Spectrum_2d49.html#Pournelle_Chart" title="Political Spectrum">Political Spectrum</a>.

<p>This article asserts that there is a group of Jews positioned somewhere between the Ashkenazim and the Sepharadim, and that its name is the etymology of the name <i>Skolnick</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no town anywhere as far as I can ascertain called "Sheqolenique", nor is there any record that this fantabulous ethnicity ever existed. It is difficult to imagine that nothing has been written about these people in the past 1800 years...and, in fact, no evidence they existed prior to the time of their allegèd departure either. Not only that, but the article makes some pretty wild claims about the supposed purity of this group's traditions...certainly there would be extant commentary (and I have no doubt, a great deal thereof) if such a group actually existed. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 16:22, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't believe there is any such thing. What this page says defines a number of different kinds of feminism, and is not distinctly psychoanalytical. This Googles 215, but these are predominantly either Wikipedia-related or references to psychoanalytical feminism in academic context which don't identify it as a distinct perspective i.e. they just identify academic speech which is both psychoanalytical and feminist.<a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">XmarkX</a> 17:30, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The article that was proposed for deletion by Mgekelly was a substub - I have just expanded it a little so we know what we are talking about. Psychoanalytical feminism is one of the main ideas in feminism, it is often quoted next to marxist feminism, radical feminism, liberal feminism etc., so abolutely <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 18:23, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep: I didn't check history, and the original nomination might have been fine, but there certainly is Feminism based on Psychoanalysis (although, frankly, Lacan is a much more common source than Freud), as the entire <i>ecrit feminine</i> thing was based on psychoanalysis, and that has been (gulp) influential (despite my railing at it). However, it is very, very easy to go very, very wrong in an article like this. NPOV and comprehensiveness are vital. Any stub will be a misrepresentation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:02, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good points George - I was reading it as 'Freudian feminism' which seemed a bit weird, but your mention of Lacan makes me think of <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristeva.html" title="Kristeva">Kristeva</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irigaray.html" title="Irigaray">Irigaray</a>. Still, I don't think that there's a specific form of feminism they represent - <b>move</b> to Psychoanalysis and Feminism perhaps?<a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">XmarkX</a> 19:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Could also be a rather <i>large</i> section in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">Feminism</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_theory.html" title="Feminist theory">Feminist theory</a> and Feminist criticism, with this lemma becoming a redirect. I think the psychoanalytically-derived stuff is fading from the spotlight these days, with more Marxist inspired criticisms ascendant (I hope so, anyway, as I was so sick of the transhistorical subject posited by psycho crit), but a lot of the "body" criticism is, at root, psychoanalytic in inspiration. May change my vote, esp. if there are sections already present in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">Feminism</a> that cover the discussion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:44, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't recommend delete, but merge. In any case, 1) Jesus' teachings have such a profound impact on Western culture that he severly impacts even non-Christians and 2) Nincada has little relevance even within the Pokemon world, unlike the PS3 in the gaming world and British Columbia elections in British Columbia. Maybe you're obssessed with his evolution, but he really isn't much more important than any other Pokemon, and the article really can't expand past stub format without either being trivia or something that belongs on GameFAQs rather than Wikipedia. --Yoshi348 17:03, May 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps I have missed the whole intention of an encyclopedia, but "something somebody heard of somewhere" as an inclusion criterion? That makes it encyclopedic? Personally, I would probably have preferred {{Disputed}} to {{pov}}, as it's not a matter of conflicting sources but no sources given at all. But then again, I have seen {{Disputed}} articles simply sit that way for over a year. VfD at least puts it on a timetable. If it is a critical subject, surely someone will supply something to back it up before the VfD period elapses? --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 21:36, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I completely agree that we don't want "I heard it somewhere" articles. But we also don't want to be too hasty in rejecting an article as "obviously" bogus. Better to give people a chance to give actual sources. ¶ I also agree that {{Disputed}} would have been more appropriate than {{pov}}. But whoever did the POV described the issue correctly, and that's what's important. ¶ A VfD debate may leave enough time for the article to be beefed up -- or maybe not. That's all beside the point. We have too many of VfD debates, they use up too much of everybody's time, and they cause <i>way</i> too many bad feelings. It's better to give people a chance to thrash out this kind of issue offline. That's why we have policies for less drastic action. Obviously those policies shouldn't allow a bad article to hang around for a year (or more than a month), and you'd be perfectly justified in VfDing such an article. But you have to give it longer than 34 minutes!----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 22:01, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep and rename</b> to President of Earth (fiction). I know I am in the minority here, but I am still bothered by the fact that Wikipedia makes no quick and easy way to distiguish actual persons, groups, and events from invented ones. Typically, the fictional or invented nature of the subject is noted somewhere in the body of the article in no standard way. (If it were up to me, I would give all invented subjects a separate namespace.) As far as statements like "The President of Earth is a theoretical future political office", that appears to me to fall squarely under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a> --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 21:15, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a>, I believe that under the rules of <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a>, an article named President of Earth (fiction) is not allowed if an article named <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a> either does not exist, or the latter just redirects to the former. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 21:39, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyone seeing an article titled <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a> isn't going to assume that there really is a President of the whole Earth, because every single person reading the encyclopedia will know otherwise. Besides, it's noted in the very first sentence that it's not real and is common in science fiction works. Most people do not learn about things by only reading the article titles. I do agree that the first sentence should probably be reworded in accordance with the crystal ball policy. -<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoozer_0a6f.html" title="User:Doozer">Doozer</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoozer_95ba.html" title="User talk:Doozer">Talk</a>) 21:45, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I wasn't really expecting support; just wistfully wishing there were a way to clearly, unambiguously mark articles that are on subjects that are invented or fictional. The current <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">everything2</a>-style free-for-all mélange doesn't really work for me--but I'm just one person. Not every title will be as blatantly obvious as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a>, so when (for example) going through search results it would be nice not to have to load each article and scan it for whatever non-standard way its fictional nature is indicated in order to find out if it has something to do with the real world, or is just part of the increasing body of articles about something someone imagined one day. Also, I generally find it is risky to make too many assumptions about what "every single person" knows. People constantly surprise me. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 22:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>On the other hand <i>Star Trek</i> is a TV series from the 1960s so it is something from the past.

We could of course delete the future history parts of the article, and we'd still have the list of science fiction stories which have a character in them whom is the president of earth. That is not future history, but it isn't really encyclopedic either in my opinion.

<li>Delete: Conceivably a lot worse than vanity, with the "German pride" themes.

<p><b>Keep</b> I have to say, "Geogre", I have no idea how you extrapolated this article as having "german pride" sentiments. I would actually like you to explain it, because I find your deduction to be rather offensive and ignorant. As I understand it, Wikipedia is a forum inclusive to regional information just as it would be to pop culture. I would ask you to keep this in mind, that simply because you are unaware of the topic, it doesn't necessarily invalidate its contents or make it some kind of student graffiti. Thanks. --Kdevoss 02:20, 20 May 2005 (UTC)Kdevoss</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> This article has changed my life. When I first stumbled across this article, I too thought this article on one Lukas Peter was silly and vain. I thought Mr. Peter wrote this article about himself to undermine the integrity of thos hollowed online institution. I felt ASHAMED to be a member of the wikipedia community knowing that pranksters like Mr. Peter could deface our database with his self-serving entry. I was livid. I was so angry that I sought out this Mr. Peter... and I found him. I promise you all I met him, and I gave him a piece of my mind. I berated him for hours on end. However, oddly enough he took my lecture in stride. He just stood there so peacefully, and soon enough cracked a smile. He did not try to refute my arguments nor even defend himself as I attacked and entry on his life. As the day grew, I became tired and gave in. It was then that I was transformed. Lukas taught me so much. He taught me how to be gentle in the face of danger... how to be soft spoken yet strong... and how to live a life where a meaning will ever be questioned. Mr. Peter is undoubtedly the greatest man that I have ever met. He is a man of talent, wisdom, and compassion. Please do not erase this article, if not to encourage others to follow his ways, but for my own sake... this article personally means too much for me to watch it be so violently taken away from me. Thank you all and thank you Mr. Peter. ---Elnemuigato 21:15, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> I strongly disagree with the claim that this article is that of a non-notable, as I have personally seen this person on the evening news in Seattle as the lead story, a news broadcast that went out to an excess of 3 million people. This article helps to highlight individuals who are of regional significance, and should not be judged by those who are unfamiliar with the area and its culture. By promoting the existence of articles such as this Wikipedia shall come closer to fulfulling the mission of documenting all knowledge, regardless of whether it will ever effect the lives of all people. ---<a href="../../../m/o/j/User%7EMojoismog_7521.html" title="User:Mojoismog">Mojoismog</a> 2:23, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Mr. Bound's last remark, entered at 21:16, May 20, 2005 was maliciously written with the express intent to harm. I contend that his remark was a personal attack. Thus according to Wikipedia policy, which states most plainly "Personal attacks are not allowed on Wikipedia.", I demand his last remark be disregarded from discussion, and I intend to file a complaint with Wikipedia citing this gross violation of the rules. Thank you --Elnemuigato 21:36, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would appreciate it if my remarks were not misconstrued. Nowhere have I said that anyone in this discussion is a puppet of anyone else. I have not "attacked" validity, only questioned it with what I feel is not an unreasonable suspicion. Indeed, I have no proof, that is precisely why I requested that someone step in and shed some light on the situation.

<p><b>Keep</b> I can entirely understand why there is much skepticism to the legitimacy of this article, but this biographical profile is entirely consistent with the spirit and purpose of wikipedia. To the residents of Shoreline, Washington Lukas Peter is an iconic, culturally important figure of our town and region. His adventures are closely watched, and often receive coverage from the local media. The man is one of those individuals who can inspire a sense of community, a feeling of regional pride and self-worth in just about everyone he comes across. In the Seattle area, Lukas Peter has a pseudo-celebrity status that makes him notable, significant and an enormous personality inseparable from Western Washington's cultural identity. --Kathman 03:35, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

The reason I took it through vfd is that the author obviously disagreed that it should be deleted, and the vfd process is a way to legitimise the deletion to him. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 21:17, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a page to promote a website at <a href="http://www.realrapfans.tk/" class="external free" title="http://www.realrapfans.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realrapfans.tk/</a>. A link was also edited into the "hip hop music" article. Whether or not the author is part of the staff or just a fan, the website is very juvenile (in its introductory paragraph it calls some random guy who I guess disagrees with the site a "faggot"), amateurish and has only had a couple thousand hits in its history. Even ignoring the fact the article seems to have been created for promotional purposes, the site is nowhere near deserving of an article. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieli_47f3.html" title="User:Jamieli">User:Jamieli</a></p>

<p>Hi, it's me TheBuyer. Are you seriously deleting this entry because you never heard of Acmeshorts and no one else really has either? That's shortsighted and suggests you've misread our intentions. No one credible on the site wants the lowest common denominator to show up, we don't even have any advertisers, pop-ups, mailing lists, promotions, nothing. The only thing site traffic would do for Acme is slow the site down and we hate that. The fact is, Acmeshorts does exist and deserves a definition. Cheers! TheBuyer</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not an ad agency... there are other channels to go through that don't make you look like the same scum that spams people's inboxes with Viagra. --Yoshi348 17:08, May 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, TheBuyer again. This is what I'm saying, you're misreading our intentions. Where in this entry do you see any kind of solicitation or promotion, it's all just facts about how/why it exists that's all. You're assuming Acmeshorts wants you there. Why would you assume that?</p>
<ul>
<li>We're not deleting it based on us not having heard of it, but instead based on its demonstrated obscurity (very low Alexa ranking, few google hits). Please, don't take it the wrong way--it's simply that this website isn't notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. Please keep contributing on more noteworthy topics. Thanks, <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 17:50, May 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Will Disney here. We get 10,000 hits a day on AcmeShorts. WikiPedia certainly has space to store a serious entry about a web site dedicated to writing. This Wikipedia entry provides us with no "advertising" value, and we don't care about advertising as AcmeShorts is a money-losing site with no profit method. Why should something obscure not be in an encyclopedia, if the entry is real and contains facts and information that contribute to the greater common knowledge pool? Maybe one of our many daily visitors would like some information about AcmeShorts, and will look it up in Wikipedia. Isn't that the point?</li>
<li>Disney again: Are you saying you don't allow obscure things in the encyclopedia? Normal encyclopedias have very, very obscure things in them. Things that probably no one ever looks at. Certainly there must be pages in the Wikipedia that people look at less than the AcmeShorts entry. It's not like the Wikipedia has a page space limit. I mean, sure, AcmeShorts is obscure, but it has been visited almost 2 million times now.</li>

<li>What does that mean - not notable? We think it's notable? How does it harm Wikipedia if we setup a genuine entry with real information about a real writing site that has existed for several years? Isn't that the idea?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
TheBuyer again. Hi! from one of your pages and pages of rules...</p>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above (of course, this may be controversial, and can be discussed on the article's talk page, using this policy as a guideline), it should not be deleted on the basis of it being:</p>
<pre>
  1. insufficiently important, famous or relevant, or
  2. currently small or a stub.
</pre>
<p>What part of this am I failing to understand?</p>
<p><br />
Mr. Pony here. I'm with Megan1967. I think the so-called "Google Test" is inherently flawed. Seriously, though, as far as our insignificance goes, we're all trying to not take that the wrong way, but I think we need a little clarification. Could one of you give us an example of what you think is the <i>least</i> significant site that is <i>just significant enough</i> to merit an inclusion in Wikipedia? Thanks!!</p>
<p><br />
Also, where is the discussion, all I see are user names weighing in with Votes but very little actual discourse. -TheBuyer</p>

<li>Personal attacks? What are you, a fucking moron? You seem to be no more capable of recognizing a personal attack than you are at writing an encyclopedia article! Maybe you should go back to grammar school -- I hear it's a good place to learn such things. Or maybe you never went there in the first place: it would explain a lot about you. I see from your userpage that someone's accused you of taking dumps in the yard. You deny it, of course, but we all know the truth. Grammar school could help you with that little problem, too. And while we're on the subject of you, what sort of a name is "Mr. Pony"? Is it maybe a reference to your lack of stature? Or maybe your size "down there"? Or are you just one of those "cutesey" guys who likes such things? Maybe you should try "Mr. Jackass".

<li><b>Comment:</b> Well, Carnildo, I guess I'd like to thank you for showing me what a real personal attack is all about. I must say, I really am surprised that you were able to discern from my few brief posts that I am indeed of mixed ancestry (my father is a Third Generation Japanese American, and my Mother a European American; her father from Italy, her mother an Irishwoman from Canada). What really surprises me, however, is how gleefully you compare me to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule" rel="nofollow">mule</a>. I thought that kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" rel="nofollow">racism</a> was a thing of the past; although I admit that in my travels throughout the world, I have tended to keep to large cities, where "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-breed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-breed" rel="nofollow">half-breeds</a>" such as myself are more tolerated. Your other attacks about me not going to grammar school, or about me being short or having a small penis, I can sort of write off as being playful (your way of saying "hello", maybe?) but your exuberant racism is another story. I can only assume that you are alone in your racism, and that your racist ways do not reflect in any way on the Wikipedia community. I hope I am right in thinking this. -- <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Pony_fb44.html" title="User:Mr. Pony">Mr. Pony</a></li>

Im begging you to take our site seriously, because we enjoy writing stories and we think we have a shot at becoming succesful like other major web players such as Slate, Yahoo or even amazon.com! (Wouldn't it be embarrassing for your corporation if we became big and you had erased our definition?!) OK so some of our stories may not be Puzinger Prize winners but that doesn't mean they're not worth reading or don't contain literatury merit. Plus, If you let us stay on your site i would be willing to contribute some entries on the Wikipedia. I don't have a particular field of expertise "per se" but I could maybe research some topics for you such as computers or others you assigned. If you are interested please tell me who I should send my resume to, for I would love the opportunity to further discuss whether I could work for your organization. I would love to be part of such a "think tank" as Wikipedia. Even if you don't want me to work there maybe you could at least forward my resume to other similar websites, like the Encyclopedia Britanica. I do not wish to work for sites dealing with sexual content, however. I have to go meet some friends now, but thanks for your time. I will check for your response tomorrow around 3:30pm.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notable generally refers to any subject that has had a relatively impressive impact on society in general. Thus, Amazon.com, Homer Simpson and breadbox all get articles. A writing site, however good, far out of the mainstream and with no demonstratable impact on society is inherently not notable. If you can prove notability (eg impact on society) I'd love to be proven wrong. Incidentally, if it's as notable flash fiction as the flash fiction at the bottom of that article, why don't you just put it there as a link, rather than as a seperate entry? -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Incidentally, while going through the pages of rules, did you notice the ones about POV? Even if the article were kept it would be kept in a NPOV format. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a></li>

<li>Disney: Is that tone necessary? I'm really surprised by the tenor of the comments above. Believe it or not, we thought we were supporting the wikipedia by creating an entry there.
<ul>
<li>Mr. Pony: I agree. I mean, I know it's a lot to expect to be taken seriously, but the editors' comments (with a few notable exceptions) have been gleefully dismissive, school-yard elitist, and even racist. I realize that an open encyclopedia must have some standards, but the content and tone of these comments has to make one wonder about the people setting these standards, and by extension, the standards themselves.</li>

<p>Corvon Gundtsdottir here again. Sorry it took me so long to get back! Meeting my friends and hanging out with them turned out to take a lot longer than I expected, that's why I didn't have the chance to touch base again with you Wikipedia guys until now. One thing I forgot to mention in my last posting is that I am totally interested in karate. I haven't actually taken classes but I've always wanted to, plus I've seen probably a hundred movies (including Hong Kong Hustle which is one of the most intense films I've seen, like, ever). My friends are always amazed at how much I know about karate. What I'm driving at is, I would be totally up for writing an article on karate for the Wikipedia. I don't know a lot about the history but I could do the section about karate movies, and/or put together some diagrams showing the different kinds of moves they do. I don't draw, but I could describe the moves and techniques to your illustrator so there could be a cool visual next to the article. I haven't looked at your current entry but I'll bet I know more different kinds of kickass moves than what's up there now. I have to go to the store in a minute but I'll check back in tomorrow about 2:30pm. Let me know if you're interested in having me write about karate. I could do other topics as well but I'd be totally psyched to do the one on karate.</p>

I have also bought his latest album 'On the road to nowhere'. It's a top cd! Please support the Derro Drummer and donate generously. Help keep him on our streets.
