<li><s>The article has changed substantially since I wrote this (I note it includes a brief description I wrote here but never intended to be in the article itself), but as said below it is now veering strongly in the direction of original research. It also has something of a POV problem, not in that it takes a somewhat cynical view of political discourse. I wonder if a home can be found for a slightly refactored version, for example in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a> or some similar article? But I'm afraid I can't justify withdrawing the VFD. A political phrase is only worthy of a separate article if it has a particular resonance and identity with a policy (eg '<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>'), and this phrase is precisely aimed at not doing that. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 21:28, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s> See below. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 23:40, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an important codeword in current right wing politics (See Dbiv's comment below). This is the british equivalent of "Hardworking Americans" who deserve a tax cut.

<ul>
<li>Well, not in principle, no. But in the UK election it's being used as a code: the parties all want to lower taxes and provide services for "hardworking families", by which they mean to include everyone who might vote for them but exclude feckless benefit recipients (right-wing use) or those who have unearned income (left-wing use). Which is what I suspect <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> was trying to say, but I think it has extremely limited value as a separate page. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 21:53, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really appreciate the job <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> done with the new version of the article. But what he did is a brilliant example of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, to supporthis point of view that the expression in question is interpreted differently by different societies/parties/whatever. What is still lacking is <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>, i.e., respectful researchers (no disrespect to Kaishu) who described of this phenomenon in authoritative sources. Also, so far the article is a mostly about the <b>usage</b> of the term, i.e., more in the dicdef section. Clearly, its actual meaning "families that work hard" depends on what different people mean when they say "work hard". A buglar works hard. Sometimes.</li>

<dd>So, who else besides kaishu and other wikipedians noticed and described the notoriety of the term? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:18, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree the article is useful. But the notability of a thing must be established <b>prior</b> to the publication in wikipedia, rather than <b>in</b> wikipedia. Also, when publishing elsewhere, please keep in mind that not all people have the same understanding which sources are <b>authoritative</b> to be counted here (just like with "workharding families"&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 16:10, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I looked to see what rhetorical device this would be classified as, and found that we didn't cover this in anything listed under <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>. However, <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> does not link to the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a>, which in turn fails to link to <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>. And with that knowledge to hand, both problems here are solved. This phrase is <i>an example of</i> a <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>, so we know how to treat it, and <a href="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.wg.gg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.wg.gg.html" rel="nofollow">the IPA's article on Glittering Generalities</a> is one good secondary source dealing with this phenomenon, ameliorating the secondary source issue to an extent. So I suggest a <b>merge</b>r of some kind, with some refactoring, to <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>. Note that this phrase is <i>not</i> an example of a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_word_%28figure_of_speech%29.html" title="Code word (figure of speech)">code word (figure of speech)</a>, because it doesn't meet the definition of "code word" given.

<li>Yes, it is a <b>"concept"</b>, i.e., an abstract notion, and we are speaking about a particular article that describes this concept.

<li>Sam, thank you. I know how to use internet. The reference you gave is a <b>usage</b> of the term, not its scientific/encyclopedic discussion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:16, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. That's simply yet one more use of the glittering generality. Nothing in that series of television programmes purports to describe the concept of "hardworking families". Instead they describe <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_care.html" title="Foster care">foster care</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adoption</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_support.html" title="Child support">child support</a>, and the like, and <i>use</i> the glittering generality to attempt to gain widespread appeal and to imply that this is positive action for the benefit of those who inarguably deserve it. This is why a redirect from the phrase to an article <i>about such phrases in political discourse of which this is but one example</i> is I think the best approach. It solves the problem of people in <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a>'s shoes. Such people come to the encyclopaedia not knowing what a "hardworking family" is, and the encyclopaedia tells them that there <i>is no</i> definite meaning to the term, but instead shows them that politics has a long history of such deliberately vague terms (or, at least, a history that goes back at least as far as the 1940s, when the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a> analysed these things) to which politicians expect the audience to ascribe their own meanings. They may not have been instructed in the way that they expected to be, but they've been instructed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:25, 2005 Apr 15 (UTC)

<li>G, this is yet another, example of brilliant, but <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> (and please don't poke me with this kaishu's indymedia contribution: there is no peer review at this site. Otherwise everyone could have been publish any bull in wikipedia by submitting at indymedia or elsewhere first). I still don't have the question answered: <i>who and where (besides kaishu) <b>critically discussed</b> this term</i>? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 17:03, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem here is secondary sources. But it's a limited problem. We don't have a problem with the concept of <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generalities</a>; we have the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a> as at least one source for that. We don't have a problem with all of the quotations mentioning "hardworking families"; we (presuming the external hyperlinks to be correct) have full references for those. The core of the problem, the only part that remains, is whether anyone has considered the phrase "hardworking families" in terms of its propaganda value apart from us:
<ul>
<li>We certainly have plenty of evidence for its use, particularly in political strategy documents where politicians <i>prescribe the propaganda</i> that their party members should use.</li>
<li>We have uses of "hardworking", by itself, by people whose <i>job</i> was explicitly Minister of <i>Propaganda</i>.</li>
<li>We have sites such as <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4433.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4433.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that analyse statements containing such phrases <i>as propaganda</i>.</li>
<li>We also have sites such as <a href="http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/englishRADIO/political/US%20media2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/englishRADIO/political/US%20media2.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that analyse Nazi propaganda and that use the word "hardworking" as an example ("Using the Preemptive Strike doctrine, the Nazi propaganda machine actually managed to convince ordinary Germans that the National Socialist government was invading other countries and laying waste to their cities in defense of Nazi Germany. It all read like a quaint little story: <i>the racially inferior, parasitic, uncivilized, disheveled, excitable brute was out to kill pure, God fearing, <b>hardworking</b> Germans.</i>")</li>
<li>And finally (I've just turned this up.), we have <a href="http://www.midtermpapers.com/16240.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.midtermpapers.com/16240.htm" rel="nofollow">"Summary of Politics: The Art of Bamboozling"</a> which says "Another red herring is argumentum ad populum, also know as stroking. This is when a politician will compliment the people, such as <b>"hardworking ...</b>". (This mid-term paper is flawed. I suspect deliberately so, as a copyright trap. The spelling errors are probably deliberate, and the mis-labelling of this as <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">Argumentum ad populum</a> is probably deliberate also. But that's beside the point here, which is that someone <i>has</i> addressed this word as a propaganda word.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Without the last, I would have said that it was borderline and circumstantial. With the last, we have confirmation that "hardworking" has been discussed as a propaganda word by others, albeit that "hardworking families", specifically, may not have been. (It's a pity that "pay money to see the rest" cuts in at exactly the point that it does. ☺) So the question is: Is the adjective enough? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:30, 2005 Apr 16 (UTC)</li>
