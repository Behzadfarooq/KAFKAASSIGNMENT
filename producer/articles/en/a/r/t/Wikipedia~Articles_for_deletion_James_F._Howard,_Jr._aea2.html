Given standard academic usage, the listing as "Distinguished Professor" is a claim of notability/recognition (as the self-professed Yale graduate above ought to know). Subject of article shows a significant record of professional activity, involvement in medical advocacy/research groups, etc, and if he wrote the article himself (as seems likely) he's as guilty of modesty as of vanity.

All academics are judged on what they <i>publish</i>, not by the positions they hold or the number of "distinguished professor" awards that they receive. Twice you've said "he's as guilty of modesty as he is of vanity", have you ever heard of him? Do you know who he is, and more importantly, what are these qualities which he was too modest to include?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Distinguished professorship is generally given by the faculty member's University. For example, this gentleman's institution, UNC gives out <a href="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct03/distprof101503.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct03/distprof101503.html" rel="nofollow">a lot</a>. It is not a reflection or judgment by a jury of peers in his field; the criterion for "distinguished" status in that sense of the word is publication and acceptance of theories/practices/ideas by that person. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 00:15, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's safe to assume that endowed professorships are named for the person who made the endowment, as per the first link I provided in this thread, and not for the person who holds them. If it was his father, then it is named after his father. Then again, if it was he who donated the money to the school, then it would simply be dumping cash to move up in the department.

<li>Thank you for the third party reference. But, context: <i>Dr. Howard has been giving exceptional care to a family member for the past several years. The family has agreed to express their gratitude through the creation of an endowed professorship named after Dr. Howard.</i> At the least, it sounds like more of a "pat on the back" from someone who can afford it (possibly a higher-up of the Broyhill furniture company, which is based in North Carolina?) than a academically-deserved-only title as asserted by <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a>. Again, I'm not "hating on" the gentleman, who clearly does good work in his field... but I am somewhat puzzled and not convinced as to why he deserves an article more so than any other professor, because of his ability to make tenure and achieve endowed status. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 01:33, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I said it was a sufficient claim/assertion of notability to meet the Wikipedia threshold in that regard, not that it proved notability. The original nomination for deletion indicated no claim/assertion of notability. And I would think it should be apparent that an academic who achieves tenure and an endowed chair is, by objective standards, more notable than any of the minor celebrities (pornographic video performers, unsigned draft choices by professional sports leagues, Pokemon characters, etc) who are by consensus deemed notable. And I'm puzzled by the argument, often seen here, that an individual is no more notable than anyone else having the same credentials, bypassing the question of whether simply having the credentials is itself notable. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:17, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Full professorship via tenure track makes Dr Howard far more notable than the average professor, most of whom don't make it that far. PubMed search on "Howard JF" reveals 58 articles, all of which are in this Dr Howard's area of expertise (electrophysiology and neuroimmunology); I'm sure it's the same guy.

<dd>Actually, it appears that of those 58 articles, 6 or so are by an Australian dentist, not the neurologist in question. Doesn't alter the gist of the argument. Ikkyu2 23:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ovid search found 45 papers in 27 years, some are review articles.

<dd>Could you perhaps expand the article then? Give an overview of his research, is it important in the field and if so, why?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Kinu argues that the title of <i>Distinguished Professor</i> isn't good to go by. 45 papers in 27 years isn't so much, especially for a clinician, who can gather large amounts of data from the patient that he treats. Besides, the journals that he publishes in (Neurology, J. Neuroimmunology, Ann. NY Acad. Sci) are on the weak side. Aand let's look at it like this: if he was known for any advance in the field this fact would occur to anyone in that field and it would say so in the article. Instead, the article is a collection of biographical trivia, nothing beyond a CV. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On what do you base your assertion that Neurology (Lippincott-Williams-Wilkins, informally the "Green Journal") is a journal that is "on the weak side?" On the contrary, it is to the speciality of neurology what the New England Journal is to that of medicine. ANAS is not a "weak" journal, either. Ikkyu2 06:56, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd call <i>Neuron</i> a strong journal. <i>Brain</i> is also good, then there is <i>J. Phys.</i>. Papers in <i>Science</i>, <i>Nature</i> and <i>PNAS</i> (watch which track!) would also boost the case for notability. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those journals are indeed strong journals. However, none of them even will even consider a paper that has to do with clinical neurology. With the occasional and eccentric exception of "Brain," they publish basic neuroscience. Dr Howard is a physician and publishes in medical research journals. Is your "delete" vote predicated on the fact that you consider clinical neurology research to be somehow less notable than basic neuroscience research? That would be odd. Ikkyu2 12:05, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - "Distinguished" professorship, without mentioning what criteria for selection and/or particular accomplishments that lead to the honor, is concerning. It leaves the reader wondering why the subject is notable? If someone familiar with the honor/professor/field could provide this information (with sources), it would helpful. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 05:28, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Del</b>, tentatively. (And A7 probably mistaken, for the record.) Nearly all med school profs are important, but not a lot are notable. I'm being treated by two of them this week, whom i respect and value, but i'm not putting either up for a WP bio.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>: The title "distinguished professor" per this individual was <i>not</i> given by the University of North Carolina for this individual's excellence in his field; as mentioned several times above, it was an <i>endowment</i> in which the recipient was specifically named. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 08:36, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you asserting that the title of Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina can be bought? You're going to need to prove that, because it's a pretty wild assertion. There's no way UNC would have conferred this title on Dr. Howard without the consensus of their Academic Senate, no matter how much endowment was offered. Also, if you read his articles, he's pretty clearly a leader in the field of single-fiber EMG for myasthenia diagnosis; he pioneered major refinements in the technique. You should consider confining your commentary to things you understand a little better. Also, I request that you either stop this smear job immediately or start providing references for your incredible assertions. Ikkyu2 11:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The University, as you stated, evaluated Dr. Howard's contributions and found him meriting the "Distinguished" honor. Including specifics of the accomplishments and contributions of the Professor should eliminate this brouhaha. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 13:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I made no such smear; I was basing this on evidence found. I noted that University <i>does</i> give out distinguished professorships based on merit, as per <a href="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct03/distprof101503.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct03/distprof101503.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. These are ones that go through the "standard" channels for endowed professorships as established at other universities: the benefactor makes an endowment to the university, and the university determines who shall receive them. I then compared that to this specific situation, and noted that, based on a <a href="http://www.myasthenia.org/news/MGFA_News04_03Fall_correction.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.myasthenia.org/news/MGFA_News04_03Fall_correction.pdf" rel="nofollow">source provided by Quarl</a>, that this particular endowment was given to establish this professorship, per the stipulation that it be named for and be held by this individual, per his service to one particular family member of the endower, and not his accomplishments in the broader sense of the word to his field, his patients as a whole, or his university. Last time I checked, those are verifiable facts, per what little information is avaiable, and I have repeatedly stated that no such smear was made. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 15:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Paris Hilton is notable because people write about her. That's fine. Now James Howard here, we are still trying to establish if someone has written about him. The question is: does an endowment given for service to a particular person establish notability already? If that is not sufficient, are there any other achievements hat might establish it? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
