<p>Keep!! You can't delete it! He is a very important web-animator. And is made possibly even more important by being an alter-ego of Dave Firthwho is an inredibly important Web-animator. He is important for many people and just because he isn't important to you doesn't mean you should delete the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Boydie86 (<a href="../../../b/o/y/User_talk%7EBoydie86_2d6a.html" title="User talk:Boydie86">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Boydie86_6ac6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Boydie86">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I Agree, you obviously dont like it.. so what. He is extremely important, probably better than david firth. If people search for him why should there be no related article? Doesnt make sense, rather improve current page. I will create this again if you delete it!

<p>I advise that the Jerry Jackson entry should not be deleted. It is by far one of the most original web creations by an artist anywhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.153.27.0 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.153.27.0_530e.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.153.27.0">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Firth_155c.html" title="David Firth">David Firth</a> if you must remove it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't see why this would be deleted and it has been already stated, we do not know if Jackson is Firth. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.135.20.33 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.135.20.33_d91f.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.135.20.33">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP!</b> I would like to see Wikipedia continue to be the best and first source for information on the Internet. So stop trying to bloody delete it!!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Honestly, it would be ridiculous to simply get rid of the page. It provides users with information on the animator, and if people even a single person has come here looking for information on him, then why would there be a need to get rid of the page? One should not delete the article simply because they find it unimportant, because that could be said about numerous articles on Wikipedia; it should be kept for those who visit the site, and actually want to read more about the animator. Having obscure articles like this is what makes Wikipedia so great! You can find information about new things all the time, and those who have knowledge on the topic can make contributions to the site by fixing/adding/removing information. Please don't limit the site, simply because this is unimportant in your own eyes - after all, I searched it, didn't I? Lastly, just for the record, Jerry Jackson is quite notable, and many people on Newgrounds know who he is. Whether or not they all like him doesn't matter, the fact is that it is not as if he is completely unknown. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandwiches99_3cbd.html" title="User:Sandwiches99">Sandwiches99</a> 23:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Would you delete Ricky Gervais because you have a section titled The Office? Would you delete a secrtion on Mickey Mouse because you already have one on Pluto? Or Walt Disney. (A lengthier comment has been added to the even more ridiclous suggestion to delete David Firth)... - I dont know how to sign it in the Wikipedia way but I am Bob Slayer!</p>
<p>Jerry Jackson can not be deleted he must get a lot more visits than over pages on this website it is interesting because Jerry Jackson is orginal.If you delete Jerry Jackson because you have no prove he is real then you should delete all the stuff on the bible because have you got any proof that is real.</p>
