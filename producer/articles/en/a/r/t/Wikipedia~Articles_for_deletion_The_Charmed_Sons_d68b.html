<li><b>Delete</b> Save Everwood is also a fan campaign and they are also that "successful" or even more so, and it still does not have its own wiki article. I think having and wanting to keep this article (and to be honest, the whole campaign) is just being a busybody instead of doing something important or useful.

Because we are not talking about an article about a TV show; we're talking about a website that does exist. And does it matter who started it? if someone would point out specifically what codes of Wikipedia this article has broken, we can debate the most relevant topics. Adamdobey has expressed strongly that he does not support this website; yet he has given no specifics besides his own opinion.

<dd>The problem with that statement is that just because it is a new type of movement, does not make it notable. There are a multitude of "new movements" that begin and end all the time, yet they are not recorded on the site. Even if it becomes successful, it is uncertain whether it should still be included in the 'pedia. Even the famed campaign to bring back the original Star Trek series for a third season doesn't have it's own article; rather, it is included as a few mentions here and there on the main TOS articles. I don't see why this campaign should be any different. If and when the series comes about, then the information can be included as a footnote. -- <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntster_d403.html" title="User:Huntster"><span style="font-size:13px; font-variant:small-caps; text-decoration:none;"><b>Huntster</b></span></a> <sup style="font-size:10px;"><a href="../../../h/u/n/User_talk%7EHuntster_309e.html" title="User talk:Huntster"><b>T</b></a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Huntster_f26f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Huntster"><b>@</b></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Huntster_713b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Huntster"><b>C</b></a></sup> 09:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That really isn't a reasonable statement. To keep with the Star Trek theme I have going, historically, those TOS fans are fairly rabid about their favourite show. I fully expected to find an article that had been written about the campaign, and was surprised to not find one. In this instance, one of two things happened: either those fans realised it didn't necessitate a separate article, or the article was created but later put through the ringer as this campaign is now. Which one, I can't say. -- <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntster_d403.html" title="User:Huntster"><span style="font-size:13px; font-variant:small-caps; text-decoration:none;"><b>Huntster</b></span></a> <sup style="font-size:10px;"><a href="../../../h/u/n/User_talk%7EHuntster_309e.html" title="User talk:Huntster"><b>T</b></a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Huntster_f26f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Huntster"><b>@</b></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Huntster_713b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Huntster"><b>C</b></a></sup> 14:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Compromise proposal</b>&#160;: I'm quite sure I have seen this article a month before, it got deleted then. So before this devolves into yet <i>another</i> create-delete-create-delete bulls*** escapade, I propose to Delete this article, BUT: take the text presented here, shorten it to the more important parts(meaning: this is a fan campaign, there is a website, what efforts have been made up to now), and add it at the bottom of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmed.html" title="Charmed">Charmed</a> main article under "Fan spin-off campaign".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Advantages</b>:
<ul>
<li>The article, which might be not notably enough is gone.</li>
<li>The history of this campaign will be recorded and updated (since the Charmed main article is likely more frequented).</li>
<li>It's more topic oriented. The average Charmed fan will probably not have heard of The Charmed Sons, but if he/she has interest in a possible spin-off, he'll find the information where he/she will certainly look at (the Charmed main article).</li>
<li>If the campaign turns out to be nothing more of a dream, one simple edit, and it's gone.</li>
<li>If the campaign turns out to be more, and/or attracts more interest, then it warrants to be expanded into a whole article. <a href="../../../t/e/s/User%7ETeshik_178a.html" title="User:Teshik">Teshik</a> 10:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is about a campaign to get a new television show created. The website and message board are just tools to that end. Adam Dobay's own argument of why it should be deleted states that this is a "Fan Movement". There is nothing in the guidelines of Wikipedia that states that a fan movement cannot be listed as an article. Therefore, all the points about why this should be deleted do not hold water. This entry has a right to be listed, moreso than the seventy different entries I've seen on Wikipedia discussing different aspects of Charmed. The campaign is notable and does exist, and the article talks about that. Fan campaigns have been notable stories, starting back with the Save Designing Women campaign in the 1980s, and recently the Save Angel, Save Veronica Mars and Save Everwood campaigns. This campaign is especially notable because it's for a tv show that does not exist yet, but fans are campaigning for it. It just seems some people are jealous because they cannot do what others are and are trying to discredit this campaign. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anonymous2004 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymous2004_b596.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymous2004">contribs</a>) 19:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Exactly. You can't have rules and regulations against something that is in it's own category. I have yet to even hear of another campaign, or even whispers of idea's of campaigns to get an entirely new TV show on the air. How can you apply rule for things that have been done before to something that, in it's right, is brand new? It hasn't been done before, there isn't any equal and fair etiquette to compare it too.

I don't know how they track members, but if I have two more e-mail addresses; <b>think If i make two more names, they'd be able to track it?</b> Or maybe Mom would let me use her conputer...whole dofferent IP...*wheels turning*</i></dd>
<dd>*She and the there-admin Brianna personally attacked wiki-user Zythe and wiki-user AdamDobay on this message board, confirming my thought that this whole issue is more like a personal issue for them and therefore they cannot think rationally and objectively.</dd>
<dd>*The admins are on this site and are contributing to the thread and they support this behaviour.</dd>
<dd>I think after the cheating the question whether to delete this article or not is no longer a question. Ever heard about fairplay?! And just because now I'm prepared for everything, here are the screencaps of their comments in case they delete the thread and pretend that it never existed. <a href="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/8306/charmedsons1cv3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/8306/charmedsons1cv3.jpg" rel="nofollow">Confession of cheating</a>, <a href="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/9872/charmedsons2fz3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/9872/charmedsons2fz3.jpg" rel="nofollow">Bashing1</a>, <a href="http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/4201/charmedsons3fm1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/4201/charmedsons3fm1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Bashing2</a>, <a href="http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/1676/charmedsons4fp7.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img108.imageshack.us/img108/1676/charmedsons4fp7.jpg" rel="nofollow">Bashing3</a>.

<dd>Because deleting reasons such as "get a life" as SO much more legita,ate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.66.105.253 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.66.105.253_18ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.66.105.253">contribs</a>) 07:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<ul>
<li>While I have encouraged members of The Charmed Sons campaign to vote, I have not encouraged anyone to vote multiple times. I am also not responsible for the actions of others that I did not encourage.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, any comments made on another message board about AdamDobay or Zythe should have no bearing on whether this entry remains or goes. It is obvious it is a personal one for them, as many supporters of the campaign do not believe the character of Piper had a third child and that seems to be a sore spot for AdamDobay. As far as Zythe goes, he was banned from the Charmed Sons message board awhile back for trolling as well as banned twice under two different usernames from TWOP by the moderator on the Charmed board there for purposely antagonizing other posters. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anonymous2004 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymous2004_b596.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymous2004">contribs</a>) 08:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Liz85, thank you for drawing our attention to this. I just told Shondrea to withdraw her anonymous vote, and told everyone else multiple voting is forbidden. We want to keep this article, but we want to do it the fair way.</dd>
<dd>As for the matter of Zythe versus Brittania and Shondrea, I don't know who kicked whose puppy in that one, but more importantly, I don't care. Leave the "I don't like you comments" to yourself, This was about whether the article merits Wikipedia status or not, not if you like each other or not. I hope we ALL can now return to an objective debate about this one. <a href="../../../t/e/s/User%7ETeshik_178a.html" title="User:Teshik">Teshik</a> 13:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - the Internet Fandom Community is a powerful one, and this is the first movement of its kind. As such, it should be allowed to remain. Besides - is it hurting anyone? There is no attempt to claim copyright, nor is there any attempt to make money from the original copyright. I don't see how this is a violation of rules, as this is the first article of its kind. I say keep it - regardless of what some immature fans may or may not have said on another website. The decision should be made purely on whether the article is appropriate for Wikipedia - and not about whether someones feelings got hurt from a personal attack. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.70.235.213 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.70.235.213_72a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.70.235.213">contribs</a>).</small> <small>User's second edit.</small></li>

<dd>Dear whoever. I never trolled on the Charmed Sons. I think I may have expressed that I felt it was an attempt that couldn't go anywhere, but I contributed to discussion and actually I wasn't aware I had been "banned", since I stopped frequenting both TCS and TWoP. ~<b><a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZythe_56f0.html" title="User:Zythe"><font color="purple">Zythe</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../z/y/t/User_talk%7EZythe_7eb0.html" title="User talk:Zythe">Talk to me!</a></sup> 18:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
