<p>The Caust Monkey (Caustus Callithrix) is a small member of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmoset.html" title="Marmoset">marmoset</a> family, about 10cm in length, recently discovered in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.html" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> Basin, by Australian explorer <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Denton_ea84.html" title="Derek Denton">Derek Denton</a>. The species of monkey occurs in several colour forms but generally has auburn hair and a large white mane in males. This is used as a mating device, whereby the males with the largest manes attract the most females. They are unique among marmosets in that they are primarily ground monkeys, opportunistic feeders at this level, although they may venture into the canopy of the rainforest in search of foods such as mangoes and other favoured fruits. They are a monogamous species, and live in small troops of between 10 and 15. Zoos in San Diego and London have both expressed an interest in receiving several specimens of this genus with the intention of setting up breeding programmes for this rare species of primate.</p>

<p>Mile Stones:</p>
<ul>
<li>1877 Louis Renault is born,the son of 'Button Maker'. He has 2 older Brothers, Marcel and Fernand. The 'Family Renault' are a part of the Parisian 'Social Set', living in a large house on avenue Foche, just off the Arc de Triomphe . Louis recieves a good education and studies engineering, he spends most of his 'teen' years 'tinckering' in the garden shed, at the Renault 'estate' at Billancourt, where the Automobile factory will eventually stand.</li>
<li>1897 Louis,the brilliant young engineer, designs a 3 speed indirect transmission.</li>
<li>1898 Louis build his first 'prototype' using a De Deon 3/4 hp single cylinder engine, in order to prove his indirect 3 speed transmission theory. He spends all night giving demonstration drives, up and down the very steep Rue Lepicque, to amazed onlookers.</li>
<li>1899 The Brothers three... Louis, Marcel and Fernand Renault found The Society Renault Frere's, at Billancourt. Louis designs and builds his own engine. Renault wins in Voiturette class (Small Car) in Paris-Trouville, Paris-Ostend and Paris Rambouillet Motor Races... And a Star is Born.</li>
<li>1890 Renault build the Worlds first fully enclosed car on a Renault Type B Chassis.</li>
<li>1901 Louis wins the Paris-Toulouse, Pau Grand Prix, Paris-Bordeaux and Paris-Berlin Motor Races, and a second Star is born!</li>
<li>1902 Marcel wins outright the Paris-Vienna Race, beating all before him in his Renault light 16. Australia receives its first Renault Imports in the form of Taxis, light trucks and Private cars.</li>
<li>1903 Marcel is killed in a race car crash in the Paris-Madrid Motor race. Louis withdraws from all motor racing.</li>
<li>1905 Louis produces the 1.1 litre twin cylinder AG1... It becomes instantly famous. 1500 are sold as taxis in New York, Berlin, London and Paris... There is no stopping Louis now!</li>
<li>1906 Renault return to racing and win the inaugural French Grand Prix. Renault vehicles are so popular that Louis has to embrace some mass production techniques in order to meet demand! King Edward buys a Renault 14/20. Louis installs compressed air starter motors, as an option and creates a four speed gearbox.</li>
<li>1907 Louis produces his first Marine and Aircraft engines.</li>
<li>1908 Louis take out a patent on an exhaust driven compressor .... forerunner of the 'Turbo Charger</li>
<li>1913 As war looms Renault now employs 5200 workers and produces 10,000 vehicles per annum!</li>
<li>1914 Renault switches production to Aircraft engines, Ambulances, and Light Tanks for the Allied forces.</li>
<li>1919 Life, post war, at Billancourt returns to normal and now manufactures Cars, Tractors, Aircraft, Tyres, Electrical Components, Carburettors, Bearings, Paint, Tools, using its own, foundries, forges, steelworks. Renault now owns the brick works and presses out new bricks with the Renault Logo stamped into each one!. Louis also establishes his own cardboard factory to supply his own enormous needs.... Life is good!</li>
<li>1921 The Sahara Desert is conquered... by a 6 wheeled Renault 'half track'</li>
<li>1925 Renault adopts the Diamond Lozenge as its logo. Things are really 'cracking along' Renault seeks to establish a new and bigger factory, close to Paris, with access to water transport for both raw materials and finished product. Lot by lot Louis purchases the entire ile Seguin (An Island in the river seine, right on the outskirts of Paris CBD). he builds a new 'state of the art' factory, with the longest assembly line in the world at 1.6km! Meanwhile, in Finland a Renault establishes a new world economy record of 3.6 litres per 100km in a 6hp Renault.</li>
<li>1926 Renault establish a new World 24 Hour speed record, clocking a 173kph average speed, for 24 continuous hours... in a 40hp Renault. For the first time in history man has exceeded the 'Magic Ton' (100MPH) for 24 hours!!!</li>
<li>1927 A stock standard 6 hp Renault becomes the first car to make a 'Solo Trans-Sahara Crossing' the journey takes 36 days to complete 1800 km.</li>
<li>1935 Renault wins the big one...The Monte Carlo Rally. In another field Renault establishes a new world speed record for Aircraft.</li>
<li>1939 War breaks out, the Renault factories, once again, swing into military production.</li>
<li>1940 Renault factories are commandeered by the German forces. Louis is given the choice of completely surrendering his entire factory empire, to the German cause, or to stay in charge and run his factories under the direction of the German forces... Louis, wisely, chooses the latter. Three prototypes of the 4CV (750) are built and hidden away, underground. Louis is forced to build military vehicles for the German forces, reluctantly he agrees, secretly he works with 7 key trusted men to build in faults and weaknesses, thus ensuring the vehicles will fail, when subject to stress! (It is Louis way of fighting back)</li>
<li>1941-1944 Were Louis darkest hours. The Billancourt factories are 50% destroyed and 80% of Renault facilities are lost to bombing... Louis is a broken man, but fights on, building in various faults to the military vehicles he is forced to build for the German cause. After France is liberated, Louis is branded a 'traitor', for his apparent collaberation with the German enemy. Louis is arrested by a group of resistance fighters. He is stripped of his wealth and the remains of his empire is confiscated by the French Government. Louis is charged with collaboration and jailed, no one being prepared to accept Louis rationale for 'appearing' to collaborate with the Germans. In jail Louis is attacked and beaten with sticks... he dies of his injuries... The 'official' cause of death is recorded as 'Bladder Infection'. Four years later the French courts deal with the charges against Louis Renault... the charges are dropped, when new evidence is brought forward.</li>
<li>1945 The Renault Factories are Nationalised under the name of: Regie Nationale Des Usines Renault.... The acronym used is RNUR... Another Star is born!</li>
<li>1946 Renault unveil the 4CV, a 760cc rear engined 4 door sedan, at the Paris Motor Show, the world is gob smacked as to how soon, after the war, Renault could develop this 'new' model, not realising that development work had been secretly carried on, underground, during the war.... (God bless you Louis, you trumped 'em again... this time from the grave!). The 1003cc Juvaquatre 4 door, 8hp, sedan is launched in Australia.</li>
<li>1947 The 'Nationalised' Renault factories concentrate on export sales, to bring in much needed foreign currency, necessary to fund the post war re-building of France.</li>
<li>1948 The 760cc version 4CV is assembled in Australia, by then NSW State Distributors Ira Berk P/L, at a plant in the Sydney suburb of Belmore... It is introduced to the Australian market as the 'Renault 750' (Tho press adverts by Pound Motors, the Distributors for Victoria, Riverina and Tasmania advertise it as the 760)</li>
<li>1949 A Renault 4CV wins its class in the Monte Carlo Rally. Importation of the Juvaquatre to Australia is discontinued, in order to concentrate focus on the locally built '750'.</li>
<li>1950 The 748cc version of the 4CV is launched in Australia, assembled and distributed nationally by Ira Berk P/L</li>
<li>1951 A Renault 4CV takes a class win in the 24 Hour Le Mans... and yet another Star is born (Pandora, young 'Kermit' is going to love that one)&#160;! ...The luxury 2 litre Fregate is launched in Europe. Enthusiasts of the Marque form the 'Renault Car Club of Australia'... Renault sales in Australia are heading ever upwards with a 2% market share! (Now if just that 2% had been maintained then there would have been over 19000 Renaults sold in Australia in 2006 rather than that relatively poor 3000 odd that was achieved... Sacre Blue)</li>
<li>1952 The Renault 4CV wins its class in the Mille Miglia. The Renault Praire 'MPV' is launched in Australia, it physically resembles a Dodge Fargo Wagon, but utilises some Fregate mechanicals, but used a pre-war side valve engine, up until 1954, when upgraded to the Fregate OHV engine.</li>
<li>1953 The Fregate 'Affairs' 2 litre sedan is introduced to Australia. It is a basic spec model.</li>
<li>1954 Regie Renault builds the 500,000th 4CV... just 8 years after its launch!</li>
<li>1955 The Renault Alpine, created by Jean Ridele, son of a Dieppe Renault Dealer, takes its first competitive step, by entering the Mille Miglia and so starts a new journey which will ,some years later culminate in a 1,2,3 victory in the Monte Carlo and a World Rally Championship... But that will all be revealed later.</li>
<li>1956 It is a busy year for Renault, both at home in France and here in Australia..The ultra-stylish (for its era) Dauphine is launched in Europe, with eyes on the lucrative USA Market. It is built on a stretched 4CV platform, with updated 4CV mechanicals and the engine capacity increased to 845cc. A 'special' version Dauphine wins its class in the Mille Miglia. Renault's experimental gas-turbine single seater, fully enclosed sports car... The 'Etoile Filante' (Shooting Star) sets a new World Land Speed Record for Gas Turbine cars at 309KPH. The car some years later goes on a World tour, to promote Renault as a World leader in car development. Australia is included in its 'tour'. (RHR had the joy of climbing inside and steering this car, as it was pushed in and out of Maison Motors Workshop, in Adelaide Terrace Perth, to be displayed to the passing traffic, every day for several months). The Dauphine is imported to Australia, in the same year as its International debut, it is an instant success (Despite those 'spider' rear hubs falling apart, as did the 4CV). The Domaine Wagon and Fregate 'Amiral' are both introduced to Australia.</li>
<li>1957 Renault 'Grand Pavois' is introduced to Australia, it is a 'performance enhanced, top of the range luxury car from the Fregate stable. Its sales are dismal, due to its price. Renault purchases the French specialist sports car maker 'Salmson', claiming it needs the extra factory space.</li>
<li>1958 A Renault Dauphine 'High Performance' version wins the Monte Carlo Rally outright! and takes a class win in the Mille Miglia. (Mr.Amedee Gordini has arrived!) Renault annual production reaches 410,000 for the year, with 65,000 exported to the USA. The French Governments philosophy for their Nationalised Car Manufacturer is indeed working, thanks to Pierre Lefaucheux, RNUR's inaugural President, a man of vision. (Who sadly lost his life when skidding in his Fregate, on black ice... More on that later. Praire imports to Australia are discontinued due to poor sales (Dodge Fargo are Kings in market segment).</li>
<li>1959 Renault Floride and Estafette FWD van are launched in Europe. Renault Australia P/L is established, as a fully owned subsidiary of RNUR, with offices in King Street Sydney (Later moving to George Street Redfern, where it established service and parts facilities) and established a retail showroom in William Street, Kings Cross. Mr. Nick Josika was the Sales manager and Jerome White was salesman. CKD Assembly is carried out by Martin and King, in NSW and by Continental and General in Victoria. Unable to meet demand, Renault licenses Alfa Romeo to assemble the 4CV, for the Italian market. Renault exports 117000 cars to the US to become the largest selling imported car in the US, outselling VW America! Renault is Frances largest economic contributor, exporting cars to 98 countries.</li>
<li>1960 The Renault 'Ondine' is launched in Europe. Renault builds the 1,000,000th Dauphine, just 4 years after launch. Renault introduce the 'Manoir' Wagon, a Fregate derivative. The Floride 2 door coupe/convertible and Dauphine-Gordini are launched in Australia to rave press reviews, both share the same mechanicals and are 845 cc Dauphine based derivatives.</li>
<li>1961 The boxy Renault 4 is launched in Europe, it uses an updated 4CV engine, located in the front, driving a forward mounted front wheel drive gearbox (Ahla Citroen D19). It is the first car with a 'sealed' cooling system, using an Ethyelene/Glycol/Water composite as the 'coolant', this has two rationales, it protects against extreme cold by virtue of its anti-freeze properties and it guards agains overheating, by virtue of its higher boiling point, whilst at the same time achieves an improved thermal efficiency, by virtue of its higher controlled operating temperature. Dauphine local assembly commences in Australia. Dauphine Gordini's are placed 1st, 2nd and 6th in class 'D' at the Armstrong 500 held at Phillip Island. US Sales take a huge dive, due to a number of factors, including US economy, durability problems in the US market and increased competition from compact domestic makes.</li>
<li>1962 Renault 8 and Caravelle make their European debut, both share same mechanicals , which include a new 5 main bearing 956cc engine, 4 speed gearbox and 4 wheel disc brakes, and new front suspension with ball joints. Again these new models are built upon a stretched 4CV (750) Floor pan! The Floride is discontinued. The R8, R4 and Caravelle are launched in Australia, initially being fully imported, later the R4 and R8 become locally assembled, whilst Caravelle remains fully imported. A Dauphine Gordini driven by Emmett, Connolley and Sampson takes a class win in the Armstrong 500 at Phillip Island. Renault 750 and Dauphine locally assembly ceases, mid year, to make way for local assembly of the R4 and R8. Renault workers in France strike for better conditions, they are granted 4 weeks annual leave... this added manufacturing cost reflects in reduced competitiveness for Renault products on world markets, particularly the US, where local car workers recieved 2 weeks paid leave, per annum, at the time.</li>
<li>1963 The 845cc R4 Deluxe is launched in Australia, supplementing the 745cc standard R4 with deckchair seats and tube bumpers. They sell for 745 pounds ($1490) and 845 Pounds ($1690) respectively.Renault produces 670,000 vehicles world wide for the year. Renault secretly signs an agreement with American Motors to jointly develop a rotary engine ...it fails to reach production. Renault enter a team of 3 x R8 and 1 x Gordini in the Armstrong 500 at Bathurst, Frank Matich is one of the drivers, the cars finish mid-field. RHR is promoted from Apprentice to Service Manager at Maison Motors, the WA Renault State Distributors.</li>
<li>1964 The Renault 8 is named Wheels Car of the Year. Sales of 750 and Dauphine are discontinued in Australia. 6 x R8's compete in class 'B' at Bathurst, they finish mid field.</li>
<li>1965 The revolutionary R16 and the R10 are launched in Europe. The R8Gordini with a 'cross-flow' 1108 cc engine and 2 x twin choke side-draft Solex's is launched in Australia, it is priced at 1285 pounds ($2570). RHR meets the boat at Fremantle, drives car back to Perth showroom, (Then can't sleep that night as the 8G is constantly on mind) thus claiming to have been first in Australia to drive one! 3 x R8's compete at Bathurst, finishing 7th class 'B' and 32nd overall, the 3rd car crashed on lap 42.</li>
<li>1966 Renault build the 1,000,000th R4, just 5 years after its launch. World production is 738 vehicles for the year. Renault Australia purchases the 4.5 hectare West Heidelberg Assembly Plant, from Continental &amp; General and begins expansion and upgrading of facilities. Renault Australia become concessionaires for Peugeot, in Australia, and assemble and distribute Peugeot via a National network of Renault/Peugeot dealers. The West Heidelberg plant employs 148 people, who assemble 7x Renault and 3 x Peugeot vehicles per day! Renault Australia Head Office is relocated from Redfern to West Heidelberg. Renault establish operations in Eastern Europe, building Bulgarenault and bulgaralpine in Bulgaria! 'RENAULT SCORES in 24 HOURS LE MANS'... So says the headline in Renault Australia's 'Australasian News - Press Information' issued 22nd June 1966, under the signature of Mr. J. K. Slattery... Wholesale Manager... Quote: " Competing against cars with engines over five times their capacity, the 1300cc Renault Alpines performed brilliantly in the 1966 Le Mans Race to win the first 3 places in their class and gained 8th, 10th, 11th and 13th places outright... Fifty-five cars started in this years world classic and only fifteen finished including four 1300cc Renault Alpines" ... RHR.</li>
<li>1967 Renault 10, (a long nosed, long booted R8) built on a yet again a further stretched 4CV platform replaces the R8 in Australia. R8 Gordini 1300 (1255CC) is launched in Australia, at 1365 pounds ($2730) 2000 Cars are produced at West Heidelberg in the year. R4 and Caravelle are discontinued, in Australia. A lone Renault 8 is entered in the Gallaher 500 at Bathurst (RHR drives from Perth to Bathurst, in a R8, to watch the event) the Renault 8 finishes 5th in class, driven by David Frazer and Bernie Breen.</li>
<li>1968 The Renault 16 is launched in Australia with all aluminium 1470 cc engine. The Renault 6, (an updated R4) and the Renault 16TS (A 1565cc performance version with cross-flow head) are launched in Europe. Renault Australia open a new 'hi-tech' paint shop, which incorporates an 'electrophoresis' process... which promises much, but sadly it is twart with teething problems. (more on that later in 'Blunders down under').</li>
<li>1969 Renault launch the Renault 16TA with an in-house developed and manufactured electronic controlled automatic with computer... (lots of promise, not much substance... more on that later). Civil unrest and student riots disrupt production, despite which World annual Renault production exceeds 1,000,000 for the first time, with 50% being export sales... (The regie is still fulfilling the dream). The Renault 12 is launched in Europe, with a 1289cc version of the original 956cc Renault 8 engine. It is front engined, front wheel drive, with gearbox behind engine... It will become an outstanding car, world wide, spawning many siblings. The 2,000,000th R4 is built and the 1,000,000th R8 is built. Bob and Ross Edgerton enter a Renault 10 in the Hardie ferodo, at Bathurst, finishing 35th and just 2 places behind Bill Brydon and Don Smith, in a 16TS. Meanwhile at West Heidelberg, conveyors are installed that enable production to be raised to 7000 units for the year. A team of 16 Dealers and Renault Australia executives, plus RHR, are hosted by Renault France, for a 10 day factory tour. Renault Australia campaign 3 x R16TS specially prepared by Harry Firth, in the ARC and VRC events, with much success, easily winning the VRC and stamping their name in the Australian Rally History book... at the seasons end RHR purchase all 3 cars and trucks them to Perth.</li>
<li>1970 The 10 millionth Renault built, since the Nationalisation of Renault comes off the assembly line in Paris. Local assembly of the R12 and Peugeot 504 begin at West Heidelberg. Bob Watson wins the Australian Rally Championship in a Renault 8 Gordini, whilst RHR wins the WARC in the ex Watson 16TS... It is a good year for Renault Motor Sport in Australia. Renault open a National Spare Parts Warehouse, behind the factory at West Heidelberg, meaning that the various State Distributors may now source their parts from within Australia, rather than each ordering direct on Paris... Progress! Renault sales in Australia top 5039 units.</li>
<li>1971 Renault 15/17 Coupes launched in Europe. R12 Wins 'Wheels Car of Year'. Renault Alpine wins Monte Carlo Rally. Eurocars are appointed Renault/Peugeot Distributor for Western Australia (on 1st April 1971). Renault 10 and base R16 models discontinued. Renault 16TL is introduced, as a locally assembled model, along side the existing 16TS. Slater/Large, in the ex works 16TS Rally Car retain the WARC, giving Renault a 'hat-trick' in the West with WARC wins in 1969/70/71.... Slater is rewarded with the promise of a 'works' 12G for 1972.</li>
<li>1972 Europe sees launch of R5 and R12TS (Neither are sold in Australia). R12GL sedan and R12TL wagon are introduced to Australia, as local assembled models. The R12GL is a cleaver marketing excercise, and with its, cheap, pressed aluminium full wheel covers, its chrome plated rocker cover and its bright colors it became an instant sales success, with demand exceeding supply. Renault Sport develop a 2 litre V6 'Gordini' race engine for sportscar competition.</li>
<li>1973 The Renault Group produces 1.3million cars and employs 130,000 people. Renault 5 and 12 models become worlds best selling Renault models ever. Renault Australia reach a new annual sales record of 5633 units. RHR negotiates a 'deal' which sees Renault Australia offer cars to WA inventor Ralph Sarich, discussions held between Renault/Sarich and WA Government to manufacture engines in WA for use in R12 do not reach fruition. Renault Distributor Rod Slater commences discussion with WA Government regarding Renault Buses (more on that in 1985). Renault Alpine wins Monte Carlo Rally and World Rally Championship. R15/17 are launched in Australia.</li>
<li>1974 The Renault 'Gordini' 2 litre Alpine A441 Sports Prototype sets the pace, on the race tracks in Europe, by sweeping all before it. Renault 12 Wagon and Renault 17 Gordini are launched in Australia. Renault Australia invest 1.5 million on plant expansion at West Heidelberg. Renault sales in Australia reach a new record of 6569 units.</li>
<li>1975 Despite an overall fall in sales to 6313 units Renault Australia increases market share to 2.1%. The Renault 20/30 range are released in Europe.</li>
<li>1976 R5 Alpine and R14 launched in Europe. (RHR was there) Renault sets new World production records, producing 1.660,000 vehicles, for the year. Renault sales in Australia, affected by unfavourable exchange rates and import duties, fall again to 6009 units. Meanwhile, in WA, Eurocars retail showroom on Canning Highway, in South Perth, is confirmed as the largest volume Renault dealer in Australia, setting new sales records for Renault, in WA.. Renault (Aust) launch the Renault 12 'New Star' Racing series, as part of a move to lift awareness. 75,000 vehicles (Renault &amp; Peugeot) have been produced in the 10 years since Renault (Aust) aquired the West Heidelberg plant. The Renault 1.4, a larger capacity (1397cc) R12 replaces the 12TL &amp; 12GL, in Australia. The R15, R16TL and R17 are discontinued, in Australia. Renault France appoint Gerard Larousse as Manager of Renault Sport and announce plans to enter Formula 1.</li>
<li>1977 Renault enters the British Grand Prix, with a car of its own design, powered by a 1.5litre V6 Turbo engine and so begins the Formula 1 'Turbo Revolution'. In a desperate move to address flagging sales, the Renault 12 1.4 is replaced, in Australia, by the Renault Virage. It is, in reality, a rebadged Renault 12 1.4, with a facelift, new color range and a price rise! Renault Sales in Australia drop to just 3250 units, thanks to ever worsening exchange rates, import duties and local labour costs driving price increases, against more affordable imports from Japan. Local production and sales of the R16TS ceases, after a succesful 8 years in Australia.</li>
<li>1978 Renault wins Le Mans 24 Hour, with a 2 litre V6Turbo, with the crew of Didier Pironi and Jean-Pierre Jassaud averaging 208kph, for the 24hour journey, a second Renault is placed 4th; the Porches, with 3 litre Turbo power, were never in contention. Meanwhile Renault conducts its first full year in Formula 1, amassing a total of just 3 points to finish 12th overall for the season... Much 'midnight oil' will be burnt over the 'off-season', to prepare the Formula 1 cars for the '79 season.</li>
<li>1979 Renault 20 is launched in Australia, the first cars are imported, fully built up, local assembly, at West Heidelberg, follows shortly after. Renault France takes a 10% stake in Volvo Car Co; a move that will later 'turn-sour'. Jean-Pierre Jabouille takes 'pole' for the South African GP... he follows this with 'pole' in the French GP and brings Renault their first GP win, in the modern era. Renault Australia (suffering from that well known disease made popular by Noel Coward) establish a TRACTOR division, in NSW. assembling and distributing 9 models. (RHR is offered distribution for WA, but declines)... The division losses 'squillions' as is 'abandoned' within 12 months.</li>
<li>1980 Renault 18 is released in Australia, as a locally assembled 1647cc sedan and wagon, in both manual and 'dreadful' auto versions. Build quality is poor and a 'locally sourced' Airconditioner, as a 'dealer fit option' proves a 'nightmare'. What could have been a succesful model was 'compromised' by local build and content... it would prove to be 'the beginning of the end' for Renault, in Australia, who loose $4m on their Australian operations. There is strong pressure from France to 'abandon' their antipodean loss making 'out-post' Fuego is launched, at Geneva, a sleek 2 door/4seat 'Poor mans Porsche'. It is built on the R12 floorpan. Renault are 'lighting the wick' under the F1 'traditionalists' with Renee Arnoux and Jean-Pierre Jabouille taking 3 x FI victories for the season.</li>
<li>1981 The 'Demise' of Renault(in Australia)... This is to be Renault Australia's darkest hour, coming some 30 years after establishing themselves in Austyralia in1951. WA Distributor, RHR, is 'summoned', in March, to a hastily convened meeting with the MD of Renault Aust, Mr. Bernard Vernoux, who 'lays his cards on the table'.... Renault Aust have experienced a $17M trading loss, over past 12months, and 'The Frogs' are not prepared to fund any more losses. The factory must close and all assetts must be sold, over the next 6 months, to recover some losses. Discussion is held with the Federal Government regarding Renault transferring from 'local assembler' to 'full importer'... The Federal Government responds by allocating 1300 licences, a number considered financially unviable for Renault to remain in Australia. The Renault import licences are transferred to LNC. Who take over importation and national distribution, of Renault, thru their network of State based offices. LNC Managing Director, Doug Donaldson, assures RHR that He (RHR) will remain as the only 'independant' Renault State Distributor in Australia (A committment which is honoured right up to the handover to Volvo Australia.) A new entity, Renault Importers, is formed as a division of LNC and is Managed by Mr. Bob Bessemmer. LNC take-over all remaining stock of locally built R18 and R20, with effect from October and commence plans to import the series 2 R20 early in '82. Peugeot are left without any licences, so must 'strike a deal' with a local assembler, to take over Peugeot assembly and distribution, for Australia. Leyland Australia, become Peugeot's Australian 'life-line'. The assembly line is transferred to Leylands facility at Zetland NSW. Leyland have no regard for RHR's relationship with Renault Australia and 'seize' Peugeot Distribution, in every state, including WA, RHR becomes a 'Peugeot Dealer'. Alain Prost and Renee Arnoux take six pole positions in F1, winning 3 GP's to take 3rd position in constructors Championship.</li>
<li>1982 Fuego arrives 'Down-Under', being launched in October as a one model/one spec manual 2 litre with everything... it is an instant success. Series 2 R20's, arrive in March and are a huge improvement in fit/finish over the local assembled version. The locally built R18 is discontinued. Consideration is given to importing the R18TX 2 litre, as a replacement, but Renault France will only build to ADR's for volumes of 1000 units per annum and above. With only 1300 licenses (Which will reduce over time under the federal Governments local content plan) Renault Importers are only able to import one model... and Fuego is the winner. Prost and Arnoux take 10 pole positions and win 4 x F1 Grand Prix.</li>
<li>1983 Alain Prost is 'almost' World Champ. coming within 2 points of being crownd World F1 Champion, having won 4 x GP for the season. Renault supply F1 Engines to Lotus, who manage 1 x pole position for the year.</li>
<li>1984 Renault becomes a 'one model' brand. R20 imports cease, all import licenses are now dedicated to Fuego and Renault becomes a 'one model' brand, a 2 door Fuego, in manual and that's it... 'take-it or leave-it' thats all there is to sell, in Australia, thanks to the Federal Governments 'Car Plan', (a 'blueprint to reform the Australian Car Industry'... again!) Renault are now undisputed 'king of the F1 turbo era' and now supply both Lotus and Liegier with F1 Turbo engines. Prost leaves Renault Sport and with his leaving goes the hopes and aspirations of a Renault F1 Constructors Championship. (for the time being). Renault are now the Worlds 6th largest vehicle manufacturer, with annual sales of US$13.5 billion.</li>
<li>1985 George Besse appointed Chair: With his reputation for restructuring 'ailing' companies earning him the nick name of 'The Surgeon' George Besse takes office in Jan '85 and by June annonces plans to 'Reduce the Renault workforce by 20%', a move considered essential to rein in the losses of recent years. Renault add a 3rd 'customer F1 team' and now supply Tyrell as well as Lotus and Liegier. Lotus takes 8 x pole positions with the brilliant Ayrton Senna taking 7 x poles and Elio de Angelis taking the 8th for Lotus, with Renault power. The Australian F1 Grand Prix sees an unprecedented 8 cars qualify with Renault F1 Turbo engines, after the race Renault Sport announce withdrawal from direct F1 competition, in order to focus on F1 engine manufacturing. R25 is launched in Australia... with a $34990 price tag (A big price for the times) and Renault, in Australia, is no longer a 'one model' brand.</li>
<li>1986 George Besse is assasinated... In November '86, as George Besse approaches his home, in the Montparnesse region of Paris, he is shot to death by 2 women, using hand guns. Renault rewrites it's 'Corporate Governance Policy' and the company is restructured along the lines of a privately-owned company. Raymond Levy, (formerly head of giant Belgium State owned Steel Co - Cockerill-Sambre) is appointed Managing Directorr, adical reforms are introduced. Renault Sport continues to supply F1 V6Turbo Engines to Tyrell, Lotus and Ligier. Senna, in a Renault powered Lotus takes 8 pole positions, for the season, taking the cheqeured flag in 2 GP's.</li>
<li>1987 Renault withdraw totally from Formula 1, a decade after their debut. Fuego is discontinued and Renault dealers, Australia wide, are again left to struggle with just 1 model... the now $39950 priced R25. The Renault 21 is 'displayed' at the Sydney Motor Show, it is 'dull &amp; bland' but offers Renault's remaining 'loyal' dealers a glimmer of hope. Renault claim a new World fuel economy record with the 'Vesta' prototype (sounds like the name of a battery), which travels from Paris to Bordeaux averaging fuel consumption of a miserly 1.94litres/100km (146.6 MPG). Renault 'abandon' US Market as poor quality, reliability, service and resale drastically undermine sales.</li>
<li>1988 Renault 21 released in Australia, the price is high, sales are low, the familiar auto-trans problems that beseiged the R25 soon become inherant in the R21. Renault Sport unveil a V10 Formula 1 Engine and like the 1.5 litre V6 F1 turbo before it, this 3 litre V10 non-turbo engine, will again revolutionise Formula 1. Renault 21 Turbo sets a world speed record of 250kph... on ice!</li>
<li>1989 The Centennary of Renault. 100 years have now passed, since Louis Renault sold his first car, the 1898 3/4hp 'voiturette' (one of which exists today in Peter Briggs 'Fremantle Motor Museum' in Perth WA). But ... 'Storm Clouds' are gathering over Renault...in Australia. Poor sales of R21 call for desperate action. Eurocars (WA Renault Distributors) develop a 21 Turbo, complete with skirts and spoilers...and a Renault 25 Turbo... but, it proves to be 'too little...too late'. LNC, no longer a public company, is owned and controlled by the Libbermann family, who decide to exit the Auto Industry and sell off the LNC assetts, comprising mainly of property and import licenses. Renault importers cancel orders for new cars, from France, and 'hand-over' the franchise to a NZ based group, who take-over Renault importation and distribution, in Australia, trading as 'Boulogne Motor Distributors'. Renault re-enters F1 as an 'engine-supplier' selling 3 litre V10 engines to Williams and surprises the F1 world by taking 'pole' in its first outing, the Brazilian GP, going on to take 2nd spot in the World F1 constuctors championship...and all in its 1st year! Renault have certainly proven, beyond any doubt, their prowess as engine builders... (pity that didn't translate into an ability to build auto transmissions!)</li>
<li>1990 Second Generation R25 &amp; R21 launched in Australia ... Enhanced models, with more agressive pricing, but recession is 'biting' and sales expectations are not met. Williams-Renault achieve good results in F1 with Patrese winning in San Marino and Boutsen winning in Hungary. Nigel Mansell is signed for '91. Renault Boss... Raymond Levy is voted 'Manager of the Year' by L'Economiste Magazine Nouvelle...(Mmmm does the editor perhaps have shares in Volvo?).</li>
<li>1991 Renault &amp; Volvo sign a collaboration agreement to work closely together and explore mutual opportunities. Formula 1 success continues with wins in Mexico, Portugal, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain... despite this Williams-Renault only manages 2nd place in the World F1 Constructors Championship. Clio voted 'Car of year' by a 'Jury' of European Motoring Journalists. Renault 19 is top selling import in Germany... against stiff competition from Japan and Europe. Boulogne Motors relinquish Renault franchise for Australia... amidst growing losses on importing/distributing Renault cars in Australia, in a declining economy. Renault France consult with Rod Slater, (Renault's WA Distributor since 1971), regarding Renaults future in Australia... Slater suggests Renault establish their own office in Australia to import/distribute vehicles and parts. Slater proposes a viable/cost effect solution to address Renault's woes, in Australia... But Renault decline stating... "We are not prepared to invest one more $ in Australia".... Renault 'float' the possibility of their 'International Partner' Volvo becoming Renault Importer for Australia. Slater supports the proposal and a series of meetings are held in Slaters office, in Perth, between Renault (France) representatives and Volvo Australia executives... it presents a viable future for Renault and an acceptable opportunity for Slater... Consensus is reached and Slater supports the initiative.... Volvo Australia become Renault's Australian Importer and plans to 're-launch' Renault, in Australia, with the all new Renault 19... But, there are additional 'agenda's... and just 30 days before the 're-launch', (in a move which ultimately proved detrimental), Volvo Australia terminated, via faxed notice, all existing Renault dealers in Australia, including Eurocars in WA, and distanced themselves from any connection whatsover with any of the former Renault Dealers in Australia, choosing to retail Renault exclusively thru Volvo Dealers in Australia... (thus sealing the 'demise' of Renault in Australia for almost a decade).</li>

<p><b>Martand- the abode of Sun God</b></p>
<p>Martand - Mattan (J&amp;K) India, is a tiny hamlet situated on Anantnag-Pahalgam road, about 61 kms from capital City Srinagar of Jammu and Kashmir State of Indian union. The Place is famous for&#160;;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Ancient Martand Ruins.</li>
<li>Temple dedicated to Sun God with natural fresh water springs with fish abound.</li>
<li>Pilgrimage centre of Hindus.</li>
<li>The special rituals on occassions like Parshotam Mass or Adhik Mass after every two and half years, Vijay Saptami, Solar or Lunar eclipse days, Amawasya, Sundays are being performed here for the Salvation and peace of the dead. Martand is also important stop over for the two-day halt of Charri-Mubarak (Holy Mace) on way to Amarnath. Some of the holy pilgrims after completing the Amarnath yatra would visit Martand on their return journey to seek blessings of the Surya Narayan.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>The Legend&#160;:</b></p>
<p>In his introduction to the Rajtarangini Pandit Kalhan speaks of the Vale of Kashmir thus: “It is a country where the sun shines mildly, a place of great glory created by Kashaypa- high mountains, houses, the saffron fields, iced-water and grapes—things which are found only in heaven abound here”.</p>
<p>History bears testimony to the fact that millions of years back, Kashmir had been a vast lake, . Goddess Parvati had been so enamored of the picturesque lake, which was surrounded by high snow peaked mountains that she would often sail through it in a pleasure boat right from the point of her abode on the Hara-Mukh on the North to the Vishnu Pad in Kounsar Nag in the south. According to Nilmat Puran (200 BC) once Dash Prajapat, the Himalayan King and the father of Goddess Parvati extended invitation to all Gods and Goddesses to a Yagya ceremony, but did not invite Lord Shiva. Goddess Parvati who took it as an insult, got infuriated to the extent that she jumped into the havan kund and committed the act of Sati. Lord Shiva, the legend says, immersed the half –burnt body of his consort into the deep waters of the lake. That is how the lake got the name Satisar or the taru of the chaste woman.</p>
<p>In the lake Satisar, after centuries came and went by, a cruel demon by the name of Jalad Bhuva appeared and went on a destruction spree. He began annihilating life inside the waters and on the high lands. The sacred legends say that this demon was blessed with a boon by Lord Brahama, that as long as he remained under the water level of the lake, no power on earth could harm or kill him. Around the same time marked by the terror and destruction unleashed by the demon, Munni Kashyap is said to have been visiting the holy places in North India. On reaching the region of Himalayas where his son, Raja Niel, the king of Kashmiri Nagas, told him about the miseries suffered by the people there on account of the atrocities committed by the demon, Jalad Bhuva. Upon learning the story of great sufferings, Munni Kashyap is believed to have promised his son of the help in ridding the lake of the cruel demon. He soon prayed upon Lord Brahma and the Divine Trinity met at Nav Bhandhan peak near Kaunsar-Nag (15323 ft above sea level) and drained the Satisar after breaking a huge rock at Baramulla. The demon was killed but not before a terrible fight in the low waters at a place where Hari Parbat is situated today, and the land came to be known as Kashyapmaer or Kashmir.</p>
<p>Kashyap Rishi then is believed to have invited all the Gods and Goddesses and assigned each one of them a place in the valley. For example, Goddess Sharika was assigned the Hari Parbat, as she is said to have played a vital role in killing the demon in the form of Haer. Hari Parbhat is also known by the name of Pradman Peeth and Pradman Giri.</p>
<p>Pandit Kalhan writes, “There is not a single place in Kashmir which is not holy”. Martand or Mattan constitutes one among those sacred places. Situated about 61 Kms from capital city of Srinagar on main Anantnag-Pahalgam road, it occupies a special place in the Hindu mythology and is considered as old as the Sun itself. It is believed that thirteenth Sun , Martand was born here.</p>
<p>Legend says that between the two wives Kashyap Rishi had, Ditti gave birth to Danvas and Aditti bore him 13 sons of whom first twelve became the rulers of Surya Loka, in rotation with the twelve months of the year. Between the two, legend says, Aditti was pious and spiritually inclined who would spend most of her time in religious rituals and prayers. It is believed that because of her religious disposition, Lord Vishnu had blessed her with a boon that she becomes mother of Thirteen sons.</p>
<p>However, when she was pregnant with her thirteenth son, she did not stop the ritual of fasting, much to the displeasure of Kashyap Rishi. This led to the premature birth of her thirteenth son which resembled an Andkar pind or Oval-shaped substance like an egg, but glowing like a sun. Using her spiritual powers Aditti dropped it in the depths of Satisar Lake. Latter, when Rishi Kashyap came to know that his son lay in the depths of Satisar at a place (now known as Martand) he called upon Brahmaji to accompany him to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and Lord Vishnu and they all reached where the lifeless egg or Mrit-aend was dropped. There Lord Shiva smote the Mrit-aend, the upper side became a spring now called “wemal” and the lower side became another spring now called “Kemal”. A spark of energy ignited out of it which turned into Goddess “Barga Shakha” worshipped on the mountain-hillock overlooking the shrine. Three more Shakti Swaroopni Jyoti's became famous as Beema, Bagwati, and Shree Bhawani, all worshipped there to this day. The legend says that the light that ignited out of the Mrit-aend became Martand (Aur Iss sei jo surya kiran swaroop tej pragat hua wohi Martand kehlaya). And by virtue of the chakra the stream that gushed out from there became chakarsuta or chaka nadi.</p>
<p>Greatly impressed with the divine and aesthetic beauty of these springs of ‘Wemal’ and ‘Kemal”, she blessed the fish therein and ordained that those who will take care of the fish will attain salvation. Also, Lord Shiva is believed to have blessed the dead with peace and salvation if pind-dhaan, Pitrashraad, tarpan etc., are performed under certain stellar positions and special areas here.</p>
<p>The special rituals on occassions like Parshotam Mass or Adhik Mass after every two and half years, Vijay Saptami, Solar or Lunar eclipse days, Amawasi, Sundays are being performed here for the Salvation and peace of the dead. Martand is also important stop over for the two-day halt of Charri-Mubarak (Holy Mace) on way to Amarnath. Some of the holy pilgrims after completing the Amarnath yatra would visit Martand on their return journey to seek blessings of the Surya Devta.</p>
<p>Grand Kings of Yore and many devotees have constructed grand temples, Dharamshallas, bhawans etc. The springs have also been renovated and decorated many a time since their appearance. Also since times immemorial pilgrims from as far countries as China, Tibet, Samarqand, Afghanistan, North Indian states and NWFP (now in Pakistan) would visit Martand. It would be a must see in their itinerary.</p>
<p>History makes us believe that it had been the Raja Ramdev of Pandva dynasty who first built the original temple devoted to Sun God. Many subsequent kings and monarchs repaired and renovated the temple complex. However, it goes to Maharaja Lalitaditya (8th century AD) who gave a complete face lift to the ancient temple and made it known all over the world. The Sun temple of Martand stands in the middle of a large courtyard having 86 fluted columns. The temple proper contains garbhagraha, antarala and closed mandapa, approached by a grand flight of steps. The pliant supporting the central shrine has two tiers, both with niches having 37 divine figures. According to Walter R. Lawrence, the noted historian and a Kashmir expert of his times, “The ruins of the Hindu temple of Martand, or as is commonly called, the Pandav-Koru House- the Cyclopes of the east are undoubtedly, occupying the finest position in Kashmir. This noble ruin is the most striking in size and situation of all the existing remains of Kashmir grandeur”. He further writes, “There are in all eighty-four columns- a singularly appropriate number in a temple of the sun. The number eighty four is accounted sacred by the Hindus in consequence of its being the multiple of the number of days in the week with the number of signs in the Zodiac ( Rashis)”.</p>
<p>Cunningham, another historian, thinks that the erection of this Sun temple was suggested by the magnificent Sunny prospect which its position commands. “It overlooks the finest view in Kashmir and perhaps in the known world. Beneath it lays the paradise of the east, with its sacred streams, orchards and green fields, surrounded by vast snowy mountains, seem to smile upon the beautiful valley below.</p>
<p>The history of Martand or Mattan is incomplete without any mention of Bumzua, a sleepy hamlet at a distance of one Kilometer and situated at the mouth of the Lidder, more known for the cave temple, dedicated to the Kaldeva that stands at the far end of a natural, but artificially enlarged fissure in the lime stone cliff. The entrance to the caverns is 60 ft above the river Lidder and is carved into an architectural door way. The huge Shiva Linga inside the cave is believed to be there since the days of Pandavas. At a striking distance from the cave is yet another cave, some hundred feet long and is said to have been a Samadhi of some ancient sage.</p>
<p>According to Dr Stien, “The temple is the same as the Bhimkesava temple mentioned by Kalhana. It was built by king Bhimasahi, king of Kabul in Afghanistan”. Hugel states that the Bumzua caves date back to the year Kali-2108 or 993 BC, when Raja Nara ruled the Kashmir and these occupy very conspicuous place in the fables of Kashmiris. He tells us, “During the reign of Raja Nara, a certain Brahmin wanted to marry Chanderasha, the daughter of Susravas, a serpent God, who lived in lake near the city of Nara, near the Vitasta. Raja Nara also noticed the movements of the beautiful daughter of the serpent in the lake. He was struck with the deepest admiration and resolved to carry her off but failed. To avenge the insult, a storm was called up, which swallowed up the king and his court. The sister of the serpent God also helped him and hurled stones from the Bhawan or Mattan mountain. The caverns of Bumzua are on the spot where these rocks were upturned”. (Hugel, Growse).</p>
<p>The foreign scholars have praised the superiority of the Kashmiri Architecture. “The architectural remains of Kashmir are perhaps the most remarkable of the existing monuments of India, as they exhibit undoubted traces of Grecian art.”-(Reference., Bate’s Gazetteer). “Martand or Mattan are all known by the general name of Pandavan-Ki-Lari or “Pandava house” a title to which the statement of Ptolemy (2nd century AD astronomer and scientist of Greece) can be considered a sufficient authority. He says, “ Circa antem Bida spun Pandovorum region”, meaning—The kingdom of the Pandavas is upon the Betasta or (Behat) that is it corresponds with Kashmir”.</p>
<p>“Truly speaking, there is hardly a river, a spring or hillside in Kashmir that is not holy to Hindus”. ( Walter R Lawrence). Again Abul Fazal ( 1550-1602) writes, “ The Hindus regard all Kashmir as holy land. Forty-five places are dedicated to Mahadeva, Sixty-four to Vishnu, three to Brahama and twenty-two to Durga. In seven hundred places there are carved figures of snakes which they worship”.</p>
<p>It would mean endless space if one attempts to give description of places famous and dear to all Hindus in Kashmir. As regards with the Martand temple, these like many other places of Hindu worship fell victim to the fanatic zeal, soon after the end of Hindu rule in Kashmir in 1339 AD. Gibbon writes, “History is little more than a register of the crimes and misfortunes of mankind, chances and changes of human fortune; prosperity and decay of human institutions”.</p>

Mike Saenz, born in Chicago, Illinois, is a comic book artist and creator of the first digital comic book.

It was then photographed like a piece of traditionally drawn black and white comic art, and the color separations were applied in the traditional manner. An innovative breakthrough for both comics and computers, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shatter_%28digital_comic%29.html" title="Shatter (digital comic)">Shatter (digital comic)</a> attracted widespread media attention and set sales records for an independent comic.</p>

<p>Jim Fleeting (51) SFA’s newly-appointed director of football development (soccer) Jim was previously manager of Kilmarnock F.C in 1988-92 and served a short apprenticeship in management with Stirling Albion. Jim was a player with Norwich City, Ayr, Morton, Clyde, a brief spell in the States with Tampa Bay Rowdies, Knockentiber and down the leagues with Kilbirnie, Annbank, Irvine Vics, Irvine Meadowand to name a few.</p>
<p>Jim is the dad of female football sensation Julie Fleeting who plays for Arsenal ladies, is one of the most eminent female footballers in Europe, with 92 goals in 85 games for her country.</p>
<p>His son, Barry, plays football, for Troon Juniors, as do both his sons-in-law, Livingston goalkeeper Colin Stewart and Ayr midfielder Chris Strain. His other daughter, Gemma, plays netball, and who knows what awaits his young grandson Ben.</p>
<p>Jim Fleeting signed Tommy Burns and Bobby Williamson for Kilmarnock F.C who both went on to manage Kilmarnock F.C after Fleets.</p>
<p>What, apart from an infectious enthusiasm for the game, makes Fleeting unique, however, is the fact that he has played across every level of the game, from amateur to junior, from the old English first division to locking horns with Franz Beckenbauer with the Tampa Bay Rowdies.</p>

<p>Posteal Laskey terrorized Cincinnati in the mid-1960s with a string of assaults on and killings of young women. He was called the Cincinnati Strangler</p>
<p>Laskey was only convicted of one of the murder, but police believe he was responsible for at least six more.</p>
<p>Laskey was convicted of murder – and initially sentenced to death – for the brutal slaying of Barbara Bowman. Her body was found on the pavement near the Price Hill intersection of Grand Avenue and Ring Place.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old woman had been raped. Her throat had been cut. Her right foot almost was severed. Police said she had been choked, stabbed and run over by a cab.</p>
<p>Her body was found near Yellow Cab No. 870, which had been reported stolen. Laskey worked at one time for Yellow Cab and was using a master key he’d made.</p>
<p>Cincinnati police had as many as 54 detectives on the case. Laskey was caught after someone reported the license plate of a car driven by a man who tried to assault a woman downtown.</p>
<p>Police used the license plate number to find Laskey.</p>
<p>Laskey, 69, had his death sentence commuted to a life sentence in 1972 when the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Before his 1967 arrest, Laskey had been convicted of assault and spent four years in prison.</p>

<p>Saleh made many very critical friendships with high-ranking Syrian generals while undercover.</p>
<p>After Hafez became Prime Minister, Shadi was even considered to be named the Syrian Deputy Minister of Defense.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although the story may be <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocryphal.html" title="Apocryphal">apocryphal</a> many claim that Saleh suggested that <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucalyptus.html" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> trees should be planted around Syrian military bunkers and mortars on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> that were targeting Israel. That way, Saleh argued, the trees would provide natural cover for the outposts. After his suggestion was implemented by the Syrian military, Saleh passed on the information to Israeli intelligence, then, the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Air_Force_4b7e.html" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> IAF — using the newly planted trees as a guide — easily destroyed the majority of the bases during the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>. The mature trees are still evident today when visiting the sites.</p>
<p>Saleh also learned of an important secret Syrian plan to have three lines of bunkers and mortars right after each other in order to trick the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">Israeli military</a> who would have only known of one at a time.</p>
<p>While in Syria, Shadi Saleh was able to collect much information on Syrian Airforce pilots. This included their real and code names and family information.</p>
<p>According to his brother and fellow Mossad agent, <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Cohen_3b6a.html" title="Maurice Cohen">Maurice Cohen</a>, Shadi Saleh's alias was third in the line of succession to become president of Syria when he was discovered.</p>
<p>Requests by his family for his remains to be returned to Israel have been denied by the Syrian government (as of May 2006).</p>
<p>He is celebrated as a hero in Israel because he has been credited with being a deciding factor in the outcome of the Six-Day War. The film <i>The Impossible Spy</i> is a depiction of his life.</p>
<p>He is honored at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Spy_Museum_28b9.html" title="International Spy Museum">International Spy Museum</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Ancient Greek homes were very different from our modern houses. Greek houses were usually made of both mud and stone while our houses were made from a variety of materials such as metal, wood and drywall. A rich person usually had a two-story building and a shop if it was necessary. Another thing that a rich person had was 8-15 rooms in their house. A middle class person would usually have 4-7 rooms in their house. Rich people had a room for every member in their family and middle class people had their whole family to sleep in one or two rooms. People always had a courtyard in each house no matter how big it was. The men’s dining room was treated better than any other room in the household and it was the biggest. The storage room was the smallest where pottery was usually stored.</p>
