<li><b>Keep</b>. One, they're part of a series of articles on the season (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a>). Two - in my opinion they're notable, they've got four-figure crowds watching them live - plus a number of people watching on TV.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As Sam says, these are part of a series of articles on the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> - and the series (taken as a whole) is about a notable subject.

<li>I was not aware that these were part of a series, but I remain uncomfortable with the idea of having articles on individual athletic contests - there over 1,200 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> games and over 2,400 <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">MLB</a> games every year (many of which have significant attendance or a large TV audience), and I am wondering how this does not justify individual articles for each of those games. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 28, 2005 22:00 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia articles are not news reports</a>, which these articles ("This was a game of two batsmen.", "Warwickshire crumbled in a woeful heap for 153") blatantly are. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> June 29, 2005 21:17 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having just today returned to WP, I am disappointed to see this attempt to destroy days and days worth of hard work just because BD2412 feels uncomfortable. There's no doubt that Sam and I are good constructive WP users trying to create a section of WP that will be useful to many in many years to come. I trust other WPians will not wish to see all that work destroyed on a whim, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 28 June 2005 22:03 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You appear to be lost and wandering the hallways of the wrong project. The Cricket section of the newspaper, where news reports on Cricket matches belong, is <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Cricket" class="extiw" title="wikinews:Category:Cricket">over there</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> June 29, 2005 21:17 (UTC)</li>
<li>To be honest, and although I have contributed several articles to the 2005 English cricket season series myself, I think BD2412 is right to feel uncomfortable. These articles are not especially notable on their own. They are notable as part of the series we have been constructing, which is why they should remain where they were before User:Bryan_Derksen's tampering. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 28 June 2005 22:12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't "tampering", <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpages_22af.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpages">Wikipedia:Subpages</a> is quite clear that the use of subpages in the article namespace is frowned on and I raised the issue in <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_English_cricket_season_311c.html#Subpages" title="Talk:2005 English cricket season">Talk:2005 English cricket season#Subpages</a> first with plenty of time for objections to be raised. The only one was that these pages might wind up on VfD, as it turns out they have, and my response is that if the articles are deleteworthy it hardly matters what title they're under; using subpages to "hide" articles from facing VfD is not a valid usage IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 29 June 2005 01:00 (UTC)</li>
<li>There were clear objections from us when you raised the issue three weeks ago there, and also when you tried again on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Village pump (policy)</a>. It looks to me that most people would be happy for these 'articles' to be merged, <b>which is exactly what we were doing with the transcluded subpages</b>. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 29 June 2005 10:24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I have already pointed out elsewhere (including on my talk page where you left a note about this specific point), <b>I consider the transclusion issue to be completely separate from the subpages issue.</b> The subpage policy is IMO quite clear, the transclusion one is not, so it was the transclusion issue that I raised on the village pump. I wasn't "trying again", I was addressing something else entirely. And I even said this explicitly at the time in <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_English_cricket_season_311c.html#Subpages" title="Talk:2005 English cricket season">Talk:2005 English cricket season#Subpages</a>. What else do you need to clarify this? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 29 June 2005 23:47 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry that this nomination upsets those who have worked on these articles, but I assure you that I never nominate articles for deletion on a whim, nor am I attempting to destroy anyone's hard work. I have no objection to the preservation of the information if the articles are merged, I simply do not feel that individual matches are sufficiently notable to merit articles. The nomination alone will have <i>no</i> effect on these articles unless a significant majority of the voters in this vfd so decide. If there is a consensus to merge, I will gladly help with that process. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 29, 2005 00:53 (UTC)

<li>How would you feel if these articles were moved back to the subpages they originally were at? --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 29 June 2005 10:24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no objection to that, and I see nothing wrong with having subpages of major articles - Wikipedia should be that flexible. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 29, 2005 13:23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FWIW, I'd like them to be at subpages as well, I don't think they are substantial enough to stand alone in the main articlespace. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 29 June 2005 13:50 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but move back to subpages</b>, These were originally subpages of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> from where they were transcluded into articles (indeed, they don't make much sense out of the context of those articles). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">User:Bryan_Derksen</a> has taken it upon himself to unilaterally move them into the main articlespace with no discussion or consensus. I have asked him to clarify why he did this but have as yet received no response. Our intention at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cricket_255e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket">the Cricket WikiProject</a> has been to have these subpages transcluded into the various articles under <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> (<a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_9870.html" title="Durham County Cricket Club in 2005">Durham County Cricket Club in 2005</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_4f3a.html" title="Essex County Cricket Club in 2005">Essex County Cricket Club in 2005</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladeshis_in_England_in_2005_ddc3.html" title="Bangladeshis in England in 2005">Bangladeshis in England in 2005</a>, etc.) as part of the ongoing process of writing complete articles.

<li>That was because of the conclusion apparently reached here, <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ETemplate_namespace_7c1c.html#Any_discussion_still_ongoing.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Template namespace">Wikipedia_talk:Template_namespace#Any_discussion_still_ongoing.3F</a> and that no one objected to it at the time <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 28 June 2005 22:13 (UTC)

<li>I must say I would have objected, if he'd stated that in the same place as the discussion of it was going on in the first place (<a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Village pump (policy)</a>). I have desperately tried not to assume bad faith with this user but his sustained attacks on our efforts to improve Wikipedia's cricket coverage are becoming very wearing. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 28 June 2005 22:17 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I drew the conclusion based on lack of objection or further discussion at <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_English_cricket_season_311c.html#Subpages" title="Talk:2005 English cricket season">Talk:2005_English_cricket_season#Subpages</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> into one article, if not the main <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> article itself. Having information about each match in a season is fine, but having each separate match in its own article is a bit over the top. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 28 June 2005 22:22 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is that each match account is transcluded into several articles (for instance, a report of a match between <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_County_Cricket_Club_aa47.html" title="Durham County Cricket Club">Durham County Cricket Club</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club_0fc2.html" title="Derbyshire County Cricket Club">Derbyshire County Cricket Club</a> might be transcluded into <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frizzell_County_Championship_Division_Two_in_2005_14e7.html" title="Frizzell County Championship Division Two in 2005">Frizzell County Championship Division Two in 2005</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_9870.html" title="Durham County Cricket Club in 2005">Durham County Cricket Club in 2005</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_bd6e.html" title="Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 2005">Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 2005</a>. Our intention is ultimately to produce reviews of the season targetted to each competition and competing club. (But I agree that each match having its own article is over-the-top, which is why we had got them in subpages of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a> until the season is concluded and each season-review article can be finished off.) --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 28 June 2005 22:24 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b> - it <i>is</i> possible to link to a specific section within a larger article, which would have essentially the same effect. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 29, 2005 01:18 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It wouldn't have quite the same effect. At the moment what we have is the account of the game between Team X and Team Y in the Z Cup transcluded into an article on Team X's season, an article on Team Y's season, and an article on this year's Z Cup. (You can see this in action from the various articles linked off to from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_eb85.html" title="2005 English cricket season">2005 English cricket season</a>.) A merged article '2005 English cricket season' containing all these match reports (note that there are more than mentioned here) would be very confusing and certainly breach Wikipedia's guidelines on article length. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 29 June 2005 10:29 (UTC)

<li>That still doesn't help, all we can do then is link, not transclude. I realise that transclusion isn't a very neat way of forming articles, but it is less time-consuming for us as editors than writing individual bits from each point of view (both sides, the league in which it belongs, plus the season page) after every game - rather than doing the entire rewrite when the season is over. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 29 June 2005 13:50 (UTC)</li>

Also, South Asia&#160;!= the UK, and these articles are on UK matches. And I'm not debating the relative popularities of sports; no other sport that I know of, regardless of popularity, would get information about individual regular-season matches included on this site. I've looked at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>, several <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> teams, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a>, and other sports articles.

<li>That really <i>wasn't</i> a personal attack, just a choice of phrasing. You make some good points (and some bad ones: the knowledge of your 'American friends' certainly isn't one of my criteria for what should go into Wikipedia!) but I won't attempt to answer them here because as I say above this isn't really the place. (I will happily respond on my Talk if you want!) I really think the reason other sports don't have this coverage is because Wikipedians haven't tried. I (and other participants in the WikiProject) believe this is a fantastic asset to Wikipedia's cricket coverage: it's something that's not available anywhere else, and when the season is over and we get the various articles finished it will be the only place people can come to look if they want detailed accounts of a club's performance through a season. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 29 June 2005 10:34 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sports reference books such as Wisden give articles similar to these, too, and they're published six months after the event - suggesting that they're not ephemeral. Plus, these articles are only there to act as "feeder" articles for the bigger picture articles (which is why people have argued they should be subpages). No newspaper would publish a detailed review of the entire season for each team, which is what we intend to do. Temporarily, we at WikiProject Cricket feel this is the best solution until the "final" update is written some time in October. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 29 June 2005 22:13 (UTC)</li>

Wikinews is the newspaper (and takes all of the match reports you can give). Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia.</i> — <b>okay, let's have a look</b> — <i>News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project Wikinews does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, <b>and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known</b>. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples.</i> To my eye the exclusion refers to breaking news, rather than newsworthy events, a distinction which I think applies here, and makes the issue one of notability and context. These articles should be looked at in the proper context of their transclusion, and then the issue of notability should be applied. I would argue that an article on the County cricket season is notable, and since these articles are intended to be a part of that article, rather than standalone articles, I think they are notable and should be kept. I think perhaps this VfD should be set aside and the issue of the use of transclusion in this way should be put forward as a policy suggestion. This VfD seems to be something of a red herring, and not the debate we should be having. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 30 June 2005 07:32 (UTC)</li>

<li>A very very small number have some primary source material.

Most of the material I wrote is a mixture from Cricinfo, the BBC and The Times, with occasionally other sources coming in too - such as the county websites. You'd have to ask other contributors what their sources are, but as the major contributor is in Norway, my guess is that he isn't a primary source either (unless he has an awful lot of airmiles:) ). What we are doing here is writing something better than Wisden, produced much more quickly, and ultimately covering all Test nations, not just being English-based.

<p><i>I have moved the ongoing back-and-forth between <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> to this vfd's talk page, in order to maintain the readability of this VfD. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 30, 2005 16:19 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Allow me to restate the question on <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a>'s behalf: <b>Would those who have voted 'merge' in this VfD please clarify whether they would be satisfied if this was accomplished via transclusion of subpages?</b> --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 30, 2005 00:37 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>We've always said that the transclusion is a temporary measure until the season is over, when there will be an opportunity to fully copyedit and amend the articles in the light of how the season ended up. At that point (probably at the end of October), the articles will be "subst"'d into the main articles. Transclusion is a necessary tool whilst the articles are being constructed, otherwise it would just take prohibitively long to create them. Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 30 June 2005 05:40 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Incidentally, an example of this kind of work being done 'the other way' is at <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_English_cricket_team_in_the_2000s_9409.html" title="User:Ngb/English cricket team in the 2000s">User:Ngb/English cricket team in the 2000s</a>. As you can see, it's taking forever. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 30 June 2005 10:37 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just said above that I think this VfD is a bit of a red herring distracting us from the real issue, and that this VfD should be set aside for the moment and the matter of the usage of transclusion in the way it <i>was</i> being used to present these articles put forward as a policy suggestion, if it is currently frowned upon, since that seems to be the issue worthy of greater discussion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 30 June 2005 07:45 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also just noted that, according to the previous discussion at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Unusual transclusion issue not covered by policy</a>, there is <i>no policy against this transclusion</i>. Therefore, this matter should be decided before this VfD is continued with. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 30 June 2005 07:58 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would definitely support continuing discussion on the transclusion issue to some sort of conclusion. It doesn't look like this VfD is going to result in a "delete", though, so I don't think it's going to interfere one way or the other with that discussion. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 30 June 2005 16:00 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, I should also mention that there's a thread on this topic at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ETemplate_namespace_7c1c.html#transcluding_prose" title="Wikipedia talk:Template namespace">Wikipedia talk:Template namespace#transcluding prose</a> as well. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 30 June 2005 16:06 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>There is a policy against this, actually. You're not supposed to use templates to masquerade as article content. That these templates reside in mainspace rather than template space is irrelevant. Also, transclusion is increasing server load, increasing page redundancy, and making it harder for newbies to edit. Bad thing. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 1, 2005 10:18 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you link to where this policy is? I did a bit of hunting around through template-related policy pages before going to the village pump and couldn't find anything specifically about this, I will be embarassed if it slipped under my nose all this time.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 3 July 2005 10:04 (UTC)

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikinews. Match reports aren't encyclopaedic. Accounts of matches are news, not encyclopaedic content. Short summaries could easily be merged also. That said, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_One_17d2.html" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> has an article for every race. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 4 July 2005 21:59 (UTC)</li>

<li>Are you saying that articles like <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_English_cricket_team_in_the_2000s_9409.html" title="User:Ngb/English cricket team in the 2000s">this one</a> should be transwikied to Wikinews?

<ul>
<li>No, since an article like that combines a large number of events from the past. But for current events and all future cricket match reports, I think Wikinews is the best place (it would be nice if all the cricket reports on Wikinews were combined into a format like that.)<br />
What's more, I don't think that subpage's content is encyclopedic, but since it isn't in the main namespace, it isn't harming anyone. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a><a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_I_ate_my_cat_a1df.html" title="User:Ardonik/I ate my cat"><sup>*</sup></a> July 7, 2005 17:56 (UTC)</li>
