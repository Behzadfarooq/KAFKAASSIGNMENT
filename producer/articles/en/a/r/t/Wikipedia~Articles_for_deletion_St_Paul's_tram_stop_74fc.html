<p>Tram stops are, well, tram stops. Except when they happen to be a station they are generally indistinguishable from bus stops. Unless there is something notable about a particular tram stop I don't see the point or need for an article especially since all the information is already in the main article <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Metro_15dc.html" title="Midland Metro">Midland Metro</a>. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a travel guide</a>. This is a multinomination for deletion of all tram stop articles in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category%7EMidland_Metro_stops_ee51.html" title="Category:Midland Metro stops">Category:Midland Metro stops</a> excepting, of course, the stations (Snow Hill, Jewellery Quarter and Hawthornes). <b>Delete all</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:15, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as this is a one-liner article with no content which is not already clear from the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Metro_15dc.html" title="Midland Metro">article on the tram line</a>. However, I don't think tram stops are generally not-notable <i>par se</i>. They are more permanent fixtures than bus stops are, and I feel they lie between bus stops (usually deleted) and subway stations (almost always kept) in terms of notability and I feel that stations on light rail systems with separate tracks away from the streets have more in common with with subway stations than bus stops. My delete is without prejudice an article with some more description. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually it appears that the Midland Metro acts more like a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_rail.html" title="Light rail">light rail</a> system, which normally has fixed stops, than a traditional tram. Most of the tram articles seem to have been created in October/November 2005, and have not been updated significantly since. I hope the articles can be expanded in some way, but after this time I'm not sure someone will step up to do it. <s>That said, I'm neutral on this matter.</s> <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 07:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>After reading the arguments below, I will give in to the benefit of the doubt and say <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created these with intention of expanding them into decent sized articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the Midland Metro was once the former <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> Birmingham-Wolverhampton railway line, I would imagine that several of the stops (being built on former railway station sites) will have some history, which could be incorporated into the articles. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOur_Phellap_7982.html" title="User:Our Phellap">Our Phellap</a> 13:34, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to say I agree with the above comments (by Tinlinkin and Sjakkalle) that the Midland Metro stops are notable. They have more in common with the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands_Light_Railway_3383.html" title="Docklands Light Railway">Docklands Light Railway</a> stations than they do bus stops, and all the DLR stations have articles. It might also get confusing if too much information is incorporated into the main <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Metro_15dc.html" title="Midland Metro">Midland Metro</a>. I would suggest a sensible course of action would to be to wait. If Erebus555 is indeed wanting to expand the articles, perhaps they should be given the chance to do so. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOur_Phellap_7982.html" title="User:Our Phellap">Our Phellap</a> 17:00, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I spotted these some time ago and we have been waiting for 10 months. If the creator was going to do something substantail he would have done it by now. There seems no danger of too much information; there is virually nothing. If something notable of such length appears that it would overbalance the main article then a separate article could be recreated. The one stop on the site of a former station is <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wednesbury_Great_Western_Street_tram_stop_1dd5.html" title="Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop">Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop</a> and there could be an argument for keeping that one. However, the question is why keep them? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is quite clear - just because they exist is not enough to jusfy an article. This is /policy/ and says <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia</i>. What is needed is a good reason for separate articles; remembering all the encyclopaedic info is already in the main article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This Afd is part of a general anti-piblic transportation slant on Wikipedia. The article is not hurting anyone, and non-notability seems a bit harsh. This appears to be a type of LRT where the stations are "real stations" as opposed to "stops". Just because this happens to be a stub now does not mean that it is not of value to people. I think a lot of people just wish to delete for the sake of deleting. I will point out Wikipedia is not paper. As such there is limitless space for articles. If articles are not used that much, they will not slow down servers. This article appears to meet the LRT guideline, as a "real station" so why not keep it? What are you saving by not including it, except preventing greater access to information about public transportation? <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 19:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "except preventing greater access to information about public transportation" is simply untrue. No information is being deleted that is not in the main article. I am arguing that there is no need for 21 articles where 1 would do a better job. It is easier for the reader to find information in 1 place than clicking on 21 articles. /If/ so much encyclopaedic information is gathered on these stops that the main article becomes unbalanced then it can be broken out - initially into a Midland Metro: Tram stops article - that is normal editing practice. "What are you saving by not including it" - you are saving people's time in providing the information they seek in a more accessible form. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep all</b> - <b>light rail</b> stations like on the DLR are notable; this is one of them; not a street tram (whose stations would not be notable). This article has a template which is connected in with the British Rail system anyway; to get rid of it leaves platforms on interchange stations which are unexplained by a neighbouring stations box. It makes sense to keep this article. Leave them alone. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 06:37, 30 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
