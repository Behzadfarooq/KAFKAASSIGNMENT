<p><i><b>Gundam Seed: Rengou Vs. Z.A.F.T. Portable</b></i> Namco Bandai has officially announced they have come with a new Gundam game for Sony’s portable platform; PSP. The game is Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. Portable (quite tetchy). As the game title is same as of PS2 version, the ingame content is almost the same, as well.</p>
<p>As the name of the game obviously suggests is a portable i.e. a miniature version of PS2 title. Most probably, the game will come with some diminutive changes in game content. But if we talk about the graphics, the game will inherit almost comparable quality.</p>
<p>The game is set for launch on PSP on April 5th, 2007.</p>

<b>Shoo Sticks are double-sided transparent silicone fashion sticks, designed for sling backs, strappy sandals and mules, but can be used on any shoes or clothing.</b></p>
<p>They prevents shoes cutting into all areas of the foot. It can be applied to the inside of the shoe to create padding to prevent rubbing and help prevent blisters. Shoo Sticks are made from very high quality silicone – gentle and safe for human contact and will move with the skin, clothes and shoes. They will hold women’s shoes in place for up to 12 hours, also when walking quickly or dancing. The movement is eliminated not only reduced Designed to wear with bare feet or fine denier stockings and tights, they are for all round use.</p>
<p>Shoo Sticks have a different strength of stickiness on each side:</p>
<p><b>Side 1</b> – the stickier side attaches to your shoes (or your body when using with clothes)</p>
<p><b>Side 2</b> – the less sticky side attaches to your feet (or to fabric)</p>
<p>Shoo Sticks can be re-adjusted once applied and will not be ruined if it comes in contact with itself. Additionally they can be doubled up, with two stuck together for a more cushioning effect and will stay firmly in place. Shoo Sticks come in a handy re-usable tube that won’t get squashed in the handbag.</p>

<p>Faust is the name of the hamlet of 400 people that has been my home since 1966. In 1914, an engineer working on the railroad track that came through somehow left his family name here.</p>
<p>AKO CHI GUNNA TEKAYA TOH An Oral History</p>
<pre>
            Marie Courtoreille (nee Wichihiwesis, or Walker) lost her life in a fire at her home in Faust in 1982. She was 101. At over a century in age she had no trouble threading a needle, still had her own teeth, and needed no glasses. Marie Witchihiwesis was born on the shore of Lesser Slave Lake just west of the mouth of Old Man Creek on a day in May, 1881. Her father Henry Witchihiwesis and mother Nancy Giroux had her baptised in 1883 at the parish mission of St. Bernard at Lesser Slave Lake settlement. At 18 she married Alexander Courtoreille, stayed along the lakeshore, and in her own words, "lived on fish and meat." It is from her family that the earliest oral history of the community dates.
            Local tradition has it that the Native people used the location at Giroux Bay as a fishing camp where the year's supply of fish was strung on poles in the sun for drying. The place may well have been called (as tradition has it): Ako chi gunna ("that which is hung") Tekaya toh ("where it takes place"): The Place Where They Hang The Fish.
</pre>
<p>After the immigrant settlers arrived, many of the Native people continued traditional modes of livelihood such as trapping, hunting, and fishing, while also working for homestead farmers, loggers, in sawmills, and for mink and fox ranchers.</p>
<pre>
            Dolphus Walker was born in 1903. His life's experience may be typical. Walker went to a mission school for eight years and at age seventeen trapped rats, squirrels, and weasels at Driftpi1e. "Years ago, only oldtimers trapped. Young fellows, they don't care for trapping. No white people trapped, just the Indians. But now there is a lot of trappers. There used to be everything years ago: lots of foxes, coyotes, lynx, lots of marten, minks, everything, years ago." His trapline was about fifteen kilometers long and five kilometers wide. Walker made a good living trapping: "Before, you used to make a lot of money, but not now." He sold his trapline and moved to Faust where he also worked in the fisheries, logging, and "tried a little bit of farming."
            Merton Carl died in 1984 in his house at Faust, aged 87. His was among the first families of immigrant settlers on a homestead taken by his stepfather in 1913. "We came in 1914," he told. The railroad took then seventeen-year old Merton to Mitsue, then by boat to Sawridge, and by wagon to Old Man Creek. "An old man lived there and died," he said. There was just one other family in 1914, Carl said: "Whitford ~ a family of breeds, the mother knew the old man (the creek was named after)."
            A walk to Kinuso was needed to find two stores and a post office. From Kinuso, there was a road to Strawberry Creek; from there, a wagon-trail along the lakeshore wound its way to Faust, Driftpile, and on to Grouard. In 1914, an engineer working on the railroad track that came through somehow left his name here, and within a few decades Faust became a hub for the activities along the south shore of Lesser Slave Lake. In 1928, a public school opened. Numerous fox and mink ranches gave the community a peculiar odor at pelting time; the pelts made the area among the foremost in the world in producing high quality furs. Mink ranchers took their annual produce to the auction markets of eastern Canada and Europe to return with large amounts of cash. To feed the fur-bearing animals, they fished the lake for "herring" (tullibee). Commercial fisheries also were a major economic activity. During Faust's years of greatest achievement in terms of economic importance, there were four fish-packing plants located in the community: Menzies, UFF (United Fishermen of Faust), Gateway, and Inland. At the same time, the harvest of timber made the forest a busy place with logging camps and portable mills, while in the community there were located two sawmills, a planer mill, and a pole-yard that produced treated railroad ties and utility poles. During its height, Faust may have had a population of well over 1,000. It was such a busy place that the local general store was open seven days each week and twenty-four hours per day. Three hotels were located here, and at least four stores.

<p>khoshdash is an expresion that was used to describe the fraternal relationship between mamluk soldiers. this relationship was the equivalent of a blood relation, tying these soldiers to their bretheren. the concept is very similar to fraternity in greek organizationts, free masons, and other social organizations advocating close ties between its' members. the origins of the word are unknown, possibly originated from the asian stepps, where most of the mamluks were born. this word is not commonly used in the arabic language, and has no equivalent in the english language.</p>

<p>ClassicShaving.com was established in response to the current worldwide rediscovery of and increased interest in classic traditional wet shaving methods and products Men the world over are searching for alternatives to the mass produced, commercially available, drugstore quality products that until now have been the only things available. The reasons why are as diverse as the personalities of the men, but one thing is very clear - Many are dissatisfied and want better.</p>
<p>For some it is the ever-increasing cost of today's modern multi-blade razor blade cartridges, for others the generally poor performance and resulting poor shave quality. Still others are looking for a way to express their individuality, enhance the shaving experience, or preserve a lost art. Whether you fall into one of these groups or have your own reasons - ClassicShaving.com has products tailored to mens needs.</p>
<pre>
The management and staff of ClassicShaving.com are committed wet shavers and straight razor users and have been for over 35 years.

<p>Born on the 11th December 1988, Karl Hopkins is now a famous and ever popular British Artist. He was born and raised in Bristol, and had always shown a flair for the arts. He tried to pursue a swimming career and made county before illness struck him and his lungs collapsed leaving him critical in hospital. After this Karl became a very inward and focused person. Being ostracized at secondary school made him work further on his arts, (now his only true retreat). At the beginning of his art career he was promoted to perfect his works. By the end of secondary school Karl had featured in many exhibitions, and left for University in Oxford to study Architecture. Through his Architecture degree he harboured doubts as to his career choice and quickly left for the arts. It seems like he made the right move, as now he is promoted as following in the steps of Damien Hirst and other greats. His mediums vary greatly but a majority of his works can be found in graphite. His pieces vary from portraits, to landscapes, and his most famous current piece being a copy of the work of Leonardo Da Vinci.</p>
<p>His works have been displayed in the Tate among others. Working on a commission basis Karl has found living comfortable, but a struggle at times. He is currently in talks with the Saatchi Gallery about an up and coming exhibition.</p>

<p>The First Satanic Church of Sydney, is a non-profit organisation founded on the 29th of October, 2006 by Matthew Leigh Schnider. The organisation is Australian-based, and remains the only Australian Satanic organisation, in operation. The organisation, is based on the right for religious freedom. The organisation, has (since it's foundation in 2006) been fighting for the freedom of religion.</p>
<p>Most of the members, that are present in the First Satanic Church of Sydney, are LaVeyan or Symbolic Satanists. However, the organisation does endorse members of seperate religions (i.e; Christian, etc.) The organisation is not biased, and does not discriminate against any religion.</p>
<p>Many rumours have surfaced about the organisation, including; vandalism, ritual abuse, molestation, and sacrificial slayings. However, the group has denied this claim on many occasions, and in late Febuary 2007, the High Priest, Matthew L. Schnider came forward in an interview inviting the local media to attend one of its rituals. No evidence has proven that the organisation has anything to do with the accusations.</p>
<p>The group was originally known as "The Satanic Resurrection" or "TSR" but after complaints were made regarding the groups name, they successfully changed their name to "The First Satanic Church of Sydney." The group originally started out, as an off-line organisation, but with the release of their website in early 2007, the group had successfully moved to on-line aswel as off-line.</p>
<p>Former members have come out complaining of the leadership of the High Priest, Matthew L. Schnider but were quickly discouraged. The members were quick to defend his credibility. When the group was formerly known as "The Satanic Resurrection" former members (who first contributed to the building of the organisation "The Satanic Resurrection") an arguement, and differences of opinion took their toll, and Schnider left the group.</p>
<p>Rumours have also surfaced regarding the number of members within the organisation. Their German Administrative Office came forward, and announced, that no-such information you would ever be handed out to the public, or even its own members. As their website clearly states, that no personally identifiable information will ever be released. Including the number of Active and Registered members. The total of members, is estimated to be in the 3,000 mark.</p>
<p>In Febuary 2007, the group officially released its United States Headquarters, in Arizona. The Headquarters (also known as a Grotto) was granted a Grotto Master, Magister Zach Marshall, to be its main Administrative Officer and Agent. In the same month of 2007, the group also officially released its German Headquarters in Berlin, Germany. The Grotto Master was and still remains Magister Mitchell Bernasconi.</p>
<p>The main objective of the First Satanic Church of Sydney, is fighting for the right of religious freedom in Australia, and world-wide. They say:"Religion controls everything, the Media, War, Politics, etc." They are having a good impact on Australia. And have been recognised as one of the most successful religious organisations within Australia--not directly with involvment with the Anglican Church, Christian Churches, amoung others.</p>
<p>Ordainment order for the First Satanic Church of Sydney, is much like that of the Church of Satan.</p>
<p><b>First Degree</b> - Reverend/Reverend<br />
<b>Second Degree</b> - Warlock/Witch<br />
<b>Third Degree</b> - Priest/Priestess<br />
<b>Fourth Degree</b> - Magister/Magistra<br />
<b>Fifth Degree</b> - Magus/Maga<br /></p>
<p>Unlike the Church of Satan, the First Satanic Church of Sydney's ordainment in First Degree, does not require them to be entered into the Priesthood of Satan. Thus, they can be recognised as Reverend.</p>

<p>Magrudergrind are a 3-piece <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a>/<a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerviolence.html" title="Powerviolence">powerviolence</a> band from Washington, DC. Formed in 2003 with nothing but a drummer, guitarist and vocalist, Magrudergrind have been able to release many splits 7" records, and full-length albums on several record labels from around the world. Magrudergrind are quickly becoming one of the most important Grindcore bands from the USA and are breaking ground with taking extreme music to a new level with some of the most intense high-pitch grind vocals, and some of the fastest drumming and guitaring in todays Grindcore scene. Some of Magrudergrinds bigger accomplishments up to date are being featured 2 years in a row at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_Deathfest_6d82.html" title="Maryland Deathfest">Maryland Deathfest</a>, appearing at the Bloodshed Grind Fest in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and endless touring of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> with bands like <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misery_Index_b75e.html" title="Misery Index">Misery Index</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Downfall_d84e.html" title="World Downfall">World Downfall</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/h/Unholy_Grave_2e3b.html" title="Unholy Grave">Unholy Grave</a>, Sanitys Dawn and Yacopsae.</p>
<p>Most of Magrudergrind's early albums are long out of print and were printed in very limited numbers (for example, their first LP "Dont Support Humanitary Aid thats Led by the Church" sold out in a matter of weeks during their 2003 summer tour). Due to the importance of Magrudergrind nowadays, all their newer releases have been signed with important underground labels such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotic_Empire_ad41.html" title="Robotic Empire">Robotic Empire</a> and Six Weeks records and have been released in huge amounts.</p>

<p>I have seen this man fight on a number of occasions myself. I have no idea if he's famous or unknown but he's real. The man Must be about 5'8" shaven head a tattoo on one of his arms and not a big grock at all. He always had a nasty look in his eye. for example Two of my friends Rajvir and Satpal singh found out about him the hard way. There was said to be a complication inside a 'asian' club and the psycho doorman fought both of them on his own in a car park behind the bar in the dark both being much bigger than him. They called a friend of theres whos supposed to be quite tuff. A foreign man from france. He ended up in a coma for a whole month(this was all in the space of twenty minutes).And its not like this happened once everytime i went to that bar on a saturday it was guaranteed to be littered with people on the floor or blood leaking out of them somewhere.i have also seen this guy (the door man) fight for money in amounts as small as £20.00 (i think all i could see was one note) behind a bar which was called the Tube. I used to work at the tube so i seen the fight with my own eyes. After watching him fight i decided to research the guy a bit.Hes apparently from the alum rock and lives now in dudley. a lot of people have said the man is extremely bad tempered but others that he is a fair man? Does a fair man break a Mans jaw bone and then repeatedly stamp on his face? or Punch some ones head through a table and repeatedly beat them with the leg from the table? Does a fair man break you nose and teeth for finishing your drink a little too slow? Does a fair man walk up to a customer and smash a pint glass in his face? does a fair man fight for twenty pound, and then take the guys phone and credit cards too? As much as i hate this man (as he broke my teeth and nose) i felt it was only fair to document this two year spree of violence and fist fighting by a man not big not muscle bound just a man who i think either is not scared or just does not care because as evil and dangerous as the man is its amazing to see not just him but other people like this take out in a matter of seconds a group of people or a man mountain. i witnessed not only the two of many events i have listed above but many more with my own eyes as did many other people.</p>

<p>The CBU-87 combined effect munitions cluster bomb is a bomb used by the United States Air force. It was developed by Aerojet General/Honeywell. In 1986 the bomb was introduced to replace the earlier cluster bombs used in the Vietnam War. A cluster bomb is a bomb that when dropped, makes many little explosions covering a larger area then a typical bomb would cover. The bomb is not necessarily used for precision, but for destroying multiple targets at once or making sure something gets hit along with the outer perimeter of the target getting hit as well. The list price is set at $14,000 per bomb. The bomb is designed to be dropped by plane at any altitude and any air speed. It is a free falling bomb and relies on the aircraft to aim it before it drops. Once it is dropped, it needs no farther instruction. The bomb can be dropped by a variety of modern day aircraft used today. It is 92 inches long and 15.6 inches in diameter. The whole bomb weighs 950 pounds. Inside the bomb, there are mini bombs that deploy before it hits the ground. Each bomb contains 202 armor piecing shaped charged bomblets. The dub rate for each bomb in about 5%. This means that of the 202 bomblets dropped, about 10 will not explode on impact. The bomblets are stored in a SUU-65B canister. While descending in the air, the bomb starts off spinning. After it gets to a certain altitude, the bomb with break open and drop mini bombs. When the bombs hit the ground, it will cover a large area and have separate explosions within that area. The CBU-87 can be adjusted so it can cover a wider area of land, or a small area. Depending on the rate of spin and the altitude at which the bomb opens, it can cover an area between 800x400 feet and 70x70 feet. Decreasing these adjustments causes a lower surface area to be hit. Increasing them allows a wider surface area to be hit. There are 6 speeds that can adjust the bombs rate of spin. The CBU-87 is fused with a FZU-39/B proximity sensor. The sensor has 12 time selections which tell when the bomb is to be dispensed and throw out the sub munitions. When the bomb opens up while falling, it breaks into three pieces not, not including the bomblets, and the bomblets fall out. The BLU-97/B is the sub munitions in the CBU-87. When the canister opens and the bomblets are released. When the bomblets fall, they are separate from the main bomb and independently free fall to the ground. They contain an inflatable bag on the top of them, which slows them down and spreads them out. As the bomblets descend, they experience g-forces. Once they reach a minimum of 6 Gs, they arm themselves. As the bomblets fall, they are also spinning as well. Arming takes about 2.6 seconds. They have a charge attached to the front of them that is effective against hard and soft targets. It is very effective against and mainly used for anti personnel, anti material, shaped charge fragmentations and anti armory.</p>

<p>Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam is the latest mobile suit game from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandai.html" title="Bandai">Bandai</a>. It is for use on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_2.html" title="Playstation 2">Playstation 2</a> console. It is Up to two players with the option of adding two additional computer controlled opponents or allies.</p>
<p>The Mobile suits were originally created for construction on space colonies but then were fitted with machine guns, cannons missiles, and other weapons for combat. In the game you will pilot various Gundam suits in large scale stages. Instead of the traditional one-on-one combat style, that normally accompanies these kinds of stages, you can fight two or three opponents at once in a <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melee.html" title="Melee">melee</a> style of fighting.</p>
<p>You are also able to jump and hover for a short period of time until your boost gauge is depleted. Both the boost gauge and the ammo gauge are replenished over time as you continue fighting. This particular game also features an “awakening” system which acts much like an overdrive function. This can be activated once a special meter is filled. One of three awakening types can be chosen before each battle. The three types of awakenings are attack, recovery, and mobility. When piloting the gundam you can lock on to targets and switch among targets as well. Battle ends when one team’s power gauge is depleted.</p>
<p>There are five modes of gameplay: arcade, versus, universal century mode, survival, and training mode. Arcade and survival mode are similar to just about any other fighting game. Arcade can be played cooperatively with other players or against them. Versus mode allows you to fight in two teams in any combination of up to two players and two computer controlled suits. Universal mode is a more in-depth single player mode. This mode also allows you to play through Gundam history as part of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Earth_Union_Group_9bf6.html" title="Anti-Earth Union Group">Anti-Earth Union Group</a>, the Titans, or the Axis. You can follow many different pilots throughout Gundam history and your performance in each battle can alter the outcome of Gundam history. As you continue in gameplay you earn points which allow you to upgrade your Gundam suit. There is also the option of using points to unlock gallery bonuses. Gallery bonuses include mobile suits, illustrations, and movies.</p>

<p>Two competitors stand on opposite corners of a room or other open space (such as a front yard). A referee stands in between them, counts to three, and then drops a hat, preferable one which the involved parties would not mind being wrecked. When the hat hits the ground, the two competitors run towards the hat and attempt to grab the hat. The object is for each competitor to stand erect for five seconds with the hat firmly on his or her head. If a competitor accomplishes this, he or she wins the match. Punching, scratching, and biting are not allowed, but wrestling, grappling, and tackling are strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>Hatmatches can be held simply for entertainment purposes, or to settle a dispute. In the case of the latter, the winner of the Hatmatch is declared the winner of whatever argument or dispute preceded it. For example, if evening plans are in dispute between two people, one may challenge the other to a hatmatch to settle the argument. The winner of the Hatmatch is the winner of this dispute.</p>

Farid arrived in Canada in 1977 to much fanfare. In his short time as a Canadian, Farid has managed to sustain a successful career at the Fairmont Royal York.</p>
<p>Now living in Pickering, Farid is involved in numerous community events including the annual pumpkin festival, held every October. While in Pickering, Farid has had a run-in with a cashier at the UPS Store in the Amberlea Plaza. Farid wanted to send a letter to England only to find that it would have cost $54.98. Farid decided to send regular post for reasonable sum of 59 cents.</p>
<p>At work, Farid was trained by Siva Kamalendran. They now battle daily over such topics as limos and tour luggage handling. Siva is now a co-owner of MegaPro Designers, a kitchen and bath company.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Farid enjoys to retire to his home and settle down with a cool glass of orange Fanta.</p>
<p>See Farid daily Sundays 6:45-3:15pm, and Monday through Thursday 2:30-11pm at 100 Front St West, Toronto.</p>

<p>A ruddevator, is a control surface for aircraft, in which the rudders, and the elevator are joined in one. Perfect exaple for this is the Beechcraft V tail, Bonanza. This example shows the tail of the airplane in a V shape. If you should apply right rudder authority, both of the controls move right. If you should input a climb control, both surfaces will move "inward" producing a reduction in the lift coeficient on the tail and resulting a pitch up attitude. The opposite happens when you imput a decent control, the surfaces will move "outward" and increase the lift coeficient on the tail, producing a pitching down attitude.</p>
<p>Although reliable means of control, there are downsides to it. Some of them being, too much yawing tendency and unstable and unusual stall characterisitics.</p>

<p>Darnellia Russell is driven to raise her game and her daughter.</p>
<p>Her priorities include taking care of the basketball as well as taking care of a baby. And there's homework, too. It's a lot to balance for a high-school student.</p>
<p>There's as much diapering as dribbling. As many baby bottles as water bottles.</p>
<p>Yet Russell, 19, refuses to let go of her goals. She loves her 1-year-old daughter, Trekayla, but still has a passion for basketball and believes it can be the means to bettering both lives. The fifth-year senior playing for Roosevelt is determined to use her skills on the court to earn a college education.</p>
<p>For Russell, rebounding has taken on a whole new meaning. It's not just about a ball against a backboard. It's about a gifted young woman bouncing back from an unexpected pregnancy to fight to return to her high-school team and pursue her college dreams.</p>
<p>Those who know her believe success will be a slam dunk, with assists from her large support group.</p>
<p>"I don't have any doubt," said Roosevelt coach Bill Resler.</p>
<p>Back in March 2002, few doubted Russell's future in basketball. She was a 5-foot-6 guard full of jukes and jumpers. She led the Roughriders to fifth place at the Class 4A state tournament, capping a 25-2 season. Russell averaged 14.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and about six steals, four assists and three blocks as the only junior on the Star Times all-area team.</p>
<p>Then the girl with all the promise learned she was pregnant. Suddenly, Russell felt she was on a fast break to nowhere.</p>
<p>"I was mad," she said. "I just felt I kind of let everybody down."</p>
<p>Later, she felt the system let her down. Russell twice was denied athletic eligibility, most recently last month by the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association. She began to wonder if she would ever play high-school basketball again.</p>
<p>Tuesday, a King County Superior Court judge granted a temporary restraining order precluding the WIAA from enforcing its ruling pending a full hearing yet to be scheduled.</p>
<p>That set the stage for Russell's return to the court. She played her first high-school game in nearly two years last night in the sixth-ranked Roughriders' 73-45 victory over No. 13 Kent-Meridian.</p>
<p>While her daughter, mother and grandmother cheered her on, Russell made 10 of 13 shots and finished with 20 points, eight steals, six rebounds, five assists and two blocks in only 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Resler believes she is better than ever.</p>
<p>"She is substantially a better player," he said. "She's really astute, alert and mature on the court, and she's quicker than she used to be."</p>
<p>The journey, however, has been long and slow.</p>
<p>When Russell scored 14 points to help Roosevelt beat Snohomish for fifth place on the final day at the 4A state tournament in March of 2002, not even Russell knew she was pregnant.</p>
<p>She and her boyfriend, Secoy Clemmons, have dated since eighth grade. At times, she didn't have the energy to get up and go to school in May and June but didn't bother to find out why.</p>
<p>"I always wanted to sleep," Russell said.</p>
<p>Near the end of June, Darnellia took two home-pregnancy tests. Both were positive. A visit to a pediatrician confirmed that she was pregnant. The baby was due Nov. 17, about the time basketball turnouts were scheduled to begin.</p>
<p>The lives of both Russell and Clemmons, a junior at Ballard High School at the time, were turned upside down.</p>
<p>"I was happy, but at the same time I knew we weren't ready," Clemmons said.</p>
<p>Russell's mother, April Swafford, was angry and hurt, but she could relate. April was two weeks shy of her 15th birthday when she gave birth to Darnellia.</p>
<p>Members from both families agreed they would care for the baby while Russell attended Seattle's Marshall Alternative School and returned to basketball at Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Her teammates were supportive and threw Russell a baby shower.</p>
<p>"We were all behind her 100 percent," said Tracy Leddo, now a senior.</p>
<p>They planned to have Russell back by January, in time to make another playoff run.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Trekayla had her own timeline in mind. She was two weeks late and, after 15 hours of labor, Darnellia finally gave birth to her by Caesarean section Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Darnellia returned to the gym the first week of January in hopes of playing in the King Holiday Classic at KeyArena on Jan. 17 against Seattle Prep, the defending 3A state champion at the time. She logged the required 10 practices, then found out she was academically ineligible for the season based on her poor attendance the previous spring.</p>
<p>Angry and disappointed, Darnellia faced another decision: Get her GED and play basketball at a community college or return to high school, appeal for a fifth year of eligibility and pursue a scholarship to a four-year university.</p>
<p>It didn't take her long to make up her mind.</p>
<p>"I wanted my diploma," Russell said. "I want to go to a university."</p>
<p>Refocused, she began working harder in the classroom and currently carries a 3.6 grade-point average at Marshall, which offers a more flexible schedule than Roosevelt. Resler believed it would be "a no-brainer" for Russell to qualify for a hardship exception and gain a fifth year of eligibility through the WIAA.</p>
<p>He was wrong.</p>
<p>Russell's appeal was denied. In a letter to Darnellia, WIAA executive director Mike Colbrese said her decision to miss classes during May 2002 was within her control because at that time she did not realize she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Darnellia was frustrated and ready to fight the ruling.</p>
<p>"I was really stressed out because I didn't know if they were going to let me play," she said. "And I also thought the whole big ordeal was uncalled for."</p>
<p>So did attorney Kenyon Luce, who had battled the WIAA in court on a variety of eligibility cases. After talking to Resler and Russell, he agreed to take the case pro-bono — on one condition.</p>
<p>"She has to in her life help some young person with her ability, as I have helped her," Luce said.</p>
<p>There is no doubt how much Russell helps Roosevelt's playoff chances.</p>
<p>"She's an exceptional athlete," Garfield coach Joyce Walker said. "She's a great anticipator and she has the heart of a champion. When she's focused and driven, I don't know if there's anyone better."</p>
<p>Walker, who starred at Garfield in the 1970s and was an All-American at Louisiana State, believes Russell can succeed in college. Resler said he has been asked by several schools, including Washington State and Eastern Washington, about Russell's status.</p>
<p>"I imagine it's going to be like a forest fire now that she's playing," Resler said.</p>
<p>The fire still burns within Russell. Not only to be a great player but a great mom, and by all accounts, she is becoming both. Watch her at practice, and you'll get a dazzling behind-the-back dribble and no-look pass to a teammate. Watch her at home and you'll see a priceless peek-a-boo moment with her daughter.</p>
<p>Russell is the first to admit this isn't the way she would have mapped out her life. It was always basketball first, babies later. Now that she has both, she couldn't imagine doing without either one. Especially Trekayla.</p>
<p>"She's so sweet," Russell said. "I love talking to her and playing with her and reading to her. I love her a lot."</p>
<p>And, at long last, she loves being back on the basketball court</p>

<p>ZXBInstaller is to autoinstaller mainly in Spanish, developed by a community of users dedicated to modding of Xbox in which expert and usuary advanced in the subject they are dedicated to help to solve the doubts and to orient on how to tunnear the console.</p>
<p>[to publish] History</p>
<p>ZXBInstaller began like a proposal of Fernas, a participant of the old ZonaXbox.com community that it loved to create a new type of autoinstaller (program/commando that makes a neglected installation of applications) based on Slayer. Slayer, completely in English, was the first one to autoinstaller created and was the most used then. The new one autoinstaller would almost have like main characteristic the being in its totality in Spanish language, with a friendly interface and of easy handling, besides to contain the updated best applications more and, thus avoiding to install other that, in fact, were not indispensable for the Xbox.</p>
<p>After proposing its project in ZonaXbox.net and not obtaining much answer, Fernas ZXBInstaller becomes independent, creates taking as it bases the programming of Slayer and it begins to publish it by main means of distribution of information of the Internet, as they are programs P2P. Just a short time later it appeared the first Web of ZXBInstaller and the program went spreading throughout of the world, mainly in the countries of Hispanic speech.</p>
<p>[to publish] To Today</p>
<p>With an excellent Staff and than 30,000 members more registered, an enormous amount of active users and many daily registries, are the greatest community in Hispanic speech on the subject, with a friendly atmosphere in which it is possible to treat other subjects like computation, design, animates, purchases/internal sales, projects, aids, etc.</p>
<p>In a brief sense, ZXBInstaller is dedicated to help all those people who have doubts in diverse subjects, with the purpose of avoiding that they spend unnecessary money with third when them all the necessary information so that can be provided they themselves of reliable and totally gratuitous form make wonders with the Xbox.</p>

Christopher Del Negro Photography</p>
<p><br />
A Waltz With Light.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Christopher Del Negro, born December 1961, was raised outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey in the small town of Pomona. As a youngster, Christopher had a passion for excitement and danger. On many occasions he would come home bloody and broken from riding motocross or jumping out, over, or into something that disagreed with the human body.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Having survived adolescence, Christopher entered the United States Air Force in 1980 and was an Avionics Technician on B-52 bombers and KC-135 tanker aircraft. Christopher got out of the Service with an AS Degree in Electronics, and went on to earn a BS in Aeronautics and a commercial pilots license from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flying aerobatics became Christopher’s new passion, - danger and excitement of course.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Flying jobs in the late 1980’s were not great for those pilots who wore glasses. Christopher therefore followed in his father’s footsteps, becoming an FAA Air Traffic Controller. Christopher work two years at Key West control tower, fourteen years at Miami International, and is currently vectoring at Atlanta TRACON.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Today, Christopher and his beautiful wife Angela and new member of the family David Sebastian spend a lot time kayaking, biking, mountain climbing, riding motocross and enjoying life and family.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Christopher’s passion for life and beauty comes out in his photography, so log on and have a look.</p>

Ho’opili is a proposed master planned community in West Oahu, which could create thousands of much needed homes and jobs. Ho‘opili is planned to feature a traditional neighborhood design, which will create a healthy community where residents can live, work and play. It will also provide a significant number of affordable and competitively-priced homes in the area, to help alleviate Oahu’s housing shortage. Actual building is not expected to start until 2010.</p>

<p>Venetian Plaster is a decorative and highly specialized coating applied to walls with a steel trowel and resembles polished marble.The basic formulation is comprized of finley ground marble dust, aged slaked lime, water, with alkali-proof pigments added for color. The finish as it is known today was created by the renaissance era venetians wanting the look of polished marble without the weight of a slab or tile. Since much of venice was built on pilings, measures were taken during construction to reduce the overall weight of a building. So, to achieve the look of marble without the weight, highly skilled artisans troweled thin coats of pulverized marble dust plaster onto walls, compressing and burnishing the final coat by rubbing it forcefully with a polished edge steel trowel to give the surface depth and a high gloss. Artists would tint the plaster to match natural marble, and finish the surface with soap-wax for the deepest shine.The methods of application have changed little since the time of the renaissance, with the main differences being the advent of stainless steel trowels and electric drills for mixing the material, the process remains difficult and requires the skill of a highly trained individual to achieve the traditional appearance. It should be noted that true venetian plaster must come from the venetian region of Italy and contain at least 40% marble dust to be classified as marmorino to qualify it for use in historical preservation projects in the venetian region.</p>

<p>Stig Of The Dump is a hip hop artist from Newcastle Upon Tyne. He is currently working with Beer &amp; Rap Records and independant record lable which is also home to Dr Syntax &amp; Dj Newborn. Stig gained a reputation as a formidable battle mc in various video's available on the internet, including the legendary mauling of ex So Solid member Asher D, as well as performances in the first World 2on2 Battle Championships. He has since toured the country and visited Europe with Dr Syntax as "The Beer &amp; Rap Roadshow" and seen his debut release "The Homeless Microphonist EP" (which was written and recorded in just 7 days) become one of the fastest selling debuts in UK Hip Hop. Stig is one of the biggest new names in years and has a unique and adaptable style, notorious for his self deprocating humour and gutter mouth he is equally as skilled when it comes to consious/concept/story telling and punchline tracks. with his first full length LP "Mood Swings" and collaberations with US legends RA Tha Rugged Man, K Solo &amp; Canibus all in the works at the moment he is set to establish himself as a key player in not only the domestic UK but also International Hip Hop scene. Cited by none other than Robbie Williams in a Big Issue interview as being "fucking brilliant", Stig has a character and wicked sence of humour which could see him cross over to main stream chart success while still maintaining his underground integrity.</p>

<p>The brain is in constant need for glucose (sugar) to function normally. When a sudden fall in plasma glucose occurs, the brain is protected against low glucose levels through a number of mechanisms, including a decrease in insulin secretion and the release of hormones like glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol (ACTH) and growth hormone (Gerich et al., 1991; Mitrakou et al., 1991). Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, however, lose this ability to respond effectively to low glucose levels over time. Eventually, patients with frequent hypoglycemia may lose their ability to detect and protect against low glucose (hypoglycaemia) until they develop frank neuroglycopenia (insufficient glucose supply to the brain) leading to <b>hypoglycaemia unawareness</b>.</p>

<p>Camp Koldychevo - Koldyczewo in Polish - was first used as a forced labor camp in Belorussia established by the Nazis late in 1941. Later it became a notorious concentration camp for Russians and Poles who were interned along with Jews transferred from the surrounding ghettos of Baranovichi, Nowogrodek, Slonim, and others as can be seen from the well-documented link, "The Jewish history of Poland and Belorussia." Prior to the camp's liquidation on 29 June 1944, over 22,000 inmates were murdered and buried in 38 mass graves in and around the camp. An active Jewish resistance group, led by Shlomo Kushnir, existed within camp Koldychevo. On the night of 22 March 1944, he succeeded in leading almost all the Jewish inmates still alive out of the camp after first killing ten Nazi guards. Kushnir committed suicide when he and 25 others were recaptured by the Nazis. Others who managed to get away joined the partisans in the forests</p>

<p>Teri Horton is a retired truck driver who has thrust herself into high brow world of modern art by proclaiming to own a Jackson Pollock orginal painting. She found the painting in a thrift shop in San Bernadino California for which she paid the sum of $5. Upon finding out that the painting could indeed be a Jackson Pollock orginal and worth in the high millions, she set out to gain accredation from the art world. She soon found out that the high brow art world is doing everything to discredit her painting instead. However, Teri now armed with evidence in the form of a fingerprint found on the back of her paiting said to match that of one on a paint can from Jackson Pollock's Long Island studio, is on a quest to tell her story to the world. This quest in chronicled in the the documentary “Who the #$&amp;% Is Jackson Pollock?”.</p>

<p>Brigadier General William H. Jackson, one of the most prominent soldiers of Tennessee, was born at Paris, Tenn., October 7, 1835. At twenty-one years he was graduated at the United States military academy (1856), and assigned as brevet second lieutenant to the mounted riflemen. In December of the same year he was commissioned second lieutenant while serving at the cavalry school for practice at Carlisle, Pa. he was on frontier duty at Fort Bliss, Tex., 1857, and in December of that year was engaged in a skirmish against the Kiowa Indians near Fort Craig, N.M. In 1859 he was engaged in the scouting in the Navajo country, and took part in the Comanche and Kiowa expedition of 1860. On May 16, 1861, in obedience to the command of his State, he resigned his commission in the United States army and entered the service of the Confederate States as captain of artillery. In the battle of Belmont, November 7, 1861, he acted as aide on the staff of General Pillow, and was seriously wounded while executing that officer's orders. His name is flatteringly mentioned in the reports of Generals Polk and Pillow and of Col. S. F. Marks, who, at the request of Colonel Barrow, tendered the thanks of the Eleventh Louisiana regiment to Capt. Wm. H. Jackson for valuable and gallant service rendered them. This gallant young officer was in the field again early in 1862 as colonel of the First Tennessee cavalry, winning compliments from his superior officers in every affair in which he was engaged. His name is mentioned in all the reports, and by his merit as chief of cavalry in Pemberton's department he richly earned the commission of brigadier- general, which was bestowed upon him December 29, 1862. He had acted as chief of cavalry for Van Dorn and Price in the campaign which culminated in the battle of Corinth. On the retreat from that disastrous field he had well protected the rear of the Confederate army. He increased his already high reputation throughout the Vicksburg campaign, and after its disastrous close he was indefatigable in his labors and rendered invaluable assistance to Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. In the Meridian campaign of February, 1864, Jackson commanded the cavalry of Polk's army, hanging upon the flanks of the enemy and compelling his foragers to keep close to the main line. During the Atlanta campaign, Jackson commanded the cavalry corps of the army of the Mississippi, which participated in all the arduous labors and many brilliant successes of the cavalry arm of the Confederate service. When, after the brilliant cavalry victory at Newnan, Wheeler moved into the rear of Sherman's army, Jackson's cavalry shared in the movements that defeated Kilpatrick's raid against the Macon road. He led his division of cavalry through the Nashville and Murfreesboro campaign, and then retiring to Mississippi, was there, in February, 1865, assigned to command of all Tennessee cavalry in Forrest's department, with other brigades, to form Jackson's division, one of the two provided for in Forrest's reorganization. His last military service was the cutting off of Croxton's brigade from the main body of Wilson's expedition, April, 1865. Since the close of the war General Jackson has engaged in stock raising, and is proprietor of the celebrated Belle Meade stock farm near Nashville, Tenn.</p>

JACKSON, CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BRIGADIER GENERAL WILLIAM H. JACKSON, CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p>Brigadier General William H. Jackson, one of the most prominent soldiers of Tennessee, was born at Paris, Tenn., October 7, 1835. At twenty-one years he was graduated at the United States military academy (1856), and assigned as brevet second lieutenant to the mounted riflemen. In December of the same year he was commissioned second lieutenant while serving at the cavalry school for practice at Carlisle, Pa. he was on frontier duty at Fort Bliss, Tex., 1857, and in December of that year was engaged in a skirmish against the Kiowa Indians near Fort Craig, N.M. In 1859 he was engaged in the scouting in the Navajo country, and took part in the Comanche and Kiowa expedition of 1860. On May 16, 1861, in obedience to the command of his State, he resigned his commission in the United States army and entered the service of the Confederate States as captain of artillery. In the battle of Belmont, November 7, 1861, he acted as aide on the staff of General Pillow, and was seriously wounded while executing that officer's orders. His name is flatteringly mentioned in the reports of Generals Polk and Pillow and of Col. S. F. Marks, who, at the request of Colonel Barrow, tendered the thanks of the Eleventh Louisiana regiment to Capt. Wm. H. Jackson for valuable and gallant service rendered them. This gallant young officer was in the field again early in 1862 as colonel of the First Tennessee cavalry, winning compliments from his superior officers in every affair in which he was engaged. His name is mentioned in all the reports, and by his merit as chief of cavalry in Pemberton's department he richly earned the commission of brigadier- general, which was bestowed upon him December 29, 1862. He had acted as chief of cavalry for Van Dorn and Price in the campaign which culminated in the battle of Corinth. On the retreat from that disastrous field he had well protected the rear of the Confederate army. He increased his already high reputation throughout the Vicksburg campaign, and after its disastrous close he was indefatigable in his labors and rendered invaluable assistance to Gen. Joseph E.

His last military service was the cutting off of Croxton's brigade from the main body of Wilson's expedition, April, 1865. After the close of the war General Jackson was engaged in stock raising, and was proprietor of the celebrated Belle Meade stock farm near Nashville, Tenn., where he raised cashmere goats and throughbred horses. He became a nationally known breader of throughbred horses in Tennessee after the war. He died on March 30, 1903.</p>

The game is a game that has been going around for many, many years. It is a memory game in which, you are not to think of the game. If you remember the game, even breifly, you loose it and you have to say aloud, "I lost the game". If you are sitting in a class or something, and you try to spread the game to all of your friends, and enjoy!</p>

<p>MELDIN® 7001 is a thermosetting polyimide materials made from the unfilled base resin. This grade offers the maximum mechanical properties and high chemical resistance. The MELDIN® 7001 grade is used for electrical and thermal insulating applications. Meldin 7000­ series polyimides are formed using high-pressure mold presses, automatic resin-feeding systems, and computer-controlled hydraulics. Complex shapes can be molded, reducing the need for secondary machining operations. The Meldin 7000­ series features operational temperatures of 600ºF for continuous operation and 900ºF for intermittent exposure, and tight tolerances of ±0.001 in. on both ODs and IDs. The 7001 grade is suitable for high-temperature structural, high-purity semiconductor, and welding component applications.</p>
