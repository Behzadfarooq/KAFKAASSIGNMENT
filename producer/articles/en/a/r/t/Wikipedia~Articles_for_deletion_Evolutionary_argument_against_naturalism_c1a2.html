<dd>I agree. I can't find an appropriate category; there should be something like "humanities." I am concerned that a philosophical argument is being dismissed because science-oriented Wikipedians fault philosophy's methodology. I find fault with philosophy's methodology, too, but I think that philosophical arguments should be evaluated using the tools of philosophy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is not OR. It is sourced and presents a philosopher's argument that has attracted enough attention to warrant a book rebutting the argument (<i>Naturalism Defeated?</i>). I agree that the argument is poor, but there needs to be an article, because currently <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical_naturalism.html" title="Metaphysical naturalism">Metaphysical naturalism</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_atheism.html" title="Critique of atheism">Critique of atheism</a> each deal with this argument separately. At <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critique_of_atheism.html" title="Critique of atheism">Critique of atheism</a> we reached more-or-less consensus that this argument needed to be moved from that article, and a new article is the best place for it. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 18:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> article is the best place for it.

</li>
<li><s>Delete</s>. In the Critique of atheism the consensus was that it didn't belong in it's entirety there, but the dispute of it's actual existance was nowhere near settled. It has been said in the Critique of Atheism discussion that according to Plantinga's website this paper is unpublished, and therefore has not received a peer review. That coupled with the article presenting his views as undisputed fact, and the fact that these views can raise quite a few eyebrows and looks like a wedge issue for advocates of Intelligent Design (which is actually compatible with Plantinga's background), makes this article seem less informative, more like it's fullfilling an agenda. The use of secondary sources to refer to such a polemical subject is frowned to within guidelines, and given the fact that the paper is unpublished this maybe beyond repair. NPOV and RS issues aside. I would say epistemologists would agree that the importance is not in the arguments themselves, but in the debate, and that is not presented at all here. It should be recognized that he argues evolution is only possible if it is guided by a supernatural being, and therefore this is purely a philosophical argument for intelligent design, as far as I can see, if this belongs anywhere, it's in the ID article and presented as such. And as for Lamont's concerns above, maybe the deletion of this article is the precedent needed so other articles dont need to deal with this at all. Whether that is established or not, future edits should converge those articles' mentions of this argument linking to this one.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">Starghost</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarghost_d510.html" title="User talk:Starghost">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Starghost_a508.html" title="Special:Contributions/Starghost">contribs</a>) 19:35, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I removed my previous vote, and am currently indifferent. I guess this argument is bound to resurface, or at least I believe it will be mentioned in Wikipedia in one form or another (it would be too long before editors would cede ground and give up on this argument on the other pages anyway). As some concerns are being adressed, such as the criticisms to the argument, I believe in time it may earn the right to a dignified existance. It is related published books and all, and we got plenty of other published crap anyway, so what the hell. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">Starghost</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarghost_d510.html" title="User talk:Starghost">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Starghost_a508.html" title="Special:Contributions/Starghost">contribs</a>) 21:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>del</b>. Covered in <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> article. It is Alvin's nonnotable and logically faulty original research. Good whed describing Alvin's views, but generally nonencyclopedic. There are zillions of various philosophical arguments for each philosophical issue by various philosophers, but unless it is duscussed by wide community, is is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. Wikipedia is not a media for <i>publication</i> of original ideas, it is for reports about <i>discussions</i> of them. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, the argument is considered notable enough "in the real world" to deserve <i>a published collection of academic essays <b>replying</b></i> to it (see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naturalism-Defeated-Plantingas-Evolutionary-Argument/dp/0801487633" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Naturalism-Defeated-Plantingas-Evolutionary-Argument/dp/0801487633" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 22:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Note</b>: The above statement was true when Andrew made the comment, but it is <i>not</i> true anymore.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> per nom.</s> I think that the <i>keep</i> arguments address the OR charge successfully, because I think the OR charge is a misguided interpretation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <s>But none of the <i>keep</i> arguments address the charge that this is a POV fork from <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical_naturalism.html" title="Metaphysical naturalism">Metaphysical naturalism</a>.

<ul>
<li>Regarding the alleged PoV fork, I should think the fact that the article is a result of a rough consensus by opposing views on the merits of the argument would indicate that it is not. In discussion at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_atheism_7a18.html" title="Talk:Critique of atheism">Critique of atheism</a> a number of points were made, including the fact that it needs to be expanded, as it is a quite technical and intricate argument. As such, it would overwhelm the <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> page. Moreover, since when do significant ideas go on their discoverer/postulator's articles? <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">Meme</a> isn't under <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, nor <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> under <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Derrida_cbcf.html" title="Jacques Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>. As for the relevance of the EAAN to metaphysical naturalism, it has the same problem we ran into in Critique of Atheism- it isn't a disproof of naturalism <i>per se</i>, but rather naturalism in conjunction with evolution.</li>
<li>Lastly, I think it is somewhat incumbent on the community to consider, if not defer to, the deliberations of the editors that led to the creation of the article, which may be found <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_atheism_7a18.html#Vote_on_linking_to_Plantinga" title="Talk:Critique of atheism">here</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielthursday_048f.html" title="User:Gabrielthursday">Gabrielthursday</a> 05:20, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that having an extended discussion of it at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical_naturalism.html" title="Metaphysical naturalism">Metaphysical naturalism</a> is a mistake because the argument is not about naturalism <i>per se</i>, and it is distracting there. Plantinga's argument is not about naturalism or evolution, it is about the two combined. He says that Naturalism in conjunction with belief in evolution renders the premises that underly the two beliefs unreliable. Putting the argument in <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Plantinga_8fc3.html" title="Alvin Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> is not appropriate - for some reason, other philosophers take his argument seriously. As I pointed out earlier, there is a published book criticising his argument (and with his responses). If professional philosophers take the argument seriously and debate it on its merits, there is no reason to conflate the argument with its proponent (I also second Gabrielthursday's comments on this issue). <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 12:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, is the article still pending expansion? I can understand content-forking if there is too much to be said that cannot be covered in other articles. But as it stands, the content is largely redundent with existing pages, and is NOT expanded.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there is enough here to justify the article. The fact that two other articles want to discuss the <i>argument</i> (rather than the philosopher) justifies the article. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 13:38, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi, Andrew, I second Lamont's and Gabriel's comments. In addition, the article (that was created yesterday) is already larger than many stub-pages in Wikipedia (*update: as in <i>21:46, 7 October 2006</i>, the text is now considerably larger than it was when Andrew made his last comment). There is continuing philosophical debate around the argument, but the critique section in the page is still based on comments from <i>only one</i> of the already existing critical reviews... There is certainly room for further expansion, not only of the criticism section, but also of the main argument. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 14:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Borderline keep</b>. The reasons for deletion are not valid. The article is not POV as it is balanced with criticism, and the page does is not duplicated elsewhere now.

I have previously misunderstood what a POV fork really is. As to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as I said above, that charge is misguided. That policy forbids Wikipedians from inserting their own original research, not from inserting the original research of others. As to notability, the proponents of this article have shown that Plantinga's argument has elicited wide discussion in the philosophical community. Finally, this article should not be deleted even if Plantinga's argument is "logically faulty" (as one editor says above). Using that criterion we would have to delete <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological_argument.html" title="Ontological argument">Ontological argument</a>.
