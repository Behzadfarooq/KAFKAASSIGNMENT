<p><s>The creator of this article removed the speedy tag inserted as an A7 CSD.

<li><b>Keep</b> - in the case of questionable articles that could go either way, I lean on the side of "does someone care enough to write an article" side. There's no point in keeping a stub for three years that nobody is ever going to touch, but if someone is willing to write an article on it ... this person seems to be a significant individual in the national church of Norway, so keep. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> After all she is a bishop. And she passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; there are articles about her in important newspapers in Norway: <a href="http://www.tk.no/nyheter/article2348123.ece" class="external text" title="http://www.tk.no/nyheter/article2348123.ece" rel="nofollow">like this one</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 00:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- the standard in WP:BIO is "multiple non-trivial published works". A quick google throws up what are obviously multiple reports of her appointment as bishop.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Leifern, I get frustrated at deletionists, especially when deletion is a first resort (vs. tagging for cleanup or sources, or even googling first).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am happy to discuss my characterization of the speedy delete nomination as "vandalism," but I have deliberately not brought that into the discussion here, partly as conciliatory move, and partly to keep the vote clean. I will write a brief explanation at <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeifern_779d.html" title="User talk:Leifern">User talk:Leifern</a>, and we can take it from there. I have no problems with people disagreeing with me, but it seems that making one accusation to counter another does little to get me - or anyone else - out of the trenches. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Judging by searches, appears to be known only in Norway. Also, appointment as Bishop doesn't seem to me to give sufficient notability--she is the Bishop of a town of 27,000. IMO, this can be covered sufficiently in other Wikipedias. The other Wikipedia article doesn't seem to cite much in the way of references either. This page is extremely light on the "multiple, non-trivial independent published works" as well. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 02:41, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The diocese of Hamar is one of 11 dioceses of the Church of Norway and covers one of the most populous areas of the country - far more than the 27,000 who live in the seat of the diocese, namely Hamar. And by your standard of "only being known in Norway," should we delete articles about people who are only known in the United Kingdom, Canada, or the U.S.? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 03:35, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; episcopal-level dignitaries of a major church are notable pretty much by definition, in my opinion, in the same way that dukes and princes and senators are notable. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because it seems to be notable. But it would be good if some secondary references are provided, apart from the external links. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a> 03:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In my opinion people holding highly-placed religious offices are automatically notable, in addition, there appear to be ample sources. The article may not be ideal, but it is acceptable under all wikipedia policy I can think of. As to the greater debate, I'm staying out of it, but I will say that I can see points on both sides. Assuming good faith is vital, but using a speedy tag when an article does not meet speedy criteria is also stepping out of process. In my opinion, this AfD should avoid that issue. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 04:49, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, obviously. Bishops are notable. And speedy-tagging an article with such a clear claim to notability (and doing it without an edit summary) may not be vandalism, but it is not correct use of the deletion instruments we have around here. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up◦land</a> 08:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
