<p>Is this the beginning of a structure for the arts?</p>
<p>Regarding 'Performing Arts', I am not sure what 'Theatre' includes or doesn't include. Is it just for English-language spoken drama? If so, I wonder whether major non-Euopean forms of music drama such as Kabuki, Nō, and Chinese opera should all be listed alongside Dance, Film etc.</p>
<p>Also I see 'Liberal Arts' is being used for literature. My understanding of this term is that it includes the arts and humanities and the social sciences. Would 'Literature' be a better label here?</p>
<p>Regards from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Opera_88e9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Opera">Opera Project</a> - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 18:57, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Theatre" is obviously going to include the Western dramatic tradition and not just plays in English. I would imagine that a user would expect to find Kabuki and Noh in that category as well, although I'm aware that certain Eastern art forms would not fit into <i>any</i> of the categories here: a Japanese tea ceremony or Zen garden, for example. I suppose that "the arts" with its subdivisions "perfoming arts", "fine arts" (which I omitted because I see it as an antiquated term), "applied arts" etc. is a wholely Western concept and that trying to pigeon-hole Oriental art forms into this structure would have a distorting effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm having second thoughts about classing "Opera" under the Performing arts alongside "Music" and "Theatre"; isn't it more a descendant of those two art forms? Also it seems that opera as most people think of it, more than art, architecture or theatre, is an entirely Western tradition, and that people might be be surprised to find Chinese opera as a subcategory of it. I confess to complete ignorance of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_opera.html" title="Chinese opera">Chinese opera</a>, but from the article I just read it would seem as unrelated to Western opera as the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_robin.html" title="European robin">European robin</a> is to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_robin.html" title="American robin">American bird of the same name</a> – the similar name is a convenience that explains something from culture X that is alien to culture Y in terms that put it within Y's frame of reference, but apart from the superficial resemblance they don't have that much in common. That Chinese opera is not currently categorised under "Opera" would seem to bear this out. (Though, as I said, I'm speaking from a position of ignorance and may have the wrong idea entirely.) Perhaps the categorisation should go something like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Performing arts
<dl>
<dd>Theatre [or, alternatively, Music]
<dl>
<dd>Opera [by implication, Western] | Chinese opera etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is that too Western-centric?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "Liberal arts" label, I'm not entirely happy with that myself, either. At first, I didn't want literature and poetry to be left out on a limb with no sur-category, but now it seems more sensible simply to have "Literature" on its own, under which would come poetry.

<dd>I don’t wish to start writing an essay on this subject, although I could probably write several. Having spent half my life in East Asia I am familiar with some of the non-European performing arts - as well as opera.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all you are absolutely right about Chinese opera - it is unrelated to ‘European’ opera. Chinese opera has no more connection with it than Kabuki or No etc. (Incidentally the reason that Chinese opera is no longer classified under opera is because we (at the Opera Project) uncoupled the links.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding ('European') opera, I would argue that it is not a ‘descendant’ of music and theatre. It is obviously far more than just music, (although the relationship between the main classical tradition in music and the development of opera is close). On the other hand it has little in common with the (non-musical, Anglo-oriented) theatre category. Opera did not develop from this kind of ‘theatre’, in fact it could be argued that it is the other way round - because music theatre predates ‘so-called’ straight theatre. Opera originated in Italy and was developed in Germany and France, rather than Britain (or America).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You ask whether the schemat above would be too <i>western-centric</i>. I think so, but it would also be too <i>Anglo-centric</i> (reflecting an Anglo-American view of the arts). The solution (in my view) would be in listing all the forms (opera, Chinese opera, Kabuki, No, dance, music, straight theatre etc. etc.) as equally-valid performing arts.</dd>

<dd>The new version looks good. Some questions - in this case speaking definitely as a non-specialist - would <i>Literature</i> also include other forms, such as some of those listed in <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_genre.html" title="Literary genre">Literary genre</a></i>? Would you consider making a section for <i>Applied arts</i> to include topics such as <i>fashion</i> which might otherwise be difficult to categorize.

<ul>
<li>Where you thinking of putting comics? We normally categorise it in both literature and visual art, as it is thought by many to be a hybrid of the two at the least. Others contest it is a seperate language, but none the less it shares common factors with both groups, and is often described as both. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">The wikipedian meme</a></small> 13:55, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wow, I didn't know there was discussion here as well. I responded to this under WikiProject arts talk, but I'll cut and paste my respone from that page and respond to some other things as well.</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I would argue keeping <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_f0df.html" title="Category:Arts">Category:Arts</a> and merging everything there. As I see it, the name of Category:The arts is simply wrong. Naming conventions only allow articles like "the" to be used if the name of the category is a specific title. Certainly, both "arts" and "the arts" refers to the same exact thing, the article doesn't add anything in this context. As for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_7691.html" title="Category:Art">Category:Art</a>, while "art" is the commonly used term for visual arts, for our purposes being specific is the most useful thing. Of course, if we were to do away with that category, it would mean the renaming of a number of categories. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 16:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the argument on opera...I have a degree in Theatre with a minor in music. When studying theatre, there was very little discussion on opera but while I was studying music, opera was heavily discussed. I would classify opera under Music and Theatre. I think the best classification for things like Chinese opera should be under theatre, with a note in the category directing anyone looking for non-western opera to the theatre category.</p>
<p>Finally, just a note about theatre (as mentioned at the very top), <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7ETheatre_3b42.html" title="Category:Theatre">Category:Theatre</a> includes anything that could be defined as a performance that tells a story, excluding any performances that are mostly a musical performance (i.e. opera) or dance (i.e. ballet). <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 18:53, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Re <i>Arts</i> or <i>The Arts</i>, I have no strong preference (though obviously it should not be <i>Art</i> as that would be misunderstood). I do agree there should be one overarching category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re opera - the intention of those of us who are working on the project is to raise the profile of the subject on Wikipedia. This may be difficult to do, given the general orientation of Wikipedia, but that is what we are attempting. Relegating opera to a subcategory of music or theatre (which have such different cultural baggage) would be counter-productive for us. Moreover I can't see any logic in listing dance separately from music/theatre but not opera.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One other thing - opera is well defined. We even have a exact date for its beginning and composers to this day (even in places like China and Japan) have a clear idea of whether or not they are part of the opera tradition. In contrast, theatre is a much vaguer concept. (The basic meaning, after all, is of a (secular) venue rather than an art form.) I note <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">Ganymead</a>'s definition above - based on narrative - but I wonder whether other members of theatre-related projects might come up with different ideas. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 20:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I have explained before, I don't think opera can be listed under music or theatre - or both! Moreover I don't think this 'Arts' project can be successful unless you consult the views of those working on individual arts projects. I can see lots of problems with the visual arts arrangement above. I am not sure what the solution should be, but there must be people involved in this area who have informed opinions. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 19:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, should opera be separately listed?

<dl>
<dd>I've thought about it briefly and I've decided to agree that opera probably deserves it's own listing. I'll amend the above listing. I agree that we do need more people here to discuss this. I'm not sure if you've noticed my response at the end of the above segment, my specialty is theatre, but I've studies music and performed in a few operas myself. I hope you don't think I'm downplaying operas importance. I have a great love for it as well.

<dd>I am in favour of keeping to the rule. Opera belongs wholly to the Performing Arts. There is overlap with music, theatre, costuming, lighting, set design, architecture etc. but surely there's no advantage in listing opera under all of them. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 23:09, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. Speaking both as an opera person and an orientalist, I think a broad horizontal listing of the various performing arts will be a much better structure for future development. At the moment there are very few Chinese opera articles and amazingly none on Kabuki titles (probably none on Nō either) but these will be eventually written. Giving them due prominence will help. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 20:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One further point. Should we regard television and radio as media rather than arts?

<dd>Well, I would say that Television is almost an extension of film, maybe minus all the artsiness. Surely there is some TV that has artistic merit (just not here in America, I suppose). Well, I might consider Monty Python and some of British TV comedy to be worthy. But that's just my opinion. Plus there have been a number of well-known productions of plays and operas on TV. Menotti's <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amahl_and_the_Night_Visitors_e8a1.html" title="Amahl and the Night Visitors">Amahl and the Night Visitors</a></i> was first performed on TV, for example. Radio, I think has similar merits. Of course the term "media" is vague. Here in the states it's quite common to refer to libraries in schools (and I would venture, elsewhere) as "media centers". Well, that's a muddled answer...I'm at work and have had a rather muddled day. I'll look at this later and try to sort it out. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 19:22, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lots of good (arts) work is certainly done on TV, radio etc. The question is just how it is classified. My suggestion would be for TV films to be under film, TV or radio opera (of which they are quite a lot of examples) to be under opera, radio drama to be under drama . . . I mean theatre!

<dd>How about the next tiers down from visual arts being 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional, rather than getting into loaded and controversial terms like "applied" and "graphic" (I bet most painters don't consider themselves graphic artists). <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkit_6e56.html" title="User:Sparkit">&gt;&gt;sparkit|</a><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESparkit_d651.html" title="User talk:Sparkit">TALK&lt;&lt;</a> 05:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The more I think about this, the more I view <i>intermediate</i> sub-categories as being unhelpful.

<li>Why isn't music considered a Performing Art?</li>
<li>I really think Spoken drama should be called "Theatre". Drama is defined in most places as the literary element of theatre. In other words, theatre is drama as it is performed. I would consider Chinese opera and Kabuki under Theatre rather than standing alone.</li>
<li>Vaudeville should probably be incorporated into <a href="../../../v/a/r/Category%7EVariety_entertainment_afca.html" title="Category:Variety entertainment">Category:Variety entertainment</a> being that it is the American version of variety, sometimes known as "Music Hall." <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 20:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with you on including radio drama, of course while we're at it, you could include film and TV. But, I think that drama is really sub-serviant to theatre rather than vice versa. But on that, I really have to come up with a good answer as to why. Lemme think on it.

<dd>I'd already included Television, and Film had already been categorised under visual art, so I left that. To support my case I offer the article at <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_drama.html" title="Radio drama">radio drama</a>, and also note that drama equates to plays as much as it does theatre, and that plays can be performed on radio, television and in the theatre.

<p>My comments:</p>
<p>1. We are not going to get distinct, hermetically-sealed, non-overlapping categories. Inevitably some art forms belong in more than one place. Given that Wikipedia structure is more of a hedge than a tree this shouldn't be a problem.<br />
2. IMO Music (the art of sound) is fundamental, so it should be at the top level. (Nor is it necessarily a performance art. You can't put on an opera at home but you can play the piano with no audience.)<br />
3. I prefer <i>Drama</i> to <i>Theatre</i> because it is clearer. (A <i>Theatre</i> is after all a venue/building not an art form as such.) I also think we should avoid treating <i>Drama/Theatre</i> as a synonym for performing arts, when in practice the category coverage is narrow. So I'd recommend keeping opera, dance, Chinese opera, Kabuki etc. distinct from <i>Drama</i>. This should facilitate rather than stiffle their development.<br />
4. I have put the category <i>Plays</i> for literature and <i>Drama</i> for Performing Arts to distinguish them from each other.<br />
5. I have put Vaudeville in <i>Variety entertainment</i>. This category should just be <i>Variety</i> and include magic. Of course people involved in these fields may object, but if not they would make a convenient grouping.<br />
6. In my view <i>Film</i> is part of the <i>Visual Arts</i> - it is not <i>performed</i> as such.<br />
7. Media like Television and radio aren't included. I don't think this presents any problems. A radio opera is an opera. A television drama is a drama etc.</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful, I realize we will never get complete agreement on this. Perhaps we need to develop some kind of decision-making process? 23:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC) Revised <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 08:23, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, this works for me, apart from the fact <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">Comics</a> isn't mentioned.

<dd>I have added Comics to 'Visual Arts'. (I see each of the main four sections being open ended, i.e. when there is sufficient interest in a category we add it.) I think it's better to keep items in one section if possible. Obviously we can't do this with plays/drama/theatre (unavoidably in both literature and performing arts) but with other arts it is surely better to keep the scheme simple. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 17:16, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't disagree more strongly. Comics has to be categorised as both literature and art. The form is one of a storytelling nature, which makes it literature, but also one of conveying information through pictures, which makes it a visual art. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,547796,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,547796,00.html" rel="nofollow">Time</a> have referred to comics as a literary form, as do the Encyclopdia Britannica, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8941787/site/newsweek/" class="external text" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8941787/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">Newsweek</a>, as do the Economist who write "TINTIN, a teenaged journalist, and Yakari, an ecologically correct native American (Red Indian), are among Belgium's main contributions to literature. Their comic-book adventures sell millions of copies, mainly in France.", Apr 6, 1996; p. 69, and the <i>The Washington Post</i> who refer to comics as a "a literary genre" Monday, December 13, 2004; Page B01. Now as the rep of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">WikiProject Comics</a> I feel I'm going to have to stick to my guns on this point. I don't have reference books to point to right now; given time there may well be comparable <i>The Oxford Guide to Comics</i> and <i>The Cambridge Guide to Comics</i>, but right now there aren't. I can point to American universities teaching comics as literature, and I will have to hope that will suffice. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small>[</small></dd>

<dd>By the same logic, opera should probably be listed in all four sections, but what would that achieve? At the moment no category is duplicated, even if drama/theatre are different aspects of the same thing. If you insist I will add Comics to literature, but I fear people will think the arrangement is a bit ridiculous.

<dd>I don't find the suggestion of categorizing comics in two places all that rediculous. I think you (Kleinzach) and I feel very strongly about fairly rigid categories. Of course it's like trying to fence in a river. The Arts are all fairly fluid. I think we need to compromise where need be and save our heavy discussions for something more important.

<dd>Somewhat against my inclinations, I have added <i>Comics</i> to <i>Literature</i>. I fear this will lead to duplication all over the place but we need to reach a compromise. Of course you (Ganymead) are correct (above). The problem is that it is a self-defeating argument. Why have a structure at all if it is completely elastic?

<dd>Ta. I for one have never been over bothered by what people think, I'd rather that people discuss and find a compromise or consensual position. I don't think any categorisation structure should be rigid, I thought your opening comment that the structure was more a hedge than a tree would facilitate this idea, and I apologise if I have cause you offence with my position. As to other categories and where they are placed, I think that's a matter best left for people who understand those fields to determine. I'm not well versed in opera, but to me the main point of it is that it is to be performed for an audience. That would seem to place it in performing arts. Unfortunately, the point of comics is that as a form it is both looked at and read, making it the literary form of visual art. I can't really see another category that crosses the boundaries to such an extent, but like I say, I'm not as well-versed in other fields of art.

<p>I accept that we may not agree, but let me throw out this one last argument. Everything else seems ok and I can live with it, but the theatre/drama thing still irks me. I wish to point out that most reference books on theatre use the term to describe the art form. Certainly the two sources I rely on heavily use it: <i>The Oxford Companion to the Theatre</i> and <i>The Cambridge Guide to Theatre</i>. In addition most American universities with programs in theatre refer to their departments or schools with that term. Even here on Wikipedia the articles for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatre</a> (which I'm rewriting but along similar lines) and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a> make note of the difference. Indeed, I consulted a few online references and their definitions for drama do not include the full production of theatre, just the literary form. With relegating drama to literature, you also include dramatic items that could not simply fall under the heading of "Play," these may include individual scenes and monologues, etc. While I realize that we may never agree on everything, I still must stick to my guns on this point; especially as founder of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Theatre_7a64.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Theatre">WikiProject Theatre</a>. I shall rest my case, now. Thanks for hearing me out. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 14:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I have changed <i>Plays</i> to <i>Drama</i>, and <i>Drama</i> to <i>Theatre</i>. I don't have strong feelings on <i>Plays</i> versus <i>Drama</i>. (<i>Plays</i> correspond better with <i>Novels</i> but it's no big deal). With two actresses and a drama professor in the family, I understand the arguments for <i>Theatre</i> as a concept much as I disagree with them (and the way so-called <i>Theatre</i> has been hyped and used to marginalize more important non-Anglo drama traditions and cultures). The words used for all the other arts describe an activity or a product of that activity - only <i>Theatre</i> is different!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand we have to respect each other's positions - otherwise we can't move forward. I just hope the vagueness of the <i>theatre</i> concept will not become a reason for absorbing the rest of the performing arts into it and representing them from a <i>theatrical perspective</i>. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 18:01, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

I think if these broad topics need some coverage, there would/should be an article of the same topic.(&amp; I'll leave this comment over in visual arts) <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7EClubmarx_4ca5.html" title="User:Clubmarx">Clubmarx</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/u/User_talk%7EClubmarx_b93a.html" title="User talk:Clubmarx">Talk</a> 21:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cinema_by_country" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cinema_by_country" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] - there are articles that cover regions larger than a country. That seems like a reasonable solution. (If we did need something like this, I'm not sure adding 'world' to region labels is a good idea.) <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7EClubmarx_4ca5.html" title="User:Clubmarx">Clubmarx</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/u/User_talk%7EClubmarx_b93a.html" title="User talk:Clubmarx">Talk</a> 00:17, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I see that all 3 subcats in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_by_region_4c0d.html" title="Category:Art by region">Category:Art by region</a> are already in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_history_4577.html" title="Category:Art history">Category:Art history</a>. I think having these in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_history_4577.html" title="Category:Art history">Category:Art history</a> is best. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_by_region_4c0d.html" title="Category:Art by region">Category:Art by region</a> should probably be deleted. <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7EClubmarx_4ca5.html" title="User:Clubmarx">Clubmarx</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/u/User_talk%7EClubmarx_b93a.html" title="User talk:Clubmarx">Talk</a> 04:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since the merge to Art didn't work, I have another proposal. What do people think? If we come to some agreement here I can put in a block merge/rename categories request. <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7EClubmarx_4ca5.html" title="User:Clubmarx">Clubmarx</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/u/User_talk%7EClubmarx_b93a.html" title="User talk:Clubmarx">Talk</a> 01:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dt>1. Rename <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_7691.html" title="Category:Art">Category:Art</a> to <a href="../../../v/i/s/Category%7EVisual_arts_b0d2.html" title="Category:Visual arts">Category:Visual arts</a> &amp; merge</dt>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_7691.html" title="Category:Art">Category:Art</a> has already been de-populated of performing arts, lit, and so forth, which was a big problem before. The parent category Category:The artsalso has a much better structure than it did before.</p>
<p>I don't think it's realistic, or desirable, to rename each 'Art' category to 'Visual Arts'. So, I propose to just rename the main one &amp; leave the rest as 'Art ____'.</p>

<dd>Agree. However, I give it about half a day before Category:Art is re-created.

<dd>Seems like a sensible proposal to me: The change of name for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_7691.html" title="Category:Art">Category:Art</a> will hopefully mean that no-one confuses art with the arts, but we avoid weird category titles like <i>Category:Visual arts historians</i>.

<dd>Slight issue: how will the article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">Art</a> be categorised under this new system? At the moment it has the categories <i>Art</i> and <i>The arts</i> – I take it that this would change to <i>Arts</i> and <i>Visual arts</i>? (<i>Arts</i> because the article does not deal purely with the visual side of things, and <i>Visual arts</i> because that is the most common usage of the term – i.e. the same logic as the current categories.) <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHam_ce62.html" title="User:Ham">H<small>AM</small></a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/87/SaintPierre4.JPG/15px-SaintPierre4.JPG" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" /></a> 09:31, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dt>2. Remove Category:Visual art movements</dt>
</dl>
<p>Just like Art &amp; Visual arts, I think <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_movements_722b.html" title="Category:Art movements">Category:Art movements</a> is sufficient. If there are any pages that are just categorized under Category:Visual art movements, those would get categorized as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_movements_722b.html" title="Category:Art movements">Category:Art movements</a>. It seems that <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkit_6e56.html" title="User:Sparkit">User:Sparkit</a> did a lot of work about a year ago on this, but I haven't seen Category:Visual art movements grow a whole lot since then.</p>

<dt>3. Popular topics</dt>
</dl>
<p>There are several topics (photography, comics) that are technically visual arts but are categorized under Category:The arts. I don't have a problem with making popular topics more prominent. Visual arts can still include these and all the other art/arts that are visual. Conceptual art could be categorized like this, just in The arts. I think this issue is a little separate than the Art/Visual art category and we could come to some conclusion about the above without completely resolving the popular topics issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd prefer to see topics like photography etc. under visual arts in order to promote clarity in the structure. If we have lots of categories out of place we will lose coherence, though I realize a perfectly logical order will never be achieved. In the case of conceptual art (which I don't know a lot about), isn't this another of the sub-categories like <i>Fine arts</i>, <i>Applied arts</i>, <i>Plastic arts</i> etc. which we are covering in articles but which we are trying to keep out of the structure because of the difficulty of definition? - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 08:36, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was looking at the "Literature" subset, where <i>Essays, Sagas, Epics etc.</i> have been added to the list, unlinked and in italics. Now, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Category%7EEssays_f6a2.html" title="Category:Essays">Category:Essays</a> exists and I would be happy for that to be included in the restructuring scheme, but I'm less sure about the place of "Sagas" and "Epics" here. For one thing, no such categories exist to my knowledge. But also, as a saga or epic could take the form of novels, poetry, comics, (not to mention operas, plays...)</p>

<p>I would class those as <i>genres</i>, and I would argue that this scheme should just include <i>artforms</i> – because to my mind that is what poetry, drama, essays, novels, poetry and comics are. Strangely, every projected subcategory of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Category%7EMusic_dc15.html" title="Category:Music">Category:Music</a> looks to me like a genre:</p>

<dd>What is the difference between an artform and a genre (and indeed a sub-genre)? In the case of music are you saying we should list symphonies, concertos, songs etc, instead of the arrangement above. I doubt if that would be practical. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 11:25, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There also exists <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_genres_by_country_or_nationality_9f76.html" title="Category:Arts genres by country or nationality">Category:Arts genres by country or nationality</a>, which I think should be changed to <i>Artforms by country</i>, because its subcategories are along the lines of <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilms_by_country_83bc.html" title="Category:Films by country">Category:Films by country</a> and not <i>Film noir by country</i> – again, it's really about artforms and not genres.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_genres_by_country_or_nationality_9f76.html" title="Category:Arts genres by country or nationality">Category:Arts genres by country or nationality</a> is a useful list of 58 subcategories. It's actually by country or nationality or region or ethnicity or language. Renaming and restructuring it would be a considerable job and would also be highly controversial. Different arts have different requirements. Take opera for example, <i>Opera by language</i> is used because operas are often by written and performed in <i>foreign</i> languages (e.g. Handel's Italian operas written and performed in London). - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 11:25, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(As for the thorny question of "country" vs. "nationality", it seems to me that people have nationalities, but artforms come from countries. I don't think this is something to go into depth about here; Ganymead brought it up during the early days of <a href="../../../w/p/a/WP%7EWPArts_0430.html" title="WP:WPArts">WP:WPArts</a> and it still hasn't been resolved.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is complicated. There are historical problems. Countries and nationalities disappear - particularly in the middle of Europe.

<dd>Bear in mind that I started this topic because I think that as sagas and epics do not belong in the same list as novels, poetry et al, for a reason I have imperfectly tried to pin down above (that a saga or epic could take the form of a poem, a novel or a series of plays and thus does not belong on the same level of categorisation). I am having to rethink my definition of "artforms", after my Concise Oxford Dictionary from 1980 problematically suggested "novels, sonnets and sonatas" as examples – I'm sure you agree that the latter two examples are way too narrow for our scheme, and that "poetry" and "classical music" would suffice. So I think I am going to change my tune and argue for a degree of internal consistency within subsets, but that none of the differing aspects of the arts can be expected to follow the same standards. Pop music deserves inclusion but not Pop art, because the division of music into styles (what I have been calling genres) seems more necessary and useful than to do the same thing with the visual arts. "One law for the lion and the ox is oppression". I suppose that whereas doing this sort of thing with the sciences is straightforward because the scientist's job involves categorisation, pigeonholing isn't actually necessary for artistic endeavour at all, unless you're putting an encyclopaedia together!</dd>

<dd>Yes, the problem here is that while the visual arts tend to be defined by tools (pencil, brush, camera etc.), literature is organized by forms of production (novel, poetry etc.) and music by styles (classical, pop, jazz). Classifying music by instrument or form (across styles) wouldn't work. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 18:26, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If its only use is as a helpful grouping together of 58 subcategories, might I suggest a change of name to <i>Arts topics by country or nationality</i>, at least provisionally?

<dd>After reading this, the question that sticks in my mind is: "Is this category really useful?" I agree that the name is wrong, but if someone is looking for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_de_Montaigne_9b39.html" title="Michel de Montaigne">Michel de Montaigne</a> in the categories, wouldn't they follow a path through Literature to Essayists, then Essayists by country to France and then find him? Now, if I were looking for Belgian Symbolist playwrights, I might look in this category and it may be helpful. To me, it just seems like a worthless melange of categories. As for the nationality/country argument, I think we should probably wait a bit before we get into that. I think we still have a few items to argue over before we get into the meat of the 2nd Level Categories (Music, Visual arts, Performing arts and Literature). I have a little list that I'll post shortly, with some remaining questions and issues that need to get worked out. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 20:51, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As mentioned above, there are still some minor issues in the 2nd Level of categories that I think need to be worked out before we get into the nationality/country argument. A few nights ago when I was being an insomiac, I took a look at the 2nd Level to see what else needed to happen before we move onto the 3rd Level of Categories. Here's what I have found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just a general category note: should we consider creating definitions at the beginning ot each category list? This would briefly define the topic and then lay out the parameters of the category. Certainly for the large categories, these should be created by us as a group.</li>
<li>After defining the "Big 4" categories (Music, Visual arts, Performing arts and Literature) we're still left with a few categories.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts-related_lists_70b8.html" title="Category:Arts-related lists">Category:Arts-related lists</a> - I would suggest this be structured just like Category Arts.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_deities_707f.html" title="Category:Arts deities">Category:Arts deities</a> - Should this be included?</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_centres_824f.html" title="Category:Arts centres">Category:Arts centres</a> - This should be restructured to include categories for art galleries and performing arts centers, neither of which are found in it now.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_organizations_5ce5.html" title="Category:Arts organizations">Category:Arts organizations</a> Again, another cat. that should probably be restructured like Category:Arts and expanded.</li>
<li>Category:The arts by country - I'll nominate this for renaming since we're change Category:The arts as well. This could probably do with a restructuring along the lines of Category:Arts as well.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/o/s/Category%7ELost_works_a457.html" title="Category:Lost works">Category:Lost works</a> - A great category, but should probably be broken down into Category:Lost literary works and Category:Lost works of visual arts (though maybe visual arts could use a better name).</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_managers_ae5c.html" title="Category:Arts managers">Category:Arts managers</a> - I'm not really sure if this category should exist. All of these managers fall under a specific type of art rather than just the arts in general. Perhaps, just do away with this?</li>
<li>The rest of the categories will fall under the categorization system we've decided on. But think we might wait until the CfD finishes and then put our plan into place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that's my little list. Once a decision is made we also should either volunteer or delegate someone to take care of moving and restructuring. I'll be more than happy to take care of most of the stuff on the list. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 21:35, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been thinking about your proposals above, (and also the work Ham is doing on the category scheme for the portal). I am wondering whether it is a good idea digging too deep into the categories. As we know there are lots of anomalies - like for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArts_deities_707f.html" title="Category:Arts deities">Category:Arts deities</a> above. These are often insubstantial in terms of content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My proposal would be to start an expanded scheme - like the one of the portal page but more detailed in order to provide a road map for any re-organizing we do. Obviously the Portal page scheme is best kept simple. Perhaps a new arts category scheme could be attached to the Arts project page? I can set up the page if you think this will help. The page (and discussion) would also be less obscure than this page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In general I think we should be cautious in what we do. <i>Top down</i> re-organization isn't easy and invites controversy. At the moment I am working on an infobox category scheme for opera which is more <i>bottom up</i> in nature. (I don't know if this will serve as a model for other category maps.) - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 21:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in favour of moving the activity on this page to a more prominent place, and in keeping this portal page as a simple, clear outline of the scheme. The more prominent our categorising plans are the better, because it's no good honing them to just the way we like them on an obscure portal page like this (and although it's just one click away from the Main Page, not many people will think of looking at the talk page) – because some time we're going to have to make our proposal for upheaval of the arts categories to the greater Wikipedia community (I suppose on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_portal_0276.html" title="Wikipedia:Community portal">Wikipedia:Community portal</a>) and I don't expect that everyone will like it. Yes, we should be cautious in what we do, and transparent as well – I'm thinking along the lines of advertising this projected categories page prominently on the main <a href="../../../w/p/a/WP%7EWPArts_0430.html" title="WP:WPArts">WP:WPArts</a> project page. I wonder how many members of WPArts know that this talk page is just as active as the project's main one? <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHam_ce62.html" title="User:Ham">H<small>AM</small></a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/87/SaintPierre4.JPG/15px-SaintPierre4.JPG" alt="" width="15" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintPierre4.JPG_d3e3.html" /></a> 19:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
