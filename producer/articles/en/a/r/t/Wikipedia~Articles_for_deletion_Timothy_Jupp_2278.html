<p>Five articles on members of the Christian band <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delirious__bfd7.html" title="Delirious?">Delirious?</a>. The band gets external coverage so is notable, but I can find no evidence that the individual members have been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources, and the only source for the bio data seems to be the band's own website. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Edit &amp; Comment</b>: Oops; I forgot to sign the above. Anyway, I would actually say that it's much harder for British Christian bands to meet the criteria. In America, there's a massive CCM industry willing to report on bands, etc.; in Britain, there's literally no CCM subculture... and a lot of music magazines, channels, etc. refuse to consider Christian bands (and hence especially their by-definition less-notable members) as being worthy of attention. Oh, well... I still would say <b>Keep</b> for Martin and <b>Weak Keep</b> for the rest. --<b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_88b7.html" title="User:MatheMezzaMorphis163">3M163</a></b>//<i><b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_3007.html" title="User talk:MatheMezzaMorphis163">Complete Geek</a></b></i> 13:02, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Delerious is one of the most important bands in contemporary Christian circles, especially in the UK. and has influenced worship in 1000s of churches. Martin Smith and Stu Garrard in particular have written songs that are used regularly in worship and are Christian hymnwriters in their own right. It might be best to keep their articles seperate and combine the others into Delerious' article. There are other sources of information about them. <a href="../../../m/m/c/User%7EMMcCaghrey_ff22.html" title="User:MMcCaghrey">MMcCaghrey</a> 16:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
