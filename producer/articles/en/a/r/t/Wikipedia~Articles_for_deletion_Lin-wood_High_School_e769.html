I think the converse is true. "A school may be best handled in a separate article if it is the principal subject of multiple reliable independent non-trivial published works."

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability is considered a <b>guideline</b> not Wikipedia Policy. Lack of notability is an argument to avoid in deletion discussions <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>. Simply stating that the subject of an article is not notable does not provide reasoning as to why the subject may not be notable. Many editors still consider notability to be a subjective <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">WP:JNN</a>. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, not truth. Wikipedia is not a matter of truth.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it is interesting that you support your argument against a guideline by citing essays, which are even weaker authority. The policy in question here is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a guideline used to implement <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Incidentally, a guideline is "generally accepted among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow." It is not something that should be disregarded just because an essay says its ok. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 04:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is a policy. You can abuse it all you want, but we are supposed to follow it. It is one of the rules of engagement here, like it or not. The section of WP:NOT which is primarily relevant here, IMHO, is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. This section of WP policy is implemented through the guideline of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. In plain language, notability distinguishes subjects worthy of articles from the sorts of things that one would only find in a directory. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 05:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's take a look at what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> actually says: "1.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see you missed my point. It's #3. Wikipedia is not a directory of schools. If they pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, they go in. Otherwise, they stay out as directory fodder. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 05:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You just claimed that the relevant issue is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, and insist that this article is a directory of schools. Let's quote #3 in its entirety "<b>Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business. For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules, programme lists, etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable. Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article. Wikipedia is not the yellow pages.</b>" Clearly, it is an article about a school, not a list of them. I don't see anything that looks like "upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules, [or] programme lists" in this article. "Directory fodder" is just a rewording of "I can't come up with an actual Wikipedia policy that this article violates so I'm resorting to excuses." Any other suggestions of a relevant Wikipedia policy? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:29, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I guess it's a lot easier to prove me wrong when you misconstrue policy and put words into my mouth. The policy does not merely prohibit 'articles' which are themselves directories. Rather, it declares that 'Wikipedia' itself is not a directory. (Look above the subsection you quoted and you will see the following text: "Wikipedia is not a directory. Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed.") Similarly, I did not insist that the 'article' is a directory of schools. I argued that if every non-notable school is the proper subject of a Wikipedia article, then 'Wikipedia' would become a directory of schools. As you can see, this is touching on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> as well. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 05:45, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

The problem with your quote that "Wikipedia is not a directory.

<li><b>Comment</b> (Indent reset) You are misconstruing the policy by ignoring the two sentences I quoted in my last post here. You are putting words in my mouth by stating that I am insisting that the article is a directory of schools. You say you can only rebut the claims I make, but you are doing a much better job of rebutting claims I haven't made. Are you saying that WP policies are to be read literally as exhaustive lists and that if another category of item fits the definition but is not within the letter of the law, users are free to disregard the spirit of the law? <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 06:15, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm getting frustrated. You probably are too. I explained my reasoning above. You obviously disagree. I did quote actual policy (with quotation marks and everything!) but I don't see any utility in repeating my argument that WP is not a directory (of high schools), because you'll just repeat your argument to the contrary and we'll continue gainsaying each other indefinitely like some real-life version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Argument_Sketch_4850.html" title="The Argument Sketch">a comedic sketch</a>.

<li>And that makes it notable how? If it were the only school built with brick, would it be notable? The only school with a maple tree?

<li>I believe the only <i><b>"single school"</b></i> SAU (School Administrative Unit) in the state to be the argument of notabilty. If in your opinion this is not notable, based on cockeyed, crazy, loony, and loopy comparisons than your opinion is right. Here is another comparison for you; Every guy has one dick, but this one guy has a double dick. His claim to double dickness is verifiable and has regional interest in San Francisco, however every guy could have a double dick if he went <i>Dan's House of Double Dick Installations</i>, would no longer make the article notable. I understand your argument without the comparisons. Hopefully my articulateness expression on comparisons being useless is understood. --<a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowpedia_0ef3.html" title="User:Knowpedia">Masterpedia</a> 18:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My 1<sup>st</sup> grade teacher just informed me I was rude with my delivery. That being said the comparisons are elementery.

<dd>Just to <b>comment</b> on the facts, without getting back into the keep/delete mishegas, it is the school <i>district</i> that is the only SAU in the state. The subject of the article is the <i>school</i>, not the <i>district</i>. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 19:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is completely false. All School districts is NH are SAU's <a href="http://www.ed.state.nh.us/education/doe/SAUList.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ed.state.nh.us/education/doe/SAUList.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>It's not false, just ambiguous because I shorthanded the sentence. I'll say it again, this time including what I thought was obvious: "It is the school <i>district</i> that is the only SAU in the state [with only one school]." Anyway, it doesn't change the fact that the article is about the district, not the school, so something that makes the district notable would not necessarily make its school also notable. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 20:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
