<dd>Funny how you deleted my reasons - that's vandalism. Anyway its also funny how you vote to delete the allegations against the US Democratic Party.

<dd><b>Speedy Keep and Rename</b> -- ideology and AfD processes aside, the title is confusing -- is the article referring to allegations by the U.S of others' state terrorism ... or allegations by others of U.S.-sponsored state terrorism? The answer, of course, is the latter. The "See Also" section has a link to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._list_of_state_sponsors_of_international_terrorism_802b.html" title="U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism">U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism</a> but I think that should also be included in some sort of disambiguation statement with link at the top of this article. Perhaps a better title here would be "Allegations of U.S.-sponsored state terrorism" or "Allegations of U.S. government-sponsored terrorism". As for my "speedy keep" recommendation, that's based on the short interval since the last AfD. Unless there was a process problem the last time (sockpuppetry, votestacking, etc.), I think it's wrong to push another AfD so soon. (If there was a process problem last time that's not mentioned here, please spell it out and I will reconsider). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> I was just in the process of unwatching this page, I never really thought much of this page in many respects, truth be told, and now a third deletion. Looks like I have to watch the page again, more drama. This page needs major work, but people's ideologies block any progress, one way or the other.<br />
As long as this article has this name, it will be a lightning rod of controversy. I tried to change the name a million times, but <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding_cats.html" title="Herding cats">Herding cats</a> makes me want to slit my wrists. Nuclear once said he would never allow me to change the name, but he has recently changed in surprising ways. Maybe we can get a name change.<br />
<b>SUGGESTED COMPRIMISE: I don't suppose User:Khodavand would close the AfD if we can agree on a name change?</b> Best wishes, Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 17:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With respect, Khodavand, the only connection I can see between that article and this, is you.
