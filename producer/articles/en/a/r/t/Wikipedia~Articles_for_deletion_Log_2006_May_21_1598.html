<p>This article is inherently, unavoidably biased, by describing criticisms of Hugo Chávez outside the context of his main biographical article. Criticisms of Chávez are already discussed in the main article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:32, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> We are trying to shorten the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_ab88.html" title="Hugo Chávez">Hugo Chávez</a> article, which is impossibly long and making it very hard to edit, while working on removing the substantial bias on both sides. The Criticism section in the Chavez article is exceedingly long, and we are trying to work on cleaning it up, removing the POV, and moving some of it to this daughter article in order to shorten the main article. I voted in favor of deleting Personal Life of Hugo Chavez because there was nothing in it that wasn't said in the short section in the main article. The situation here is different: there is too much that is said in the main article, which is too long, and the content needs to be cleaned up and moved to the daughter article. If this article is deleted, some of the content will have to be merged back into the main article, which is already hopelessly too long. Give us a chance to work on it, as we have only recently begun to interest other editors in taking a look at the problems. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think the main article is so long, not so much because there's so much to say, but because it's said in an extremely verbose way. I'd be happy to help on trimming it down - I'd say it could be made less than half the size it is now just by writing it in a more concise way. Even if subarticles are necessary, I still disagree with this one - its very title is biased, in that it defines its scope as reporting one point of view, contravening one of Wikipedia's most fundamental philosophies. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:54, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Criticism and controversy sections are common in many articles: if this topic is biased, then so are many others in Wikipedia. IMO, there are more problems than verbosity with the main article on Chavez, and nominating all of the daughter articles for deletion will not solve the problems. The daughter articles appear to have been created in order to feature the main article, and deleting all of them could just increase the bias in the main article. The daughter articles are needed, although everything about Chavez needs editorial attention. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:58, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I'm certainly not arguing against a criticism section in the main article; quite the opposite - that's the only place I think there should be one. Taking the section out of context and making it a standalone article is what I object to - such an article is unavoidably biased. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 01:01, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're aware that the main article is already so long that it's difficult to edit? And that daughter articles have been created for almost every section of the main article? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:08, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, I'm wondering if you want to nominate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_honors_earned_by_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_026e.html" title="List of honors earned by Hugo Chávez">List of honors earned by Hugo Chávez</a> for the same reasons you've nominated the others&#160;?

<ul>
<li>On further inspection, I see that the Chavez article already is split up based on time period. Looks good. I'd suggest splitting off the "political impact" section and drastically reducing the redundancy of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidency_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_ce84.html" title="Presidency of Hugo Chávez">Presidency of Hugo Chávez</a> section/article, then, if size reduction is still needed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:58, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, no reason to delete, there is no space in the original article to include all the criticism. For example, in todays newspaper "El Nacional" the main article tells about 54 cases submitted over the years at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-American_Court_of_Human_Rights_9299.html" title="Inter-American Court of Human Rights">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> against the actions of Chávez's government. We need a LOT of space to be able to responsibly inform about all the issues. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaracas1830_acdd.html" title="User:Caracas1830">Caracas1830</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Though I see how this article might violate WP:NPOV it would be objectionable to not show that Chavez has done things that have been criticised by the rest of the world. This is a fact. I would agree on any change that would make it obvious that this article is in fact a list of criticism that have been called to attention by nations/press/whomever as oppossed to being a criticism in itself.

<ul>
<li>Bryan, can you see a way to fix the title? We need a separate article because of the length of the main article. If it said something else (e.g.; "controversy" instead of "criticism"), would you find that POV? I fail to understand why "criticism" is POV, because it is what it is: a discussion of the substantial criticism, presented (hopefully) in a NPOV fashion. But considering your concern, can you suggest a better title? I've merged all the content from the main article into the daughter article, but since <a href="../../../e/n/a/User%7EEnano275_9ab8.html" title="User:Enano275">User:Enano275</a> fixed the reference links, it can easily be merged back if needed. But we're really trying to get the article down to FA size. BTW, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 03:38, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sandy, I appreciate the work you're doing on cutting the main article down to size, and I don't want to make it more difficult. The problem is not subarticles per se, but which subarticles. You can discuss criticisms in a neutral way, but if you do so ny isolating that discussion from the context provided by the main article, and without any opposing viewpoint also discussed, that is no longer neutral. If there was a subarticle called <i>Praise of Hugo Chávez</i>, wouldn't you think that was POV? The main article is long but it can and should be cut down substantially. I think the 'Criticisms of Wikipedia' article should be deleted as well. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>World, if we could cut down the (WAY TOO LONG) Presidency and Political Impact sections of the main article, perhaps we would be able to bring the Criticism content back to the main article. Yes, I think a Praise of article would be fine, as long as it's balanced by a Criticism of article. (But, so much of all that is written about Chavez on Wiki right now, except the Criticism of article, reads like an ad campaign for Chavez anyway, so that article isn't missing&#160;:-) Enano has completed the references, so moving text is now easier: would you be willing to help us reduce the size of the other sections? I'd be happy to see Criticism included in the main article: if we can shorten the article to something reasonable, then I'd opt to bring the Criticism back, since the brevity of the current Criticism section of the main article doesn't reflect the extent of controversy and criticism surrounding Chavez. On the other hand, there are a number of comments on the talk page of the Criticism article, indicaing areas that haven't been covered at all in criticism (and I can think of more, such as the mudslides), which I've found to be typical of that whole series of articles, so the Criticism article still has need for growth. So, again, I'm wondering if a new title would work? I'm doubting that the FA status of this article is maintainable, given that so much of the story was left out. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 11:58, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Politicians make speeches all the time, and apart from the likes of the Gettysburg I don't think an article on an individual speech is very useful. It appears that in this speech Chávez said nothing atypical for him, and the speech was not regarded as a notable part of the summit concerned. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think this speech is up there with a Gettysburg. The article fails to capture the effects but from what I understand at the 2005 UN World Summit their were policy shifts by many countries and Chavez's speech essentially offered the intellectual justification for these shifts (and was seen as such). We won't know for many years if the spread of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolivarian.html" title="Bolivarian">Bolivarian</a> ideas outside of Latin America turns out to have global implications, but the fact that it might makes this article clearly a notable historical event. <a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJbolden1517_d5f6.html" title="User:Jbolden1517">jbolden1517</a><sup><a href="../../../j/b/o/User_talk%7EJbolden1517_f2fb.html" title="User talk:Jbolden1517"><font color="DarkGreen">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:20, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing wrong with organizing information in as many ways as possible. That the list only has four entries is not a reason to delete it; it is a reason to expand it.

<li>And I explained how it wouldn't. Agglomerating already-available data does NOT constitute original research. In fact, that's what this whole encyclopedia is: an agglomeration of already-available data. Doing that is the OPPOSITE of original research--you're simply putting together data provided by others rather than going out and getting your own. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:35, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I beg to differ. In this case, imagine you are down to item 10 on the list. There are multiple references online to which is #10 let's say. And the 'real' one may not even be referenced anywhere. Then how would you resolve it? Then imagine you get to number 11, 12, 13 - the problem gets harder, exponentially as you go deeper down the list. These are not easy and simple references - this is absolute, and very hard, original work, and may easily be disputed as such also. This is not the normal encyclopedic process of collecting information about notable items. It is the very imprecise and controversial <i>ranking</i> process which is the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:56, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>We find contradictory sources all the time. What's any different about this? If it is impossible to come to a consensus, you just notate all the disputed entries. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 17:41, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are missing the point. The <i>ranking</i> is the issue. It's one thing for 2 editors to argue about whether source a or b are notable enough, and reach some consensus (which may change over time, and then source c may be added, etc.) Here the issue, again, is <i>ranking</i> - you will have to argue who is #8 and who is #9 etc. all with limited and conflicting information. It won't be even about opposing POVs - you'll have (say) 2 fairly reliable published sources conflicting about a company's size - whom do you believe? which numbers do you accept? once you open it up into <i>ranges</i> (which are controversial also), then the ranking becomes even more ill-defined mathematically. Of course any small change can immediately change all the deeper level in the ranking. IOW, IMO this is MI (Mission Impossible), <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to define a ranking, and gets tougher exponentially with every step. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And let me add again that not all organizations will publish their size - military forces come to mind. What do you do then? Use estimates? whose? and couple that into the main ranking problem... <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:15, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You don't understand NOR. Original research would be me going out and sending letters to everyone asking how many people they have working for them. Simply putting together numbers obtained by others is NOT original research. Crum is raising a good point about verifiability (although I don't think he realizes it), which is starting to give me second thoughts--but there are no NOR issues inherent to this list.<a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 21:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I should add to that that I don't entirely agree with the NOR policy anyway (and as a result I often try to keep articles that DO violate NOR), but that was never actually an issue with this article; those who claimed otherwise simply don't understand the policy. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 21:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree in the sense that NOR is kind of fuzzily defined, and can be stretched to kibosh almost any article on Wikipedia if anyone wanted to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (and to some extent, I do think it might not be OR, which is why I focused on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), but I don't think you realize that what you propose is a lot closer to your example of NOR than most of us are comfortable with. We're not supposed to be the source of first record on anything, and if we cobble together a bunch of disparate sources into the first cohesive list of its kind in the world, one which the companies on it will cite as being the "#8 largest employer in the world", that raises some issues as to whether we're really trying to follow our goal of building an encyclopedia, as opposed to an almanac or something else. (I HAVE seen at least one list cobbled together from different sources on a completely unrelated topic, one in which the main concern was that it was approaching cruft level, but I actually didn't think much about the issues raised here.) I should make clear that my vote has always been a keep on the condition that reliable sources be found to expand it on. I only want to delete if a) reliable sources can't be found (i.e., the sources you're looking for turn out to not be easily accessible or not existent at all) or b) any source turns out to be inherently unreliable, as has been raised here. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 23:53, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who says we have to? Why not just present each ranking on its own with information about where it came from? If a ranking is different from others because it uses different criteria, explain the difference. If we get several lists, presumably there will be some commonalities between them, and we can highlight those commonalities without establishing an explicit ranking of our own: "With an estimated 2.3 million active-duty troops, the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Liberation_Army_1d81.html" title="People's Liberation Army">People's Liberation Army</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> is considered by many to be a strong candidate for the world's largest employer, with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Department_of_Defense_5719.html" title="U.S. Department of Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> a reasonably close 2nd, although some list-makers dispute the notion that a nation's armed forces should be considered an "employer," and others lump all employees of a country's government into a single group for the purposes of ranking. Most list-makers consider <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</a> to be the world's largest private employer, although <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> can be said to rival it in size if the employees of all of the chain's independent franchisee restaurants are included in its total."

<ul>
<li>For the first few, say 3 or 4, it is possible to create a ranking, with a lot of qualifications that may tend to obscure the picture. When you get to higher numbers, I think the problem to present a fair ranking will get exponentially harder, with the picture to the casual reader becoming ever more obscure. Also, as someone else mentioned here, imagine the conflicts with other WP articles that claim a ranking.

<li>In general yes, but <i>rankings</i> of fuzzy values are extremely problematic. Of course you can refer to any published reliable source for such rankings if you can find it, but once you have several, and they differ (and they would by the nature of the fuzziness), it becomes confusing to the reader. It would be nice if you could point to an example anywhere on WP where this is done. And comparing <i>exact</i> values (like tallest buildings or largest countries by area) is not relevant here because they are not fuzzy. Note also that due to fuzziness the values will start becoming <i>ranges</i> (like 2.6-2.9) and then the comparison or ranking is even more ill defined, so this whole concept, regardless of the source, is shaky at best. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:43, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My concern is this: what if a company invents and heavily promotes via Web a new 'holiday'. Then WP picks it up, before it's really established, and once WP picks it up WP becomes a factor in its establishment. That would not be a passive observer role which WP should assume IMO, but a positive and active feedback role which it shouldn't. In a way WP becomes an advertizing tool. Assuming we don't want that role, I think it makes sense to be <i>really</i> sure a holiday (or similar) has taken root before accepting it on WP. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can accept AIGA being non-profit org, but non-profit can still be a business with advertizing and promotion needs. The issue here is the specific proclaimed holiday - is it something they just whipped up and are trying to promote or is it already established and recognized around the world. To verify it is truly established, I would have to see reliable record of several neutral parties around the world 'celebrating' it, as opposed to just a mention by some Web page that google-searched the date to see if anyone has a holiday claim, on an otherwise slow-news day. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:42, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Up till now, FPS fans had to live without such addictive supplements. DungeonDoom puts an end to this: The mod transforms Doom3 into an Ego-Diablo. PC Zone(UK) Feb 2006: ...it's strangely addictive once you get past the initial difficulty hurdle... Computer Gaming World Feb 2006 (2.5 of 5 stars): ...it's a frenzied meat grind from top to bottom... PC Action (Germany) Doom3 Special 2005: translated: Diablo 2 as a First Person Shooter?

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> - As stated, it's not as if there are not other mod articles. What sets Dungeon Doom apart is the fact that it was one of the most quickly built and most innovative mods yet, and it is fact that many other developers use this mod as a referance for getting certain aspects in their own mods.

<li><b>Weak delete OR weak keep with complete rewrite</b> (I know that's a weird vote.) The site's number of registered members (assuming the number is factual, which I will for this argument) qualifies as it as being notable enough for a WP article. However, the page as it stands is quite terrible. It really doesn't assert the site's importance at all. If the site's notability was <i>much</i> better asserted in the article (and if the article was cleaned up a lot, and if much of it was completely scrapped), I'd vote keep.

<dd>I have no axe to grind over this, I have no particular interest in micronations. But I think we need to consider what makes a micronation worthy enough to warrant a Wiki entry. For example, the Aerican Empire, which apparently recognises the Dominion of British West Florida, has existed, apparently, for 19 years. This would seem to catagorise these micronations as being similar to RPG games, which have numerous entries here <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 13:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would work for me as long as it was covered by a reliable source. Did you review the link to the Aerican Empire Afd? One alternative is to delete the article, but give the group an entry in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> article. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 14:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That would make sense, but the only problem I can see is that Sealand is both a micronation and a genuinely worthy article. This entry could slot into the micronation article fine. I think common sense shows that Sealand is worthy of an article, though. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 14:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Sealand is notable, having been covered by many reliable news outlets. Unless I've missed something, this one isn't, but micronations such as these may have exceptions. The Dominion appears to have had coins made by the Central Bank of the Grand Duchy of Westarctica. Can this be verified?

<li><b>Keep</b> If other micronations accept the claim of the Dominion of British West Florida as a valid micronation, I see no reason this can not have an article just like the other micronations in Wikipedia. I agree the historical claim is weak and downright ridiculous but separatists groups in Hawaii, Texas, and Alaska use some of the same weak arguments relating to illegal annexations in the 19th century and these groups are treated seriously by Wikipedia and not treated as hoaxes. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryQ_2d28.html" title="User:LarryQ">LarryQ</a> 14:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Note that the "Aerican Empire" article was deleted. Entities like Sealand, and the Republic of Texas separatists have appeared in newspapers, clashed with law enforcement, etc. Is there a reference anywhere in any legitimate news format (not counting their own website, and that blog, which is just someone commenting on the website) to the "Dominion of British West Florida"? There has to be a minimum notability requirement for "micronations". Otherwise anyone could make one up and get their own Wikipedia article.

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia still requires that you provide verifiability in your claims. Just because data is available widely does not mean that it is true or verifiable. One needs to cite their valid and verifiable sources. The problem with this article is that it comes from sources which use no valid research at all thus the article is based on conjecture and thus origional research. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 01:54, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is valid and verifiable that these are conspiracy theories. There are extensive resources to back up existence of the enumerated conspiracy theories provided in the article. <small>—204.42.17.16 17:32, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there is verifiable information that such a conspiracy theory exists but that does not make it encyclopedic. Anyone can have theories about anything but those theories are not encyclopedic because they exist. One must establish a reason for their encyclopedic nature. Either a theory has to have made a wide impact such as the Kennedy Assasination Conspiracy Theory or it has to be based on verifiable information but if a theory is based on verifiable information then it wouldn't really be a theory any longer. This consipiracy theory is neither widely believed or widely publicized and is not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 17:44, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Still does not establish notability of a theory. Rather, all those articles state are that there is unprovable controversy over the circumstances of his death. In one of your sources, you have a doctor who never saw his body contesting whether or not Berg was beheaded and was supported by a "forensic death expert" who's a doctor only because he holds a PhD and not a MD. In another of those articles which discusses the supposed Berg-Terrorist connection, the article specifically states "the feds(FBI) concluded he had never actually met Moussaoui, who had friends and roommates at the same college." Just because controversies exists does not make them notable...or credible but that's not what's being debated here anyway. My view on the deletion will remain. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 20:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, the articles do establish that there is unprovable controversy, i.e., conspiracy theories, over the circumstances of Nick Berg's death.

<li><b>Delete</b>: even if it isn't a copyvio, it strikes me as original research and borderline advertising. I am unconvinced that "customer relations management" isn't just an excessively abstract jargon phrase for "keeping your customers in a database," only here this mundane process is described with halo words like "holistic." Prior versions of the article were full vacuous prose such as "In today's competitive business environment. . .": but the closer it gets to plain English, the less seems to be there. Vizjim's remarks suggests that those who speak of "customer relations management" are <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatan.html" title="Charlatan">charlatans</a>, and nothing here really suggests otherwise. There is an awful lot of this sort of buzzword-laden process cruft in business articles recently, and we need to draw a line somewhere. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Some time ago, someone added the following text to the article:
<dl>
<dd><i>There is not much new about CRM, it is just a piece of new jargon with some useful, money making, side effects. First it lets a load of academics and consultants pontificate about nothing and pretend they have invented a new discipline. Second we can write lots of expensive software to help you "do" CRM. Of course astute business men have applied the concept of “customer relationship management” for hundreds, probably thousands of years. Ever since they recognised the value of a special relationship - “To you my boy I got a special price for this flint axe, not even two cows, ‘cause you buy so many of these fine weapons it is just one cow and a bushel of gain.”</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Obviously, this needs to be reworded before being reincluded into the article, but it does suggest that my perception of the kind of prose in the article is not completely idiosyncratic. When an article is proposed for deletion, I tend to go through a two step process. First, is the subject worthy of an article? I am defiantly liberal about this step. Second, is the existing text at the page helpful to someone who wants to whip it into a good article? I have had my eye on this article for some time now, and I am still not convinced that it is. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I agree with you on those two points. It is clear that much of the article has either been written by industry wonks who are full of marketing fluff, else cynics.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Note I belong to one of the groups in question and therefore a bit biased (but how can you tell who is or isn't on this list anyway), but I sincerely believe at least one of the groups is notable enough to remain on Wikipedia. Also it should be noted that the previous vote for the Clock Crew was done when their website was down and they were falsely considered to be a dead group. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">Cableshaft</a> - 23 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The clock crew has gone on for years and years, and isn't really just a part of "newgrounds" anymore. It's developed its own personallity. Heck, even if it didn't have NG it'd still be going just the same. The other groups, as a result, are the same thing. They aren't reliant on Newgrounds and as a result shouldn't just be merged into the Newgrounds article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.173.248.197 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.173.248.197.html" title="User talk:70.173.248.197">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.173.248.197_8fe2.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.173.248.197">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Website vanity" is publishing a Wikipedia article about your personal website because nobody visits it and you're looking to get more hits. Some forum someone just starts up on InvisionFree or something is not notable and would be website vanity. However, groups on Newgrounds (especially the Clock Crew) have histories all their own, often separate from goings-on at Newgrounds entirely. This article is not about a website--it is about a large community of animators, akin to what the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant_Farm_%28group%29_cae5.html" title="Ant Farm (group)">Ant Farm (group)</a> was, except most publicity it recieves is on the Internet, and it's far larger. Ultimately, a group of artists who come together to make a variation on a sort of art. Architecture is to "fringe architecture" as animation is to "Clock/Lock/Glock animation." If you're looking for some hard evidence of notability, one member of the Clock Crew once donned a StrawberryClock suit and passed out fliers on the streets of Dublin, Ireland. There is video of this event if you would care to see it. <a href="../../../6/2/b/User%7E62bda02.html" title="User:62bda02">62bda02</a> - 23 May 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Actually</b> - Actually what you are describing is spam, not vanity. Vanity guidelines state that "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created." This article has been solely written and maintained by such people. Hence, vanity article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:51, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, this article has not been "solely written and maintained" by such people. Care to address how <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillpg_d182.html" title="User:Billpg">User:Billpg</a>, creator of the page, is writing about himself or something he's created? His user page and blog mention nothing of these groups, and it appears he mostly only cares about Newgrounds. Additionally, with the exception of the Glock Group and Star Syndicate vandalism, these people aren't writing about themselves or what they have done. They are writing about what other people have done in a group that they either are a member of or have seen significantly while visiting Newgrounds.

<dd>Yeah, I'm too afraid to contribute anything but typos or grammar fixes on this site since it seems just about anything related to the internet gets branded with "non-notable" and deleted on here. I just don't have the time or the stamina other people on this site have to hunt down what I consider to be false or missing information, find an online article that makes the claim I'm looking for, and use it to justify the edit. - <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">Cableshaft</a> - 23 May 2006

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - why delete, these things exist, and existance is reason to be included in wikipedia, isn't wikipedia supposed to be a user based all encompassing encyclopedia, if so, then why deny the existence of such groups, that would be like saying nazism doesn't exist because people didn't like it, keep it, and if this is vanity, then delete the several articles pertaining the single characters of flash animation including the animators/artists, because that would be considered vanity in that cause <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalteseclock_a18b.html" title="User:Malteseclock">Malteseclock</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalteseclock_dacb.html" title="User talk:Malteseclock">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malteseclock_ee68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malteseclock">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - As has been said before, these groups are a well known section of the site, Newgrounds.com. The information mentioned in it are based on actual events. Also, the groups have tried before to make independent articles regarding these groups, however, each time they were either deleted or merged into this section article. These groups represent a large faction within the subculture of Newgrounds and should be mentioned so that persons wishing to learn more about this subculture can better understand it. So since this can be used by persons to learn more information, it should stay due to its own merits towards better informing persons interested in Newgrounds and the internet culture that has grown around it. WinchesterLock 23 May 2006</li>
<li>""Very Strong Keep""* - There are articles regarding all kinds of web fads and trends, and this site actually gave me a good bit more insight into the clock crew. I see no valid reason for it's deletation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.162.231.120 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.162.231.120_e152.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.162.231.120">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article serves as an accompaniment to the main Newgrounds article as the Something Awful Forums article does to the Something Awful article. If a list of minor characters from Danny Phantom warrants an article, why not four prolific groups of flash animators? The article on Jonti Picking, creator of Weebl and Bob, was nominated for deletion, but kept because Weebl and Bob is so prolific. This was aside from the fact that Weebl and Bob has an article of it's own. Dan Paladin, a talented animator who co-created a videogame for PS2 Gamecube and Xbox, was a prominent member of the Clock Crew. The Clock Crew sparked Dan's interest in the character Tricky the Clown, who makes a cameo appearance in the game. Moreover, most of the groups exist independantly from Newgrounds, utilizing their own websites, and sites such as FlashPortal, SheezyArt, and DeviantArt, to funnel flash output. If Newgrounds went down, these groups would stay up. Biddynorris 23 May 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - <i>I wish to note that by following the same reason that is expressed by <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> that it seems that a page that discusses the accomplishments of groups should not be listed on Wikipedia and thus using that same logic that all discussions of all military battles and skirmishes should also be deleted from the site as well because they discuss accomplishments of groups of people.</i> <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a>, do you now see how absurd your reason for deletion is now? It isn't a matter of site vanity, it is a matter of letting people know more about the groups that are so influential on Newgrounds and in internet pop culture. I have sent persons interested in what the groups are about to this page in discussion and they learned more about the groups and thus got a better understanding of Newgrounds and its history. I happen to believe that any article that gives information that wouldn't have been known otherwise and that properly expands knowlege of the topic to these unknowing individuals is worthy of keeping. On a side note, why should it matter if persons have made posts on a forum in regards to this matter. As long as the reasons that they mention in this discussion are not abusive, they have every right to speak their thoughts regarding the matter. In the words of Alexander Hamilton, "Those who stand for nothing fall for anything." So it is better to speak your mind on the matter and let one's own voice be heard rather than sit idly by and watch persons that appears to not understand the groups' importance in the flash community in general. But I digress and offer another idea, rather than a deletion, why not just separate the Clock Crew and Lock Legion from this Newgrounds Groups listing and allow separate listings since they are also well known of on other major flash sites such as SheezyArt, DeviantArt, and Flash Portal. WinchesterLock 24 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Guidelines Argument For Keeping</b> - There are several separate claims for deleting the article, and I would like to address each according to the actual text on their corresponding guideline articles on Wikipedia. They are as follows: <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">cableshaft</a> 08:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Website Vanity/Notability - <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Vanity Guidelines</a> First of all this page HAS had vanity edits, and is in need of severe editing, though that does not mean it must be deleted. Also, "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article." The consensus for websites is under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which also addresses notability, so we should use this as our guideline.</dd>
<dd>2. Importance - Also, the same article on vanity states that "As explained below, vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> is." According to that link, "An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true: 1. There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)." The Clock Crew in particular, but the Lock Legion and Star Syndicate to a lesser extent, are well-known on Newgrounds, at the very least, a flash community website whose notability has already been established. As a result, the link states that "If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being: 1. of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or 3. obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)" But as the link says, it still may fall under other deletion criteria.</dd>
<dd>3. Fancruft - Cruft can be removed, and according to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a> - "Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion." So this cannot be the reason for deletion.
<ul>
<li>So back to notability. The guideline for this is on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. According to it, "Web specific-content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, ... through ... an online publisher." Additionally, this has a subscript that "Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion...Such distributions should be nontrivial. Although GeoCities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial." They discount Newgrounds as trivial, and rightly so, as everything on that site is submitted by its users. However, there is, at the very least, some content made by the Clock Crew that is distributed by hundreds, if not thousands, of independent online sites outside of Newgrounds, the vast, vast majority of which do not accept submissions. Here are four examples: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clock+sim+valentine%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clock+sim+valentine%22" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clockland%22+%22lost+files%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clockland%22+%22lost+files%22" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22cc+fight+club%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22cc+fight+club%22" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clock+legends%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22clock+legends%22" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Again, this is rather debateable, and depends on your definition of 'nontrivial'. According to the online dictionaries, at least, nontrivial means "Not trivial; of some importance" And the importance of these groups have been established in 2.* Also, I agree that any unsourced information in the article needs to be deleted. The article has bloated significantly from its inception, much of it by people unaware of this criteria. Again, that does not mean the entire article needs to be removed. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">cableshaft</a> 08:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - It amazes me that this is even an issue. These groups exist and create large numbers of animations every day. There have been two clock crew entries on the front page of newgrounds this week alone, the one that's currently there according to my research that has more than thirteen thousand views. How is it that anyone can refuse to acknowledge the existence of these groups? I can agree that using it to showcase the group's flash is not good policy but to use that as grounds for completely disacknowledging it is asinine. What you're suggesting is like saying that we shouldn't have a page on the Nazi party because some nazis would like to promote themselves. If there would be an unbiased chronicling of the clock crew perhaps with the help of some of its older/founding members to show the concept of the clock crew, the development of characters, etc. then that should be allowed and acceptable. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Deer_bfe6.html" title="User:Peter Deer">Peter Deer</a> 12:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - These groups have had combined memberships in the thousands. Google tests show that Clockcrew has 15,000 results alone. Surely the popularity should speak for itself. While it's not the most popular cult/fad/etc but combined at least they are definitly notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelardore_3570.html" title="User:Celardore">Celardore</a> 14:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> - Why don't you guys just put this kind of stuff on your userpages? That way you can put almost anything you want there and it won't have to be in the main WP space or comply to WP standards. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:51, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This has nothing to do with the discussion at hand. Just about anything can be put on your user page, and the fact that you can does not have any bearing on whether or not this page should be deleted. As an example, thousands of people have a healthy interest in the C++ programming language, and might want to put information on it on their user pages, does that mean that the C++ programming language article should be deleted? <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">cableshaft</a> 17:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - Actually, that was an idea taken from your BBS, so I was just throwing it out there, too. Your analogy doesn't really work though, as C++ is not a thing the editors of that article created or are a member of. I think our current situation would be more like someone writing about a program they coded in C++. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> - So basically what you're saying is that if the creator of C++ decided to make an article about the language here then it would be deleted, but if a random guy made one with the exact same information it wouldn't? Nuril</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This isn't an argument, but you might want to take into consideration the massive amount of vandalism this page has to endure daily. Before this page was created, the same people who vandalise this page currently used to vandalise the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> page with the same information. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newgrounds&amp;offset=20060115172902&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newgrounds&amp;offset=20060115172902&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> . The Newgrounds page has been relatively vandal-free since this page was created. Deleting this page will only redirect their attention back to that article. Is it better to have a more visible page constantly hammered with this excessive information, or to have a sub-page for groups of tenuous notability that will get maybe 1/10th the traffic of the Newgrounds page would get? Again, this isn't an argument, just something to keep in mind. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECableshaft_998a.html" title="User:Cableshaft">cableshaft</a> 17:53, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - Vandalism shouldn't be taken into account for AFD. Many of the most promiment articles of every subject are vandalized daily, but a solution is not to create other articles for those people to vandalize instead. But, yeah, I realize that that "isn't an argument" as you said. Anyways, I'm gonna stop hogging the AFD for awhile and wait for others to bring forth their opinions. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While I don't feel that individual groups are worthy of articles, I feel that the sum of these groups and the phenomenon of groups themselves are notable. In addition, the main Newgrounds article would be too long if this were merged back in, even if trimmed. I would also like to echo the vandalism comments of "Cableshaft" above. One motivation to creating this article was to contain the petty bikering. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillpg_d182.html" title="User:Billpg">Billpg</a> 23:22, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I suggest a strong <b>keep</b> again. There are so many less notable groups included in the wikipedia with far less argument about their inclusion. I'd say keep, again, this group of groups is notable even if individualy they are not. Given a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> ClockCrew is notable at least... Then there are the Lock Legion and so on. I say KEEP.

<li><b>Response</b> - I don't really think the Google test is really applicable for proving notability.

<p>This article was proposed for deletion (prod) and un-done by the author. Though this topic probably merits an article, this is not it. It is badly written, the grammar and punctuation are incorrect, it is not wikified, does not provide sources, and in general it does not read as an encyclopedia article should. Aside from being tagged with various templates, only one editor has ever worked on it, leading me to question its notability. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rom</i></a><font color="green"><i><b>a</b></i></font><a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rin</i></a><a href="../../../r/o/s/Image%7ERosemary_white_bg.jpg_1abf.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bb/Rosemary_white_bg.jpg/15px-Rosemary_white_bg.jpg" alt="" width="15" height="27" longdesc="../../../r/o/s/Image%7ERosemary_white_bg.jpg_1abf.html" /></a><small><a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomarin_fbee.html" title="User talk:Romarin">[<i>talk to her</i> ]</a></small> 04:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> pn; grammar and punctuation are very bad, the article is POV and unwikified. Nothing has been done to improve it in weeks despite the tags.

<dd>What's more "tin can sailors" just means sailors on a destroyer, it is not the name of a given naval battle (the title of the article is therefore highly inapropriate). There were many destroyers during WWII, and therefore many tin can sailors were involved in many battles (<a href="http://tin-can.org/newbattles.htm" class="external text" title="http://tin-can.org/newbattles.htm" rel="nofollow">a few examples here</a>). I don't even know which battle this refers to, as there aren't any dates! The article would therefore need to be moved to a better title to be understandable, but considering the poor quality of its content it is surely best to create a brand new article under the correct title. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 04:53, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, in this case of people whose nicknames end in "zza". There appears to be no collective name for these nicknames, so the current inappropriate title can not be changed. Nothing can sensibly link to this article. <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazza.html" title="Gazza">Gazza</a>, a disambiguation page, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> link here, but the latter article already contains the same information - that his nickname is "Prezza". This article was originally called <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezza.html" title="Hezza">Hezza</a> but that was made a redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Heseltine_7c96.html" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a> and the material moved here. However, see discussion on <a href="../../../h/e/z/Talk%7EHezza_90f0.html" title="Talk:Hezza">Talk:Hezza</a>. <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 08:21, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have done my best on <a href="../../../h/e/z/Talk%7EHezza_90f0.html" title="Talk:Hezza">Talk:Hezza</a> and Talk:Gazza (nickname) to help the people intere4rsted in this article to improve it, but it has just become a longer list of indiscriminate information.

<li>In fact it is "others" who have joined in and added to the article. There is no other reference work which makes the link from Bazza to Gazza. Gazz and Hezza both have entries in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. Gazza is widely listed in British lexicons and there are plenty of reputabale works that collect together this sort of slang. The recent BBC series "Balderdash and Piffle" highlighted the interest in how words/forms came to be coined. "Gazza" is not in fact a passing fad in the UK. And there's a long article about "Gazzagate" that is far less interesting! --<a href="../../../i/x/i/User%7EIXIA_d986.html" title="User:IXIA">IXIA</a> 13:00, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, mentioning that Paul Gascoigne (sp?) is called Gazza is enough, there's no need for a separate article about his nickname. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The hypocoristic article is after improvement, and is a good location for this kind of information. <a href="../../../d/i/m/Diminutive.html" title="Diminutive">Diminutive</a> does not cover name-derived <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknames</a> well enough. Examples of hypocoristics may be non-notable, but they're studied in ancient societies, and information like IXIA's above would be relevant in that article. As for discoverability, there's already a disambiguation page, and I'd expect most people search for Gazza rather than Gascoigne (it's hard to spell). --Mark 16:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article has now been condensed. It is not about Gazza per se, but the trend that it gave rise to and (thanks to most helpful advice from - ironically - Bduke above) details of the link to "Bazza" which is not widely known or written about). The term "not notable" has arisen before and yet lexicographers, etc deal with this sort of thing very day of the week and there are many books covering precisley this kind of usage. Could anyone think of a better title? --<a href="../../../i/x/i/User%7EIXIA_d986.html" title="User:IXIA">IXIA</a> 17:05, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Why should anyone type in "Gazza (nickname)"? Also something similar has already been done with <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezza.html" title="Hezza">Hezza</a>, but some people want a general article.</li>
<li>"Most people search for Gazza". Indeed, so why are all the others mentioned? How do people get to this article if they are not interested in "Gazza", but in "Macca"? It is wider in scope.</li>

<li>Yes, I did suggest the Australian connection on <a href="../../../h/e/z/Talk%7EHezza_90f0.html" title="Talk:Hezza">Talk:Hezza</a>, but it is unsourced and only an idea.

<li>Nobody has given sound reasons to keep it and many have given sound reasons to delete. The article has not been improved, so I conclude <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:09, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>To meet Bdukes's concern about the title a similar article has been established as <a href="../../../z/z/a/Zza_nicknames.html" title="Zza nicknames">Zza nicknames</a>. There is no reason why Wikipedia should not be creative in this regard since, as has been noted above, this is a unique article. There is perhaps an argument about links, but that could be overcome with imagination. It is not true that the article has not been improved; a number of changes have been made to meet Bduke's curiously insistent concerns and he has in fact kindly helped in that regard. Earlier comments, when Bduke first proposed the article for deletion, was far from overwhelming in favour of discarding. Ultimately this is not <i>that</i> important - it's not quantum physics - but Wikipeadia would be the poorer if it could not accommodate articles of this kind which do contain the sort of material that gets intself into many British books about popular language. In fact this is probably the most comprehensive article on the "subject" in existence - and, indeed, had been more detailed until curtailed to meet concerns which were partly understandable. The article is not offensive in any way, not does it get in the way of anything. Still, there it is: the fact that this has generated so much debate tends to detract from the notion of its being of marginal interest. Not sure what happens now ... --<a href="../../../i/x/i/User%7EIXIA_d986.html" title="User:IXIA">IXIA</a> 14:09, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b> This article contains a small history of OTserv and the basics on how to use it. Its setup isn't the greatest, but nontheless it does supply information - which is the whole point behind having an encyclopedia article, is it not? And you could say that this article is an advertisement, but I could also say you're wrong. Anyway, OTServ is not a product. It isn't sold, it isn't traded for something else, and it is productive. So advertising this wouldn't actually get us anywhere, would it? Seems kinda silly to think so. It would seem that support goes for deleting this article, but I am willing to bet that these are people who have barely read the article or have no clue what OTServ really is or any of that. ~nfries88</li>

<p>From the author, jonsmirl 22 May 2006</p>
<p>The article is a year old and not considered new research any more. I never considered it research to begin with, it is a survey of the state of graphics technology on Linux.</p>
<p>When it was first written it was well publicised and it has been referenced by a dozen papers during the last year. As far as I know it is the most complete description of Linux graphics in existence. I'm trying to find a permanent place to put it so that the historical information it contains won't get lost. Multiple translations are also available.</p>
<p>It doesn't contain standard footnotes, instead everything is linked to the original sources. I have received no objections from any of the sources linked.</p>
<p>I moved it <a href="http://jonsmirl.googlepages.com/graphics.html" class="external text" title="http://jonsmirl.googlepages.com/graphics.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but this constant bouncing around between hosts is equivalent to it being deleted. It is linked from close to 1,000 places in google to the freedesktop.org site but they don't want it anymore and deleted it there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, original research is defined as being analysis or synthesis introduced in the article itself rather than from any external sources, even if sourced information is used to justify your analysis and synthesis. Age has nothing to do with it. In other words, Wikipedia should not be the primary home of an essay that introduces its own analysis and synthesis. An article reporting on a similar essay that's published elsewhere would be valid, however. Read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> if you desire more information. Even if it's published elsewhere, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a place to publish verbatim copies of such essays (also see <a href="../../../n/p/s/WP%7ENPS_2b55.html" title="WP:NPS">WP:NPS</a>, which is titled "Don't include copies of primary sources"). If your essay is as well-publicised as you say it is, you might look into using <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikisource</a>. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">jgp</a> 18:44, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry if I was unclear but one of my employees at FCF created my page, not me.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think his notability trumps the potential faux pas of creating an article about oneself.

That being said, I stand by my first statement, and I will always say that artists are underrepresented here due to systemic bias. If it takes an artist making his own entry to get him here, I can live with that.

<li><b>Point of Information.</b> How does the nomination of this article contribute to the idea of systemic bias?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I think that the typical active user here is inclined to favor articles they deem worthy or appropriate; for example, there is a proliferation of articles about exceedingly minor technical phenomena, and all kinds of cruftish minutae (and I mean that in the warmest way possible) but similarily minor artists are usually treated as deletion fodder. That is systemic bias.</dd>
<dd>Notability arguments per Bwithh in this AfD are weak, considering his accomplishments. Also, they are inaccurate and indicate a dismissive attitude toward the arts. Shoot first, ask questions later. He directed a music video for a major recording artist, and has a feature length film that screened in UK theatres. How does that equal "a couple of shorts"?</dd>
<dd>As to the comment of Brimba, the criteria for speedily deleting an article based on being a recreation hinges on it being "substantially identical" to the original article, which according to <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> an admin is responsible for determining. In other words, not me, and not Brimba. If it is determined to be the same article again, then I will accept its deletion.

<dd><b>Follow-on.</b> Need for clarification:
<ol>
<li>Could you give examples of the <i>"cruftish minutae"</i> you alluded to? <i>(Since I am asking, my contributions are fair game for illustrative purposes.)</i> Perhaps it will help explain how this nomination contributes to the notion of systemic bias, a question which has yet to be answered.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't have any specific examples, and certainly not within your contributions. I certainly didn't mean to imply a personal bias on your part; only a systemic bias. I am speaking of things like articles for specific video game maps, articles for minor television characters, etc. The community in general will come out in strong support of things like this (as well they should) but not of similarly minor cultural contributors. Is that more clear? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 16:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As for the <i>"...arguments per Bwithh in this AfD are weak, considering his accomplishments..."</i> remark, whose accomplishments are you referring to? Bwithh, or the subject of this AfD?</li>

<ol>
<li>It seems that there is some conflation related to the deletion review process. Articles which have been deleted can be recreated [at will]; however, reversing (i.e. <i>"resurrecting"</i>) a deleted entry requires a deletion review. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 15:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I agree, thus my point that it is up to an admin to determine if the article has been recreated or reversed. If you view the article Richard Booth from the old AfD, it still shows the current iteration. I am unaware of a way to view the previously deleted iteration for comparison's sake. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 16:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>More Follow-on.</b> It is clear as he light of day that this article is substantially similar to the deleted article, and should have been sent to a deletion review before being resurrected here. No one should have taken it upon themselves to over ride an AFD conclusion. It is not an excessive burden to send it to review. It is disrespectful to the other editors who took the time to review the original and vote, to say that their votes mean nothing, and you will over ride them because you know better then they what should be included in WP. As per what you said: <i>“which according to <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> an admin is responsible for determining.

<li>How is it clear as the light of day? Do you have a record of the previously deleted article?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well said. We have all stated our opinions and the consensus seems to be that the article needs to be deleted. I stand by my claim that systemic bias exists for artists, whether you want to admit it or not. I am not compelled to examine your contributions, because one person's contributions do not tell us much when discussing a community-wide idea. I sincerely apologize for anything that you construed as a smear.</dd>
<dd>Further, you requested this page be deleted because its recreation violated process; you have yet to address my question as to how you have established that. This AfD turned into half process debate/half notability debate, so I am curious about why we are really deleting this article. If it is deleted because it was illegally recreated (meaning it is "substantially identical") then I think it is appropriate for me to re-write it, establishing notability. You can note that I'm "determined to recreate this entry" all day. While you're at it, note that I'm determined to make Wikipedia the best place I can, by opposing deleting of articles I think benefit the community. If it is deleted because the community decides it lacks notability, then I will let it lie. As a side note, the credibility of your process arguments is severely diminished in my opinion, due to your voting twice in your own AfD. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 14:28, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entry should be deleted. Rolando Carbonell should not be included in the canon of Writers from the Philippines. Respected writers and critics dismiss his works. He is not included in significant studies and anthologies in Philippine literature in English. He does not have any national or international reputation as a writer.

<li><b>Comment</b> He has two books listed on Amazon, but the only info Amazon has on them is that they were published. It has no information on the <i>content</i> of the books. In addition, both books are out of print, and nobody else is selling them through Amazon.

<li><b>Delete</b> Ignoring the nominator's claims (not they are necessarily invalid), the article does not assert sufficient notability. Just because he's written books is not proof that anyone has read them. "Rolando Carbonell" gets only 50 Google hits, and "Rolando A. Carbonell" gets only 26. Even if he's from the Philippines, he's contemporary enough that a notable writer/poet should get far more Google hits than that. In addition, the external links are to a high school's web site and to a Geocities page, and neither of those are "reliable sources" which assert importance. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 13:31, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Week delete</b> <s><b>Weak keep</b></s> based on having two books published. It makes sense that a Philippine writer published in the 1960s would likely not have much Google presence.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are numerous anthologies of Philippine Literature in English or Philippine Poetry in English since 1898 (Works by important writer-critics like <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemino_Abad_ea49.html" title="Gemino Abad">Gemino Abad</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/e/Bienvenido_Lumbera_8a5f.html" title="Bienvenido Lumbera">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, Leonard Casper, Doreen Fernandez, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Bresnahan_6c91.html" title="Roger Bresnahan">Roger Bresnahan</a>, Isagani Cruz, Ophelia Alcantara-Dimalanta, Caroline Hau, Roland Tolentino, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Neil_Garcia_1c53.html" title="J. Neil Garcia">J. Neil Garcia</a> and many others, for instance). There are numerous articles, theses and other studies on what is generally accepted as important authors long before the age of internet. Filipino authors who emerged before World War II like Paz Marquez Benitez, Francisco Arcellana, N.V.M. Gonzalez, Nick Joaquin, Bienvenido Santos and Jose Garcia Villa are still being studied extensively in universities offering courses in Philippine literature including UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, University of Hawaii, Cornell University and several others. Remarkably, there isn't a single major anthology, textbook or course in these universities that has included Mr. Carbonell. Considering that Mr. Carbonell is still alive, there should be discussion about his work if he is important enough as a writer. But nothing is being discussed about him. Ask any Philippine Studies scholar or critic anywhere in the world. His 2 books were vanity publications. Mr. Carbonell was never published by any major publisher in the Philippines and anywhere else. - <a href="../../../7/2/5/User%7E7258.html" title="User:7258">7258</a> 14:05, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Amusingly, the second link on the page is to a library, which notes that nobody has ever borrowed Mr Carbonell's volume. A Google search for Horizon Books, Manila, turns up only Mr Carbonell's books. All of this seems to back up <a href="../../../7/2/5/User%7E7258.html" title="User:7258">7258</a>'s assertions regarding notability. If anyone can provide sources for this article beyond what's already been supplied, then my vote could be swayed, but right now there's nothing out there. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:18, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I was going for delete, because the article doesn't provide substantiation of any significant status. However, "Respected writers and critics dismiss his works" indicates that he is actually known, as unknown writers don't get their work dismissed, so I would like an explanation of this. We are not here after all to evaluate the quality of his poetry.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:40, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I should have earlier used the word "ignored", not "dismissed" to describe his presence as a writer. It seems rather strange that although he has been published since 1960s, his works have never been included in important studies and discussions on Philippine writers, whether in a positive or negative way. No one considers him important enough to be discussed by artists and scholars of note. - <a href="../../../7/2/5/User%7E7258.html" title="User:7258">7258</a> 05:56, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Carbonell does not have an "alternative" or underground" reputation. "Notorious" writers and artists who rebel against the prevailing established aesthetic styles and forms are widely covered by Filipino and international experts on Philippine Studies. Examples of these alternative and underground artists (who eventually became mainstream) are David Cortes Medalla, Victor Nadera (or Vim Nadera), <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Zafra_ccc5.html" title="Jessica Zafra">Jessica Zafra</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paolo_Manalo_a75d.html" title="Paolo Manalo">Paolo Manalo</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Vergara_94fe.html" title="Carlo Vergara">Carlo Vergara</a>. Though initially ignored by mainstream crtics, these artists had massive cult following that eventually forced the prevailing literary and cultural establishment to take note of their works seriously. Carbonell never had a cult following. He was never discussed positively or negatively by the major critics. As one entry had put it, his book has been in the Ateneo High School library since 1961 and yet, no one has borrowed it. - <a href="../../../7/2/5/User%7E7258.html" title="User:7258">7258</a> 13:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not even sure exactly what this is an article for. Is it for a music scene or is it for a style of clothing? The article is based on Original Research and the Sources don't point to what the article is about. There's nothing on Hot Topic's website that I can find that mentions "Urban Goth", The link to the Will Cristopher book review uses the following adjectives "heavy" and "urban" with the noun "Goth" to describe the mood of the novels, it doesn't specify a new genre classification "Urban Goth". The Urban Goth Apparel website is a normal online Gothic clothing website. The Artamatik source simply gives a link to the same Urban Goth Apparel website I just mentioned. The two Alexandre Plokohov articles don't mention anything about "Urban Goth", he's a designer who makes "Goth-influenced" clothing. The candisc.com link appears to be a CD/DVD replicating website that mentions its replicated cds for a number of different genres "ranging from rock to country, jazz to hip hop, and classical to urban goth"... It seems rather obvious that urban goth here isn't referring to a specific genre dependent of Goth, but again, an adjective before the noun Goth. It appears to me that most of the citation was taken at random from a simple search on a search engine for anything that had both the words "Urban" and "Goth".--<a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrift__b1af.html" title="User:Adrift*">Adrift*</a> 18:21, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Have you read some of its entries? Here's one for the 3rd entry to Cyber Goth on the Urban Dictionary: <i>Usually either very tall or short, so will wear massive boots to make them selfs look either REALLY tall or just a bit smaller than everyone else. Is also usually more arrogant than normal goths, ie will only talk to you if you like anything really dark or horrible, or like put fuck loads of drugs down your throught every weekend. note: can also be pronounced cyber-gaff just for a laff. even more basically, a goth who goes to raves "oi hugo, get that puppie out of the oven, you fucking crazy cyber-goth!"</i></li>

<li>I love <i>The Simpsons</i> with a fiery passion- Matt Groening is a god. With that said, I have no choice but to vote <b>delete</b>, as this really is an indiscriminate info collection. There are hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of one-off characters. For every Frank Grimes, there are dozens of characters who had one line. What about guest stars? They're one-time characters. This list could go on and on, and the point is that if none of the characters would be notable enough for a WP article by themselves, the sum of these characters does not equal a single notable article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 18:05, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why on earth is this even being considered for deletion? The basis that "there's so many one time characters in the Simpsons that it doesn't even matter" is absurd. It completely contradicts the entire purpose of Wikipedia, which is to bring people <b>ALL</b> forms <b>valid</b> of information available. A listing of characters that actually appeared on the show, even if it was once is <b>valid</b> information. I really think more people need to take the time to really understand what the word "fancruft" means. A listing of characters who actually appeared on the show isn't fancruft, thats just general information...I can't make up the fact Allison Taylor was actually a character on the show even if she appeared only once. What if some person came on the website, and thought "I wonder what was the name of so and so from that episode where Lisa meets her match." and find that this character has no page of their own...and that the character isn't even listed in a list. This isn't Simpsoncruft, its a general list of one time characters BECAUSE of the fact they don't require their own individual pages. Where else is that information going to be put if thats the case other than a single list? . This list is neither pointless nor is it fan based, its a general listing of characters who don't need their own page. This page is not just for the die hard Simpsons fans, the show is so well known and everyone has some fond memory of it that they'll no doubt come to wikipedia to look up some random bit of information on it and one time characters fits that bill. Thats the whole reason I made the character template, so that not only are the individual profiles easilly accessed....but the lists to the minor charactes not listed there are also ready for easy access. This isn't maintaining valid information folks, this is blatantly sacrificing the integrity of a wikipedia meta-article for the sake of cleanliness. Its not right. This doesn't conflict with what wikipedia is not at all because its all basic and valid information. What are we just going to just pretend whole characters don't exist just because they don't warrent their own page? If anything, thats against what wikipedia is. Yes, there's Simpson websites where this information can be accessed...but since when did Wikipedia become a place that tells people looking for info on something to "look somewhere else". I mean..honestly. If a character that doesn't warrent their own page gets one we'll deal with it (like the case with Ling Bouvier), but deleting this whole page because its supposedly "irrelevant" is irresponsible. --<a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosuki_aad2.html" title="User:Kiyosuki">Kiyosuki</a> 01:03, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, the purpose of Wikipedia is <b>not</b> "to bring people <b>ALL</b> forms <b>valid</b> of information available."

We can certainly discuss whether this particular article is encyclopedic or not, but it is plain wrong to say Wikipedia's mission is to include all valid forms of information.

<dd>The fact of the matter is, is that if this place is supposed to be an encyclopedia...the deletion of this page would be a terrible waste of valid information that exists whether people like it or not. If this was a page about something that was really unecessary like complete fan created info or every single character ever including background characters, then it'd be different. But these are characters that as stated...had an impact on the episode they were in even if it was only one. They had personalities, voices, and a purpose. The deletion of this page is a total lack of foresight and common sense. Everyone would constantly come and create either this page, or individual pages for whatever character they didn't find on here over and over again. Its stuff that was actually in the show, and had some weight so its not just going to go away. I admit that my opinion of what this place is isn't flawless, but I whole heartedly think its more accurate than the nearsighted logic behind the decision to question this page's validity.--<a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosuki_aad2.html" title="User:Kiyosuki">Kiyosuki</a> 12:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've reverted to a version before the following was all done:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*I say keep it. A fine addition to the academic fortitude of this online institution. Without the entry of Bentley Staunch this online database borderd on the realms of academic suicide (comment from User:67.68.47.60, replacing the first comment from <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">User:Kicking222</a>)</i><br />
<i>* It's true; Bentley Staunch is the leading voice of conservatism in Tulsa, Oklahoma and perhaps even nationwide. There's so few google hits because Mr. Staunch doesn't believe in the internet (he thinks that sharing information for free is just one step away from Leninism). (comment from User:70.29.55.131, replacing the original deletion reason)</i><br />
<i>*<b>Comment</b> Bravo Mr. Fox. I say the level of grassroots support seen from the moral majority (if i may quote the late Richard Nixon) in cyberspace, despite the inherent socialist bias of the medium, is no doubt indicative that the real majority in America may be tuned into Mr. Staunch through the internet, but rather, we connect with Mr. Staunch through something far more inportant, our hearts. May I remind you that George Washington once said of situations like this:</i><br /></p>
<pre>
   "Thou who, sinless, yet hast known
        All of man’s infirmity!
        Then, from Thine eternal throne,
        Jesus, look with pitying eye."
                
</pre>
<p><i>I think the use who put this entry up for deletion needs to read the previous passage very seriously. (comment from User:67.68.47.60, represented as being from <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">User:Kicking222</a>)</i><br /></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> The basis for this deletion is that non-notability is a reason for deletion - and I agree the article is nn. However, <b>there is no policy against nn content.</b> Let me repeat: Content is not invalid because it is nn. Since WP has a policy about <i>everything,</i> there would surely be policy if this were the consensus. There is no shortage of long-standing nn articles. ([[%100_hamburger]]) What makes this one different? In order to be deleted, an article must contain one of the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion#Problem_articles_that_may_require_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion#Problem_articles_that_may_require_deletion" rel="nofollow">Problems that may require deletion</a>], an element of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> or another policy. See <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. If an article can be written about every <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">simpsons</a> character, (which the previous article encourages!) why not a little known interpretation of a Biblical passage? May I stress that to delete this article under the guise of nn is no better than forking. If anyone believes nn is a reason for deletion (and you're not alone in that opinion) go try and change policy - don't work against policy behind its back. --<a href="../../../e/p/h/User%7EEphilei_3ebf.html" title="User:Ephilei">Ephilei</a> 23:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not understand why this was deleted. It is indeed a band, and if you go to their site they actually do have music.</p>
<p>And I have seen shorter, less informative, wikis such as the Vicarious Visions article.</p>
<p>But, this band is real, and I have verification of their actual identities. Also, I am most definately not one of the band members my name is Mario Lucero, and I have know the members of said band. but, they are a real band and others have seen them and they have developed a small fanbase. Just check around their myspace. Smile Lee | 2006-05-21 19:22 UTC</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It was up for deletion previously, and before I had a chance to comment it was deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Miyamoto is known world-wide by many people. A small band known locally to some people within that region is not notable. The Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, and doesn't include every little group of people everywhere on the planet; it only includes those things which are notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I never said that they are better than anyone else, other up and coming bands can probably have wikis too. Also, the Seventh Day Adventist church is a world wide denomination. I am not a part of their religion, organized religion is not for me. But, that is more of a side note. Other bands can have wikis, it is never stated that they can't.</li>
</ul>
<p>^<b>Suggestion</b> I think the criterion for a local band could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have more than 4 songs made and have had at least one play on a regional radio station.</li>
<li>They have appeared in a live performance as a band and performed works of their own on stage as a group.</li>
<li>They have song samples on hand.</li>
<li>Some form of band owned website, the band owned website needs to have info on the band, and it's member(s).</li>
<li>And lyrics on hand, and the lyrics must be understandable with thoughtfulness obviously put into them.</li>
<li>They must also have plans to expand outside of their region.</li>

<li><b>Comment again</b>. You're not comprehending something very important here. The Wikipedia doesn't just keep articles on every topic under the sun because it can. The Articles for Deletion process is largely to get rid of articles of subjects that don't have enough notability. You seem to want the band to get a wiki article just because it can.

<p>I have given reasons for notability; They have more than 10 songs made, they have appeared in a live performances of some sort, they have song samples on hand, a band owned website, they have plans to expand to become a more nationally known band, continued to get more shows at various places, the song entitled "Your Grace" is becoming a notable worship song within' the Seventh Day Adventist church, lyrics are on hand, and links.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I performed in front of a rather large audience during a school play when I was young, have written several (poor) short stories, and plan to become Emperor of the Solar System. Again, you've provided no good evidence that "Your Grace" provides them with any notablity, and besides that all you've said is that they <i>plan to become notable</i>. Many small bands perform in front of local audiences, but that doesn't mean they're of any slight encyclopedic notability. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 05:34, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We're not discussing how good their lyrics or music are, but how notable. Notable. Notable. Notable. Notable. Notable. You still havn't said why they're any more notable than every other band that has aspirations of making it big. Your only piece of support for notability so far is that the church whose name I forget is using their song, but you've given no evidence of that. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 06:03, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>It (Notablity) differs, however, from fame and importance; while all articles on "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh and about <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_a1ea.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a> they are one of the largest protestant denominations worldwide. And you've never heard of them? Well you can read up on them, they are an interesting religion. And it doesn't change my arguements. But it does show that you don't need to be importantyou just need to have done something that interesting and knowledgable. Plus, there is argument based on what notability is. But, most of the time it is from a reputable source. And what more reputible source than the people, fans and critics, which their myspace is full of. A secondary source can; be a large group of people more than 100 in number, a recognized newpaper, and/or many other sources. And the source I have used is a group of people.

<p>Well, may God Bless wiki and everyone involved, as it is quite the information database, and if you find my article to be not well written or uncyclopedically written please give me tips on how to fix it. You could, maybe if it isn't too much trouble, even help sort the information by editing the Under the Shadow article to make it better. Or maybe even just send it to cleanup.

<p><b>Strong (Reiterated) Keep!</b> This band ,like Smile Lee has said over and over again, has been played on the radio and has preformed in front of an audience.

<p>Monkeyfloop for taking my side on this band, I am going to change that vote to a reiterated vote with a strond feeling.</p>
<p>But, I am impressed in Consumed Crustacean's will to keep Wiki a trustworthy site of note, and I do respect that. I can see his decision in deleting this article, he sees it just as another band. But, as I've said; they have a decent-sized fanbase, they have a decent collection of music written by themselves, they have performed at various places, they are sometimes played on M88, and were the creators of the worship song "Your Grace", if you look at the link to their lyrics on the article, you might recognize it.

<li><b>Remember</b> I understand that you guys "spend a lot of time improving Wikipedia's musical coverage and feel that notability is required for a band to deserve an article here. Please remember that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion."

<li><b>Let's Look it Up In The Dictionary</b> A dictionary can usually help us understand a word. And the definition for an Encyclopedia is "A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field." Let's look at the word "Comprehensive" which says "So large in scope or content as to include much." <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmile_Lee_d2f2.html" title="User:Smile Lee">Smile Lee</a> 07:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>And this article doesn't contain self-research</b> Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. So gathering the information from the Under the Shadow MySpace is a primary source, while Lyric Wiki and M88 are secondary sources. And wiki reports "what other reliable sources have published, whether or not we regard the material as accurate." And a reliable source would be from those primary and secondary sources, and whether or not they are true or false they are still information on the band. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmile_Lee_d2f2.html" title="User:Smile Lee">Smile Lee</a> 07:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. True, the article needs some sources, but they are easily verifiable, as easy as googling to show some other prima facie cruft or neologism is <i>not notable</i>. When an article claims things like "First Pro Team to win the World Cup"; "Series Titles..." and then a list of multiple world championships, I can't understand why you would state that you are "not seeing any notability". The assertion of notability is there in spades. Here's my two second google results: "The WB and CBS, channels 5 and 8, actually shot some staged play by local Professional teams XSV and <b>Dynasty</b>...NBC will be here TODAY filming several live shots from 3:30 - 6:30 pm." <a href="http://www.paintballnews.com/articles/jan082005/fp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paintballnews.com/articles/jan082005/fp.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>; "Dynasty are the reigning champions of the NPPL and PSP circuits" @ about.com's listing of <a href="http://paintball.about.com/od/proteams/" class="external text" title="http://paintball.about.com/od/proteams/" rel="nofollow">Professional Paintball Teams</a>; more info <a href="http://www.warpig.com/paintball/articles/pressreleases/automated/082203dynasty.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.warpig.com/paintball/articles/pressreleases/automated/082203dynasty.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.68caliber.com/news/story041725.php" class="external text" title="http://www.68caliber.com/news/story041725.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 20:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The assertion was present, but sources were absent. I'm still not completely convinced, but I may change my mind in light of some of this. That's a big may. Just because NBC or whatnot had a few things from one of their events is not a notability thing, since the local news has recorded various dumb things around my own city that would never get in the Wiki. Also want to add: Monkeyfloop has removed this nomination from the AfD page, though that's been reverted.

And if something seems to have a biased POV you can fix it to become a better artical, remember constructive criticism is better than just saying something is wrong. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmile_Lee_d2f2.html" title="User:Smile Lee">Smile Lee</a> 09:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "Canadian royal family" is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Royal_Family_853c.html" title="British Royal Family">British Royal Family</a>. Any relevant info about the former will be covered in a page on the latter. If we are to pretend that the British Royal Family somehow simultaneously exists as a distinct "Canadian" family, and that this family in turn deserves a full page, we may as well make 16 different pages for the Jamaican Royal Family and the Belizean Royal Family and all the countries where the British Monarchy reigns.</li>
<li>Any relevant information about the monarchy as a Canadian institution belongs on the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a> page.</li>
<li>The whole page exists primary for partisan monarchist propaganda purposes. No one outside of the Canadian monarchist subculture even believes in the idea of the "Canadian Royal Family" and even they only use that term to try and win supporters to their case.<a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J._f353.html" title="User:J.J.">user:J.J.</a> May 21, 2006</li>

<p>An article about a short film with no assertion of importance or of wide distribution except for over-the-top review blurbs that sound fake and do not list attribution.

I'm not saying that the same topics cannot be carried over into a new article because they can be incorporated into it and probably very well should be. What I am saying, is that a new article must be created which should hold researched material which is not copying directly from other articles. Perhaps it should be more of a general overview and include Wikilinks when neccesary to other articles on Wikipedia.

<dd>How about reading my comments again before you attack me. I stand by my deletion nomination because I feel that the article should be more than merely a grouping of existing articles on Wikipedia. I have stated this already but apparently you wish me to repeat myself because you do not like to or are unwilling to read. I have stated above that this article should be deleted in its current form. Sure, another article under this same topic, may be doable but not as it is. It should be deleted. Someone may wish to attempt writing a new article that is researched and does not simply copy info from other articles. I, and other editors, have begun attempting to make edits to the article but it doesn't seem to be losing its laundry list form. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 02:30, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to _official Wikipedia policy_ if an article simply needs to be cleaned up and rewritten, it _should not be deleted_. It even specifically lists the templates to use if that is the case. If an article under the topic is doable, and the article in question is not a duplicate, it does not belong on AfD. Since you have admitted that the article topic is a valid one, and you persist in trying to get it deleted after being informed of Wikipedia policy, your nomination is in bad faith and you are <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>.

<dd>Funny, because I consider your comments to be personal attacks but you are attempting to turn it around to make it seem as if I am attacking you. <b>Let me clarify my official position on this AfD as simply as I can once and for all, superceding any of my prior statements</b>: It should be deleted because it appears to have been created as a POV Fork. Perhaps it is doable, I don't know that because I have not seen a doable form of the article. Because I cannot see into the future I can neither confirm nor deny the doability of the article. If you could create one and replace what already exists then I will see that it is doable and change my vote. I am not violating any Wiki policy in that statement. As per the discussion resulting from the above AfD process I have begun to institute changes in the article in cooperation with other editors. There is nothing wrong with this because it is considered to be improving Wikipedia and acting in a good faith manner. Please see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - I find it interesting how you insist on citing Wiki policy yourself when you continuously violate it. If you assume bad faith of me then I cannot help but to take that as a personal attack and assume bad faith of you. I have been acting in good faith in my edits, If you need proof of this, see my edits to the article along with the edits of editors with whom I have been working with. Simply because I have attempted to improve an article after I have nominated it for deletion does not put me in violation of any Wikipedia policy. Nominating an article for deletion does NOT exclude an editor from attempting to improve that article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 03:17, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because WP isn't paper doesn't mean we have to have articles for every videogame-related meme. The "Satsui no Hadou" concept is really only a relevant part of the Street Fighter Alpha storyline. I think the only reason there's an article for it is because fans eat it up. It's not really fancruft, but as an SF storyline fan myself, I think its importance is overstressed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 02:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As sad as Anna Svidersky's death is (and it is), I don't feel that Wikipedia should devote a page to her.

<ul>
<li>I also think it is extremely sad but I also agree that there shouldn't be a page devoted to her. Her death did get a lot of attention in the Washington area, but there are a lot of high profile murders that happen elswhere. (In the Los Angeles area alone a lot of media attention is given to many crimes but they don't have a wikipage and L.A. is the second largest media market in the US next to New York). If you look at the edit history of this article, it was written as a memorial page to her. What is even more telling that this is a memorial page is that no article of the suspected murderer, David Barton Sullivan exists. It is, I believe, the sole "victim only" article on here. Other articles of victims such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> at least mention in detail, about the suspects. Wikipedia is not a memorial and this article is being treated as one which is evident by the constant POV assertions. --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 18:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Memorial would be if you focus on the person's life. News would be if it's a run-of-the-mill event.

<li>I agree that as it is written now it sounds like a memorial.

<li><b>Please note</b> I have rewritten this article throughout from an encyclopedic viewpoint. It is a mistake to see it as a "memorial" or "tribute" page. The wider significance of this tragedy was clearly asserted by <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, which is one of the four "serious" national UK papers (for those not familiar with it) and which I have used as a main verifiable source.

<li>It is your personal opinion that it is a "run of the mill event". From a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> a verifiable and reputable source has described this as "on a global scale". Likewise, where is there any evidence to assert that this only received coverage because it was a "slow news day"?

<li>I respectfully propose that Angr <i>et al</i> completely miss the point. Anna Svidersky <b>is</b> the first (though probably not the last) example of extensive MySpace mourning. She wasn't notable in life, and even her death itself wasn't notable. But as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> put it: "The grim truth is that this tragedy has mutated into the latest internet buzz".

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is a broad topic. If you mean 'not a memorial', then by reading the latest version of the article you will see it is not that.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find that this had some significance because her death did get a lot of attention. It was not what I would consider a memorial. Like I said in my vote above, I was searching for information on google a while ago, and I could not find the information. I found one site that was about the DELETION of the article I had been searching hours for. In the end, I never found the information I needed because someone considered the page a memorial (and it was an old deletion from over a year before I found it). Lots of pages that people would consider a memorial do have value to some people. Plus, what will it hurt to have one more article on wikipedia? <a href="../../../f/i/w/User%7EFiwtart_a9cc.html" title="User:Fiwtart">Fiwtart</a> 16:51 EST, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - now that this seems to have been cleaned up, I think it's important. I'm from New Zealand (note: nowhere near Washington) and I heard about her death, which is both unusual and notable for what would usually be an everyday American murder. There is a lot of talk about her on teenage websites, and IMO it's useful to have a reference to who she is. - Ktbaby 08:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>ITSM and ITIL are quite different in scope. Proof is in previous frameworks developed by many vendors and the effort undertaken by OGC in the ITIL 'refresh' to play catch up. ITSM is a valuable, separate topic. Separation would allow ITSM to mature as required by the market and ITIl along qwith any other best practice framework offering, to position accordingly and make its case for consideration. ITIL is NOT ITSM.--Itsmi 22:07, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't find any confirmation of the rather extraordinary and controversial information in this article.

That is true of all the external links: they relate tangentially to the topics of hypnosis, but they still don't support anything that is in this article. Because of this, I'm afraid I have to call the veracity of the entire article into question.

<p><font color="#FF0000">This article is an expansion of a section in "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Burns_2d82.html" title="Montgomery Burns">Montgomery Burns</a>," a character in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>." Speculation about the age of a character in a fictional animated sitcom doesn't deserve it's own article. The section in the main Montgomery Burns article (which is by itself is spectacularly long for a fictional character) already makes it pretty clear that there are some inconsistencies regarding his age, which is not terribly surprising for an animated satirical show such as this. What this article seems to do is expand upon these inconsistencies by saying, "Well, in this episode he's 83, and in this episode he's 104, and this episode seems to imply he's 90." Totally unncessary. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 23:35, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
