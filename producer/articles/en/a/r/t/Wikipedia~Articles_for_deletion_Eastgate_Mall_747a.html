<li><b>Keep.</b> First shopping mall in a major city - Chatanooga. Interesting article as it stands - I enjoyed reading it, and I'm in Australia. As for the criteria, none of these are particularly applicable - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which includes a numerous amount of articles on shopping malls (including many this size), I can't see this content (which includes interesting information about its history) fitting in any directory (but can in an encyclopedia), and if the problem was referencing, why was this never tagged as unreferenced (thus giving people time to actually check offline (non-Google) sources, such as books about the city's history) before being nominated for deletion? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 21:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this appears to be a directory entry. Wikipedia is not a directory. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What directory would have information like this in it? Most of it is about the history of the place. If you want it deleted, at least come up with a sensible reason. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A town directory or a directory of shopping malls. The reason <i>is</i> sensible. Has this been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources? Mere existence is not sufficient, after all. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A town directory or a directory of shopping malls might mention this place, but this article would in no way fit in either of them, so that's still bunk. It has a decent claim to notability to begin with (first in a major city), and if this actually was about referencing, why was it nominated for deletion less than 24 hours after being tagged as unreferenced? There has been absolutely no time for anyone to check references apart from those on Google, such as books about the history of Chatanooga (where this would likely make an appearance). <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article existed for fourteen months without references, adding a tag wasn't going to produce them. Five days is ample time, if the references exist. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was not given an unreferenced tag during that time, so it would have been very easy for it to slip by unnoticed. Five days is ample time if the sources are on Google, or somewhere else online. It is <i>not</i> if they're offline, since this would either mean finding in Tennessee willing to do so, or finding someone with access to an excellent library collection in the States (something of the equivalent of the National Library here in Australia). I do not have this access. So please don't pretend that sources don't exist - I've already pointed out that it's fairly likely that books on Chatanooga history would have information on the city's first mall - rather, it's just that you're not giving anyone time to actually get hold of those resources. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 23:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is not the first mall in "some locale" - it's the first mall in a major city. So no, most malls would not be the first mall in a major city, but this one is. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 03:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Municipal dumps are not notable, and none have articles on Wikipedia, whereas many malls have articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> No sources on Factiva, either, apparently. If no sources exist, there is no way to expand this article; since "the mall is presently (as of 2006) almost completely vacant," I presume no new non-trivial sources are likely to be generated. This leaves the possibility of offline sources, as mentioned; therefore, delete without prejudice against recreation when and if such sources are found. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is with this bias against offline sources? For something like this, Google and Factiva are lousy means of finding useful material. I've pointed out that there is a good prospect that offline sources could be found by anyone with the right resources - what is the benefit in killing the article before giving anyone a chance to fix it, rather than leaving the unreferenced tag on for a couple of months and giving someone who can the right opportunity to do so? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No bias at all. Offline sources are great. Produce them, and then there's a basis for the article. Keeping an unsourced article around for months on the chance that "someone" might have an offline source and be inclined to edit the article? Um... no, thanks. That hypothetical editor could just as easily use that hypothetical source to write a new article, however many months in the future he or she should get around to doing so. And if he feels the old article would be useful, there's always DRV -- I imagine it'd be easy to get undeleted, since the concern is sources and he'd be producing them. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that an article based on the NRDC stuff would likely pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, but this article isn't that. Truthbringer's refs don't do much either, because they're based on showing that the dead mall was notable, whereas the case seems to be that it wasn't, but the new <i>non-mall</i> incarnation is notable. An article on it could be much more than a directory entry. I haven't actually given an opinion here, one way or the other, but I think my opinion leans towards "weak keep if stubbed, and start over". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article needs sourcing, but that can be done at a more leisurely pace than the compressed five days of a deletion discussion. The topic seems eminently appropriate to me for the encyclopedia, if for no other reason than the statement that the mall was the first mall in Chattanooga. Stubs encourage expansion; deleted articles do not. <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowKarmaError_c487.html" title="User:LowKarmaError">LowKarmaError</a> 22:19, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
