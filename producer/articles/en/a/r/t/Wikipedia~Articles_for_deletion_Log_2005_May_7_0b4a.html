<p>This seems like somebody doesn't understand a joke from <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a>. Why do you think they would have it optioned for 5 films when even huge franchises aren't optioned in that huge of an amount?

<li>It just so happened that casting this vote was the first thing I did with the account. I created the account because I like having accounts on stuff just in case I want to do things. Is it poor etiquette for your first action to be one of destruction? I mean, I don't want to make anyone nervous or anything. --Sjender 17:21, 11 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Votes from very new users tend to be discounted in VfDs, because they're intended to develop a consensus in the Wikipedia community, and new Users (and anons) are thought to be not yet part of the community. There's a template about that, which I'll try to find and stick on your talk page. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:44, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This may be a speedy delete canidate, but I felt it would be better to bring it here.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a neologism, and at best the article could be slimmed down and transferred to Wiktionary. I note that Mikkalai has added to <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> an isolated sentence that links to this article and to <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femininity.html" title="Femininity">femininity</a> (despite the fact that, as he himself pointed out above, there's no article on the latter). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:19, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You keep eyeing women! Yes, I did it, but this "isolated" sentence serves its purpose of introducing these terms irrelatively the existence of the articles. Also, making more links increases chances that someone willing to write will stumble onto them.

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that I understand all the above, but I can see little use introducing any of these terms, when one is simply a modification of the article title on normal English grammatical lines, one is a mere dictionary definition under VfD, and one is a redirect to an article linked to in the article's summary.

The tone and context made it clear that this was not an attempt by a sockpuppet to bias the outcome of the vote.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vril.html" title="Vril">Vril</a>. Note: as someone who KNOWS German Secret Weapons for over 25 years let me explain some things that you people don't know. Here's a list of OTHER German claimed weapons that seemed like fantasy that were later confirmed as real:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Kugelpanzer- lierally a round, ball tank shipped to Japan and used for light recon. Seems ridiculous, yet one was captured by the Russians and is on DISPLAY in the Kubinka Museum. Tale proved TRUE. 2) Mystery "N-Material" (aka modern Greek Fire) developed by the German Army and supposedly dropped only to be picked up by the SS for production. Again, seems like a pure fabrication. Material was discovered to be CIF3 and WAS produced at its own facility at Falkenhagen. So dangerous was the material that four water towers all connected to the central storage unit in case of ignition. CIF3 can literally repel water once ignited and only a huge amt. of water that is under pressure can ensure that CIF3 burns out underwater without spreading. The German facility had to submerge the storage area to the ceiling and had bleed shafts built into the structure for water overflow. Strange but TRUE. 3) Mystery V-4 missile. In most missiles books just a bluff to keep Sweden from turning to the Allies in 1945. But on Misdroy launch catapults pointing NORTH were found along with several Pabst ramjets and rocket launch cylinder units. The V-1 by comparison pointed WEST and used a chemical cylinder to produce steam for launch, not a rocket... and the V-1 used a crude Argus-Schmidt pulsejet, not a Pabst ramjet. Tale proved TRUE. 4) Mystery V-7 weapon. Considered a complete hoax. Only problem is the patent of it by Bruno Schwenteit as the Elektrische Luft turbine und Raumschiff, crediting Rudolf Schriever and Dr. Richard Miethe. Proved TRUE. These are just a few waffen used as examples. No one claimed that the Magic Eye worked or flew... only that a lab model was being tested by early 1945. Vril from the start concentrated on channeled flight using manipulation of gravity through intense rotating EM fields to produce strong frequency oscillations that intensified would open a small channel through spacetime. A black hole simply uses its intense gravity and imploding mass to punch a hole in spacetime. Vril tried a limited white hole effect. But no one has claimed that their JFM, Vril series of discs, or the huge cylindrical Andromeda machine actually accomplished this. Rather the opposite. The Vril 7 that tried from Arado-Brandenburg in late 1944 was completely wrecked in one experiment. Their claims are on the Vril page and no one is deleting that page. All I'm saying is that these people who come here don't know enough about the subject to credibly disprove the claims. Come back when you know more about German Secret Weapons technology, which at one time was 11,000 tons of military documents at Wright Field postwar.</p>

<li>Although it is tagged as "inhaltlich aus dem Buch zitiert", this timetable and possible table of contents (and it seems just to be a part of something larger, as it hops between Old Egypt, Mesopotamy and others), smells very much of copyvio, although I think one won't find anything by googling; I'll have a look into our library, but t´his may take a day or two..<a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> 06:10, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I've had a sniff round Thames' user page, and from his (I think "his") predilections and the edit summaries in the history of the German <i>Decline</i> page it would appear that he is using this German material to enrich the English article.

<li>Thanks for the deference <a href="../../../d/w/b/User%7EDwbird2_f2b7.html" title="User:Dwbird2">Dave1898</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a> is right that i used the this temp page for translation purposes. But my translation is retardedly bad, even when aided by google language tools. So I put in a request over at <i>translation to english</i>. Hopefully they can do a better job than I could. I guess you guys can delete it if you want--I'm not done the translation, and machine translators won't translate that far down the German article. So if you delete it, I'll have to rely entirely on the wikipedians over at german-to-english. I do admit, I've been in quite a lull recently. But if you all feel the deletion is urgently needed, go for it. —thames 08:41, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "I deleted the entire text of the chapter." Thank you. Simply repeating the text is not encyclopedic; Wikipedia is not a primary source. "There are also links which appear to be an attempt to discuss every single freaking verse of the chapter. Is this a real necessity?" How the articles are structured is a minor concern VfD need not be bothered with. Summary articles can be instituted as appropriate for verses that do not merit individual articles. As for the discussions themselves, they are notable and verifiable, <i>vide</i> the sources listed, and must be covered. Wikipedia aims to be complete. "Is this original research?" Not as long as the commentary is sourced. "Is all that commentary in the verse articles copyright violations?" The <i>commentary</i>? Of course not. If any parts of it are, remove and rewrite as appropriate. "The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_English_Bible_a201.html" title="World English Bible">World English Bible</a> is certainly copyrighted as of 1997, so listing every verse in it is a copyvio." No, for two reasons: a list of verses in the Bible is not copyrightable, this scheme having been established long before any period copyright can be applied to, and second, what <a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> said. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 13:50, 2005 May 7 (UTC)</li>

What we need is a new sister project like Wiktionary or Wikisource, maybe called Wikibible, where this sort of thing can be discussed.

<li>Please notice your examples of sister project, as is the case with all Wikimedia sister projects, are medium forks (as in, the kind of information presented, not content forks.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: We have attempted to discuss the copyright issues - please see my vote above and also the comments of JRM and SimonP.

Secondly all of the verses of Chapter 20 in the Book of St John equate to less than one page's text in my version of the Bible (King James) and there are well over 800 pages - no way would quotation on this magnitude violate anybody's copyright law - but this is a tangent as the version of the bible being used is copyright free.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not sure what the standards of fame are for a carpenter to get an article, but Jeremy Broun certainly deserves an article for his writing at least.

<p>Am I allowed to join in&#160;!!!! As author I mentioned two of my books not wishing to be excessive&#160;!

<p>From Jeremy Broun on 8 May 2005 - I have withdrawn my articles <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furniture_Today_5e63.html" title="Furniture Today">Furniture Today</a> and A History of Designer Makers as associated articles to my entry, due to further negative and insulting comments by "critics". What I have endeavoured to contribute in these two short articles has been criticized under your guidelines 'Blatant nonsense' by someone and as 'too enthusiastic' by another and as 'an essay, not a piece of Wikepedia writing' by someone else. If the writing aims to educate and inform does it really matter whether it is an essay or an article. As far as I am concerned I contributed these articles in the same way I contribute to the British media (except on this occasion I did not charge a fee). My style of delivery is an important and respected feature of my writing whilt the core of my writing is objective. Any professional knows that personal anecdote adds to the interest of an article. I get the feeling that the bulk of "critics" (eg "BigFatDave"&#160;??) on this site are young students or people totally uneducated in the Crafts culture (in the UK) I have given 40 years of my working life to&#160;? I am not prepared to have my professional (and respected in Britain) writing abused in this way. I joined this site in good faith in helping expand its knowledge base in my particular professional field of furniture design and making which is badly lacking. It appears to be a free for all for "critics" to hurl abuse or speak utter nonsense themselves&#160;! I joined this site fresh just 24 hours ago and am disappointed at how democracy is so readily abused by so called free speech. What are the qualifications of those who have been so quick to degrade my writing and why are "critics" so quick to aggressively attack and find any excuse to reject my enlightened writing&#160;? What are they actually trying to demonstrate or defend&#160;? I thought this website was an International forum&#160;?</p>

<p>I am new to this today. I dont understand how this article can be described as "Vanity" and is likely to be deleted&#160;? It is a well considered, articulate, informative, factually correct and unique&#160;! I am a professional writer and published author&#160;! Please advise .

<p>I improved the first article called "The History of Designer Makers" by changing its name to "A History of Designer Makers" assuming I could start afresh. What is a "byline".</p>
<p>There is a rather patronising implication that I am deliberately breaking the rules which is not the case. I am a respected practitioner in my field. I am merely attempting to expand the knowledge base of this amazing website so please do not be so quick to jump to criticism and kindly explain to me why you consider my article is "Vanity" . It is repreentatative of what is going on in my professional field TODAY based on a long and important tradition.</p>

<dd>Come on now. Let's remember to assume good faith here, at least. Jeremy Broun is a real person and can reasonably be called an expert on the fields of furniture and woodworking, but do you really think he's the sort of person that people would impersonate online?!? That's a <i>real</i> long shot, there. And to what end would this supposed impersonation be carried out? This isn't exactly a super-controversial topic here.

<p>I am staggered by these remarks&#160;! No I do not know what a "byline" is and yes I am a well known International author - one of my books "The Encyclopedia of Woodworking Techniques" is published in several languages including "USA English". Check out what "Starblind" has said about my entry at <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Broun_c538.html" title="Jeremy Broun">Jeremy Broun</a> and my reputation.</p>
<p>If I am accused of "self promotion" of course through this knowledge base I am hoping to promote my proessional field which is neglected in Popular culture. Why is there this immediate level of aggressiveness&#160;?!! My article is a historical document NOT a piece of propaganda or commercial advertizing. There has been very little written so far about the British Crafts Revival and you are fortunate that i am sharing this knowledge with you&#160;!</p>

<p>Sat 7 May - from Jeremy Broun (UK). I have learned a lot today and obviously I am a little naive as the above comments about imposters and vandals caught me totally by surprise. My aplogies for not registering/logging in. My only excuse is that I am a member of a dynamic UK WIKKI site (a forum for UK furniture makers) and we all edit freely, but having said that we are given a password. I was obviously too enthusiastic to submit my entry and two articles. I am sorry to have created such a stir when my intention was to add to this amazing knowledge bases which I came across by accident. I am the real Jeremy Broun if you care to enter my name in Google you will find numerous pages connected with my work. I am primarily an educator and if I promote myself in the process it is because I have learned it is necessary&#160;! I do not participate in "Vanity" publishing but write objectively about a variety of topics.</p>
<p>Might I suggest you delete the first article "The History of Designer Makers" and allow "A History of Furniture Makers" to stand. I would like to add to the article something about the English Cotswold School of Designer Makers in the 20th Century which I had missed out.</p>

<dd>I apologise if we gave a rude introduction here. You see because Wikipedia is popular free-content encyclopedia that anyone can edit, we are a target of vandals and imposters, either added nonsense to existing articles, or making up rubbish articles. Every day, new cases are added to our list of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">Vandalism in progress</a>. So it sometimes gets many editors, including me, on extra, extra alert. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 19:30, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My apology also. Of course I should have read your guidelines first and I fully appreciate the need to check authenticity. Sadly this wonderful tool called the Internet is abused. I have now registered and therefore hope that any contributions I make are accepted wihout raising the alarm. Jeremy Broun.(It does take a lomg time to digest the extent of the protocol&#160;!)I have also re-edited my article called "Furniture Today" and trust that is now acceptable.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unless a <b>huge</b> cleanup is done to make an encyclopedia article from this rhetorics. In the current state it is useless. Aslo the title is too broad. Does the article cover designer makers of jewelry? Also it looks like <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, disallowed in wikipedia. References are required. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:46, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. So, I'm wondering who would ever enter "The[A] History of Designer Makers" into the WP searchbox. OK, right, I don't like the <i>pagename</i> for openers. And if I should stumble across this article I wouldn't know what to make of it. It doesn't look or read like an encyclopedia article but rather a page from a book about an obscure something that doesn't fit in here (and I really do like <i>Random page</i>). There may be good information here but it is so poorly formatted that it is almost unreadable. Perhaps a massive rewrite and a more logical <i>pagename</i> would get my vote to keep. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 01:33, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>From Jeremy Broun - in view of the last comment (by "Hydnjo") I have withdrawn my article. The article was originally written last week for a British Furniture Designer Makers Internet Forum after time consuming research and was entusiastically received. The title obviously refers to Furniture not Jewelry or other crafts because it was sited on a Furniture Design listing. I am not prepared to have my professional writing abused in such a Phillistine way when I submitted it in good faith to help broaden this knowledge base on my subject. I have made several changes to my article in my attempt to conform to your "rules" but it is just inviting further insult. Perhaps it would be a good idea to highlight and summarise the key rules for any new subscriber as it was misleading to me that this is a freely editable website as obviously the rules are extensive. 8 May2005.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Local slang. There's plenty of ways to commit suicide (of family and friends, off the top of my head, two shot themselves, one took an intentional drug overdose, and the other hung himself), jumping off something tall is just one of many--don't really see a need for separate articles on each one. <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html#Methodology" title="Suicide">Suicide#Methodology</a> already mentions "jumping from height"--if someone wants to expand that (possibly breaking the section into its own <i>single</i> separate article (<a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_methodology.html" title="Suicide methodology">Suicide methodology</a>, or whatever), since Suicide is 51k), that would be a better place for the concept. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 00:01, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

Good re-write, SimonP, but I still think that the content should be added to the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_methods.html" title="Suicide methods">Suicide methods</a> article, with a redir to it.

How many suicides does it take to qualify? How many attempts? If someone survives an attempt, does that disqualify it? This is supposed to be a worldwide, timeless encyclopedia, not suicide_methods.com.

Period. Regardless of where consensus seems to be heading. Furthermore, the VfD template says "please do not blank, merge or move" the article while it's listed here. At least one Maintenance page says that <i>after</i> the 5 days a non-admin can close the discussion if the consensus is clearly "Keep", but this is not mentioned on some other deletion policy pages. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that some admins seem to view "Merge" votes as different from "Keep" votes.

<li>No, allow <b>me</b> to beg pardon.

Also, it goes to <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_methods.html" title="Suicide methods">Suicide methods</a>.

<li>Yes, but it is counted into "keep" and it is a suggestion, not obligatory. Things must be kept simple. This is vote for deletion. You cannot put all possible editing decisions into VfD. "cleanup" and "rewrite" are also valid votes. This vote is a <b>request for deletion</b>, and the only outcomes are to keep or delete. After it was decided to keep an article, the rest of its fate is to be decided at its talk page, not here. Everyone <b>really</b> has to periodically refresh the understanding of policies. Very often a customary usage tricks you into an illusion of understanding. And it is understandable: there are so many policies around. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:24, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

The books are stocked and read in Canberra, read in England, and read in the US - read by children not (in general) wikipedians - the author fits the criteria for inclusion as a biography on the basis that the audience is &gt; 5,000 --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 07:42, 12 May 2005 (UTC)
