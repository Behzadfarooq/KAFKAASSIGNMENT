<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> This article comes across as an advertising platform for the benefit of a specific university group and an associated conference. Much or even most of the content should be removed as insufficiently notable for the weight given to it. Barely any mention is given to the "seminal work" which coined the term compared with the Loughborough content, and there is a lack of broader discourse references. Having said that, I think the term does have currency in geography, and I would support a keep based on a rewrite addressing the issues. If there is serious copyright infringement too, than the rewrite needs to be even more comprehensive. If it doesn't occur, than I vote <b>weak delete</b> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd go along with the above: either rewrite substantially, to get rid of the "world cities research begins and ends in Loughborough" "undue weight" (if not rampant self-promotion) issues, or else rescope and rename it as a GaWC article, and start <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_city.html" title="World city">world city</a> and/or <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">global city</a> from a clean slate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The concept is notable, and the term 'global city' is thrown around a lot in economics, political science, geography and international studies. However, I agree with Bwithh and Krm that there needs to be some changes; I'm not convinced that Loughborough University has a monopoly on the concept so I believe the article should be a bit more comprehensive, offering different ways of conceptualizing what precisely constitutes a global city by looking to other sources outside GaWC. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Keep</b>. per the way. But. No need to invet an Original Research there. GaWC is ver very accurate for now.

<li>(ec)I don't believe anyone's arguing for original research, just toning down the rewriting of the history of the concept to make it entirely about GaWC.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: We chose to use the global city concept at <a href="../../../v/0/2E/WP%7EV0.5_07ec.html" title="WP:V0.5">Version 0.5</a> to guide us in what cities to select for our CD release (we wanted 100-200 of the most important cities).

I can accept that the article should reflect the consensus view of this concept. Is the Loughborough definition considered the most authoritative (I have no clue)? If so, there's no harm in emphasizing that, but other significant viewpoints should definitely be represented. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 05:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Conditional keep</b> - this article has a place but the GaWC data should be chopped considerably, especially as it don't even purport to list Global cities generally, only by financial criteria.

<dd>I disagree that there is something that needs to be removed (cleaned up) from the article. There are some old data, but it's noted that it is old. Table with cities of most is not an OR.

<dd>I fully agree, the fact that this concept is relevant in a number of fields of study is sufficient to keep this article from being deleted, period. The fact that it may be in need of changes, even substantial ones, has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not it should be deleted. Someone could make the case to add a POV tag or a cleanup tag, but these are not problems to be addressed here; these separate tags exist for those problems which alone implies that such articles are not ones that warrant deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 04:22, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, I disagree, although I'm sure it could be closed under <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. There are too many "Conditional Keep" votes to say that the consensus is "keep". As I said above in one of the comments, I don't think an acceptable article could be written, and there <b>is</b> consensus that <i>this</i> article is not acceptable under this name. The concept and GaWC's interpretation of it <b>must</b> be separated.
<ul>
<li>look at votes. there is total consensus that article should not change its name or be removed. <a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElk_Salmon_d84f.html" title="User:Elk Salmon">Elk Salmon</a> 21:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>No need to continue</b>. 14 to keep, 1 to delete. Absolute consensus.<br />
8 - to keep without changes (with notofications that cleanup leads to POV).<br />
6 - to keep and cleanup (not all said what exactly).<br />
1 - to delete<br />

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - The problem with this article is that the term "global city" is a very important one in terms of usage in human geography, (development) economics and wider social sciences. To this degree, it is important that Wikipedia has an article about the terminology. However, it is an incredibly POV term and its usage naturally sees individuals wanting to "big up" their city - a look at the page's history illustrates countless edits to this degree. GaWC are the only electronic source that attempt to actually define the term, and thus can provide a definitive list of "global cities". It would be nice if there were other sources so that this article could take a more generalised approach, but they do not seem to be readily available, and hence why the article has taken its present form of regurgitated information from the source. Changes could be made, but it is essential that the article remains <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV"><b>neutral</b></a>, and this cannot be done unless based on external sources. <b><a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><span style="color:#CC0018">DJR</span></a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi"><span style="color: navy"><b>T</b></span></a>)</small> 10:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>The difference between "global" city and "world" city is pure semantics. I don't have a preference, but when I type "world cities" in the search box I get nothing. "World city" redirects to tthis page.</li>
<li><b>keep and clean</b> (I support the deletion of categories such as "Beta world cities") this article is affecting the quality of wikipedia, some city articles are using this a a reference to justify some things. The article is POV, but should not be deleted. If some other study from other university confirs this then it would be a proper reference. Add another studies to the article.--<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 21:46, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
