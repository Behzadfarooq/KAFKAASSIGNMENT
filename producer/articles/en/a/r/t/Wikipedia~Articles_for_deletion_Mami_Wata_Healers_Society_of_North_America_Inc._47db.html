<li><b>Comment</b>The Mami Wata Healers Society of North America (formerly <b>OATH</b>) is <i>not</i> a vanity article. It is a serious, and legitmate, legal 501(c)3, non-profit African/Diaspora <b>Religious</b> organization. One of MWHS (OATH) achievements has been proactive in changing the way some branches of <a href="http://www.mamiwata.com/LOC.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mamiwata.com/LOC.html" rel="nofollow">African Religions are classifed</a> i.e., <i>cults</i>.

<dd>Thank you all for your feedback. We have reviewed all of the wikilinks listed, and based on our understanding,could not find any of the suggested guidelines which would indicate to us that we are in violation. The very <b>ancestral &amp; religious</b> nature of the <i>Mami Wata Healers Society of North America Inc.,</i> precludes it from being a forum for <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html#Advertisements" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam#Advertisements</a>,proselytizing or recruitment. It simply is not possible. Additionally in reading the <i>suggested guidelines</i> on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> page, we have avoided linking any Wikipedia article to our religious corporation. Wat was also clear in reading each article was that all were simply <i>general guidelines</i> as oppose to <i>official policy</i>, the article further stating that the most severest penalty which may be imposed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> is that it "<i>may put the editor at serious risk of embarrassing himself or his client</i>." Nonetheless, in consideration for your concerns, what we have done is to re-read the MWHS article, and can always agree that the article can be improved so as not to offer the appearance that our intention is to recruit. In that regard, we are open to anyone rewriting the article or submitting a link to an example of how a Religious organization is presented in encyclopedic form.Thank you again for your comments and feedback.--<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 19:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One of the main problems of the article is that it copies almost word-for-word the text found on the <a href="http://www.mamiwata.com/OATH.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mamiwata.com/OATH.html" rel="nofollow">MWHS website</a>.

<dd>Look, Viv, that only proves that your organization <b>exists</b>, it doesn't mean you're notable enough that we need an article about you. You see, we don't only delete articles for being in violation of policy, we delete them because we simply don't need them. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a collection of every single thing that exists; this is an encyclopedia, and what deletion debates are about is whether the article merits inclusion in an encyclopedia. So far the consensus seems to be that your organization is hardly any more notable than the bowling alley across the street, and the "<b>ancestral &amp; religious</b> nature" of your organization has nothing to do with it. It's just that there are a lot of bowling alleys in the world, and we simply don't need an article about each individual one. We have an article about <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowling.html" title="Bowling">bowling</a> and that's enough. Likewise, there are a lot of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movements.html" title="New religious movements">religious organizations</a> in the world, many of them claiming "ancestral" status, and your organization is no different.

Yet your response offers nothing other than a personal opinion as oppose to wikikpolicy of which we are not in violation. We also take offense to your disrespectful tone in addressing our organization founder and your derisive characterization of our religious organization. My name is Anagossii, the MWHS secretary whom you are corresponding. We have been respectful of you and it is policy that you extend the same. It is clear that you are determined to delete the article no matter what is presented. You may do so. However, in the meantime, we have made a copy of this transcript and will fax it to the Board of Directors at Wikipedia along with a letter of complaint. We believe it is important for them to obtain first hand knowledge of the tone, and spirit, and (what we believe is) abuse in which some of its admins and editors are responding. We must know directly from them if they (Board members) are in complicity or are quietly sanctioning such behavior..

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't think comparing a religious organization to a bowling alley is helpful to anyone. (A little more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, please!) The <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mami_Wata_3afa.html" title="Mami Wata">Mami Wata</a> article indicates the general subject of Mami Wata has significant notability in Africa. The difficulty is in coming up with evidence that this North American organization has attracted attention in its own right. It is perhaps unfair that non-Western religious movements, whether new or traditional, are somewhat handicapped in this respect. For what it's worth, the organization claims to constitute a denomination rather than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">local church or congregation</a>, so it's not clear that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)</a> policy, which may require special evidence of local notability over and above that of the denomination, applies. Although it can be debated which policy is applicable, evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> from one or more independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> appears, fairly or not, to be an element underlying essentially all the variants of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> policy.

<dd>Thank you Shirahadasha. You are correct MWHS does not proclaim to be a separate entity from its ancestral roots of the Mami Wata traditions in West Africa. Our society was aided in its very establishment by elders of Mami Wata from Togo, West Africa. Within our own religio-cultural milieu, we are very much notable for having established the tradition in North America since the suppression of African religions in America during <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>. Additionally, within our organization we display <a href="http://www.mamiwata.com/MWHS.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mamiwata.com/MWHS.html" rel="nofollow">the photo and credentials from Togo</a> of our founder and other legal documents that are required by both our tradition and the state and local county. The bigoted and disparaging manner in which our African Ancestral Religious Society and its members are treated here is indicative of its long history of racism, suppression and discrimination in the USA. However, we are not deterred. We understand this history and the motivation behind it, and will continue to contribute and challenge what some of these editors and admin have made self-evident.Apokassii--<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 15:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are requesting that the naysayers demanding deletion of this article, provide tangible evidence and convincing argument that the MWHS is not deemed notable under Wiki <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> policy in spite of the numerous <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">Reliable</a> sources provided. If sufficient Wiki policy and agrument cannot be provided within two days, we have no choice but to consider this issue settled, and will remove the AfD message.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I've read the debate and am not convinced of notability. Or else merge anything useful into the main Mami Wata article.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 16:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
