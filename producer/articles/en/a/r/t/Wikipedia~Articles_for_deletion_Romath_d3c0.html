Unless you've been on SlashDot or something, something OUTSIDE of your current sphere of fame giving acknowledgement of your noteriety. However if we <i>did</i> deem you notable enough to be here your opposition to the page would NOT be recognised. Unless you threatened legal trouble or something like that. Our goal is to provide the facts, not what people want the facts to be&#160;:) Oh and as for not being allowed to use your name, we will only honor name suppression in the case of kidnappings etc. out of respect for the family while the case is going on. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 12:23, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>FROM Romath:</b> It most certainly is a page of lies and innuendo, NOT posted there by me. I came across the thing quite by accident, and only tried to CORRECT the lies in it, merely finding some fool keeps on putting the lies right back in. I even tried redirecting the page in order to have my full Rihannsu name entered, then hoopefully having a page where the TRUTH would be left alnoe, but to no avail. someone screwed that up, removed the full name refirect, then falsely accused me of trying to say 'Rihannsu'; was religion, which I never, ever did! I even tried blanking the pagew because of the all-too-frequent vandalism against it. Next, 'evil monkey; blocked me from entering in order to re-edit. I solved that crap by going to another computer and getting in. To thie very DAY-- the crap still goes on --- I re-edit to tell the truth----- certain individuals plaster the lies right back into it.</p>
<p>As I mentined before, this vanity page was NOT placed here by me, and since I am the person being discussed, Wikipedia DOES NOT HAVE my permission to keep this page. It also serves NO PURPOSE to see ridiculous editing wars in here, in a site that has potential as a valuable learning tool if used properly. Allowing ridiculous pages like this one to exist and remainis an error, both to the encyclopedia end of things, and legally.</p>
<p>As I have been asking for some timer now, PLEASE DELETE THE ROMATH PAGE. IT IS NOT MINE, I DID NOT PLACE IT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND ITS LIES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING PUT RIGHT BACK IN AFTER I CORRECT THEM. DELETE IT PLEASE, AND AT ONCE. Romath</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't believe that it was started as a vanity. However the subject has been intensely involved in editing it over the last couple of weeks, principally to correct perceived "lies" and because she is strongly opposed to having her real name mentioned (though she herself has revealed it many times). She is a famous "kook" on the Usenet, but there is no NPOV way of saying so (that I know of), so her greatest claim to fame is not mentioned in the article. Merely starting a group doesn't give her much notability. The subject's objections to the article do not seem to be a sufficient reason to remove it, but in light of her minimal notability I don't see a reason to keep it either. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 6, 2005 20:33 (UTC)</li>

<p>FROM Romath: I post my name WHERE I WANT IT POSTED, yes. HERE is not it, and I have NEVER POSTED IT HERE.</p>
<pre>
It also has been posted AGAINST MY WILL on certainb sites, including this one, and in usenet.
</pre>
<p>As for the 'kook' crap, that is nonsense. A bunch of detractors supposedly nominated me for uisenet's kook of the month award years ago for my strong oppostion to certain lifestyle issues. Just because I am against such things, that doesn't verify I'm a 'kook' of any kind.</p>

<li>Ah, I see I misunderstood. But I think an anti-vanity page is as worthy of deletion as a vanity page -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 7 July 2005 09:25 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now there is a principle which should be enshrined in the guidelines. However the origins of this article are moot as it has been heavily edited since then. The latest incarnation is mostly a total vanity production which was then substantially cut and slightly re-written by me. Regarding the notability of the subject: the large number of Google Group hits indicates that she may be notable, if we can find a way of describing that notability in a neutral fashion. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 7, 2005 09:37 (UTC)</li>
