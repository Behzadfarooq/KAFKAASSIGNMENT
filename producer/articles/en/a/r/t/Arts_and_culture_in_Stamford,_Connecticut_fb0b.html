<ul>
<li><b>The "Fish Church,"</b> or the <a href="http://www.fishchurch.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.fishchurch.org/" rel="nofollow">First Presbyterian Church</a> of Stamford, was designed by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_K._Harrison_0924.html" title="Wallace K.

The fish shape is obvious to anyone who drives by, but the floor plan is also fish-shaped. The stained glass windows in the sanctuary contain more than 20,000 pieces of faceted glass. They depict the story of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The 32-foot-high cross is faced with wood from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury_Cathedral_f215.html" title="Canterbury Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>. "Brilliant blues, reds and yellows make up the walls -- and seem to fill the air. 'It really is like being inside a jewel,' says Reverend David R. Van Dyke, a co-pastor. 'When I bring people who haven't been here before, there's an audible gasp.'" (Life Magazine, April 14, 2005)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>St. Mary Roman Catholic Church</b> (completed in 1928) on Elm Street is modeled on a Gothic church in Europe and is the largest house of worship in Fairfield County.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p><b>VICTOR BISHARAT'S BUILDINGS</b></p>
<p>Many of the most distinctive buildings in downtown Stamford were designed by the late Victor Bisharat, a Jordanian who received his education at the American University in Beiruit, Lebanon and at the University of California at Berkeley. His Stamford buildings were designed for F.D. Rich Co.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><b>St. John's Towers</b> -- The three cylindrical, 17-story towers were finished in 1971.</li>
<li><b>One Stamford Forum</b>-- Looking like an upside-down ziggurat above its three-story parking garage, the building has an enclosed arboretum rising from the ninth floor to the penthouse roof, which is covered by 76 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrylic_glass.html" title="Acrylic glass">acrylic glass</a> domes. Formerly the "GTE building" named after a former tenant, the 13-floor structure is 196 feet (60 meters) high. GTE used to show off the building in numerous magazine advertisements. In the 1990s, the Tresser Boulevard entrance to the building was changed (in a design by Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum) from a "formidably stark concrete wall of a parking garage" to "a more inviting entrance ... clad in blue-gray ceramic tiles, with a lobby, canopy, colonnade and small garden."<sup id="_ref-Dunlap_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunlap" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>One Landmark Square</b> -- completed in 1973 at a cost of $35 million,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> the skyscraper became the tallest building between New York City and New Haven. The "Landmark" in its name is no exaggeration. When it was built, the 23-story structure towered over a much lower skyline, but it remains the tallest and one of the most distinctive buildings in downtown Stamford. Five smaller buildings, designed by Moshe Safdie, were later built around the tower.<sup id="_ref-dunlap_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dunlap" title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>1 High Ridge Park</b> -- Completed in the late 1960s, the building looks like a fortress, complete with a moat (previously filled with water, it is now dry). Bridges lead to its entrances. It was built for CBS Research a company worried about its security. Originally the building had few or no windows facing outward and tenants saw the sunlight through atriums and skylights. In the 1970s, after CBS Research left, slit-like window areas were put in the outside walls, letting in some light.</li>
<li><b>2 High Ridge Park</b> -- The saucerlike building was meant to recall clocks and watches. The building was originally built for General Time, a large clock manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>OTHER BUILDINGS</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>One Atlantic Street</b> -- Art Deco interiors, with murals in the ground-floor bank, and Art Deco exterior details as well. The red-brick/white marble building at the corner of Broad and Atlantic streets was finished in 1931 and for a long time was the tallest in Stamford.</li>
<li><b>University of Connecticut Campus</b> -- The 225,000-square-foot building with the vast, green glass facade at the corner of Washington and Broad streets was designed by Perkins Eastman Architects.<sup id="_ref-dunlap_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dunlap" title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Old Town Hall</b> — The Beaux Arts building was built from 1905 to 1907 and served as the seat of local government until the early 1960s. The building opened for business on March 20, 1907. The last mayor to work there was J. Walter Kennedy, who moved to the Municipal Office Building that was on Atlantic Street (now torn down) in about 1961. The Old Town Hall held offices for the city government until all city offices were moved to 888 Washington Blvd. in 1987.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></li>

<p>In the 20th century, particularly after World War II, educational and cultural institutions were founded in the city or expanded in a range of areas.</p>

It set up the first small planetarium between New York and Boston in 1941, when it had a 6-inch (wide) telescope and a dome made of wood slats and cardboard. In the 1950s the museum had to move again when <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> was built, and it went to a 118-acre site in the northern end of town.

In November 1965 the state of Connecticut bought the 64-acre estate of Dr. Francis A. Bartlett, a dendrologist who had planted the site with tree and bush specimens from all over the world. The Arboretum opened to the public for the first time in 1966 and was transferred to the City of Stamford in 2001. Today the Bartlett Arboretum Association runs the institution, and an additional 27 acres have been added to the site, giving it a total of 91 acres.</li>
