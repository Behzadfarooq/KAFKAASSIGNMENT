I have no status on whether the article should stay or go, but someone obviously wanted it to be deleted.

<li>I took a look at the categories. Just the Indian bloggers. I dont have anything against the category itself per se. But just because a 'nobody' blogs day in and day out for 'x' number of years doesnt bless him with enought notability to merit an article on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>If a 'notable' person(like say, M J Akbar) blogs, then it makes sense to make a 'note' of it. Rajeev Srinivasan also just about makes the grade because he is a regular journalist/columnist at one of the biggest portals/websites in India and perhaps the world. That certainly is 'notable'.</li>
<li>Kiruba who(??) is on the other hand, a 'nobody'. Blogging alone seems to be his claim to dubious claim of notability. It is not like he is the only blogger from his country or that he is the only one in the world who blogs about a certain topic or something like that. It is not like he's running something on the lines of slashdot or something notable like that(dont jump at me, I know slashdot isnt a blog). Basically, forget the person, even his blog is nothing special. For example, there was some blog during the recent Iraq war which was the only blog in the world that was reporting from ground zero and major news agencies were feeding off that blog. Kiruba and his blog have no such achievements to their credit. It is just another one of the zillion blogs on the net.</li>
<li>And just because The Hindu mentions his blog in an article about the 'non-notable' blogging scene in India(not even India, just Madras) is no claim to fame. The Hindu and other Indian newspapers(even English ones) routinely cover such 'non-notable' events like some fancy dress competition for kids in some school for Krishna Janmashtami, some high school's annual day celebrations etc.,.</li>
<li>Using these to establish notability is ridiculous and going on to write articles about such people and events is an abuse of technology and wikipedia. Gigabytes and terabytes may come cheap these days, but that is no reason to dump all nonsensical stuff reeking of vanity on wikipedia. Basically, as a thumb rule, I'd ask myself the question, "Will this article make it to the Encyclopedia Britannica?(even assuming the book ran into millions of pages and thousands of volumes)". The answer is an emphatic NO! Kiruba and his blog(considering their 'achievements' to date) will not make it into E.Britannica today or in the next 50 years or ever!!</li>
<li>Also, I havent taken a look at the entries under the Bloggers category for other countries. But even if there are entries like Kiruba's from other countries, I hold that even they should be deleted. This is just plain and utter nonsense!! Come to think of it, I myself have represented a state of India in baseball. How many people in India have done that? So let me just trash the fact that 'Baseball in India' itself is 'non-notable' and nonsense, and let me go ahead and create a wikipedia article for myself!! Kiruba's name at best belongs in some article about say, 'Blogging scene in Madras' or some such article. Writing a whole article about this 'nobody' is simply an abuse of technology and resources.

<dd>You certainly weren't involved in the same efforts all of us were - I hadn't heard about you either, and you hadn't heard about me. But that doesn't invalidate your efforts, and it doesn't invalidate Kiruba's either. As for his "ordinary blog" - strange that every indiblogger rating system I know rates him in the top 5 - and for very good reasons.</dd>
<dd>As I have said before - a subject doesn't turn "non-notable" just because *you* haven't heard about it/him/her. It turns non-notable if *no one* has heard of it before. And that is very obviously not the case here or in the case of the other AfD nominations by the same editor, who seems to be showing the same "haven't heard of, can't be notable" problem. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 18:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>I haven't heard of you, you haven't heard of me; it doesn't invalidate our efforts</i> - Alright. Nor does it make us 'notable' enough to merit articles on wikipedia. And in any case, why are we discussing his tsunami works?? I was under the impression that the article existed because he was a 'notable' <i>blogger</i>. The article describes that 'blogging' is his greatest(and only) claim to 'notability' on WP. His tsunami work and rowing for sify team wouldn't fetch him an article even on wikipedia even from whoever wrote this dubious article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And <i>indiblogger rating system</i>. What indiblogger rating system? Systems that require bloggers to register their blogs on their 'system' to even get rated! These so called 'systems' themselves are of dubious nature and the less said the better about the 'systems' they use to establish their useless top 10 or top 100 lists. Its not like some fortune 500 or forbes 50 list. These so called 'indiblogger systems' - what are they? are they slashdot? Also let me quote the Category:Bloggers description -

<dd>As I said, the article can do with editing. Notability is not something either of us can be a judge of. And Kiruba wields huge influence in the blogger world in India and has used that influence to make things happen for many people, including (but not limited to) Tsunami victims. We are here to edit articles, not to judge. I stand by my recommendation to keep and edit. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 21:16, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>...Kiruba wields huge influence in the blogger world in India...</i> - Thats your POV and basically nonsense. I for one, wielded considerable influence in the <i>gilli-danda</i> and <i>buguri</i>(top) circuit in my area. Kiruba is just another one of the billion bloggers who has had his 15 mins of fame, thanks to the likes of people who've voted "Keep" here. I'd like to see someone establish the <b>widespread influence</b> this 'nobody' has had on anybody or anything. Note that the emphasis is also on 'influence'. Also while blogs as a technological innovation and a medium of communication may be 'notable', bloggers arent automatically 'notable' nor will cooked up 'ahhh-so-coooool' neologisms like "Blogging 'scene' in India", "Indibloggers", "blogger meet" etc., give them the 'notability' they dont deserve. And also please stop talking about tsunami, row row row a boat etc.,. Even the article doesnt describe those things as his claim to fame. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody contests the fact that Hindu is a reliable source. But you should be pragmatic enough to know where and how much weight to give to it. Like I said, Hindu and other Indian newspapers routinely cover insignificant items like high school annual day celebrations, inter school elocution contests, a talk by some 'motivational' expert in some corner of the city etc.,. Even the article you've linked is just one such insignificant 'city-specific' article. Also '....India's leading blogger...' is blatantly POV for WP purposes. I can fish out zillion articles from zillion 'reliable' sources that sing praises of Tendulkar and describe him on the lines of 'the greatest there is, the greatest there was, the greatest there'll ever be'. How I wish I could use those sources to edit <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tendulkar.html" title="Tendulkar">Tendulkar</a> and claim that he is the greatest of all time! I can produce any number of 'reliable sources' that sing praises of <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a> and elevate him to 'Godhood'. How I wish Wikipedia would let me use those articles(with the POV) to edit <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a>. Kiruba Shankar is not India's leading blogger, not even close. Who is Hindu to decide such things. It is not like they're quoting some authoritative source. It is simply some unabashed POV of some journalist. Nothing more, nothing less. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 03:42, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
