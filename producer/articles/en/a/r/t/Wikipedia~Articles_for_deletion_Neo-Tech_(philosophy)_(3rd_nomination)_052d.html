<li><b>Speedy Close</b> No AfD notice on the article and from the looks of it, the article is locked from editing due to an edit war. This is a content dispute, not an AfD issue... besides, we don't need peer-reviewed sources for every article to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There was just a AfD earlier this month. This article is based on primary sources. It is perfectly legitimate to cite authors of books as a sources about what tbeir own own books say. Just because there are no secondary sources available, it doesn't mean the article should be deleted. And, Neo-Tech is definitely noteable. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> (neologism) doesn't even apply. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 17:01, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> people interested in retaining this article should probably try and find some secondary sources.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Here is the deal. One guy named Frank Wallace developed the philosophy. He published his own books. Since then other authors people have been writing about the philosophy, and Wallace has published their books and articles for them with his own publishing company. I don't know if the latter would be considered secondary sources since they're technically not self-published, but it's all that's available. There are no books that go into describing Neo-Tech that are not published by Wallace's publishing company, that I'm aware of. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 19:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd understand that people get heated <i>after</i> you want to delete an article...; but to get angry at the bad editing of an article on which you wanted to participate (that should prove you deem the article worthy of existance) to the point you propose (3 times!) to delete it... Well, it's good to see people take the project at heart! By the way, It's just the french article that's a copy of this one. I quite like <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Tech" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Tech" rel="nofollow">the portuguese one</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, you know what? I started this AfD because people were telling me on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WT%7ENPOV_3540.html" title="WT:NPOV">WT:NPOV</a> that an article with only self-published sources is unencyclopedic and should go. And now you're saying that it shouldn't go. OK, how about this: if you really want to keep the article, please <i>please</i> <b>please</b> draft out a plan of how <i>you</i> would improve the article, instead of giving vague requests to other people to "find some secondary sources" and make the article "more interesting", yadda yadda yadda. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 18:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Anyone that told you an article is unencyclopedia because it has only self-published sources is wrong, under the condition that self-published sources are only used a sources for what the author of those sources are saying in an article about the authors of those sources. A book by Frank Wallace is a good source to show what a book what by Frank Wallace says. There's no disputing that. But, since Wallace's books are self-published they're probably not good as secondary sources, which means you couldn't use Wallace's opinion in a different article about something else. The article is not too bad as it is. The way to improve it would be to bring in more books by Wallace and others who write about Neo-Tech. The way to not improve it, is to do what you were doing, which is bringing in posts from anonymous people on forums and even a web page you made yourself as sources. That would be using self-published sources as secondary sources, which means using self-published sources in a article other than an article about the source itself. You made a web page called Pax-NeoTex which is making jokes about Neo-Tech. You can't use that as a source in the article, meaning it's not a reliable secondary source. You could only use that as a source if you're using it as a source about Pax-NeoTex if there were a Pax-NeoTex article. You're not a published expert on Neo-Tech, but a self-published jokester (that is, your web page is a joke page). <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> specifically disagrees with your argument: "Neologisms that are in wide use -- but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources -- are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia." Plain and simple.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's not applicable at all. Do you think <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is a neologism and therefore that article should be deleted? That's absurd. This article is not about a word, but about a philosophy represented by a word. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:24, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> <i>does</i> have peer-reviewed secondary sources discussing it, including a senior thesis. And you're splitting non-existent hairs: obviously when one discusses a word, one will discuss the meaning of the word. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 18:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Here they go again. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a>, you must admit it is possible that there is no available documented criticism on these guys. If there's none, it just means they're not important enough to attract some. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a>, the article as it is is not interesting and will strike almost anyone who stumble upon it as an ad. For the sake of your own cause, please consider making it look like there has been some other consideration than the books. Basically, Islam is defined by the Coran. But if you got out there and did the article only by citing it, it would look unapropriate. I know, it's not a cult, but you get my drift. Or else, consider changing it to articles about the books.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 18:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If they're not important enough, then shouldn't the article be zapped, according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a>? And again, I refer to the quote above from <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 18:37, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Books about Neo-Tech are cited in other books, such as in <i>Church Disputes Mediation</i> (Gracewing Publishing 2003, page 287) and in <i>Fresh Wisdom: Breakthrough to enlightenment</i>, ISBN: 1419618555 (page 117), but as far as I know there are no criticisms. So the fact that it is cited, if not criticized, indicates some importance. Even without those citations, it's obviously noteable. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There's a line between being imporant enough to attract controversy and being notable. But I think I'm loosing my time here. How about we flag the article as "neutrality disputed", and wait until someone (<a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> maybe?)edits a book against it? Then we'll have opposing secondary sources. No, more seriously: <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a>, you didn't answer my proposition.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 18:49, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To improve the article? That's what I've been trying to do, but Bi here deletes the cited material. He's doesn't want the article to exist, but since he can't get rid of it, he tries to delete almost everything out of the article. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:52, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh I see. Are you new to Wikipedia? It sounds like you're advocating what is called "original research" which means to put things in an article that can't be cited from reliable sources. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. We can't put our own opinions, arguments, or criticisms in Wikipedia articles.

All the books are published by Wallace's company and I don't know if they've released numbers on how many books have been sold. If so, you really couldnt use it as a secondary source.

<li><b>Comment</b> Once more, the <i>whole reason</i> for this AfD was that there aren't any peer-reviewed sources from either the pro-Neo-Tech side or the anti-Neo-Tech side, so if you'd like to keep this article, please at least suggest something more useful than "find some secondary sources".

<li><b>Yet another darn comment...</b> OK, I just had to get this out of my system. Friends, Wikipedians, countrymen, do you know why the Neo-Tech article is still not of encyclopedic quality? Why people keep voting to not to delete the article, but to clean up the article, but it's still a mess?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll tell you why. Because everybody keeps waiting for someone who's not himself to clean up the article. You see this in the first <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Neo-Tech_ee81.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Neo-Tech">VfD</a>, you see this in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29_c8d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Neo-Tech (philosophy)">previous AfD</a>, and you see this in the comments above. Yes, yes, the article can be great article, if only somebody who's not me goes the extra mile to clean up the article and pull out good-quality secondary sources from his magic hat! Yes sir, it'll be a "headache", but it's not <i>my</i> headache! And guess what, everyone ends up waiting for that someone who's not himself to do all the dirty work. Read the comments above, read the comments in the VfD, read the comments in the prior AfD, and judge for yourself whether I'm right.</dd>

<dd>Stop this. Please. This has gone on long enough. Keep, don't keep, I don't really care now. But stop all this buck-passing.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What a mess! <b>Bi</b>, no one at Talk:NPOV told you to place this on AfD again. I specifically advised you on how to deal with individual statements that cannot be verified from reliable published sources. I advised you to follow the standard dispute resolution procedures, and to not edit war. I also suggested that you just walk away from this if you had a personal stake in it. <b>JoeMystical</b>, it is indeed true that an article that can be supported only by self-published sources does not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, and should not be in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Right, but besides self-published sources being used as a source for what an author says about himself they can also be used as a source for how the author describes his philosophy. They can't be used as a source for asserting whether the philosophy is good or not, of course, but a book can always be used a source for what's in that book. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 02:26, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't make sense to merge. I understand why those who voted to merge would do so though, because they probably were not aware that of the following: Wallace is not the only developer of Neo-Tech. There are other writers who contribute their ideas to make what is called Neo-Tech. Only citing Wallace, you would not get a full picture of the philosophy. The philosophy stands alone because it's a combination of ideas from different people. Wallace's son, Mark Hamilton, has probably written about half of it. I oppose a merge. A merge with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Wallace_ae51.html" title="Frank R. Wallace">Frank R. Wallace</a> makes no sense. And a merge with Objectivism would be original research because no secondary sources say it is a form of objectivism. The Neo-Tech article is a pretty good article. It's pretty well sourced and defintely written NPOV. There are PLENTY of sources. The books themselves are the sources. It is a good article, and the vote is totally uncalled for. "Bi" who put this up for deletion spends his time writing his own web page called "Neo-Tex" which is a feeble attempt to ridicule the philosophy. He doesn't like Neo-Tech and wants to get rid of the article and wants to remove as much words about Neo-Tech from Wikipedia as possible. Look at what he did to the Neo-Tech article. He tried to cut it down to almost nothing, deleting sourced information: He cut it down from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=59710589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=59710589" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=67813185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=67813185" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> That is totally unjustified. Wikipedia is about being informative as possible, not least informative as possible. Bi has initiated this action for all the wrong reasons. Please consider changing your vote, because it's going to be moved back to its own article eventually anyway. Probably no one will change their vote, but at least this is here for the record so anyone can see exactly what this was all about. It is totally improper attempt to delete a fine article, with those voting not having enough background information to make an informed decision. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 03:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think it would be more acceptable to have a full-extent description of the guy's system of thought on his own article than on a separate one. Plus it would put the length of the neo tech citations in perspective with something else, instead of being evaluated <i>per se</i>. Should we wait for <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> to approve, or is there a time limit to these things?--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 14:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
