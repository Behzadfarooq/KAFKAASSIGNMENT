<p>Energy Savings' business, which is conducted in Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, Quebec, British Columbia, Illinois, and New York, involves the sale of natural gas to residential, small to mid-size commercial and small industrial customers under long term, irrevocable fixed price contracts. Energy Savings also supplies electricity to Ontario, Alberta and New York customers. By fixing the price of natural gas or electricity under its fixed price contracts for a period of up to five years, Energy Savings' customers offset their exposure to changes in the price of these essential commodities. Energy Savings, which commenced business in July of 1997, derives its margin or gross profit from the difference between the fixed price at which it is able to sell the commodities to its customers and the fixed price at which it purchases the matching volumes from its suppliers.</p>

<p>The "Austrian business cycle theory" has been criticized by advocates of rational expectations and other components of neoclassical economics, who point to the neutrality of money and to the real business cycle theory as providing a sounder understanding of the phenomenon. Hayek, in his 1939 book Profits, Interest and Investment, distanced himself from other theorists of the Austrian School, such as Mises and Rothbard, in beginning to shun the wholly monetary theory of the business cycle in favor of a more eccentric understanding based more on profits than on interest rates. Hayek explicitly notes that most of the more accurate explanations of the business cycle place more emphasis on real instead of nominal variables. He also notes that this more eccentric explanation model of the business cycle which he proposes cannot be wholly reconciled with any specific Austrian theory.</p>

<p>king kool ..was a pinball machine produced in 1972..by the D&gt; GOTTLIEB and co. it was one of many games produced by this company. it was a two player game...with a card theme. the artwork on the game depicted a king and his court..playing in a band. the characters resembled card characters. the playfield of the game...went along with the theme. it featured bumpers ..targets and spiners. the main part of playing the game was to hit all targets that spelled k i n g k o o l. points could also be racked up by hitting the ball through the spinners,.. advancing bonus. the bonus was collected at the end of each ball..and doubled or tripled, depending on players performance. the player had four flippers to operate at the bottom of the playfield. 5 balls or 3 balls could be played...depending on the game setting. KING KOOL..like many pinball machines was rich in style and artistic beauty. it was also made into a 4 player version ...named KING ROCK. the artwork was the same. this pinball machine is highly collected today for the art and the play of the game. it is very hard to find a game in excellent ..original condition.</p>

<p>Radishchev's Art Museum, the first Russian provincial public museum was founded in January 1878 by the initiative of famous artist Alexey P. Bogolujbov, "historian of Russian fleet", grandson of A.N.Radishchev. A special building was built for he museum and 29 June 1885 the museum opened its doors for the public.</p>
<p>The collection of pictures presented by Bogolujbov became the basis of the museum. It reflected many-sided creative links of the artist and included pictures of his contemporaries as well as wonderful works of old classic art. Bogolujbov's collection included china, furniture, books and manuscripts also.</p>
<p>Many famous Russian people took part in the museum's fate: P.M.Tretjakov and S.M.Tretjakov (Moscow collectors), F.A. Bronnikov, M.M.Antokolsky, F.S.Zhuravlev, A.A.Kharlamov (artists). There were also gifts from the Imperial Ermitazh Museum, Art Academy, Association of Peredvizhnikov.</p>
<p>No doubts that presenting to the museum his collection of pictures Bogolujbov gave his own works (painting, graphic arts, paintings on ceramics). Today the museum has about 200 his works. The best works of the artist dates back to 1870-th - the beginning of 1890 years. A.L.Kusch, the first museum's keeper, divided the collection into 25 parts. The contribution of Bogolujbov to each part of the collection says about his understanding of educational and enlightenment functions of the museum.</p>
<p>The collection was increased in 1920 -th - beginning of 1930 years when after the centralized dissemination of Russian values many wonderful pictures were given to the museum. Today the museum has the collection about 20 thousand various works: Russian and foreign painting, graphics, sculpture, Russian icons, rare books and manuscripts. Here one can see paintings of such famous Russian artists as: V.D.Polenov, F.A.Vasiljev, F.A.Bronnikov, I.I.Shishkin, V.M.Vasnetzov, I.N.Kramskoy, I.E.Repin as well as works of "Saratov Art School": V.Borisov-Musatov, P.V.Kuznetzov, P.S.Utkin, A.I.Savinov. At the beginning of he museum existence Bogolujbov considered it to fulfil educational role for Art School founded by him also. Bogolujov's Art School was founded on 1897 but museum which was opened 12 years before has become to play an independent role in the life of Saratov region.</p>
<p>For thousands of visitors who come to the museum every year to see its famous collection the museum is closely connected with the name of Radischev and Bogolujbov..</p>

<p>The Open Season are a young Australian based band that has been highly successful since their inception a year and a half ago. They began with modest aspirations, but found ourselves building a solid, growing fan base locally, which ultimately resulted in a record deal from Adelaide based label, Pee Records. This motivating factor lead the band to recording a five track EP at acclaimed Australian Soundhouse Studio with respected engineer/producer Darren Thompson. Their EP proved to be a great success, selling out the first pressing in a few months and making first and top 3 slots in the Awesam Charts for months after its release. The CD also made Triple Jâs Short Fast Loud Top 40 releases of 2005. The launch show sold out to a 350 strong crowd at Enigma Bar.</p>
<p>Since their inception, THE OPEN SEASON have shared the stage with notable bands such as Gyroscope, Mere Theory, After The Fall, Lagwagon (US), Kisschasy, Matchbook Romance (US), Straylight Run (US), In The Grey, Forgetting Yesterday, Angela's Dish, Hi End Audio (RIP), Stolen Youth, STR (RIP), Realist Few, Bullet The Blue Sky, Sunset Avenue and Unpaid Debt</p>

<p>Painting every one or two years is the usual method for exterior wall decoration on most types of buildings, however there are long life products available that can cut this maintenace dramatically. Many of the products available are trade only and must be applied by trained people with special tools or equipment.</p>
<p>â¢ Exterior wall coatings are commonly available in trowel-applied wallcoating, Spray applied coatings, roller applied wallcoating or trowel and roller applied wallcoatings. Probably the easiest, quickest and most value for money way to refurbish and repair pebbledashed or tyrolean, or even brick and masonry (masonary) walls.</p>
<p>An exterior wall coating, some may suggest, is the ideal alternative to the problem of what to do with a pebbledashed wall, especially when the home owner is not wishing for their home to look like pebbledash any longer! The range of colours available, and the process they use in repairing the wall and binding the existing pebbledash with âbaggingâ, or latex modified render, can save a lot of time, a lot of hassle, and in the long term, a lot of money.</p>
<p>Exterior wallcoatings, no matter how they are applied, are best explained as long life paints, with render/stucco elements to them. Indeed, some wallcoating products are actually made with hard minerals in them, such as perlite, or crushed marble. This gives the coating strength. This is combined with high quality colour pigments and dyes, flexible resins, fungicides etc. Some coatings are even made with an amount of glass fibre (grp) in them, so the essential concept in exterior coatings is low maintenance, long life and strength.</p>
<p>A masonry coating is not designed to be a cheap option, although the savings do come in the long term, (very much so), but itâs a one stop solution, that often means it saves more time and hassle than ever realised!</p>
<p>For a start, a high performance coating is always a one off job and the company doesnât normally have to ever return to the site. Secondly many companies offering this product, operate a national or international service, have a good customer care and liaison policy with helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff with systems in place to deal with any enquiries rather than a local builder or contractor.. Thirdly an exterior wall coatings, be it trowel, roller or spray applied, will cover up more bad DIY done by previous homeowners or cowboy builders, hide building joins in extensions, repair cracks and hollow render and essentially make the house water tight yet breathable with microporous technology constantly flexing to suit the mood of the house.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of wallcoating is that in normal curcumstances, it will last for up to 25 years, many products offering a guarantee for a large part of that period.</p>
<p>Some would advocate that this method is the one stop solution to repairing and painting the typical house with no fuss, hassle or worry &amp; handled by experts, and solves the problem with having to repaint exterior walls ever year.</p>

<p><b>TECHNICAL DATA:</b></p>
<p>TYPICAL DRY FILM THICKNESS Variable, although generally a film of a high performance exterior coating is about 20 times the thickness of a normal masonry paint film.</p>
<p>ELONGATION Very Flexible, in fact exterior wall coating systems are so flexible, they can be bent around 360 degrees!</p>
<p>SERVICE TEMPERATURE -15Âº C to + 80ÂºC. Most resin based exterior wall coating systems can be applied in freezing temperatures and in very hot weather too!</p>
<p>ACCELERATED WEATHERING M.O.D Def. 1053 - 1000 Hours No defects or change in flexibility meaning that claims of long life have been tested against this criteria and it "does what is says on the tin!". There are some brands of exterior wall coatings that have seperate accreditation, such as a BBA (british board of agrement) certficate or a BSi certificate.</p>
<p>CHEMICAL AND DAMP RESISTANCE Sulphur dioxide (No effect). Many resin based exterior coating systems resist the growth of damp, algae and mould, meaning that of your walls are green, they wont be anymore!</p>
<p>FLASH POINT 40Â°C</p>
<p>APPROXIMATE SOLIDS CONTENTS</p>
<p>68% by weight</p>
<p>52% By Volume</p>
<p>Specific gravity: 1.30</p>
<p>TSC (approx) 73% B.S 1391:1952</p>
<p>Viscosity (RTT) 54 Poise</p>
<p>DRYING TIME</p>
<p>&gt; 8 hours (touch dry) under normal conditions</p>
<p>A typical exterior wallcoating system is so thick and substantial that it can take up to 2 to 3 weeks to fully cure and dry. Customers must avoid placing ladders or any other objects onto the wall surface during this time.</p>
<p>IMPACT RESISTANCE</p>
<p>Internal test suggests that the film will tolerate a 5mm indentation without damage. For example, The NPA system is designed to be a thick protective coat all over your home, resisting the harsh weather, which breaks down normal masonry paint.</p>

<p>The Huon Highway links the capital of Tasmania - Hobart, with the satellite suburb of Kingston (This section of the highway is dual carriageway and freeway standard) and the major regional towns of the Huon Valley - Huonville, Franklin, Geeveston and Dover. The highway ends at Southport, making the Huon Highway the southern-most in Australia. The highway runs for 100 kilometres, and the Hobart-Kingston section was built in the 1960's, known as the Southern Outlet, to bypass the far windier "old" Huon Highway that runs through Fern Tree and Longley. This was of particular importance as the highway is frequented by log trucks, and the old portion of the highway runs just below the foot of [Mount Wellington] , and the village of [Fern Tree] is virtually a nature reserve, 10 minutes from Hobart city centre.</p>

<p>The sale/leaseback is a financing technique that has been used in the United States since the 1940's. Sale/leaseback transactions provide alternative methods of ownership, investment, financing and risk allocation</p>
<p>The transaction, in its most basic form, involves the sale of a property to an investor who holds title and leases the property back to the former owner. The lease is typically a long-term "net" lease, with the seller/tenant having the option of repurchasing at a later time. The seller/tenant reaps the benefit of favorable 100% "financing" and still retains the use of the property. The buyer/landlord receives the tax benefit of depreciation and a guaranteed long-term rental.</p>

<p>The Esk Highway links the Midland and Tasman Highways in Tasmania, running through the towns of Avoca, Fingal and St Marys to the Chain of Lagoons, and is an important shortcut to St Marys in particular, reducing the distance to be traveled by 80 kilometres if the Tasman Highway was to be used. The highways total length is 101 Kilometres, and is interesting in that two sections of highway branch out of St Marys to join the north and south sections of the Tasman Highway, both labeled as the same highway. The southern section goes through Elephant Pass.</p>

<p>The Danish radio channel P3 invented and introduced the concept of happy huggin as the improved version of the malfunctioning fad happy slapping. Happy hugging is hugging, often of individuals not prepeared for the hug. Similar to happy slapping, happy hugging is a kind of video created on a cellphone with videocapture functionality.</p>

<p>World Toilet Organization (WTO) has started the World Toilet College (WTC) because there was a need for an unbiased world body to ensure that the best standards in Toilet Design, Cleanliness, Maintenance, Quality of Work and Sanitation Technologies are observed.</p>
<p>WTC is a dedicated institution that offers training programs such as Restroom Design Course, Restroom Specialist Training Course and Ecological Sanitation Course.</p>
<p>The Restroom Specialist Training Course is intended to redesign the restroom cleaner's tasks and bring it to a new professional level. The Ecological Sanitation Course is the first of many that will train much needed sanitation human resource to help alleviate the 2.6 billion people worldwide that do not have a toilet. Lastly, the Restroom Design will teach the finer points of designing a public restroom for those responsible.</p>
<p>There are presently no comprehensive toilet educational institutions that address the needs of both urban and rural toilets in a continuous manner. Locally and worldwide, through WTO, WTC has support from government ministries and agencies, private companies, sanitation experts, and industry stalwarts. In addition, WTO has a network of resources such as the World Toilet Summits to leverage.</p>

<p>The Duties of a Lieutenant Governor vary from state to state. In California, the Lt. Governor sits on the UC Board of Regents, which governs the highly successful California public university system, several state commissions for the economy (including the California World Trade Commission and the Commission for Economic Development, which he chairs), as well as carrying out various tasks assigned to him by the governor. In Texas, the Lieutenant Governor possesses sweeping powers as permanent president of the state senate, where he has authority over almost all legislation that passes through the chamber. In practically all states, however, the Lieutenant Governor is president of the state senate (although usually with far less sweeping authority than the Lieutenant Governor of Texas), as well as serving as Acting-Governor when the Governor himself is unable to carry out his duties. In the electoral process, the Lieutenant Governor is practically always elected as a state office separately from the Governor, and can often be of a different party than the Governor.</p>

<p>Puchalapalli Sundarayya was a founder member of the Communist Party of India and a great leader of the working class movement of India. Comrade Sundarayya, popularly known as Comrade PS died at the age of 72 on the morning of May 19, 1985.</p>
<p>Even those who differed with Comrade Sundarayya loved and respected him. He was selfless man and the devotion and sincerity with which he served the cause of toiling masses and common people, had endeared him to one and all. He was a great internationalist leader of working class. He was one of the leaders who fought against right and left deviations in the Communist movement in India.</p>
<p>At an early age of 17, he discontinued his studies halfway in the intermediate class and plunged into the non-cooperation movement launched by the Congress party in 1930. He was arrested and sent to Borstal school, where he established his relations with Socialists and Communists. On his release, he started organising the agricultural labourers in his own village and he was victim to the anger of his own kith and kin.</p>
<p>Guided by Comrade Amir Hyder Khan, he joined the Communist Party, at a time when there was a ban on the Party, subjected by the then British rulers. Like many other Communists, he worked in the Congress Socialist Party. He was for some time the Secretary of the Congress Socialist Party. After the arrest of Comrade Amir Hyder Khan, he took up the task of building the Communist party in the Southern States of Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, at the instance of Central Committee of the Party. Com. Sundarayya along with Com. S.V.Ghate were responsible for the entry of many comrades like EMS Namboodiripad, P.Krishna Pillai and A.K.Gopalan.</p>
<p>When different communist groups came together and merged in an all-India centre in 1936, Com. Sundarayya became the member the Central Committee. During the same year, he founded the All India Kisan Sabha and worked as joint secretary of that organisation for some time. He led underground life between 1939 and 1942, when he was haunted by the police.</p>
<p>The ban on the party was lifted in 1943, when the first All India conference of the party was held at Bombay. He was again elected to the Central Committee in the second party Congress held at Calcutta. Com. Sundarayya, who was already associated with the ongoing heroic Telangana armed struggle, got himself totally involved in it and was one of its important leaders. He went underground between 1948 and 1952.</p>
<p>He was re-elected to the Central Committee in 1952 when a special party conference was held. He was also elected to the Polit Bureau.</p>
<p>He was elected to Rajya Sabha from the Madras Assembly constituency after the first General Elections in 1952 and became the leader of the Communist group in Parliament. He was re-elected to Central Committee and the Polit Bureau in the third party Congress in Vijayawada and in the fourth Congress held at Palghat.</p>
<p>He was elected to the State Assembly and remained a member of that House till 1967. He contested again and got elected in 1978. He continued till 1983 and, thereafter, did not contest. He was the leader of the Communist Party of Indiaâs group in the Assembly and later the leader of CPI(M) group.</p>
<p>He was elected to the Central Executive and the Central Secretariat of the Party at the fifth Party Congress held at Amritsar. However, he resigned both the positions protesting against the revisionist policies of the dominant leadership of CPI. He was arrested and imprisoned during November 1962 at the time of India-China border war.</p>
<p>Those who fought against revisionism organised the Seventh Party Congress in October-November 1964 and adopted a New Party Programme, electing Com. Sundarayya as General Secretary of the Party. He was re-elected to that post in the eighth and ninth Party Congress. He remained Partyâs General Secretary till 1976.</p>
<p>Immediately after partyâs Seventh Congress, several Marxist party leaders along with Com. Sundarayya were arrested by the Congress Government and detained till May 1966. Again, Com. Sundarayya had to work underground during the emergency between 1975-77. At the time of his death, he was holding partyâs General Secretary post in Andhra Pradesh and was member, Central Committee of the Party. His wife late Lila Sundarayya too was a leader of the CPI(M).</p>

<p>The story begins with Sinbad regaling a group of travelers around a night-time campfire. Bored with his often repeated tales, Sinbad then tells them a new story of his "eighth" voyage. With his friend, Abbu, Sinbad rescues an abandonned ship which contains a map to the lost treasure of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>. Sailing the ship to a port, it is confiscated by the local <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan.html" title="Sultan">sultan</a>, to be sold at auction. Sinbad obtains an agreement that he may keep the ship if there are no bids. He scares away all the bidders with not-so-sublte comments about the ship being cursed. At the last moment, one bidder appears, a veiled woman born by four servants. Sinbad bids against her and ends up owing a huge sum he cannot pay. Visiting the woman that night, uninvited, in the harem, Sinbad learns of a mysterious and deadly person known as Jamel, who will stop at nothing to acquire the treasure. Sinbad escapes from the harem and steals the ship, acquiring a rough crew to man it. During the voyage, stange stories of the evil Jamel circulate among the crew, but no one alive has ever seen him. After several days, Sinbad's ship is overtaken by the Sheik, who owns the woman in the harem visited by Sinbad. Taking Sinbad and his crew prisoner, they continue towards the treasure island. It is then revealed that Sinbad's ship's barber is none other than Jamel. Together they all arrive at the treasure island and attempt to convice the lone guardian that Sinbad is his lost son, owing to a medallion Sinbad once found, and tell them where the treasure is hidden. As the greedy sheik and Jamel try to carry off the loot, the island convulses in earthquakes, killing many, but not Sinbad. Escaping to his ship, he sails off. The movie concludes with Sinbad wrapping up his tale to the audience around the campfire. When he finishes, they don't believe him and accuse him of telling yet another tall tale. They soon change their minds when Sinbad distributes precious jewels and gold and shows them the beautiful woman, who is now (presumably) his wife.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Fairbanks%2C_Jr._cf18.html" title="Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a>, played the part of Sinbad with intentionally dramatic physical movements - leaping, jumping, almost dance-like in many scenes. While not realistic, it contributes to the movie's flair and storytelling mood.</p>

<p>Sequart.com, founded by Julian Darius, is a website dedicated to the serious study of comic books, graphic novels, and other sequential art (hence the name "Sequart," which Mr. Darius himself conceived). Founded in 1996 and revamped in 2000, Sequart.com (and its print arm, Sequart.com Books) has enjoyed increasing seuccess, in part due to the site's growing variety of information. Resources provided by the site include the "ComicsFiles," a tabulation of various creators and comic works that chronicles the creative forces behind the masks over the years; the "Coninuity Pages," providing valuable information in great detail regarding hundreds of specific titles, creators, characters, and storylines; interviews with creators such as Mark Millar and Joe Quesada; and the Sequart.com columns. The most informative and well-known columns on Sequart.com include "Anatomy of the Crossover," "The Comics Blotter," "Sequential culture," and Mr. Darius's own "Comics Aficionado." Recently, humor, critique, and other such columns have begun to grab hold of the site's audience, including the retailer-oriented "Counter Intelligence" by Lisa Lopacinksi and the controversial humor column "Tact is for the Weak" by Brian Graiser.</p>
<p>The popularity of this website is growing rapidly, with hundreds of registered members and the highest page hit count record of almost 150,000. The Sequart.com staff, when not busy publishing their books, are often found at comic book conventions around the nation.</p>

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog - Amiga ECS Demo</p>
<p><b>Sonic The Hedgehog</b>, originally a game created by Sonic Team for the Sega Megadrive, was ported to the Amiga as part of the vibrant public domain (PD) demo scene. The demo was created by Dual Crew-Shining in the early 1990's.</p>
<p>Although unplayable, the demonstration was a clear example of what might have been achievable on the lowly Amiga 500 with the right technical know-how. <b>Sonic The Hedgehog</b> was an extremely popular platform title thanks to its bright art direction and fast gameplay, something Sega claimed was only possible thanks to the "Blast Processing" of the Megadrive hardware. The demo suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>The name Palmalla originates From the Dishsoap Brand "Palmolive" While trying to think of a name T.Vv. saw the soap and shouted it out. Toaster later changed it to Palmalla. Now, Palmalla is enjoyed by thousands all along the North Eastern U.S. and parts of Canada</p>
<p>Palmalla is a game or form of entertainment created by two people who go by T.Vv. and Toaster. It was created on March 12, 2005 out of a fit of pure rage after not being able to find a suitable ride to go snowboard. Its basic principle is that teens like to burn things and throw things and this combines the two. A person wishing to play Palmalla must attain three things. Tennis balls (the more the better), gas, and something to light the gas with. One would take the tennis ball, douse it in gas, light it on fire then do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p><b>WARNING</b> Side Effects of Playing Palmalla Include, but are not limited to, 3rd, 2nd and 1st degree burns, Holes in Clothing, Hosipital Vists and the Fire/Police Department Being Called. Palmalla was Made for Your Enjoyment so Please Do Not Act Responsibaly</p>

<p>The Most Rev. David Andres Alvarez is the second native Puerto Rican to serve as Bishop of the Diocese of Puerto Rico of the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_of_the_United_States_061e.html" title="Episcopal Church of the United States">Episcopal Church of the United States</a> (ECUSA). During his years of service, he has strengthened the Episcopal Church's role within the island's health services provider sector, expanding the church's hospital holdings from one hospital (St. Luke's in Ponce) to three (adding a larger St. Luke's II in Ponce, and Cristo Redentor Hospital in Guayama). Under his leadership, the Church ceased to be a separate national church within the world <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> community and rejoined the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_of_the_United_States_061e.html" title="Episcopal Church of the United States">Episcopal Church of the United States</a>. Under his leadership, the Episcopal Church has improved its communications efforts, including a weekly, islandwide, Sunday morning radio program and an improved full-color monthly magazine. He has served as acting Bishop in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and is increasingly serving as a regional leader in the Anglican community and contributing to the U.S. church's efforts among Hispanic Americans.</p>
<p>In recent years, Episcopalians have had a higher public profile in Puerto Rico. During former Gov. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Sila_Calderon_fe11.html" title="Sila Calderon">Sila Calderon</a>'s term in office, Episcopalians held important government positions in Puerto Rico's three branches of government, including Secretary of State Ferdinand Mercado, Senate Minority Leader <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_McClintock_87ec.html" title="Kenneth McClintock">Kenneth McClintock</a>, and Courts Administrator Mercedes Bauermeister. During Gov. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anibal_Acevedo_Vila_75b3.html" title="Anibal Acevedo Vila">Anibal Acevedo Vila</a>'s current term, McClintock, now the Senate President, is the highest Episcopalian in public office.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Bishop Alvarez unsuccessfully attempted to begin an orderly succession with the election of an Auxiliary Bishop, but the Diocesan Assembly did not support such efforts at the time.</p>

<p><a href="../../../h/y/j/Hyjak.html" title="Hyjak">Hyjak</a></p>
<p>Hyjak is a member of anotha.com. He got his name from an Australian Emcee.</p>
<p>Hyjak does a lot of Poetry, Graphic Art and Audio mixing.</p>
<p>His mixtape, "Hyjak presents... Jakkin Beatz: The mixtape Vol. 1" can be downloaded for free, for a limited time, here...</p>
<p>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=PSN1I1FM</p>
<p>Like I've said before... you got talent and really have bright horizons... this mixtape is a reflection of everything you stand for--striving creativity, poetic genius and a constant knack and love for hip-hop (now you better quote that)... That whole "Rap Pioneer" song inspired me. My favorites were the Linkin Park and DMX mash and the Dreams and Still D.R.E. mash. Keep on keepin' on... consider selling this." - sp!tf!r3</p>
<p><br />
Also, here's a poem that Hyjak did entitled "Unscripted Feelings"</p>
<p><br />
Unscripted Feelings</p>
<p>One touch, one kiss, was all it took No previous desire, but they were hooked This scene of course was ill-rehearsed But this kiss was perfect, yet still their first Their eyes opened together, almost synchronised And at that point they both realised That what was happening was not forseen But what they felt was so serene Spirits intertwined as feelings grew And the curtain closes, right on cue The crowd erupts, yet they stand still Embracing time, as they forever will</p>

<p><i>1998 - dir. <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Anderson_%28film_director%29_75ef.html" title="Brad Anderson (film director)">Brad Anderson</a></i></p>
<p>Charmingly gentle film starring <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope_Davis_ef6f.html" title="Hope Davis">Hope Davis</a> and Alan Gelfant as two strangers whose paths intersect more and more significantly as time goes on.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope_Davis_ef6f.html" title="Hope Davis">Hope Davis</a> shines in an attractive portrayal of a hard-bitten romantic (Erin Castleton) who struggles to find some intelligent companionship. Alan Gelfant does bloke-dom proud by supplying a real man (Alan Monteiro) who strives and manages to better the mediocre efforts of those around him.</p>
<p>The film is beautifully low-key and accompanied by an appropriately soft soundtrack.</p>
