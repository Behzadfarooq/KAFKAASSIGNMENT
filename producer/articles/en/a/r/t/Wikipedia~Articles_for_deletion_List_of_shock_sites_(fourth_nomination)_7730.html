<p>This article is in need of deletion because it violates several of Wikipedia's policies. For one, it is simply a list of random shock sites that various people have compiled; in effect, an advertisement for shock sites. Wikipedia is a repository for notable information, not an indiscriminate linkfarm. If any of the sites mentioned in the article are notable, then individual articles can be created for them, but most of them would not likely merit an article.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of censorship, while Wikipedia is <i>not</i> censored for the protection of minors, that does not mean that any form of content is acceptable anywhere on Wikipedia. In fact, links to shock sites is something <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">specifically mentioned against in <i>What Wikipedia is not</i></a>. Several users have pointed out that this only refers to placing links to shock sites in articles that are completely unrelated, and that placing links to shock sites in an article dedicated to them is naturally acceptable. However, that would mean that by creating an article dedicated to something that is normally prohibited, the prohibition can just be bypassed. An analogy would be a person disagreeing with Wikipedia's policy about having POV in articles, and creating an article on a subject and specifically noting that POV is allowed in the article as a loophole. Having a link to a specific shock site in the article for that site may fall into Wikipedia's category of appropriate usage, but creating an article that is an indiscriminate list of shock sites is really just a way to bypass Wikipedia's policy of inappropriate linkage.</p>
<p>It should be noted also that a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShock_sites_4911.html" title="Category:Shock sites">Category:Shock sites</a> already exists.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to bring to light the interests of those whom have taken both sides of this issue. Though I cannot speak completely objectively, I find that many those who are <b>for</b> the deletion of this article to have the interests of Wikipedia in mind, while those who <b>oppose</b> the deletion often seem concerned primarily with their own interests. Examples of this may be seen in the many of the votes cast during deletion debates.</p>
<p>The following are three votes submitted during previous deletion nominations for this article that share my sentiment:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Delete</i> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">User:Thesquire</a> 10:11, 14 January 2006 (UTC) <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28second_nom%29_6459.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (second nom)">{2nd nomination)</a></i></li>
<li><i>Delete</i> — The large majority of the sites listed on this page would not stand on their own merits of notability. This page appears to be essentially a blow-by-blow list of web site links. I see nothing notable about this page. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">User:RJHall</a> 19:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC) <i>(2nd nomination)</i></li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - This page is just a resource for those Internet trolls out there who want to scare/disgust other people with these shock sites. There is absolutely no need for this article to stay. I can't believe people are asking to keep this article; It's basically advertising vulgar photographs. I suppose anyone can make a shock site and use this article to "advertise" it. I strongly doubt anyone will come into the mishap of seeing these vulgar links if no one sees this page. I suppose the page that just defines a shock site is OK, but there is no need to post links to shock sites. People know what a shock site is, and they don't need to see an example. --User:Blackeye 12:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC) <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28third_nomination%29_e953.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (third nomination)">{3rd nomination)</a></i></li>
</ol>
<p>I would also like to mention that one of the most repeated reasons for the opposition of deletion has been about Wikipedia not being censored. There are two things wrong with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia, while not censored for the protection of minors, <i>does</i> have content guidlines, and, as I stated before, shock site links is something specifically mentioned against.</li>
<li>Completely disregarding censorship for a moment, the article is not suitable for Wikipedia. As was stated before, it is just an indiscriminate collection of links and violates policies related to spam and advertisement/promotion. If the article had delt with inoffensive material, it would have been deleted promptly, yet because it deals with shock sites, many have opposed its deletion even though it merits it for fear that by supporting its deletion they might be participating in "censorship".</li>
</ol>
<p>I will conclude by asking those who are considering casting a vote to think this matter through and to vote with Wikipedia taking precedence over their own interests. Thank you. - Conrad Devonshire 07:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>One other thing that I would like to mention that has merited this article's deletion is that most of the sites listed there made no attempt at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> (though this has been corrected since this nomination began). in other words, they had a discription listed beside their link of what content the link contained, but as most of the sites were said to contain just a single image, there was no way of determining whether or not the discriptions were accurate.</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b>. Why the rant against other users? It only serves to heat the atmosphere imho. I'd appreciate a rewrite of this, keeping to the arguments on the article alone. Furthermor, its confusing to people like me, who just wander in to vote on <i>content</i> rather than on who has chosen what side. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">The Minist</font></u></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><u><font color="green">e</font></u></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">r of War</font></u></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Minister_of_War_5304.html" title="User talk:The Minister of War"><sup><font color="navy">(Peace)</font></sup></a> 13:58, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Comment</b> Like <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War">User: The Minister of War</a>, I too have an issue with the formatting of this nomination. I would like to see links to the previous nominations clearly listed in one place, all in a row, at the top of the nomination, rather than this hodgepodge of votes quoted seemingly at random, with editorial comments, and no links to see context. If we are being asked to make a considered decision, give us the links to the older discussions, make a reasoned case for the deletion and let us weigh in with our opinions. As it is now, I don't have the time to try to decipher this mess. I won't be commenting until it's reorganised, I fear. Note, for the record, I've seen notes about this discussion, asking for people to weigh in, placed on <i>OTHER WIKIs</i>...

<li><b>Keep</b> Shock sites are a part of the internet, and it is only fair to give them a dedicated page. The reasoning "each site wouldn't stand in a page of it's own on wikipedia" is stupid, as you could say that about an album, for example. Why would you list the tracks of an album when you could write a page for each song? You wouldn't. That is why most songs don't have a wikipedia entry, only more notable ones.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like whoever said above, just delete specific ones. If you delete the list you really should delete the individual entries for the important site as well or your whole purpose is defeated. --What does this do? 15:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe in not helping publicize websites that do more harm than good. I believe in protection for minors no matter what Wikipedia says, and my votes and edits will reflect that. Actions that protect minors also tend to protect some adults. When the downside of such actions is just fewer entertainment websites, such actions should generally be taken. If the entertainment is commonly labled as "shock" then it's a no-brainer, and it's even more of a no-brainer when you see what the sites in question actually are.</li>

<dd>That guidline does not mean that rules can be oughtright broken. That's ridiculous. It simply means that if one feels too constrained by the rules he should just try to do the best he knows how without memorizing them. - Conrad Devonshire 11:40, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My interpretation of the policy is that if a rule is getting in the way of making a better encyclopedia, ignore it. I feel that, if you believe it does break rules (which is disputed), then it does in fact fall in to this category. I would most likely argue the same for any article that has survived 3 AfD's that supposedly breaks rules. It shows the community wants it, and we shouldn't be deleting it because of a "rule" when so many people want it. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:37, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, it's an eternal list with no internal mechanism for limitation. Second, it is <i>inherently POV</i> to have "List of (notable/significant) shock sites": without any objective criteria for inclusion, the include/exclude is POV. Third, there is no internal organization to the list -- chronological, in terms of hits, in terms of amount of animation. Fourth, the topic is ephemeral, and sites wink in and out of existence, so, by the time a site is listed, the list is already out of date. Fifth, it's not explained in any context -- it's just a list. "List of shoes in my closet" is also a list, and my shoes are very important to my feet. Without anything internal to the article to give the items listed a function, there is no internal logic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:40, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The argument about this page being specifically prohibited by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it <b>specifically</b> says <b>inappropriate</b> links to shock sites. I can't see anywhere else where they would be more appropriate. Also, the interpretation of the voting is highly biased. There were plenty of votes for deletion that were primarily selfish (e.g. "This site is disgusting; there is enough crap on the web and wikipedia is meant to break away from that.") and plenty of selfless keep votes. This article is <b>not</b> an advertisment, if anything it deters people from visiting these sites. For every troll that uses this page as a reference there are about 50 innocent users who now avoid visiting any of these sites. There is also fact that every time this article is nominated for deletion the number of keep votes heavily outnumber those for delete. As for none of these sites meriting an article, <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Measure_7d1a.html" title="Last Measure">Last Measure</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> all already have their own articles. So in conclusion I think that this article should be kept, but cleaned up. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoolish_Child_f1d0.html" title="User:Foolish Child">Foolish Child</a> (<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoolish_Child_56c0.html" title="User talk:Foolish Child">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Foolish_Child_860a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Foolish Child">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>First of all, most of the sites linked to on that page have just been random sites of no notablitiy, and therefore the links are inappropriate. And of 20+ sites listed there, only three have their own articles (and the article <a href="../../../h/a/i/HAI2U_5bbe.html" title="HAI2U">HAI2U</a> is being considered for deletion). While the page may help people to know not to visit those sites, it would also provide a haven of sites for trolls to get their hands on and link people to. Most people who end up visiting those sites do so unintenionally due to a troll's meddling, correct? So knowing not to intenionally go to them would not do much good. Also, while I do admit that there was selfishness and selflessness on the parts of both the "keep" and "delete" voters (and showed an example of an unselfish "keep" vote in order to be balanced), the lack of consideration for Wikipedia has been far more apparent on the part of the "keep" voters than it has on the part of the "delete" voters. - Conrad Devonshire 12:31, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's quite a simple matter to block your browser from ever taking you to a site, so yes, it does cut down on the number of visitors to a site. One can visit this article and add all the sites contained to a "block-list". I know of several people who use this article in such a way. And besides, the vast majority of people ending up on these sites are due to entirely unmasked social engineering attempts in forums by users exploiting the new memebers' ignorance. And while I know that several of these sites are definately not notable, I did say this page required cleanup, which would involve deleting those.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Shock sites are an important phenomenon. They are certainly notable, as they many represent some of the most vulgar material found anywhere--on the internet or otherwise. Deleting the list I do not think is in Wikipedia's spirit of exploration, as the sites actually should be studied and discussed. I would like to know why exactly they are created and how people can endure such poses.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable and not in violation of any Wikipedia principles. Specifically, WP:NOT mentions shock sites in the context of <i>(such as inappropriate links to shock sites)</i> therefore implying that <i>appropriate</i> links are allowable. One would be hard pressed to argue that a page entitled "List of shock sites" would be an inappropriate place for such links. Finally, there is the process issue. Even if the last nomination was "bungled" as argued above, the previous ones were not, nor has anyone really come through with new rationale for deletion since it survived the last ones.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I agree. If the nominator has reason to believe community beliefs have changed significantly since the last nomination, <i>then</i> it would not be very improper, in my opinion, to nominate the article for deletion again. However, a week is not long enough for the Wikipedia community to change radically. These nominations could be considered a form of harassment; a way of holding a <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Damocles_0f14.html" title="Sword of Damocles">sword of Damocles</a> over editors heads, always trying to keep them in fear of having their contributions deleted (i.e., threatening them).

That may not be good. But what is more important is that despite my personal distaste for this topic, it is encyclopedic.

As for my personally addressing many comments, I admit that I probably have gone overboard on that and will try to refrain from doing it so frequently from now on. I have nothing "personal" at stake in this debate, but I believe that articles like this are detremental to the quality of Wikipedia and that the only reason that this article has been kept for as long as it has is because the argument for its deletion has been made to seem all about censorship, even though there are other strong reasons for its deletion. - Conrad Devonshire 18:21, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Four nominations, and it is up for a vote AGAIN. I will say what I said at the last vote... Wikipedia is not something that bends to the will of the squeamish. Sure, you don't like shock sites, understandable. BUT that doesn't mean that shock sites don't exist. Nominator mentioned the Wikipedia policy, and it says delete shock sites immediately EXCEPT FOR PAGES WHICH DEAL WITH IT SPECIFICALLY. I believe that "List of shock sites" deal SPECIFICALLY with it, so obviously the nominator's "Wiki guideline" argument flies right out the window. Nominator also villifies anyone who votes for keep. Surely, this is abuse? "You vote delete FOR THE GOOD OF WIKIPEDIA. IF YOU VOTE KEEP YOU ARE TRASH WHO DOES NOTHING BUT CONTRIBUTE TO MORAL DECAY." This is an unacceptable attitude. I, and hopefully others, will not be pressured by this attitude of "My way or the highway". I will say this again. You may not like it, but this article does serve its purpose (warning others of shock sites, giving example of what a shock site is, a chronicle of internet history).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks to me like Conrad has an agenda here. Note the extremely lengthy intro, and of course, his stupid idea that the people voting to keep are doing so only for moral decay. In a time when our crime rate is down, when same-sex marriage has REDUCED sexual promiscuity, and basically people are beginning to realize that true morals (don't kill, don't steal, don't harm others) are more important than stupid shit like laughing at shock sites, it's sad that people like Conrad just don't get it. Nice way to try to be a hero, Conrad - point at some minor "sin" and attach yourself to it to hide from your own personal problems (yes, I checked out your user page).

<li>Addressing User:69.248.236.62, I would appreciate it if you would not attack me simply because you disagree with my belefs and stop trying to infer my reasons for nominating this article for deletion. You claim that same-sex marriage has reduced sexual promiscuity based on the fact that same-sex couples have been shown to last longer on average than married couples, however this does not take into account the number of additional partners that the two members each have during their relationship. And also what morals are "true" and what morals are "stupid shit" are entirely your opinions. It is my belief that things that we tend to deem "smaller", such as pornography lead to the "greater" wrongs, such as murder, and therefore if the "smaller" wrongs were done away with, the greater wrongs would consequently disappear. As for my introduction, I wrote it to try to point out the problems that the article had and avoid making the nomination seem strictly about explicit content. Just because you disagree with it does not give you the right to remove it. - Conrad Devonshire 00:34, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

If links to shock sites are inappropriate on a list of links to shock sites, what exactly *is* appropriate? Furthermore, bringing up users' motivations in voting is a total red-herring. But the ridiculousness of this claim is all the more vindicated by the fact that Conrad solicited votes from previous AfD nominations for this page, as well as his numerous lamentations of society's "corruption" on his user page.

<dd><b>Response</b> I don't want to stir up a hornet's nest here, but there is an element of stones and glass houses involved with this. Some may interpret your opening comments to be attacking past (and potential) 'Keep' voters- you do seem to imply that the preponderance are a) selfish, and b) do not have the encyclopaedia's best interests at heart. It would have been a better idea to simply state your opinion of the article, why YOU think it shouldn't be in the encyclopaedia, and particularly, <i>what has changed since the previous 'Keep' vote on the 9th of April?</i>. Speculating as to voter's intent or cherrypicking previous votes (for or against) is unnecessary. I have to say, it is not hard to detect POV in the wording of your nomination (rather than a frank assessment of the article's quality), which editors may pick up and comment upon. Of course however, the only points to be considered here are a) does the article conform to policy; b) has good process been followed in making the nomination. All else is irrelevant. Personal or <i>ad hominem</i> attacks of ANY form are always unacceptable. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether or not they're "shocking" (an opinion) is not the point. The links to the articles have discriptions next to them describing their content, but most make no attempt at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>, and therefore there is no way of determining their accuracy.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but clean-up. It's survived several nominations so why is it being relisted again?

<li>The page is completely redundant. There is already an article on the subject, which if properly expanded in accordance with the content policies and associated guidelines <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> will more than adequately cover whichever few sites have the supportive literature necessary for encyclopedic treatment. There is also the category, to link to the small number of articles on those shocksites which have enough reliable source material to justify individual article pages. The page as it appeared before Brenneman's clean up was in a very poor state. Aside from the redundancy issue, there was an arbitrary division of the sites into "Major shock sites" and "Other shock sites"; this is an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">inherently non-neutral</a> construct, as is the idea that some of the entries are indeed "shocking" in the first place.
<p>The keep arguments are not convincing, to my mind. <b>"Useful" is not synonymous with "deserving an encyclopedia entry"</b>. My telephone directory is useful too; like this list, however, that does not mean it is appropriate for its contents to be listed in a Wikipedia entry. The test of encyclopediability has never changed: has the subject been sufficiently studied and reported on in multiple, independent, reliable publications? Are there books, theses, monographs, journal articles, government or repliable third-party reports, newspaper articles, and/or magazine articles that are focused on the subject? If these are plentiful and of very high quality, and the subject meets notability guidelines, then the acceptability of having a page on the subject is a given (for example, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>). At the other end, if there are a few stray sentences on the subject in a newspaper article that is devoted to something else, the subject probably does not deserve an dedicated entry, especially if there is no sound reason to adopt an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualist" class="extiw" title="m:eventualist">m:eventualist</a> view (the John Bambanek entry was a good example). And if the subject has <i>no source whatsoever</i> (in independent reputable publications), the question of including it in the encyclopedia in any form simply does not arise: we can't include it, whether as a statement in a broader article, an item on a list, or (obviously) a dedicated entry.</p>
<p>I suspect the items on this list fall in several different places on this spectrum. A small number may have source material; many, however, are likely entirely bereft of good sources. This posits a further difficulty for this list, in addition to the redundancy and non-neutral arguments I have already alluded to above. The best outcome IMHO would be to expand the main article on shock sites (<i>in accordance with</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). I would ask for a redirect, but the phrase "List of shock sites" isn't a good one. Hence, <b>delete</b>. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 07:35, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The difference between your telephone directory and a list of internet shock sites is that your telephone directory is only useful on a local level. If there was a wiki for the city of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington%2C_North_Carolina_2612.html" title="Burlington, North Carolina">Burlington, North Carolina</a>, an article listing public telephone numbers for Burlington, North Carolina might be appropriate after all.
<p>There are a number of cultural phenomena that have articles on wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_jamming.html" title="Culture jamming">Culture jamming</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a>, and virtually every article discussed in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">Internet meme</a>) that receive (compared to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>) little attention from mainstream publications and academia. I think this is a pretty poor measure of worthiness on wikipedia.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of shock sites is no less legitimate an article topic than a comprehensive list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_children_of_Orthodox_priests_d0d7.html" title="List of famous children of Orthodox priests">famous children of Orthodox clergy</a> (which I'd wager a list of shock sites is both more useful than and more encyclopediable than). However, if it is going to remain in its present, heavily edited form, the article may as well be merged with <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_sites.html" title="Shock sites">Shock sites</a>. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvertist_0b89.html" title="User:Avertist">Avertist</a> 16:40, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
