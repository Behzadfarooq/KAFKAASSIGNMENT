<p>This film does not yet exist, and can not be evaluated for notability. Promotional materials and prerelease articles can not be deemed sufficiently reliable.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The notability can be established from the previous two films. Why can't pre-release articles be reliable? There's a reason Wikipedia has {{future}} templates, such as the one in use in this article and {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_book_2883.html" title="Template:Future book">future book</a>}} at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reaves_aeb9.html" title="User talk:John Reaves">(talk)</a></small> 18:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Are there no guidelines for prerelease entries? As a scheduled (and in full production) sequel to a major film series, I'd say it's sufficiently notable. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 18:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And I, of course, did not state that you had guaranteed it. But I asked whether you could, and if in fact you can't, then how can you decide the notability of a film which doesn't exist and theoretically may never exist? It's still crystal ball speculation to write an article on a film that hasn't been made.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 19:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't feel it's necessary to guarantee the release of the film in order for it to be notable. The article has the appropriate tag for a future release, which warns the reader that the film is in production and has been scheduled, but the information may change before then. Wikipedia has similar tags for other types of scheduled events. It's not possible to guarantee with 100% certainty that a future space flight will take place (a number of factors could indefinitely delay or change the plans) but an article is still warranted, and a tag is placed to warn the reader. No crystalballing is done, only facts that a reader could easily find for themselves regarding the production. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 19:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not every incomplete film deserves its own article, and the vast majority of such films go unnoted by the public and history. But those films which do deserve note, for being notable failures, can be evaluated some time after the end of production.

<li><b>Reason For Delete Nomination</b> As the nominator for this AfD, I'm suggesting the deletion of the article, on the grounds that a film that does not yet exist can not be properly evaluated for notability. As I recently commented on a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Mummy_3_7b59.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/The Mummy 3">withdrawn nomination for The Mummy 3</a>, under the heading "nomination was correct,"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>All films in development and production are subjects of rumors, unauthorized leaks, and intentional misinformation. There is never a guarantee of completion, but even if completion could be guaranteed, a film can not be guaranteed "notability" in advance. Entertainment magazines, and promotional materials often spread unreliable rumors. Some sources, such as IMDB or Variety can be much more reliable when discussing completed projects than describing projects in development or production... The assumption is generally that these articles are highly speculative and subject to change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By selecting Ocean's Thirteen, I have deliberately selected a high-profile film property, which is being advertised, which is currently in production, which has a promotional page from it's production company, including a teaser trailer. I maintain that even these materials give us little reliable information upon which to build an article, and that the article is necessarily bound to contain inaccuracies, unless it is left extremely bare of any detail, in which case it is not a suitable article for inclusion at Wikipedia. Simply put, this is an article about a non-existent subject. Should Hollywood's hype and marketing budgets be sufficient to guarantee an enyclopedically notable product before it's even been seen by a reliable critic, objective outsider, or in fact by anyone?<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 18:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You bring up some good points here, but what I'm cautious about is the unilateral denouncement of all sources regarding unreleased media (I assume this extends beyond films into other unreleased/advertised media). I believe that it can be notable before it has been seen (but it should obviously exist in some form beyond a rumor). I'm interested in hearing more counterpoints as well. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 18:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While there can never be an absolute guarantee of notability for a future film, you can be reasonably certain of its notability. Wikipedia does not deal in absolutes; most of the guidelines are left intentionally vague. Notability is one such guideline. While it may be a future film, the notability is directly asserted by the notability of the previous films; no matter what the outcome, if this movie makes it or fails it will be notable as a flop or a success. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 20:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the simple reason that even if it weren't released, it'd still be notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:09, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have no reason to suspect it will be notable if released, except for the fact that the standards of notability for films on Wikipedia are <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Film_Notability.2C_and_Notability_in_general" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">extremely low</a>. But if you acknowledge that we don't know the future of this film, whether it will be completed, who will appear on screen, how it will be received, what the plot will be, and that we're dependent on the equivalent of promotional press releases for information on what this film "might be," then you'll have to see how speculative a wikipedia article must be... that is, it must be speculative, or mostly devoid of content. I don't see why we should let Wikipedia become the home of highly speculative articles, even if it has sources for its speculation. Besides, how notable was Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, really? And what reason do we have to think that Ocean's Thirteen should be any more notable? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">Zadignose</a> (<a href="../../../z/a/d/User_talk%7EZadignose_aee7.html" title="User talk:Zadignose">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zadignose_1274.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zadignose">contribs</a>) 19:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>It is ABSOLUTELY a good faith nomination, I do believe this film is unsuitable for a Wikipedia article, I made my reasons clear, and your assumption is inappropriate. This is a vital issue to be discussed, and I find the reaction of the community rather surprising. I thoroughly read about several instances where people had nominated large groups of articles for deletion simultaneously, for identical reasons, which does not always go well. One of the suggestions repeated in various places was to propose one title first which is representative of the group, and based upon the precedent set, decide how to proceed. I deliberately selected a case which is representative, and which I strongly believe should be deleted. You apparently disagree, but this does not make this a "bad faith" nomination. In any case, I have now learned how remarkably low the standards of notablity are, and how naive the general public is with regards to currently hyped entertainment product, almost all of which it seems is deemed notable in advance of its production. Fair guess that the U.S. alone will produce at least 300-400 films this year that meet the notability standards of Wikipedia, and 80-100 of which will be regarded notable without haven even been seen.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 00:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not in advance of its production, though. It has been produced, and it has grandfathered notability from the previous movies in the series. It's not like it's in pre-production, or is rumored, it's practically done. I don't feel it's representative. I bet other prerelease movie articles could be found that better showcase the hype and rumors you are referring to, but I also think they should be dealt with on a case by case basis. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 00:14, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's announced and in the production system; with major stars and a big budget, it's pretty well confirmable. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Speedy Keep</i> A cannot believe this was actually nominated. The conclusion of a very sucessful trilogy, coming out in meer monthes, advertised in theatres everywhere. It's an upcoming movie. There's absolutly no reason to nominate this. I'm still in shock. <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 22:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> on the grounds that this is not crystalballery. The movie has a scheduled release date and is otherwise verifiable, what's the problem? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i>, it is a sequel to two big movies and will be released early June of this year; trailers also have been released, so it is set to go. --<a href="../../../w/t/r/User%7EWTRiker_18b7.html" title="User:WTRiker">WTRiker</a> 01:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Completion or not it has obvious notibility and is well known. Also don't fail <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Also it is rather standard that famous sequals to almost any series get accepted because they are inheretly notable (look at Harry Potter books and movies for example, sometimes started years before release).--155.144.251.120 02:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
