<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't accept deleting an article based on a claim of "<i>excessive detail</i>". Who is to say what is excessive and what is not? The material was spun out from the main article, and while I'm not opposed to merging it back, I see no point in reducing our coverage of this event. Furthermore, what kind of argument is it to say that there are better sources available elsewhere? In that case, why should we bother working on articles in the first place since there are great pages, fan sites, official sites etc. for just about everything. Or to put it another way, maybe we should devise a template that blanks pages and provides a link to the better sources available on the internet. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:19, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see nothing at all wrong with that argument. If it has been done better elsewhere, where is the crime in redirecting people to another site. There is no reason information must be physically stored in one bank of servers. The only reason I can think of for wanting to keep information on Wikipedia's servers is because of the dreaded 404 Not Found error when an external link goes down. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 02:47, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just about everything has been done better and in greater detail elsewhere. For example, witness <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegreville%2C_Alberta_56cc.html" title="Vegreville, Alberta">Vegreville, Alberta</a> a little town of no consequence that no one has ever heard of. Our article is six lines, some statistics and a bad photo of an easter egg. What is the point of having editors try to maintain that inconsequential bit of villagecruft when the good folks at <a href="http://www.vegreville.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.vegreville.com/" rel="nofollow">www.vegreville.com</a> already provide such incredible detail and a halfway decent picture of the same egg? Why not just link directly to that site, since god knows we will never do it better than the people condemned to worship that egg 365 days a year? Of course, I'll fight for the right of the editors who think they can outdo vegreville right here at wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wiki is not paper, but it should still summarize history rather than describe it in excruciating detail.

<li><b>Delete</b> The detail is excessive because this amount of detail is available in the tropical cyclone reports of every Atlantic hurricane. Do we need a detailed storm history article of every Atlantic hurricane? No, because it does not meet notability criteria. If anything, the TCRs should be added to wikisource. This is text I cut out of the Katrina article because it became too long, and the article itself has thus become a rather poor copy of the TCR (which is very interesting reading, by the way). — <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">jdorje</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJdorje_1d2e.html" title="User talk:Jdorje">talk</a>)</small> 02:03, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm sorry, but I have to take exception to this: <i>Do we need a detailed storm history article of every Atlantic hurricane?</i> No we don't. Was Katrina just another Atlantic hurricane? No, it wasn't. Which is perhaps why we have 107 articles in our <a href="../../../h/u/r/Category%7EHurricane_Katrina_9b67.html" title="Category:Hurricane Katrina">Category:Hurricane Katrina</a>. The community seems to have decided that <i>detail</i> is required for this storm. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:18, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with that is that having such a large amount of information for one storm makes it extremely difficult to manage and improve the article. As Jdorje said, this information is already available somewhere else in Wikipedia, and to have detail to the amount you're indicating, it should be added to Wikisource instead of here. Katrina may be a remarkable storm due to its impact, but the majority of the editors who actually <i>maintain</i> this article want it gone, as it is completely redundant. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 04:36, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no problem managing or improving the material since it was spun out from the main article. Deleting will certainly not help editors to improve it. Also, <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">jdorje</a> has not said that the material is available elsewhere in wikipedia. A simple comparison of this with <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> shows that the material is not covered there to this extent. Finally, please do not speak for the "majority" of editors here. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:34, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
