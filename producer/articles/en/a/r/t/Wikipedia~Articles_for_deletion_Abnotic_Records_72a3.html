<p>Apparently the record label exists. But only 2,330 Google hits makes me wonder whether it's encyclopedic. Also, note the vanity-like writing ("<b>Abnotic</b> was founded in 2004 by <b>Hassan Ansari</b>, a proven teen prodigy." <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 05:34, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Getting over 10,000 hits a day just for its instrumentals page makes the label quite worthy of an article. Plus the website counter shows well over 25,000 hits, while the website is still fairly new. www.soundclick.com/freebeatsbyabnotic is operated by Abnotic's producers on Soundclick.com. Soundclick has the world-leading internet charts with millions of songs on its servers, yet Abnotic still managed to stay number one on the charts for years. If you check the Soundclick.com front page, FREE BEATS by Abnotic is the second-best overall artist (charts are updated everyday). <small>unsigned comment by 68.9.59.75 05:52, 11 September 2005 EDT</small></p>

<li><b>strong delete</b> clear vanity. No albums have even been released yet! â€”&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FED7A0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> <font size="-2">(<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 14:36, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Albums have been released by the artists, but not yet under the record label. The vanity was there, but is now removed. A $50,000 project is in process right now for the album "The Dawning". The artists from the record label, including the founder, have been featured on MTV and VH1. The Hulk DVD features menu tracks produced by Hassan. The label is fairly new, recently launched in 2004. However, the artists under it have years of experience. Unreleased songs by its artists are in rotation on many radio stations around the nation. The label recently raised $18,000 for the victims of Katrina with a concert in Hartford, CT. If any vanity still exists, please feel free to reword it. And again, albums have been released by the artists and the first official album under the record label is due in a few months. Peter Gunz, Mr.Lucci and Lord Tariq are some known names supporting the label. <small>unsigned comment by 172.163.18.11 20:52, 11 September 2005</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> promotional article. Wikipedia is not an appropriate venue to promote your record label. The <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=abnoticrecords.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=abnoticrecords.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa rankings</a> show that <a href="http://www.abnoticrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.abnoticrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">abnoticrecords.com</a> is not in the top 100,000 web sites. What makes a record label notable? Web site traffic? Famous artists? I think that what a record label is about is producing records, and your label has not yet released one. You write that "Abnotic still managed to stay number one on the [Soundclick] charts for years" and that "The label is fairly new, recently launched in 2004." Apparently it has been on the charts longer than it has been in existence, which would be pretty impressive if it were not a load of bull. Here's a crazy idea: become famous for making records <i>first</i>, then get in the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 06:36, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
The article is in no way promotional. It does not tell people to buy music from the label, or even mention a URL. There are basic facts about the label in the article. Famous artists....well, there are many "famous" artists that neither I nor you have heard of. A record label is about talent and the quality of the music. However, the article, again, does not state anything about the record label being the best at making music! It states facts...not opinions. I am sure you have never heard many names working with our label, such as Talib Kweli...does that make them not "famous" or untalented? NO! In fact, Talib is a genius, and he is one of the many people supporting our upcoming release, "The Dawning". As mentioned before, the label's artists have released albums while signed under various other labels and have been making music for years. The name Abnotic was a name of a group containing about 14 artists and producers who decided to make it a label. Abnotic has been on top of the charts FOR YEARS and STILL IS ON TOP OF THE CHARTS, except now with the word "Records" after it. The label is new, however, the name and the people working under it have been making music for over 12 years! In fact, Mos Def and Talib are both on Wikipedia! Other names supporting our label include XI, an artist/producer who recently went on tour with the Ying Yang Twins (major), Wyshmaster, who produced for EA Sports NBA Ballers video game and Peter Gunz, who has worked with Nore, a major artist in the music industry. We also have produced for HUNDREDS of labels around the world! Calling our team unfamous bullshiters is a pretty deep statement, especially when you don't personally know the people who make up the label. And the whole point of the article is so people can get to know the subject...same as the point of every other article in Wikipedia. You can blame almost ANYTHING listed in Wikipedia as a form of promotion, but WE ARE NOT TRYING TO PROMOTE. THE GOAL IS TO LET THE WORLD KNOW THAT THERE IS SUCH A LABEL AND IT HAS SOME AMAZING PEOPLE WORKING BEHIND IT AND IT HAS HUGE GOALS WHICH IT MAY SOMEDAY REACH! With over a million fans worldwide, I think the label deserves a spot on Wikipedia. It seems as if the matter is related more towards racism or descrimination against the type of music the label than your concerns of it not being good enough.</p>
<p>It has known people working for it who have been working on and off in the major industry for years. It has been on top of the most respected internet charts and still is! It has music in rotation on over 150 broadcast radio stations world wide. It has produced for hundreds of other labels around the world. It has had music featured on MTV and VH1. MTV Cribs and Pimp My Ride should be some recognizable names. It has over a million fans who have purchased CDs from its artists. However, the albums were not released under Abnotic Records. The team is made up of award winning artists and producers. The label is without a doubt legit. It has already put on 2 concerts in Connecticut. I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND EMAIL ADDRESSES OF FANS OF THE LABEL! Now these are only the ones who signed up for our mailing list online. AND YOU CAN CONTACT support@soundclick.com and ask them about the history of the two accounts associated with Abnotic: Abnotic Records and Free Beats by Abnotic. Finally, have a listen for yourself and judge if the quality of the music is as good, if not better than many major, or as you call them, famous, artists.</p>

<p>THEN TAKE SOME TIME TO REVIEW THE MESSAGE BOARDS ON:</p>
<p>www.soundclick.com/freebeatsbyabnotic</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>www.soundclick.com/abnoticrecords</p>
<p><br />
YOU WILL SEE WHAT WE MEAN. OH YES, YOU CAN ALSO CHECK THE NUMBER OF INTERNET RADIO STATIONS PLAYING OUR MUSIC! SHOULD BE WELL OVER 100!</p>
<p>And if you still feel Abnotic Records is not worthy of an article, feel free to remove it. I'm done wasting my time trying to explain why we deserve a spot on Wikipedia and reading false accusations. If you read right, I mentioned that the people in the label have been making music for years. Abnotic Records was just launched in 2004, but the people running the show have been earning awards and been on top of the charts for over a decade! mp3.com, soundclick.com, best new talent, ears showcase, you name it, we've done it. We are members of The Orchard distribution company...AND....</p>
<p>ONE LAST THING....</p>
<p>Our website is only a few months old! PLUS THE ARTICLE IS NOT ON OUR WEBSITE, IT'S ON THE LABEL! AND ALL OF OUR TRAFFIC IS BASED ON www.soundclick.com/freebeatsbyabnotic</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg</a></p>
<p>ABOVE ARE THE TRAFFIC REPORTS FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. AND THESE ARE ONLY FOR OUR BEATS PAGE. WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MUSIC PAGE ON SOUNDCLICK RECEIVING ABOUT THE SAME TRAFFIC AS THE BEATS AND OF COURSE, OUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME ABNOTIC DOES NOT HAVE ANY TRAFFIC!?</p>
