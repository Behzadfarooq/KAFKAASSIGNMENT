<dd><b>Comment</b> Looks like if I had done a quick google search, I would have found that it was a copyvio as well, copied from one of those sources! However, it does appear that the article can stay...I am concerned about the notability, as keeping this might make us keep a bunch of bios whos only source of notability is being a rich broadcast meteorologist who has a lot of websites written about him. -<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunningonbrains_2b29.html" title="User:Runningonbrains">Runningonbrains</a> 00:05, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Yet another comment</b> It appears more obscure bios are floating around Wikipedia. I change my vote to <b>keep</b>, I'm pretty sure theres no way to withdraw a nomination, but I'd just like to say the improvements made have been more than satisfactory. -<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunningonbrains_2b29.html" title="User:Runningonbrains">Runningonbrains</a> 16:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It has plenty of references, which should be enough to glean information from and form a good article. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliasAlucard_fc0e.html" title="User:EliasAlucard">EliasAlucard</a>|<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliasAlucard_c666.html" title="User talk:EliasAlucard">Talk</a> 23:47, 24 Oct, 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He's a fairly well known local television celebrity in NE England.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While usually I consider notability a criterion for deletion, the amount of referencing makes me pause.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm sure he's a nice person, but the references in this article are not sufficient for me, as I saw no indication of his being notable outside of his immediate local area, and most of the references looked like corporate press releases instead of legitimate press. A Google search seems to be fairly weak as well, with fewer than 1000 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=puV&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22bob+johnson%22+weather+tyne&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=puV&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22bob+johnson%22+weather+tyne&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<ul>
<li>Elonka, I take - maybe not offence - but certainly disapproval of your reference to "immediate local area" - you might come from a fanatastic large country and think that a British region of some "few" millions of people is only an "immediate local area", but in the real world, i.e. the non-American corporate media bubble, the North East of England is a fairly significant area with proud history and people, and Bob Johnson is one of its most respected broadcasters and a household name to millions. And I say all this as a non-native resident of the region. At the end of the day, I certainly think Johnson qualifies under the "cult" status of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> rules, and furthermore, people who are famous enough to meet the criteria, are probably too notable to be truly worthy of a WP entry anyway, as most people who want to know anything about, say, Madonna, probably would refer to other sources. Wikipedia is a great tool for finding out more esoteric than ubiquitous information - that is my attraction to the whole project - so to delete articles like this would be a real travesty. It is local colour and characters which make the world a great place, and to corporately wipe these people from Wikipedia would be a travesty. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperbfc_cd97.html" title="User:Superbfc">Superbfc</a> 18:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I mean no disrespect to Mr. Johnson, nor to England (where I myself lived for three years, and enjoyed it very much). However, in order to prove a subject's notability, we need more than statements such as "household name". On Wikipedia, a verbal vouching is not sufficient to prove notability -- it is necessary to provide verifiable external references, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. To my knowledge, no such references have been provided, to prove that Mr. Johnson is "famous", or that he has a large enough of a fanbase to qualify for notability. I've looking through news sites, I've Googled, I've been doing my own research, and I just haven't found anything. If you <i>can</i> provide verifiable references which prove his fame, I am open to reviewing them, but until then, my opinion stands. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We don't tend to include forums as ELs, but <a href="http://www.tvforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=135240" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tvforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=135240" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is at least one where he is asmiringly discussed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 20:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And a half a dozen messages on a forum from three years ago, are not convincing. Show me multiple fansites, with thousands of fans discussing him on a daily basis, and I'll change my mind. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>lol. How did I know you were going to respond like that&#160;;) Someone doesn't need multiple fansites to be notable; the existence of some geocities or myspace page is a poor second to the reliable sources cited. That link to the forum is sufficient for proving that he's notable enough to be discussed. Check out <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_meteorologists_96e9.html" title="Category:Television meteorologists">Category:Television meteorologists</a> and look at all those articles, such as Storm Field, for instance. Most have no references, or even links, at all. Wikipedia is not paper. There are sufficient references in the article to verify Johnson's existence and that he's been covered by independent sources. He's broadcast regularly to around 2 million viewers for over 15 years. That is notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 21:05, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right, the Storm Field article is inappropriate, and I have proposed its deletion. If you see other articles that lack references, please add the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnref_47af.html" title="Template:Unref">unref</a>}} tag to them, and if you think they should be deleted, tag them with {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} (proposed deletion), or mention something on their talk page. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
