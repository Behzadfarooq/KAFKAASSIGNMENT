<p>According to the talk page, the author created this page because he is hoping to prompt someone to write about this, as he needs to learn about it, he says. No evidence that this is a notable or distinct planning technique.

<li>I have expanded the article slightly and corrected the link. The reason I did not put up a request for the article was that felt that I knew enough about it to start the article. I intend to expand the article further within the next 24 hours. Anders 12:05, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — It looks like there is now enough information to justify its existence, and there's plenty of material on the topic available from the internet. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 17:34, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>My understanding is that deleting prior to a redirect being created is desirable when the information is not necesarry, in order to simplify both authorship lineage and technical resources associated with the copyright of the work. Merge/keep, if I'm not mistaken, would require seperate maintenance of both pieces of authorship information. All of the relevant information is already presented in <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonkette.html" title="Wonkette">wonkette</a> <a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEggplantWizard_fc4d.html" title="User:EggplantWizard">Eggplant Wizard</a><sup><a href="../../../e/g/g/User_talk%7EEggplantWizard_74c0.html" title="User talk:EggplantWizard">Talk</a></sup> 06:16, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, maybe they should change the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion Policy</a> about "Article duplicates information in some other article". <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a></li>
<li>Comment: Since attribution is automatically recorded by the respective page histories, there is essentially no maintenance necessary. Deletion is generally reserved for situations when it is important to remove the content from history altogether. For example, when it is libelous, a copyvio or just inappropriate. None of that seems to apply here. For the record, I think you could have <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">been bold</a> and redirected. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, don't redirect. Wonkette is the name of a blog and the name of a persona; she herself is a distinct person from the "Wonkette" project/persona.

<p>This "128.59.156.197" again. Please substantiate your claims. What in the Holocaust Denial article is covered in the Holocaust Controversy article? What between the two articles is the same in terms of intention? I also see no responses in the talk page of the Holocaust Controversy article. I strongly see controversies that do not have to do with Holocaust Denial, meaning not having to do with whether the Holocaust really occurred, whether there is some kind of Jewish conspiracy, or in numbers of Jews that died. There is healthy debate in academia regarding the politicization (and commercialism) of the memory and history of the Holocaust, its uniqueness, and its moral implications. Ariel Sharon, for example, recently justified Israeli foreign policy on the basis of the Holocaust. I'm not saying he's wrong, but that's quite a statement. I would hope Wikipedia could reflect the debate within academia.</p>
<p>This "128.59.156.197" again again. Take a look at the talk page for Holocaust Denial. You will Jayjg completely denies any possibility for legitimate revisionism when it comes to Holocaust histories when for academics, nothing is beyond revision. He seems to be either using multiple identities or working in conjunction with a group to shout down anyone that tries to differentiate between deniers and serious academic revisionists. I think it's gross that people would deny the actual occurence of the Holocaust. But do you think the strong feelings of nationalism during the time of state-formation of Israel would influence their view of the history of the Holocaust? This is a well-known phenomenon that is illustrated here: The Future of the Past: Historiographical Disputes and Competing Memories in Germany and Israel. Daniel Levy. History and Theory, Vol. 38, No. 1. (Feb., 1999), pp. 51-66. He talks about nationalism influence German and Israeli views. That's why I think Sharon's statement is important. He's not necessarily wrong but he has a lot more incentive to take one perspective over another in order to justify current Israeli foreign policy. I apologize for listing here, but no one is going to the talk page of the article to discuss there so I felt this was the best way to encourage substantial debate.</p>

<dd>Or even the same university. Both 128.59.156.197 and 160.39.194.93 are registered to Columbia University in New York. Also, 128 complains that no one's going to the talk page, but hasn't done so himself/herself; but 160 has, so I think even 128's getting confused about which IP address s/he's used to post where.

Okay great, now see, I'm the one that brought up the university connection and I guess I should've done a reverse lookup, but doesn't that make even more sense that two university students, now I suspect having taken/taking probably the same class even, would be the only one posting serious papers?

<p>It seems like a good idea at first glance, however this is basically already covered in another broader timeline. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 04:23, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with most of the wikipedia timelines is that they are too specific. There has to be some kind of generic line where all can intersect. Civil rights issues, Gay rights issues, women's rights issues, event simple things like attitude changes are social not cultural ones. For example: In 1936, King Edward was forced to abdicate precisely because he was marrying a commoner and a divorcee. Charles the present Prince of Wales, a divorcd, is about to marry a divorcee and the issues that forced one king only 60 or 70 years ago to abdicate no longer seem to apply, since it is very likely that Charles will inherit the throne without much opposition based on this issue alone. That is a significant social development. the kind that this page could track. There are others whether one looks at censor ship policy or civil rights issues they all pertain to siginificant social change one this page can track. AT present I am not aware of a broader timeline where all these issues connect and I have the List of themed timelines on my favourites -- at least not one that covers all these specific issues. -- [User: Kskooper 10:48 pm Feb 19,2005 (UTC0]

<li>All this debate over ad vs encyclopedia format, why don't the gatekeepers come up with a standardized and objective format? I've looked at a number of examples, such as Wil Wheaton (who I loved in STNG), Wonkette, Instapudit, Powerline, Atrios and DailyKos (come on, 3 or 4 pages of a marketing brochure for what is supposed to be an encyclopedia? Even my Worldbook don't give that much space to individuals. So far, this is looking more like a venue for ego trips to up or down others. Again, if Wiki is going to be serious, then create an approved format template for each category. If you can't do it, there will be another free encyclopedia to eat Wiki for breakfast, a la Alta Vista. Andy --67.153.224.90 17:13, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Not notable. "La Shawn Barber" gets only 30 hits in Google Groups, "lashawnbarber.com" only 7. Compare 1,140 hits for andrewsullivan.com. Typically a Google Groups search will yield about 1/4 to 1/10 the number of hits as on Google Web. In cases like this I believe a Groups search is much more reliable because Web searches are often distorted by gaming and "search engine optimization." It is very hard to believe that a truly notable political blogger wouldn't receive more than 30 mentions on USENET. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:55, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Only 30 hits? Ah yes, defining down. Google Groups returns 49 hits on first page, and page 2 drops to only 18 hits. Methinks something is wrong with the Groups engine. Is it relevant that a relative newcomer (1.5 years) doesn't use usenet? Compare 184,000 hits for "Dan Smith" on Google Web, and 25,800 in Groups, yet those hits aren't all for the same person. Not notable, since we can't determine which is the real Dan Smith in question. What are the odds that there are more than 2 or 3 La Shawn Barbers (250K Web hits) making a web prescence?

<li><b>Keep</b> - Original charge by the less than straightforward Rickk was "Non-notable blogger with a lot of puffery." Author of several serious books by reputable publishers is not, by definition, a person without note, articles in numerous hard-copy and online publications adds to notability, "blogger" is a null pointer as far as notability here is concerned since notability is established beyond blogging, "puffery" is a pure high point of view value judgment from the Wiki-ite who moved for deletion. The claim by same that he didn't know Barber was black and female is dubious from the photo posted on Barber's site. Finally, an author, writer, speaker, and blogger whose is black, female, and conservative has obvious value in the market place of ideas by being both rare and representative of an emerging trend. <i>unsigned comment by user:Vanderleun</i>

<li>User's Nth edit. I'd suggest changing socks, but that's optional. The problem with having "lots and lots of wikiedits" and not being shy about preening is that they tend to reveal more than you intend. The pattern of interjection into the process here, which is evident in the thread above, does not lead me to believe you are as confident of your postion as you proclaim. As to the question of "personal attack," I suggest you read your opening call for deletion with an clear mind. "Non-notable" and "puffery" pretty much set the tone, as did the subsequent claim of "Oh, I didn't notice her race and gender." Several others have noted this and have either had comments deleted or you have chosen not to address it. Seems to me you can't have a full and frank discussion when you've got a hidden agenda. As to my "first edit" -- well, let's look at the substance of the objection to your personal pogrom and not just count coup. <i>unsigned comment by user:Vanderleun</i>

<li>Please share with us how you acquired knowledge of RickK's "hidden agenda". Another new user with a telepathy machine? <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 00:28, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Telepathy doesn't enter into it. Most sensible people know it is not usually able to operate in a distributed system. You should seriously rethink you own belief in it and not look to it as an explantion for the obvious. One can, as many realize, discern what a user is hiding by what he says and responds to along with what he does not say or respond to. That's usually impossible in a short one-response thread but Rikk helped everyone out with non-notable and puffery. After a thread reaches critical mass, which this one did about 5 or 8 responses in (Hard to tell since there were some deletions early on before they were called), the pattern of respones begins to reveal the inner workings and motivations of the user who continually engages only to disparage or degrade. That would include, among other things, the continual "ranking" of users opinions in order to disparage them. This is a technique that seems to be heavily in use here. Indeed, the tag team for this, if you examine the thread above, would be none other than Rikk and your good self. Seems to me that a thread that is a call for deletion should be one in which we see Wiki Vets such as yourself display the NOPV ethic as an example, not a series of small lessons in how to game the system and drive out new users. <i>unsigned comment by user:Vanderleun</i>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let's go around the question of telepathy and inference to a direct question. Rikk, as the topic starter, you claim "I had no idea she was either black or a woman..." Are you saying that you called for deletion without once visiting her blog which has a photograph at top left that confirms these qualities? That would be the only way I can see that you "had no idea." If that is the case, how would you even begin to be able to judge that she was a "non-notable" with "puffery"? Are you in the habit of calling for the deletion of things you don't know about or investigate?

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't know if RickK had a hidden agenda or not, but I definitely would have VFD'd this myself after reading the pre-vfd revision of this article. The article is suppose to establish it's nobility or else it will deleted. I certainly wasn't convinced at all this person was notable from the ad-like prose of putting together a bunch of quotes; it might as well had included a comment from Ebert and Roeper. All the information that is suppose to make the subject notable should be included in the article. Otherwise, the writer risks giving readers the message that the topic is too obscure to have anything of substance to even write about in the article. It certainly isn't helpful to Wikipedia to force the users to click on an external link to find out more about the subject, it makes it look like the writer's sole intention was to have readers go to the link to find out why this person is notable rather than having it fleshed out in the encyclopedia entry.

When this occurs, the result is huge VfD battles which are of interest only within Wikipedia and do not in themselves bear on the notability of the topic.

<li>My vote is a big-ass <b>KEEP</b>. Oh, give me a break. Do you think you can just simplify the injustice by glibly comparing your own self to the great La Shawn Barber. If you are, then you definitely need to look in the mirror and realize that your self image is much more grand that what it actually is. La Shawn Barber is MUCH MORE notable than you will ever be. Have you ever been published online? I bet you haven't by seeing how emotional you get when someone compared La Shawn Barber to a martyr. There is one GOOD reason why this entry should be kept - La Shawn Barber is a conservative, black woman. She has been the very FIRST black woman to be a conservative. Have you ever been recognized in the record books as being a pioneer in politics? <b>To everyone voting delete</b>, you're all being brainwashed why the liberal menace.

<blockquote>
<center><b>Why you should change your vote</b></center>
<p><i>First and foremost, I'm a believer in and follower of Jesus Christ. I am also a former liberal and current renegade supporter of conservative ideals.</i></p>
<p>The very notion of a black woman supporting conservative ideals has made La Shawn Barber a noted individual in various printed records. This includes the title of the FIRST black woman venturing out into unknown territory. There has been no other black woman conservative before her. This definitely shows that she is a PIONEER in the political realm and deserves a mention in an encyclopedia, even in a poor-quality encyclopedia such as Wikipedia. Anyone who would refute this is either out of their minds or politically motivated to prevent La Shawn Barber's legacy from spreading - ignorance or malice but not both.</p>
<p><i>For most of my life I've wanted to be a writer. I often talked about writing for publication, but keeping a personal journal for over 20 years was the only disciplined writing I'd ever done. I graduated from South Carolina State University and Temple University School of Law, where I wrote a weekly "humor" column for the law school newsletter (which I wouldn't call disciplined for some reason).</i></p>
<p>Even early on in her life, La Shawn Barber was already being noticed for her writing skills. I doubt anyone here voting delete has the mental capacity to write a weekly "humor" column for a law school newsletter - or even anything humorous to begin with. La Shawn Barber is one of the world's greatest writers based on this and she deserves to be included. I doubt anyone would vote delete the article on Einstein's article despite the fact that he should a great talent for physics at an early age. Anyone who brushes off Barber's great writing accomplishments as puffery is definitely acting out of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malice.html" title="Malice">malice</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatred.html" title="Hatred">hatred</a>.</p>
<p><i>I've held a variety of interesting jobs. I was a flight attendant, which was very interesting but not nearly as entertaining as working for a Democrat on Capitol Hill during the Impeachment trial.</i></p>
<p>Wow, the last sentence says a lot about how great La Shawn Barber really is. How many people here worked on Capitol Hill during the Impeachment trial? Nobody, I bet. How many people here even know someone who worked on Capitol Hill during the Impeachment trial? No one. Not only was La Shaw Barber one of the lucky few who earned the grand honor to work on Capitol Hill during the Impeachment trial, she has also been a versatile member of society. Her talents have graced various industries including the luxurious airline industry.</p>
<p><i>One day I realized I was almost 30 years old (!) and still trying to figure out what I wanted to be if and when I grew up. But I had a few things to deal with first (Read "A Sobering Truth").</i></p>
<p>Another great accomplishment being buried by the liberal cabal. Not only has La Shawn Barber dealt with arduous trials, but she has also managed to finish reading an epic literary masterpiece. This demonstrates that she has the ability to comprehend esoteric writings, but can multitask in between the great burdens she was faced with. This doesn't sound like a "non-notable" at all.</p>
<p><i>After I became sober and gave my life to Christ, I knew it was time to write. A few months after my 35th birthday, I penned my first opinion piece, which was published in the Philadelphia Inquirer the week after I sent it in. I was encouraged, to say the least.</i></p>
<p>Another great feat. Has anyone here been published in an Inquirer periodical? Nobody. She definitely has a great knack for writing and now professional publications are vying for her masterpieces. In fact, her writing is much better any article that can be found in Wikipedia.</p>
<p><i>Two years later, I'm still at it. In my spare time, I'm a freelance writer (and blogger) with articles, book reviews, columns and essays published in print: Washington Times, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a>, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Denver Post, Baltimore Times, Today's Christian Woman and other publications. My work also appears online in Jewish World Review, Townhall.com and other sites.</i></p>
<p>The plethora of professional publications paying millions of dollars for her articles is a sure sign that she is notable. Who here has even had one written piece published in any of the aforementioned publications? No one. To classify the millions of companies publishing her work as "non-notable" is tantamount to boiling a male's genitals and calling it a recipe for making cream of mushroom soup. It's just plain illogical. It's notable that companies are paying her millions for her writings.</p>
<p><i>My bi-weekly political column is published on GOPUSA, MichNews.com, Grace-Centered Magazine, TheRightReport.com, American Daily and other sites. See "My Writing" for samples.</i></p>
<p>Seems pretty notable. Now, online sites and magazines have been added to her list of publishers. To just ignore this, is to go along with the liberal conspiracy and deny La Shawn Barber any acknowledgment of accomplishment. A reasonable person would really have to question the ulterior motives of the deletionists and their claims of non-notability.</p>
<p><i>Writing has opened up new opportunities and adventures, including public speaking. I had the pleasure of speaking at a conference in July, Conservative University 2004, sponsored by Accuracy In Academia. I was on a discussion panel with Star Parker (on the right). I wrote about the event (and having lunch with Star) on my weblog.</i></p>
<p>She is also a noted public speaker, who was invited and paid millions to speak at a famous university. She is also an ally to powerful and influential people in power such as Star Parker. Definitely, not a non-notable.</p>
<p><i>I also spoke at a women's retreat. The president of the church group invited me to be the opening night speaker after reading an article about my spiritual journey in Today's Christian Woman.</i></p>
<p>She is also a very spiritual person. This is of definite notability. None of the sorry deletionists here care that the illustrious Today's Christian Woman featured her in their retreats.</p>
<p><i>I've been a guest on a few radio shows, including "The Savage Nation" with Michael Savage, and "The Jesse Lee Peterson Show" with Reverend Jesse Peterson of BOND.</i></p>
<p>Now, she is emerging in field of radio. Not even the news of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>'s lip synching spread faster on the radio airwaves than La Shawn Barber's appearance of these radio shows.</p>
<p><i>I've been interviewed in print: "Blogging Brothers (and Sisters)" in National Review Online (8/12/04), "The Proper Biblical View Is Accountability" in The Daily Dispatch (7/9/04) and a few others.</i></p>
The interviews don't seem to stop. La Shawn Barber has changed the world and will continue to mold it for a brighter future. Now, I hope some of the delete votes change to keep. Fight the Liberal conspiracy and vote against injustice. Help keep this article on Wikipedia. Miranda V 08:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Westlake's second edit, coming on his first day editing Wikipedia. What exactly does it mean that one's "work has been published (in a place) of questionable notability"? Is it the person or the publication that makes one notable? As for his description of her character, we should note that <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemingway.html" title="Hemingway">Hemingway</a> was an alcoholic writer who pretended to be a conservative, and I'm fairly certain he eventually amounted to something, even though he was just another white male with a huge ego.

<li><b>Delete</b>. She's pretty insignificant. Also, I think it's sick, depraved and disgusting IF she changed her name to be more like the famous shooting victim. That's like all those people trying to sell pieces of the World Trade center on eBay after the terrorist attacks.

Conceptually, even a stub on this subject would seem more acceptable to me than an individual article on Creambo. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 04:45, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Citizens of some other states seem to sound the same to me. There's no such thing as an accent within the borders of California.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This is not a re-creation of deleted content. The previously deleted article was about a man, this article is about a woman. I agree that it will probably be deleted, but I think that current Wikipedia policy grants it a week on VfD first. The first paragraph of the previously deleted article was: <i>Ashley Edward Bloom (born December 13, 1988) is a young man living a middle class life. He is considered to be a polite and handsome young man, blessed with great perception, wisdom and intelligence beyond his years.</i> -- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 22:14, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>No offence, but there are literally thousands of theatre companies appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe each year, and in my opinion, to warrant an inclusion on Wikipedia, a company would need to be more notable than having received a 3-star <i>Scotsman</i> review and being "among the youngest" companies.</p>
<p>I frankly can't see why anyone unconnected to the group concerned would be interested. Sorry... Don't mean to be insulting, but I don't think it's appropriate for Wikipedia.</p>

<li>Delete - Check the history of the page to see the major vanity revisions I took out. I contest recieving 3 stars in the Scotsman is "notable" (with all reviews being out of 5), and I've seen younger participants at the Fringe. The only way I can see this article working is as a stub, since there's nothing that notable that I can see about the company. There must be at least two dozen or more youth groups of that age or lower at the Fringe, and I've heard nothing of their work whilst working at the Fringe (2003 - 2004). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 22:04, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do not delete. Firstly, declaration of interest: I made, and did almost all the updating of, this page. I am obviously biased; I do not claim not to be. However, do I think it should be deleted? No. Why? 1. There is nothing factually incorrect about the page. I am in the company, and I can tell you that the details on the page are correct. 2. Just because you have never seen us at the Fringe does not mean we have not been there; and in fact we HAVE been there, 5 times as I have said. In total, well over a thousand people have paid to come and see us, and many more have seen us singing in the streets to promote the show. 3. I accept that putting a link to this page onto the fringe page was shameless self-publication, and I apologise for that. However, with the potential for updates (which I will gladly do; indeed our next show, the blurb on the page of which has been editted out, is performing its world premiere in two months' time) I do not see the harm in letting this page be. Furthermore, the qualification for "famous" is very difficult. Are we famous? Probably, but not definitlely, not. I have been approached in the street in Edinburgh with people recognsing me. Am I a celebrity? No. Are the company worth adding to the sum of human knowledge? I do not see why not. Obviously if you all disagree go ahead and delete - wikipedia has to be a democracy. But I thought an opposing view had to be heard before the guillotine is brought out. - Batmanand</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is not the sum of <i>all</i> human knowledge, or of all verifiable fact, merely of the notable parts. For instance, the name of my neighbor's cat, while knowable and verifiable, is not very interesting to the rest of the world. What exactly qualifies as notable is up to (heavy) debate, but we have a number of consensual guidelines. And I'm afraid you fall below them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:23, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Substub which is unlikely to be expanded on the now-defunct <i>internet</i> radio station.

<p>This article is an essay that is trying to argue a particular POV. The title itself clearly shows this: it assumes that the three things are linked, though this could be disputed. The article itself is full of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> and unsourced opinions and facts.

<li><b>Merge</b> including <b>cleanup</b> to a section within <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a>, for reasons mentioned by BM and HyperZonk. Given the high age and low verifiability of the sources, and the recurring purging of competing POV-supporting sources over the millenia by church hierarchy or kings or fanatics or armies, virtually all serious discussion on this topic is (arguably) iredeemably POV. Other topics, particularly some religious ones, have shown that POV breakouts lead far more to edit wars than to compilation of verifiable knowledge about significantly influential events and movements. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:52, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> the salvageable, <b>delete</b> what can't and shouldn't be saved. This article is an essay. It draws its conclusion from the start - the subjects in the title are related. It doesn't review studies in the field, nor is it written from an expert's view. The article relies on 'some scholars', 'other scholars', and 'many secular scholars' to create the appearance of a solid factual basis. How many scholars are actually named inline? Two? And James Akin is cited as opposing the whole idea. The extensive list of sources is useless for verification, as it doesn't state where the claims originate, and its length makes it a hassle to find out. --<a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJill_St._Crux_f619.html" title="User:Jill St. Crux">Jill St. Crux</a> 10:46, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just how many articles specify <i>who</i> supports the text as written? It's unreasonable to only hold this expectation upon VFD articles. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 13:42, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Borderer, <i>all</i> articles should notes who supports the text as written. In the case of this article, even moreso as it's a minority view and highly controversial. Not only this, but it's in the form of an essay that argues a point (which is <i>not</i> encouraged around here - that's not what we are about. If you want that try <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuro5hin.html" title="Kuro5hin">Kuro5hin</a>) that is in much dispute. As for only holding this expectation on VfD articles: I don't see where Jill wrote that. I think it's fair to say that Jill, from talking to him around the place, expects it on all articles. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 22:13, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not many articles really say much of WHO supports them, BUT: This is a debate prone issue, it must hold to a higer standard. Thinking of standards; It's article name is unendycolpedic, it's far too 'fluffy' in it's language and readily takes advantage of inductive clauses (weasel words) and the sources list is it's own POV nightmare. <b>Delete</b> in accordance with policy or move out of the WP namespace untill it's fixed. -- <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbroadwell_691a.html" title="User:Dbroadwell">Dbroadwell</a> 15:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason I say this, is because the only time I witness a fuss over stating the scholars in the article is when it is on the VFD. I'm only saying it how I have always seen it by my own eyes, for ever otherwise there is no rabid disputation. Just because this is on VFD, does not me it <i>should</i> be deleted. In fact, you should have extended these discussions on the Talk Page much further. VFD votes can be a mob scene, unrighteously so. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 22:59, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assume you are responding to me and have changed the levels accordingly. Firstly, I have consistently always asked for sources for just about every article I've ever reviewed. All my articles have sources for their information, in a manner that allows for fact checking. So I don't think this happens only with VfD. You should check out <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">FAC</a> for other places where this happens. I realise that just because it's on VfD doesn't mean that this article should be deleted. I personally think it should be deleted (and merge that information which is mergable) because the article is an essay that argues for a point and is very poorly referenced (we had pointed this out to the original author many times, but they never fixed this issue). It's very title is POV, and so it is irreedeamble. There is good info in there, but this needs to be merged into another article - I don't dispute this. However, this POV piece should be merged and then deleted. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 23:36, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You should note that TBSDY is on a campaign to supress this article completely, having started by re-writing, and removing one of the most major of arguments in this academic debate (i.e. that which the article discusses) wholesale - the most frequently cited potential template - Horus.</dd>
<dd>This occured because TBSDY was unable to provide any academic counter argument - see its talk page, so rather than let it stand as blatent inarguable truth, TBSDY is on campaign to discredit it by associating it with bad scholars, and removing the strongest part of the case to make it look mergable (by leaving a somewhat stubby and messy survival).</dd>
<dd>This sort of campaign is typical by fundamentalists -
<ul>
<li>(0) try arguments from faith and when that fails</li>
<li>(1) spin - make it look like the argument of just one or two discredited writers</li>
<li>(2) ad hominem - imply that the argument is wrong because the author is discredited (even if they are only discredited for seperate reasons concerning other claims)</li>
<li>(3) focus on the weakest part of the argument and ignore (i.e. delete) the strongest</li>
<li>(4) try to destroy them by a vote rather than academic counterargument (n.b. votes cannot change the truth - e.g. a vote cannot make PI=3, even if the state of Texas declares it to be so (this happened)).</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Those reading the slanderous comments CheeseDreams has just made should be aware of a few things:
<ol>
<li>CheeseDreams is not posting from her account because she posted her password to <a href="../../../r/i/e/User%7ERienzo_2da0.html" title="User:Rienzo">User:Rienzo</a>'s account. It was determined by another admin that she used the same password for no less than 5 other sock-puppet accounts. All of these accounts have had the password reset.</li>
<li>CheeseDreams is currently in Arbitratrion over disruptive editing practices and POV pushing for bypassing her previous ArbCom rulings.</li>
<li>CheeseDreams was asked by me several times for sources (before these things happened), however she never provided them and never attempted to add them into the article. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistoricity_of_Jesus_Archive_4_5ef9.html#Disputed" title="Talk:Historicity of Jesus/Archive 4">Talk:Historicity_of_Jesus/Archive_4#Disputed</a>. Whenever I asked for sources, she merely (and absurdly) replied <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. To which I was forced to reply <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>! When I asked for where specific facts came from in her 44 books she has placed into references, she said that I should read them! In other words, she wasn't prepared to tell me where she got specific facts. This problem went on for quite a while, when she got blocked and banned from editing articles related to Christianity I gave up and started removing material that was unsourced. CheeseDreams had lots of opportunities to sort these issues out, however she decided not to.</li>
<li>CheeseDreams uses sources like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Babylons_cf23.html" title="The Two Babylons">The Two Babylons</a></i> as scholarly works. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistoricity_of_Jesus_faa3.html" title="Talk:Historicity of Jesus">Talk:Historicity of Jesus</a>, she mentions it in the archives. Jill (who speaks Hebrew natively) tells me that there are quite a few inaccuaries in Hislop's text. I have read half of Hislops tract. It's basically a polemic stating that the Roman Catholic church is the new Babylon of Revelation. I don't think so. It's full of absurd conclusions and tenuous links and chock full of inaccuracies. If it was submitted to peer review it would be slaughtered by academics jumping all over it because of its inaccuracies and sheer downright dodginess.</li>
<li>CheeseDreams has been deliberately disruptive when things don't go her way. She is about to be banned from submitting RFCs and RFArs because of her harassment of users. She has harassed me by implying that I am a sock puppet of Rienzo. She never has the guts to send me a message on my talk page when she disagrees about something I do, instead I find (usually by accident) that she is campaigning against me behind my back. I have always been upfront with her, she <i>cannot</i> show me the same courtesy.</li>
<li>CheeseDreams left <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> in a totally unusable state. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;oldid=7625434" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historicity_of_Jesus&amp;oldid=7625434" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Notice the following: just about all the carefully edited (for consensus) information was largely replaced by what CheeseDreams thought was important, there are no less than 4 tags on the article, there is no lead section, there are sections irrelevant to the article, there are <i>empty</i> sections, the entire article is POV as it comes from the POV that Jesus is the "new syncretism" (a minority viewpoint), the material is unsourced (though there is a huge list of materials in References that CD added, but I doubt most were used - for instance "Dial an Atheist: Greatest Hits from Ohio"? Yeah, right!). She expected us to not make any alterations on that article for an entire week.

</li>
<li>That's just a small amount of things CheeseDreams has done. So please, I hope that others will take this into account. I have been very open and tried not to disrupt editing. At one point, when I was very frustrated about the entire way things were going I bowed out of the articles so I <i>wouldn't</i> disrupt the article! Slrubenstein, Wesley and SamSpade have all been frustrated by this editor. They aren't the only ones. Many, many more people have been frustrated by the disruption and POV pushing that was ongoing in these controversial and highly sensitive articles. The article I have just put on VfD is only one of the articles CD has written. I have not placed any others on VfD, however this one is clear POV pushing. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 00:18, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>One last thing: CheeseDreams is under a temporary injunction. Next time I see her post from an anonymous IP address to anything but her ArbCom page or her talk page for <a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheeseDreams_fd4e.html" title="User talk:CheeseDreams">User talk:CheeseDreams</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">User:CheeseDreams</a>, then I block that IP address for 24 hours. If it's not CD, then that person is impersonating her, in which case the block would also be fair.

<p>Out of interest, what parts do people want to have merged into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a>? I'll make an attempt, but I can't see anything that is properly referenced in such a way that could be considered mergable into that topic. I could be wrong (and I am biased against the article, after all I did list it on VfD), but it seems that most of it is just original research with none too many source cited. There's whole chunks in there that seem to talk extensively about another culture but doesn't really explicitely detail how it is related to Christianity. For instance, the whole "Osiris-Dionysus" implies, but doesn't state explicitly, that there are similarities between some parts of Christianity and other cultures. The whole section seems to hinge on the text "However, some scholars think that an appropriate version of the tale was made up, inventing the figure of a particularly holy rabbi who was crucified and resurrected, Jesus, syncretising bits of the other localised versions where suitable." - however, this uses a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> and doesn't state implicitly which scholars hold this position.</p>
<p>The parts that are original research are the entirity of the "Osiris-Dionysus" section. It holds no information sourced from external sources and appears to be the POV of the author who wrote the piece. This is clear against our "no original research" policy. If this section were to be merged into <i>any</i> document, we would need to see an external, verifiable source.</p>
<p>The "Mithras Sol Invictus" I think is not such a big problem when it comes to merging. There is much in that that <i>should</i> be merged into the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a>. However, again the proviso is that we source who has the opinions written into the piece.</p>
<p>With the "issues of priority", I notice that the author has written from the presupposition that Christian concepts <i>must</i> have had a parallel with other religions. For instance "For instance, Creation according to Genesis is a negative parallel of the Babylonian creation myth in Enuma Elish." This statement presupposes that the Genesis account must have been a negative parallel of the Babylonian creation myth. Why? Perhaps this should be more clearly stated whose opinion this is and where they are sourcing it from. I don't have a problem with merging this section into the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a> article is sources can be provided. If they can't be, then I have a big problem with it. It's a pity the original author (CheeseDreams) edited in such a way that she effectively stopped information from being added into the article this was split off from (<a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>) and has since been so badly disrupted she has had two arbitration requests and several RFCs (since then, this author has posted her password on a known trolls account, forcing an admin to find 6 of her sockpuppet accounts - and her main account - and change her password). The pity is that we now can't find out <i>which</i> of her sources she was using in those sections. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:54, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree with TBSDY's comments. Unfortunately I just don't have the expertise (nor the resources without extensive web searches, and probably travel to private archives) to flesh out these points with proper sourcing. I hope we have a few editors who can do it. The topic is substantial but POV issues affect most people who care much about it. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:56, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof. If the <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrews.html" title="Hebrews">Hebrews</a> were long associated with <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> back to the <a href="../../../h/y/k/Hyksos.html" title="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> invasion. It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a> left by <a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhenaten.html" title="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> and adopted by the Hebrews. I myself don't know much about <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroaster.html" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher. It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persian</a> background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.</li>

<dd>The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards. Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamite.html" title="Hamite">Hamites</a> of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japheth.html" title="Japheth">Japhethic</a> as opposed to the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semite.html" title="Semite">Semites</a>. Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Asiatic_8ab9.html" title="Afro-Asiatic">Afro-Asiatic</a> people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans. I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV. I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation. For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philistines.html" title="Philistines">Philistines</a>, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece. Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> and during the Catholic <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a>, it became the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem_188c.html" title="Kingdom of Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Asia_309e.html" title="Southwest Asia">Southwest Asia</a>.</dd>

<dd>Aha; I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them. I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV. I actually requested a balanced edition of said issue, if you'd be so kind as to reread my previous statement here. The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic. We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does. The existing article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Christianity_e274.html" title="History of Christianity">History of Christianity</a> provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent. After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history? What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod.html" title="Herod">Herod</a>!)? Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies? Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for racist <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> theories. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 22:59, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If someone would like to provide sources and write from a neutral POV, then this would no longer be a problem. Incidently: that's what happens when sources aren't cited in controversial articles. The material gets removed after a certain period of time when it becomes clear that the authors won't provide their reference material. That you were banned from directly editing the article should not have stopped you providing us your sources on the talk page, and had you edited to form consensus you would not have been banned by the ArbCom from editing articles related to Christianity now, hmmm? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 00:41, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In <i>what</i> way am I suppressing protests? What, because I don't like to be insulted to my face? So far I haven't blocked you, nor have I locked this page, nor have I deleted any text in the talk pages! So <i>how</i> am I suppressing protests? And exactly <i>what</i> are you protesting? It's not clear to me. As for saying I have a PhD. in Nazism: that's a vile and disgusting thing for you to say. I'd also like to know where you get off that I've "banned" people. CD is currently not editing from her account because - well, because of her own behaviour. It might interest you that she <i>won't</i> be able to get back into her account, but not because of anything that admins have done (like block her), but because she posted her user password to a known troll's account! An admin found this, got into the account before the troll could and changed that password. He has a standing offer of giving her the new password for ONE of her accounts (she had 5 with the same password!) if she can verify she is who she says she is. So who's fault is it that CheeseDreams can no longer edit on Wikipedia? Mine? I don't think so. So why don't you get a clue and do some basic research before you a) make personal attacks against myself, and b) accuse me of admin abuse?

Also, I am asking whether this really <i>is</i> CheeseDreams, as the editor is posting from an anonymous IP address. Is it fair to assume that this editor really is CheeseDreams? I cannot be certain that it isn't someone trying to impersonate her and cause her problems. I am also aware that it may well be CheeseDreams, however we have no way of knowing now that she has released her password to the general public and forced us to change it. Really though, this isn't our problem. This was a problem that was caused by CheeseDreams when she revealed her password for all the world to see! I'd personally like to see her only edit from one account, and until she grabs her new password from (I think) Slrubenstein, there is no way of knowing who she is. It is unfortunate that she has caused herself these problems, but that's what happens when you try to be deliberately disruptive! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:17, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I salute your efforts to discredit and diminish the editorial faculties of this nice individual. All she has to do is look at Wikipedia's disclaimer about editing: "If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it." Thank you for your fundementalist(or skeptic) tirade TBSDY! Any time I need your help suppressing uncomfortable knowledge that will threaten Wikipedia, I'll just holler! That's right, you'll probably have this article deleted before she gets back! Wondrous friend, I do agree that the title should be definitely changed but to really make amends in this situation; you need to demolish and erase all records of this, which includes getting CD permanently banned! I'm sure it'll be a marvelous day when this is all over! You'll have saved us all from the crackpots and only appropriate knowledge will be be acknowledged! Send her to the Gulag! Off to Bedlam! Off with her head! If you haven't noticed, it is only YOU persecuting this body of work and its chief architect. Now that I've said this, you'll probably get your hopeful buddies to sic her(and/or me) too. Being a vigilante is only necessary when somebody has broken the law and there are no policemen around. If CD has done anything so harmful that is not commonly seen on Wikipedia as an inherent flaw in editing, then please say so now. From what I have seen, CD has done no better or worse than the majority of Wikipedians. Everybody has put up articles without sources at one time or another. Every once in a while, somebody develops an obsession with the apparent mistakes of another user and goes witchfynding. They burn Joan of Arc at the stake because her inspiration frightens them. SO, Joan hears these voices and liberates France in the meanwhile but her countrymen dispose of her as she makes them feel uncomfortable by her eccentricity. Well, CheeseDreams! I fucking hate your guts! You know that? You offer no fucking benefit to this website! You have no decency to boot!

<dd>Well, there's an arrogant attitude for you. "I know best about the content and none of the rest of you know anything, so clearly you are attacking me for being a peon". Now would you care to show me where I'm "abusing my admin powers" on this article? I haven't locked it, I haven't deleted it and I haven't blocked anyone associated with it other than CheeseDreams, and then only because of ArbCom decisions. I'm not holding my breath for CheeseDreams. She's already shown that she can't work well with others. I would have been more than happy to come to consensus and to help her verify her material. If I had better material and sources I'd even try to balance the article! A good example of how I've done this is to actually start an article on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Babylons_cf23.html" title="The Two Babylons">The Two Babylons</a></i> (a very dodgy piece of text, I might say) by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hislop_7bdf.html" title="Alexander Hislop">Alexander Hislop</a>. After investigation by several Wikipedians, several misconceptions have been cleared up (like for instance stating that Hislop was a "scholar" - he wasn't. He was an Anglican minister who had studied basic Hebrew and Greek and had many misconceptions about ancient history). So I actually started to research the material and attempted to balance it up with (gasp!) <i>facts</i>. Like I've already said: you seem to have dived in here with a misconception that we are being unfair to CheeseDreams because she supports your POV. Nothing could be further from the truth. I suggest you investigate what <i>really</i> happened here before accusing others of nasty things like <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>. Oh, and as for me being over the common rank and file: that's crap. If I step out of line too much then I'll get hauled back <i>into</i> line: probably by Jimbo himself. And I'd welcome feedback! I'm pretty much an open book when it comes to admin decisions. I tell people honestly why I did something, and if I make a mistake I try to fix the problem and apologise to the affected parties. I also try <i>very</i> hard not to make personal attacks. I suggest you do the same, because it's hard to debate facts with people who are attacking your personally (like you've done to me in our current conversation several times). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 16:30, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I never said I knew everything. I already stated that CD has opened my eyes to what info I've been looking for. I have said that I don't like POV and in truth, her POV pisses me off because it seems that has gotten you to almost throw the article out. I don't box people in to their failures to communicate. I know that online, people often act differently. Some forget that online communique demands the same level of decency as in person. When I used to edit a lot from my personal studies online and from what I learned in schoolbooks, I gave people most likely the same attitude as CD. When I'd get challenged, I'd smirk and write something obnoxious. I've changed my attitude somewhat to be more responsible and I've intervened because I think I know what her problem is. Your or anybody elses' perception of who is a scholar based on modern standards flys right in the face of historical ideas regarding such a status. Back in those days, any learned man was a scholar but today we have higher expectations before we "give" a person an "important" label. I think you know why I defended CD and attacked your assault of this article, so I'm not going to reargue the issue. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 19:24, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My. I didn't say anyone was above anyone else, I said that someone was respected becuse they have shown themselves to be reasonable and conscientious, at least to me. That implies a burden of proof that someone else will have to meet to convince my colleagues and myself otherwise. "Consensus" applies to a willingness to compromise and adapt in the light of new evidence (if such is provided). I don't want to exacerbate any arguments here, we all want the best articles possible, but we also have to learn to share our toys. That being said, while the Truth is a fine subject for contemplation in a monastery, the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> known as Wikipedia is a democracy, with rough guidelines set out by Jimbo Wales. That means that a majority does decide content, not any individual (hence the VfD debate in the first place) except possibly Jimbo because its his playground. As I've said to others, if that doesn't suit you, and there is no reason why it should, you are quite free to start your own website and decide on its content for yourself. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 16:44, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I just wanted Borderer to know that it doesn't seem to outsiders like they (that pesky indeterminate gender third person pronoun again!) are being picked on arbitrarily, but rather that your concerns are indeed justified AFAIC as there are policies and procedures in place that should be followed if one's contributions here are to be realistically expected to stand for any length of time, especially under the glare of a VfD spotlight.

<li>I will not allow article content to be decided by democracy if it is untrue. Reinforcing ignorant POV by casual observers only considerate towards policy, really sets my hair on end. Arbitrary administration is what pisses off Democrats about Bush's tenure and I voted for him, not against him. I still stand by him, which is how I see you standing by Jimbo and what would aggravate people who rather care for true Democracy instead of political machinery. Yeah, you've said the "start your own website" mantra, which I take as verification of a gang up on CD and my Devil's Advocacy. In the interests of INFORMATION, I trust rule by force less than I do rule by intellectual direction, which is different with childrearing and public service of course. Look at what you're doing when you shout policy, in order to be NPOV. Somebody who catches onesself in the middle of hypocrisy and are able to admit it freely are those I trust most to administer, as they have it in their best interest to make sure they are entirely honest. Sometimes the mechanics of a system only serves to hold down the good intent of simple people who recognise simple real things than contrived acculturations in bureaucracy. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorderer_8031.html" title="User:Borderer">Borderer</a> 19:24, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You do not have the ability to allow or disallow anything. If <i>anyone</i> continues to edit in opposition to a consensus after having been warned not to, then they can be temporarily blocked by an admin or permanently blocked by the Arbitration Committee as a troll or a vandal. An ultimatum by you is not convincing evidence of "intellectual direction," and you should know that your "Truth" is only as you and those who agree with you see it. Others' mileage will certainly vary, and you have to respect that. So that you know, I'm not a "casual observer," I am well versed in the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_hypothesis.html" title="Documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a> and the history and theology of ancient and modern Israel as well as Christianity. As such, you should know that I find your present argumentive style as unbalanced and unconvincing as that of the aforementioned CD. You obviously care about the subject, your position can be presented and your energies be appreciated as long as you maintain civility and adhere to general <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. It isn't difficult to make people happy here, you just have to be scholarly, balanced and thorough in your presentation.

<dd>Ooh, that's nice work Fire Star! Good job. It might have taken me longer to flesh that out, since I'm a slow editor. Why not call it <b>Christian Syncretism</b>? I still disagree with <i>some</i> actions taken for the No Original Research rule, but I don't care to debate over these details that people will inevitably reedit back into the article in the future. The formatting is shite and the article looks horrible, but the subject matter is just as important as similar pages talking about facets in other religions. The article has a shitty title and should be Wikified. It is salvageable, if labourious to undertake. Just because it's not Wikified, doesn't mean it deserves to be destroyed. That's because several pages sit like this on Wikipedia and they might deserve to be deleted as personal fluff for the nerds that I haven't heard of nor thought important enough to know. We need a balance by adding serious academic topics and nonsense issues should be removed.

<dd>You want people to be able to get to the background of an article. Some people will want to verify if the content is indeed correct or at least notable, other people will want to know where to find out more if the subject interests them. So solid, dispassionate documentation is the key to keeping an article on Wikipedia. Even if it is on an emotional or distasteful subject a neutral presentation keeps it encyclopaedic and lessens the chance that someone will object. Even when things don't go your way, remember that this is just a hobby for most of us, not life or death. A cool head, listening to your fellow editors and professional manners will go a long way towards defusing arguments and a good final result for everyone. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 03:17, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In general: 1) there is a wide range of opinion on high schools, from those who think only very notable high schools should be included to those who think all high schools are intrinsically notable and should be included; 2) the general topic has been argued interminably and there is currently no consensus; anyone stating otherwise is misinformed; 3) in practice VfD votes are strongly influenced by the quality of the article, and less strongly by the relative numbers and energy levels of inclusionists and deletionists on any given day.

<li>Comment: I think a page for this is probably premature, but a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> might be appropriate if suitable content was made available.

If it doesn't I think it would still be interesting enough to have a short paragraph (and even an external link) in the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> page, as one of many unsuccessful curiousities. On that basis, Michael, would you be prepared to licence the contents of your promotional site (expecially the photos) for use here under the GFDL?

<li><b>Comment</b> An acquaintance of mine who spends as much time in bikeforums.net as I spend in Wikipedia said that it was at best a novelty or curiosity and not to be taken seriously. Search on "sidewaysbike" in bikeforums.net turns up nothing, seach on "sideways" turns up nothing relevant. Rather surprising as they <i>love</i> odd bikes (my acquaintance sends me pictures of the odder ones from time to time... ever see a bicycle made <i>entirely</i> out of bamboo? Or a sort of unicycle with an outer wheel over six feet in diameter, with the rider's seat entirely inside?) Sidewaysbike's inventor has been energetically posting in bike-related USENET forums, see <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?as_q=sidewaysbike&amp;safe=images&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?as_q=sidewaysbike&amp;safe=images&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this search</a>, with no evidence of any serious interest. Typical comments: "mad stuff," "And this a solution to what problem?" "Well, from where I sit, that looks like a collection of novelty demo units whose sale to the general public would be the source of a certain amount of glee among the personal injury attorney crowd." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment P. S.</b> Most favorable comment I've seen in USENET so far: "Why not just enjoy the design and engineering that went into this thing. Obviously it won't be the next new thing in bike design. But it IS a very cool design and implementation." <b>If</b> it were to become <b>popular,</b> of course, <i>even as a fad novelty</i> then it would be reasonable to have an article on it. Reminds me of an article in, IIRC, <i>Science</i> some years ago in which some researchers studying how bicycles worked, i.e. what was the actual physics involved, tested their theories by attempting to build <i>unridable bicycles,</i> ones on which it was impossible for a human to maintain balance. Once used a tiny little caster for a front wheel. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:44, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
