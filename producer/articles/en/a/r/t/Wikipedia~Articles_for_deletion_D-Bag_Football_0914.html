<p>KEEP---So what if it is only a "university football team?" For example, there is an entry on "Maine South High School." What makes that entry notable to anyone outside the city of Park Ridge? So, we've arbitrarily decided that a random suburb in the Chicago-land area is sufficient enough to garner interest, but what occurs at arguably the most known educational institution in the world isn't? Seems to me that perhaps some people's fire is fueled due to this being a "Harvard" team--and that isn't right. Sorry but it just isn't. As for non-verifiable? Well, let's go back to the same Maine South entry....its says that they have one of the top wrestling programs in the state. Now is that statement verifiable? I mean, what does one of the top in the state denote? B/c if that means being ranked, they aren't...and haven't been for a while. So perhaps it's a false statement. Or perhaps it's vanity---some measure of self promotion. But it's allowed. Well, so should this. Furthermore, there is no analogy to be drawn between an intramural team and a ping-pong table in someone's basement. Intramural teams in the past have garnered attention, obviously to different degrees, but still. Does anyone recall the attention given to the guys who named their team the "Fighting Whities"??? So, don't dismiss something just b/c its an intramural sport. This all being said, I think it's great that we are having a discussion.66.30.15.64 06:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)AK</p>

<p>An intramural athletic team is notable when they represent the underlying values of athletic competition at elite educational institutions.

<li>The UT intramural football team is in the archives of that schools library because it has continuously existed for 50 years. The Harvard team has existed for three. Moreover, just because something is in that library does not mean that it should be in this encyclopedia.</li>
<li>Unless Harvard Law has really gone downhill, Kaufman fellowships are given out for on the basis of legal ability, and activities such as intramural football are only minor details.</li>
<li>Joel Goldman is only one man, especially in a sea as big as G-T. The fact that his team was important to him does not mean that we should have an article about it, and it certainly does not follow from Goldman's biography that a page on this team merits inclusion.</li>
<li>None of the reasons that Charles Alan Wright is actually notable have anything to do with law school intramural football, and we don't have any articles on the intramural teams that he coached (nor should we). Naturoma 02:29, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To an outside observer, law school intramural football may appear to be trivial if someone has never experienced the camaraderie of athletic competition in an intense and grueling academic setting. This misunderstanding on the parts of certain individuals is not the problem of the intramural participant nor the Wikipedia. Intramural football is it is, and has been for decades, an axis of student social scenes not just at Harvard Law but colleges, universities and graduate schools across America and the UK. Surely teams who embody the entire spirit of the great intramural tradition are notable, much like the 1985 Chicago Bears are notable for embodying a football attitude all its own. In addition, the fact that the a team has been around for only three years is not a sufficient condition for being non-notable. The Florida Marlins have two World Series titles, despite only being a team for 15 years. Are they less notable than the Houston Astros, who have no titles but have been a team for 40? Baltodomer 02:41, 5 December 2005 (UTC)baltodomer</p>

<li><b>Question</b>. Are Harvard Law people so full of themselves <i>even when they are still students or have recently graduated</i> that they think every time they get together to play flag football the world should sit up and pay notice?

<p>It seems like there's a lot of debate over something that supposedly doesn't matter. Long, involved discussions on whether is something is relevant are oxymoronic.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(1) Intramural football is a large part of student life at a very important institution. (2) The intramural football team that is the subject of this article was an especially well-known team, not because of wins and losses, but because it reflected all the joys, sorrows and camaraderie that represents student intramurals. Thousands of students play intramurals, and then its not notable when a few students who have achieved substantial fame playing said intramurals? The paradigm of an intramural football team is not notable?

<li>Argued like a budding lawyer. I'm sorry to argue against a page you put a lot of work into, and I hope you stay and contribute to other articles. However, many things that are important parts of student life are not <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a>, and in my opinion intramural football (why would you assume that I don't know anything about it and am not interested?) is one. There is a ping-pong table in the basement of one of the buildings in my academic department, and it is important to many of us, but it certainly does not merit an article in an encyclopedia. An article about an intramural league <i>might</i> be worth an entry, but one about a single team, however heartwarming, is not, except perhaps under rare circumstances. The joys, sorrows, etc, would be better told in a personal web page, blog, art installation, novel, etc etc. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 04:22, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia stated goal is �to create a free, democratic, reliable encyclopedia�actually, the largest encyclopedia in history, in terms of both breadth and depth.� If we evaluate this article by those standards, it should be Kept. A majority of people who have commented on this article favor keeping it. Accordingly it should remain in a �democratic encyclopedia.� The article is reliable as evinced by the picture, the article in the Harvard Law Record, and testimony from several contributors on this page. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is going to be the �largest encyclopedia in history, in terms of both breadth and depth� it will naturally include articles that might not appear in a standard Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p>Notice that notability is not one of the aims enumerated in Wikipedia�s mission�s statement. Although many of the article's critics mock the subject of this entry because they have not personally heard of this group, nowhere does Wikipedia state that a topic must be famous in order to appear in the encyclopedia. What purpose would an encyclopedia serve if all of the articles in it only addressed widely known topics? A good encyclopedia should help its readers learn about obscure subjects as well as history�s headliners and legends. Keeping this article is consistent with Wikipedia�s stated goals even though several of the article's critics are not personally familiar with D-bag Football. 149.101.1.123 15:38, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, a mention on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html#Student_activities" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School#Student activities</a> might be appropriate. The template at the top of this section is counterproductive; lawyers and wannabe lawyers are used to manufacturing evidence. A more important point is that Wikipedia is a community, and outsiders coming in to vote on a single issue don't know the community standards. This isn't a rules-driven community, but a consensus-driven one.

<li>KEEP---What's the point of rules if a consensus can override something that falls within the acceptable guidelines?? Especially a consensus that is seemingly ignoring arguments with throw away insults (e.g. "lawyers are used to manufacturing evidence). I go back to my earlier point, what makes this less notable than Maine South High School?? Since when does one of the many Chicago area high schools deserve its own entry in a "encyclopedia?" What makes it any more notable than this?? Note that simply distinguishing between this specific high school and this specific intramural team on the basis that "one is an educational institution and the other isn't," doesn't provide any logical argument on why it is more "notable"?? It begs the question: Notable to who??140.247.237.28 18:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC) AK</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Are you actually comparing a school which has existed for over 40 years and has thousands of pupils at any one time with this team? The school is clearly more notable, as it has had a far greater impact on far more people. In answer to your question, "Notable to who?" it generally means notable to the world at large. Your childhood pet which you loved and cherished, and then buried in the back garden when it died probably was very important to you, but it is does not have wider notability.

<li>"The world at large"??? Believe me, MSHS is a great school--arguably the best high school in America. However, it is not notable to the world at large. Rather, far from it. If it is so notable, tell me the following: Name of mascot, name of head football coach, name of school fight song, what movie allegedly had its final scene shot on the school's football field? You can't tell me these things..at least not without lots of tedious research. KEEP.</li>

<li>User Bikeable above makes the best argument so far for deletion, because he uses an actual argument, rather than a mere assertion that "lawyers are used to manufacturing evidence." That statement is as ridiculous as it is uninformed. The arguments above are not legal ones, rather legal-like arguments made under the Wikipedia guidelines which operate as a sort of legal code for Wikipedia. That makes a legal-like argument relevant and certainly acceptable. Either way, there has been strong arguments both ways, and while this is a probably a close call, I believe the weight of the evidence and the importance of the subject matter warrants inclusion in the wikipedia. <b>KEEP.</b> Baltodomer 18:03, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP.</b> Regardless of whether this team is from Harvard or from a superior athletic institution like the University of Michigan is besides the point. I don't see how one can draw the line calling a team unnotable or insignificant solely because of the size or popularity of the institution in question. Assuming this can be substantiated as a real team (the picture would seem to lead me to think it is--perhaps one could contact the student organizations office at Harvard University to verify this?), I would say keep it. I was under the impression that the Wikipedia community is more welcoming to "marginal" entries than World Book or Encarta and its strength is based in large part on its diversity. It's better to error on the side of keeping things in than wrongfully excluding something undeserving of inclusion. LLTF06</li>

<li>Whoever referenced [Maine South High School] above makes an outstanding point. Having perused the Maine South High School page, you will find many unverified claims about skill levels of various sports teams, none of which are verified or linked to any other article or source. And the Maine South page is somehow different than this one? <b>I would challenge anyone of the critics of the D-Bag article to differentiate the Maine South High School article from the D-Bag article.</b> Also, this article is encyclopedic in its style and not written in the style of a blog.

<p>DELETE - I go to Harvard Law and have never heard of this football team until they put themselves on Wikipedia. This is clearly a vanity article.</p>
<p>KEEP- Thanks for signing your comment, Mr. "I claim to go to Harvard Law School." Clearly, if you go to this school, and spend more than 5 minutes a day outside the library you would be familiar with this team. Adzilla 19:08, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The argument about Maine South is to point out that many of the arguments made by critics here concerning verifiability appear to be weak when an article like Maine South is approved. If the Maine South article is approved even though it is unverified as part of a general consensus then the general consensus is overbroad and compromises the Wikipedia requirement of veriability. As far as the high school being relevant to an intramural team, <b>you are confusing the subject matter with the type of article they both are and the two articles' verifiability</b>. The point is that there is <b>no meaningful distinction, under the Wikipedia rules, between the two articles in terms of verifiability and notability</b>. The argument that there is no similar subject matter as the D-Bag article on the Wikipedia is not a strong argument for deletion but rather a strong argument for its inclusion as an extention of knowledge previously ignored. And why are public schools notable in general? Are private ones notable as well? Baltodomer 01:42, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Observing what has gone on to this point, the concern appears to have shifted from verifiability to notability. In terms of notability, then, on first glance this appears to be a close call. However, several reasons lead me to believe that this article is noteworthy enough; that is, worth keeping as part of Wikipedia's encyclopedia. First, the topic of this article concerns a university, and a graduate school within the university, that is arguably the most famous university in the world. An article that provides insight into student life at such a university is likely noteworthy on some level. In regards to the law school, I can think off the top of my head of a famous book (One L) and movie (Paper Chase) dedicated to the topic of life at Harvard Law School. This is not to say that the students of Harvard Law are any more "special" or important tha anyone else; merely to say that the lives of these students are, objectively, more noteworthy to the general public vis a vis those of students at other universities/graduate schools. Secondly, the topic of intramural sports, obviously captured in this article, is one that is uniquely important in American society. An article on this topic (that I am assuming at this point is credible based on the corroboration, verification and strong defense from posters in the know) is likely noteworthy. To develop this point a bit further, intramural sports is a subject that is discussed and researched often in our society, and relevant to many of the debates that go on today, from encouraging a healthy lifestyle to issues of discrimination to the role of sports in the development of children. To expand on just one of these areas, the role of intramural sports in the context of gender discussions is undeniable: just think of Title IX- one of the oft-mentioned considerations in Title IX discussions is the participation in intramural sports among men and women and whether this should impact the allocation of resources. While this particular article does not delve into that particular subject with any depth, at a cursory glance, the fact that this is an all-boys team says something (on a side note, based on the picture, the diversity on this team is noteworthy based on what I know of how students associate at most academic institutions and elsewhere). Maybe I am stretching the point a bit, but i don't think it would be a stretch to say that an article that presents anecdotal evidence about one particular intramural team and its experiences may be useful (read: noteworthy) to someone's research on the subject of intramural athletics. The fact that this team is at Harvard, an institution that is world-reknowned, while also carrying a certain mystique, makes it all the more noteworthy. It is noteable, if nothing else, for what it does to stereotypes about what all Harvard Law School students are like. In light of Wikipedia's goals regarding breadth of subject matter, and providing something beyond what one could find in traditional dictionaries like the Enyclopedia Brittanica, I believe this article is noteworthy and should be <b>kept</b>. --24.61.4.185 01:48, 7 December 2005 (UTC) [SZA]</p>

<li><b>comment</b> re "the concern appears to have shifted from verifiability to notability" - As far as I am concerned, the issue of verifiability has not been dealt with. I have already commented on what the photo does for verifiability above, and beyond that photo, no other sources have been presented. I cannot find anything mentioning this team using google. If there are any external sources of information about this team, can someone please tell us where they are? I am also unconvinced as to why <i>this specific team</i> is notable (as oposed to the topic of intramural sport in general, or the value of describing a typical intramural team as part of covering that topic,) but if there were sources that would enable an article to be written about this team without using <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable information</a>, I would be far less concerned about the team's notability, in part because the fact that someone else had written something about them might imply some notability. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 14:19, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

My main point was that making repeated vote-like comments (i.e. comments which expressly state a keep or delete opinion,) especially when they are unsigned, could be taken as a sign of bad faith, and I felt is is only fair that you be aware of that. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 17:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We should have faith in the closing administrator that he or she will do their job, as in: " Another volunteer (the "closing admin") will review the article, carefully read the AFD discussion, weigh all the facts, evidence and arguments presented and determine if consensus was reached on the fate of the article." From <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Closure" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#Closure</a>. I am obviously not trying to fool anyone. If I was really doing bad faith things I'd sockpuppet the whole argument. I think the closing administrator will be fine. Baltodomer 17:47, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. This article is a fantastic read and communicates information that is apt to be of some interest to some number of readers. One thing I fail to understand -- and this may just show me for one of the unwashed -- is why anyone would be eager to delete an article like this. The best reason I can think of is scarcity, but I'm guessing that lack of storage space is not an acute problem for the Wikipedia. Another reason is that clutter offends the aesthetic sense of obsessive-compulsive types. I suppose, but as reasons go, that one leaves me underwhelmed. If the article contained false statements, that might render it objectionable, but as far as I can tell, the worst that can be said of this article is that it is frivolous (and I mean that in a good way!). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles.Morse_4b60.html" title="User:Charles.Morse">User:Charles.Morse</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sure it's all 100% true, but it's not verifiable. Even if there's an article in <i>The Maroon</i> or <i>The Lampoon</i> proving that this team exists, I'll bet it doesn't verify all those inside jokes. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 19:33, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Critics of this article assume there are inside jokes, making further conclusory statements about this article. <b>There is nothing in this article that is a "joke" insofar as it did not happen.</b> The standards for verifiability on the wikipedia seem to not be very strict. Much of what appears in mainstream articles have no citations as to specific assertions. See Main South High School. So don't get on your verifiability high horse just because you do not like the subject matter...be consistent. The critics of this article keep morphing their criticism, only to be batted down. First, it was vanity. Now nobody says its vanity. Then, the subject matter was accused of being overprivileged. That was shot down. Then it was both criticized and supported for being funny. Apparently to some, if its funny, it shouldn't be on the wikipedia. I can't find that rule either. Now its verifiability, and you are forced to apply a heavy handed standard to just this article.

<p>KEEP. I am still waiting for someone in favor of deletion to explain why the Maine South High School article is ok. "Because its a public school" doesnt cut it.Adzilla 04:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Are you actually saying that you don't see how a public school, made of bricks and mortar, which will serve many thousands of kids over many years and is an institution central to its community, is different than a small group of students playing flag football? If so, you are quite welcome to put the school up for deletion, although I am pretty sure I know what the result will be. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 19:08, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you're making different argument that the supporters of this article. <b>The comparison to Main South High School is meant to show the uneven nature of the Wikipedia's verifiability standard, not the notability argument.</b> Your argument also make the connection between how long an event/thing lasts and its notability. That's a logical fallacy. Consider the Kennedy assassination...very brief, but very notable. Both D-Bag Football and Maine South are notable, despite the difference in time elapsed. You're picturing a flag football team and a high school in your mind and you're saying they're different because they're different concepts. But the argument the supporters of this article are making is that in terms of the Wikipedia, <i>the two articles about these concepts are similar from a verifiability standard</i>. Keep up and try to think outside the box! Baltodomer 21:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Look, <b>Baltodomer</b>, I went to an even better law school than you did, and I'm sure that's true of many other Wikipedians, so don't assume that we're a bunch of knee-jerk anti-elitists who don't understand the rule of law as it applies to privately-run organizations. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 00:04, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, well this comment presents no argument. If anything, this shows that those in the "delete" camp are resorting to the type of comments that usually show a weak argument. Whoever is "judging" this debate, please take these inflammatory statements into consideration when evaluating everything. No one assumes anything about anyone being an anti-elitist. It's you who have brough the law school debate into the mix here. Quite juvenile for someone who went to a "better" law school than Baltodomer. Asserting that this debate has "nothing to do with me or you" (your response to DGaston) is laughable when you earlier state that you went to "an even better law school" than Baltodomer.

<li>comment: I find it tragic that many of the posters who oppose this article use the tool of reason to assert their opinion -- yet these same posters immediatly react in such a immature, crass, and, frankly, unintelligent manner when their very arguments are taken to task. No one here is picking a fight: posters like Baltodomer are simply making direct and coherent arguments to defend this bit of on-line real estate and the ideas/knowledge therein. It is unfortunate that some who oppose this article must step to the line with such a colossal chip on their shoulder and such an overwhelming prejudice against the subject matter of the article: all because of the vacuous perceptions these posters have of the related institution and, apparently, those who attend. The errant post above epitomizes the key problem in this "discussion." Mareino should understand that there are many who can, with varying levels of accuracy, claim that their school is "even better" than HLS in any given rubric. Be it the weather, location, a specific program, a moot-court competition result, school size, etc., there are many ways that you can assert your legal education is/was inherently better than Harvard's. But here is the important part -- <b>THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS DISCUSSION</b>. The last post was simply levied to state that that Baltodomer's logically sound response to a criticism was a direct result of Baltodomer's "elite" education, an education that is not unique to Harvard or even so-called "elite" institutions. That is wonderful <b>Marenio</b>, but this page is about a Wikipedia article marked for deletion, not assaulting one who happens to use logic to swat down an argument. And it gets better... Mareino wants all to know that s/he and "many other Wikipedians" have the requisite knowledge to "understand the rule of law as it applies to privately-run organizations." That is, again, wonderful, but <i>this page is about a Wikipedia article marked for deletion</i>, not your knowledge of the law. I implore all future posters to adhere to the discussion at hand and refrain from the maligned reasoning that lead to the above invective. --140.247.205.92 01:34, 11 December 2005 (UTC)DGaston

<li>You're darn right this discussion has nothing to do about me or you. So stop dragging your prejudices into it. Would an article on an amateur sports team be in the Encyclopedia Britannica? No, so why should it be on Wiki? Explain that to me, stop talking about how you think that you're so much better than us. That's childish and irrelevant. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 02:10, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Poor form Mareino, poor form. Please carefully re-read my first reply to your initial comment, you may find cause to adjust your comments. For further enlightenment, read the bulk of this discussion ... there are several explicit reasons why your Britannica test fails terribly. And for the record, since YOU are the one who "went to an even better law school than [Harvard];" perhaps YOU should "stop talking about how you think that you're so much better than [students of that institution]" .... "That's childish and irrelevant"</li>
