</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Principality of Freedonia, an internet nation based on libertarian ideals, hopes to set up a physical state, either on&#160;:Norfolk Island - if the Australian Government agrees to sell it - or in a remote part of Somalia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...</p>
<dl>
<dd>More than 260 people are involved in Freedonia, according to its leaders.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Founder, Texan John Kyle - who prefers to be known as Prince John I - claims to be involved in negotiations with the Sultan of Awdal in Somaliland with the intention of setting up a Libertarian nation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kyle says his nation is still some years away from becoming reality. "The next thing to do is send an emissary to North Africa and Pitcairn and to consider fundraising and making preparations," he says. "We're about five years off."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Freedonia remains unfunded - apart from an attempt to sell Freedonian currency online - and Kyle, who fusses over his international phone bill, admits he has not even raised money for a plane ticket.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even the "unstable" Somalis appear to have become leery of the Freedonians, exemplifying the difficulties internet-based nations have in getting off the ground. When The Australian spoke to a source close to the Sultan of Awdal, there was a swift denial of any links with the libertarians of Freedonia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The source says the Sultan agreed to the deal after a Somali Freeport representative, Ethiopia-based Flory Barnabas, made an approach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Sultan Ibrahim and elders of Awdal had no idea about the connection between these groups," the source says. "When I called today, the Sultan and rest of the elders were surprised.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"There is no deal and these people will not be allowed to do business in Awdal or other regions of Somalia. We never support these types of groups."</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - no one seems to have noticed that the article does not assert notability in the slightest. This is a problem. In fact, it's a valid CSD criterion.

Being mentioned in a book is no guarantee of notability, the Freedonia website itself is hardly a reliable soure, I'm unimpressed as to the validity notability-wise as to a mention in the Metro Santa Cruz - if that's anything like the Metro we have here in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, then certainly not, and the Republican magazine thingamajig does most certainly <b>not</b> have this "micronation" as the main topic of that article, or even anywhere close.

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be some question about the <i>New York Times</i> article from May of 2000. In an 1114-word article, there are just 120 words on Freedonia, most of which are about the kid who started it:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>THE PRINCIPALITY OF FREEDONIA: www .freedonia.org A country of libertarian leanings, Freedonia has very little connection with the Marx Brothers' fictional country of the same name. Its leader, John Alexander Kayle, is a student at Babson College in Massachusetts. He is studying for a degree in investment finance and professes a fondness for the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Ayn Rand. Mr. Kayle, who uses the screen name John I, and his fellow Freedonians hope to purchase a chunk of territory in Somaliland and establish a libertarian enclave. Notwithstanding its homelessness, Freedonia has minted its own money (silver) and even written a national anthem that has this refrain: <i>Oh, Freedonia, Freedonia the land that saves, Freedonians never shall be slaves.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My opinion is that this does not make the micronation notable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Most of them aren't available elsewhere online, so I won't press them, though I doubt Freedonia made them all up. Still, there's a <a href="http://www.wirednews.com/wired/archive/8.03/kingdoms.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wirednews.com/wired/archive/8.03/kingdoms.html" rel="nofollow">Wired Article</a> and an article from <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/digas/servlet/find/ON=spiegel-72682" class="external text" title="http://service.spiegel.de/digas/servlet/find/ON=spiegel-72682" rel="nofollow">Der Spiegel</a>.

This one concept, whether or not it's very serious, has been covered in repeatedly in different media.

<dd>The Wired article also has just one graf on these guys, with the bulk on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talossa.html" title="Talossa">Talossa</a> (whom the Freedonia site refers to as "imaginary," which may be Freedonian for "not notable"). The Der Spiegel article is behind a wall, unfortunately. But the real reason I'm commenting is this: I don't buy the riots/deaths story at all. It's mentioned on the Freedonia site, and in that one English-language Somali publication that only says that the Freedonia issue is "believed" to be the reason behind the riots, but then refers to the Freedonia project as a fake. Is there a better source for this particular story? I'm pressing that point because that claim in the article more than any other bit sent my delete-o-meter to red (per <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>). | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well the article posted above from The Australian at a minimum confirms that Freedonia representatives were in contact with the Sultan. It would be appropriate to note that most of the details come from Freedonia itself, but I don't see why that means the article should be deleted. I think the "fake" bit was the Somalis' impression of Freedonia people as a group of pranksters playing a joke on a tiny country rather than a serious organization looking for terrority. Even if it is just a joke, it's a notable joke which merits inclusion in the encyclopedia. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 17:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose it's a question of what constitutes notability. I see passing mentions in articles about other, more notable micronations.

<dd>I have a hard time understanding how you can keep referring to this as <i>joke-like nature of the project</i> despite the well documented fact that their very real attempt to purchase land on which to found an actual physical independent micronation was sufficiently real that it resulted in a riot and fatalities. That is the most serious real-world incident involving any micronation project in the 20th century. Despite the fact that it admittedly <i>started</i> as someone's made-up project while in school, Freedonia <i>clearly</i> moved beyond that into having very real and serious real-world activities. That they went nowhere ultimately is not in dispute - but their active pursuit is well documented and in a sense notorious. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That bit of rhetoric does not address the very real question of whether the riots or fatalities ever took place. It's just a claim by the Freedonia founders, picked up by one news outlet none of us had ever heard of which in the same blurb referred to the Freedonia project as "fake." We've seen no mentions of it in reliable news sources, no photographs of the riots - nothing. There's no actual evidence that the riots or fatalities actually took place, or even if they did, that they had anything to do with Freedonia. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:06, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You can't go around just rejecting sources and saying "You haven't verified this!". They're reliable by WP standards. You have provided no referenced information claiming that those sources or events are bogus. All you have is your opinion and suspicion. Those aren't valid reasons for deleting an article. Evidence and references are - and we've got them reliably cited now. If someone's pulling a megascale media hoax on all of us then they've done so across a very wide array of otherwise completely unrelated sources. The burden of proof is on you to show that there's something suspicious about the sources. You keep claiming I'm attacking you instead of the question - that's because you've stopped attacking the article's former lack of sources, and now are attacking the sources themselves. You can't do that.

You earlier used the riots/fatalities as a way to argue for notability, but it seems to me that the evidence that these riots/fatalities happened or had anything to do with Freedonia is quite weak.

<dd>Mr. Poole, neither of your links mentions Freedonia at all. And again, I'm looking for any bona fide news source that mentions rioting and/or fatalities as a result of the Freedonia founder's trip to Somaliland.

<dl>
<dd>The multiple sources you've already been directed to are perfectly "bona fide" as far as Wikipedia is concerned. They show that people associated with Freedonia travelled to Awdal, had discussions with clan and/or govt officials there, and that after those people were deported, public disaffection resulted in the shooting death of a protester. Incidents of a similar unfortunate nature occur throughout the world daily. Few, if any of them are reported in any mainstream media outlet. On the balance of probabilities the events described in the article took place. The fact the New York Times or Fox News didn't report doesn't make them any less real or verifiable. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 02:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You've pointed me to two sources. One is the Freedonia site itself, which does not qualify as a reliable source. The other is apparently the site of a newspaper in Somaliland, which referred to Freedonia as "fake" - so if we're going to accept it as a reliable source, then that's a clear motion for deletion of this article. Is that what you're saying? And is there some other source that indicates that the Freedonia visit to Somaliland led to a riot? Because right now I count ONE. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 03:50, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've personally pointed you to 2 sources, <i>neither</i> of which is the Freedonia site, yet both of which support assertions made on that site. Others here have pointed you to other references, including one above in the national Australian broadsheet daily which also plainly support those assertions. It is for you to demonstrate how being described as "fake" is a "clear motion for deletion". Continuing to claim that there are no reliable sources is symptomatic of disingenuity, wilful deception or outright stupidity.

<dd>Stunning display of personal attacks, Mr. Poole. You pointed to one source, <i>The Republican</i>, the accuracy of which I have questioned; the only connection made between Freedonia and the demonstration is unsourced ("The demonstration was believed to have been triggered by a government decision to deport two foreigners who arrived in Borama recently..." - believed by whom?). The other source you gave (the obit of the Dutch libertarian) never mentioned Freedonia at all. The Australian article, printed in full above, doesn't mention riots or fatalities, nor does the paragraph in the NY Times. There is no source other than the Republican article and the Freedonia Website (which isn't reliable, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources</a>) that verifies these alleged riots or fatalities. Your ardor to defend a micronation like your own is admirable, but the verification of these alleged riots and fatalities is sorely lacking, and if they are part of the argument for notability, I take issue with it. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 05:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on, MrDarcy.

<dd>Oh, I agree with that. I still don't see notability, but the fact that the best reliable source we have on the project's efforts in Somaliland refers to it as a fake is rather telling to me.

<dd>OK, first off, it should be pointed out that all of the reputable media articles mentioning Freedonia -- including The Australian article, the Wired article, the New York Times article, and the Santa Cruz Metro article -- were printed prior to the December 2000-January 2001 trip to Somaliland, so it's pretty obvious why they wouldn't mention the trip. For that matter, that I can name that many reputable media articles mentioning Freedonia at all should be sufficient to prove notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's clear from several sources that Jim Davidson and Michael Van Motten really did travel to Somaliland and spoke with local authorities. The Van Motten obit doesn't mention Freedonia because the men weren't actually involved with Freedonia. Freedonia claims that the Somalis mistakenly associated the men with Freedonia because their website made reference to Awdal as a potential location. I would guess that the website likely mentioned Davidson by name since he was actively promoting the region via the Internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>According to The Republican and The Australian, the Somalis had a very low opinion of Freedonia. They thought it was a sham/hoax/fraud/fake, whatever. That has nothing to do with notability here, but the fact that they formed an opinion on Freedonia at all is proof they were aware of the group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the Somalis were already suspicious of Freedonia, this last bit makes sense, but honestly can only be attributed to The Republican and Freedonia itself: The two men were (erroneously) associated with Freedonia and deported, resulting in a protest which was put down with lethal force. It would be entirely appropriate to note that the claim originates from Freedonia and can only be confirmed by a small Somali newspaper. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 18:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Multiple people writing about all sorts of things spend ink mentioning stuff that WP rightly doesn't bother with.

MrDarcy is leading me to doubt even this negligible claim. But if there is indeed something to it, well, "Freedonia" can get its own sentence or even little paragraph within the article on micronations. (To me, the potential significance of Freedonia is that a young Youessian would unwittingly use <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedonia.html" title="Freedonia">this staunchly Marxist term</a> for his "libertarian" fantasy and yet have even a tiny number of other Youessians look at it with straight faces.

Web references or any references even if they are realted to the perpetrators of the "creation" are still notable and reliable enough for an encyclopedic article especially if they are published and have been recognised worldwide. This nomination is done in bad taste, and I feel once again a down pour of "deletionism" as at the heart of this nomination with disregard for the truth and facts behind this article. Perhaps this article needs more work, but careless deletionism is not justified simply because the majority of people voting refer to it being "non-notable" which in my opnion is a bunch of garbage.
