<li>Those links are all to Wikipedia mirrors, or translations of the original Wikipedia article. That's the problem when you leave stuff around on Wikipedia for so long, it propagates. As for the link to to the article on Karaism, the Karaite movement has been around for at least 1300 years, so Karaism is indeed verifiable. However, that has nothing to do with "Talmidaism", which was apparently invented in the last 5 years by a couple of former Christians who met on the Internet, and who do not consider themselves to be Karaites. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 8 July 2005 20:17 (UTC)

<li>I meant the connection the article made when it stated a more conservative form of Karaism or Talmidaism. Another question what about their claim to Sefer Yeshua? <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> 8 July 2005 20:29 (UTC)</li>

<li>They can claim a connection to anything they want; they've added information about their movement to a number of articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article was submitted after requests for information about Talmidism by Athanasius and Wetman. See Ebionite Talk Page Nov, Dec 2003.

<li><b>Comment</b> I began this article because I was asked to do so; when I saw how many people disliked its existence I tried to delete it; the article was restored within days. People around Wikipedia (in other articles) have made comments like, "It is not clear what Talmidaism stands for," or "Talmidaism has no clearly defined beliefs." So, I responded in those articles by giving clear, detailed, information. These were objected to, and the information promptly deleted. If people here consider that an article about a faith which teaches others to love one another, and to practice one's religion with humility and compassion, is an eyesore, then it might as well be deleted. As for myself, I would like to practice our faith in peace. Spirituality is not about persecuting and saying hateful things about those who wish to do good; it is about trying to get in touch with something greater than ourselves....PS the majority of the assumptions made here about us and our movement (even my personal biography) are incorrect. However, I have no inclination or desire to correct those assumptions, since they will probably be amended or deleted. This is the last post I will make anywhere on Wikipedia - but please do not think I harbour any bitterness; it is not our way. I wish you all long, prosperous and fulfilled lives. May God bless you all. Shalom and farewell to you all. Shmu'el ben Naftali, 20:58 13 July 2005 GMT</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not an individual's vanity fantasy. If the movement actually exists and uses this title, it belongs at Wikipedia, no matter how much we may disapprove of them.

<dd>Please don't confuse my calling the "Nazarene Karaites" stuff "rubbish" with my comments regarding the so-called Talmidi Jews. The Nazarene Karaites stuff was similar to this stuff, but <i>completely</i> unverifiable, since no such group ever existed except as a single person's concept, relayed through 2 other people into a WP article. Literally, "from my mind to another person's WP article". This group at least happens to exist. Be that as it may, however, the group is <i>not</i> noteworthy, for a number of reasons, including:
<ol>
<li>Their approach to scripture is not innovative</li>
<li>Their membership is miniscule</li>
<li>They're brand new</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>etc. As a little test (perhaps someone should take this up as a project somewhere), they have fewer than 1000 adherents and they're historically non-notable. Take the Samaritans on the other hand. There are only perhaps as many as 500 of them, but their sect has been around for 2500 years. There are whole libraries of material written about them, and museums dedicated to them. They're noteworthy. As of yet, these "Talmidi Jews" are not sufficiently notable <i>to warrant a Wikipedia article</i>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 20:34, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The Talmidi approach to scripture is not innovative. It is based on Ebionite traditions going back to the 1st century. That relates back to my earlier point about why the article was contributed. It seems to me that the criteria for being "noteworthy" is highly POV here. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 21:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sect is still small, that is true enough. Maybe you can relate to what it's like to be a despised minority. Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about the group is that modern-day Ebionites are finally standing up to discrimination. This article is the proof. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 13:33, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who despises or discriminates against these people? This article is not proof that anyone is "standing up", the more I look into it, the more it appears to be little more than sheer conjecture. There <i>are</i>, to be sure, modern groups of Ebionites, but no evidence that there exists any "loose grouping" called Talmidaism, nor "Talmidi Jews" as the article was first named. Please review <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">what wikipedia is <i>not</i></a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 19:48, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Articles should be evaluated for their merit individually, and some discussion is warranted before a decision is made to delete them. This smacks of some kind of polemic against the contributing author or the group. Jayjg's issues with the group can be found on the Talmidaism talk page along with my replies. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 21:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, VFD is seeking community consensus. It can be taken out at any time on any article (unless obviously frivolous). Go VFD some of Jayjg and my contributions, and see how you fare. The fact is that Wikipedia is not the place to describe a tiny group of people endeavouring to live by a what they think authentic philosophy unless it has some form of notability. This seems to be lacking. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 00:27, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

If you look at <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a>'s edits, you can see a clear pattern of revisionist history through the deleting and reverting of articles.

<li>I see. So you want verification of the existence of Talmidi and, if they exist, you want verification that they practice their religion in the way that the article claims. That should be easy enough to verify. There are three links to Talmidi sites on the bottom of the article:</li>

<dd>No, of course not. Anyone can put up a website claiming anything. The key here is to have independent confirmation of these claims, so that they can be verified. The fact that the two individuals who created this religion, and the articles on Wikipedia about it, and their webpage, will be willing to e-mail you back saying "yes, it's all true" is not verification. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your suppositions about my motivations for nominating the article are, in fact, both a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a> and entirely irrelevant. I have no issue with the POV of this article; it seems written in a reasonably NPOV way, in that it attributes all beliefs to those who hold them. However, the majority of the article appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, that is, proposing a novel view of history. The other problem with it is that it is not <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. Original research and unverifiable material are not "information", they are theory and rumour, and removing them is not "censorship", but rather is <b>Wikipedia policy</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:34, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You seem to be negating yourself, Jayjg. If the article is "written in a reasonably NPOV way," why did you claim in your introduction that "most of the article is a POV re-write of Christian history?" When it comes to religion, it's kind of hard to verify your material. The only difference I can see between this article and the one on your religion is the popularity of the sect. --<a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephram_Stark_ae5d.html" title="User:Zephram Stark">Zephram Stark</a> 21:08, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's not a contradiction at all - the problem with the POV is not that it violates NPOV, but rather that it violates NOR. That is, the article itself admits its a POV re-write of Christian history, and since it cites that, it does not fall afoul of the NPOV policy. The problem is, the vast majority of it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, written by the article author. As to your other point, I'm not sure what you mean when you say "<i>your religion</i>", but as I said above, it's easy enough to verify that most religions exist, have a history, believe the things they say they do, are organized in a certain way, use specific holy books, have various rites, etc. from credible sources. You can't do that here, because there are no verifiable sources on this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My name is Shemayah Phillips (Ebionite COmmunity) and I'd like to say that "Talmidaism" is not a large phenomenon, and a splinter group from my own. An addition to the Ebionite wiki page might be enough with a link. But I wish some more time was spent, and had been sent doing more research on both ancient and modern Yeshuine groups, and a more honest analysis of ancient Judaisms. Yes, JudaismS. Talmidaism should be mentioned for the simple reason that is part of a growing attitude taking place among people of Jewish background (often removed by generations due to forced baptism, cultural pressures, persecution, etc.) who are rediscovering their family's past (as I have, and many of the Ebionites, including many of Latin America of Marrano and Crypto-Jewish families). Additionally, gentiles are also seeking conversion to some form of Yahwism. Gentiles have always done so, even before the predominance of Judah or rabbinic Judaism. Symmachus was a Ebionite convert to Yahwism (since we have to be careful not to use the word Jew when not referring to the modern monopoly on Judaism). Not only this but the same people may be attending rabbinic synagogues, assisting missionized Jews to rejoin rabbinic communities, and various groups who "Judaize." The reason we know so little and must do the research today concerning Yeshuine groups, and Christianity is because of censorship and control of history by single POV people. So the notability of this small group may not be there, but the trend it is a part of certainly is, and Wiki has an opportunity in recording this. How, on what page/article, etc. is the question. Also some comments have been made concerning this group's relationship to "official" Judaism (i.e., Orthodox Judaism whose importance may also be a matter of non-objective POV). I do not know the Talmidi relationship with the Orthodox community other than some mention in these comments about hatred. The Ebionites are not recognized by the Orthodox community---officially. But rabbinic Jews have been present at b'rit milah for Ebionites as witnesses and to read blessings, and even people of Jewish background go through hatafat dam b'rit or milah. Ebionites have been assisted by Chabadniks against Christian missionaries, most recently collaborating in Latin America; Ebionites gladly take the grief from the Christian community for converting Christians to Judaism whether these become Ebionite, Qaraite (Karaite, if you prefer), or rabbinic Jews---while the rabbinic authorities can still maintain dialogue with the Christian community. Muslims have even helped Ebionites in combating Christian missionaries. I do not know how much of this could be true of the Talmidis, but know they take the same view concerning Christian missionaries. Now we are the most extreme of such groups (one missionary group called our site the most blasphemous ---to the Christian view-- on the Internet!&#160;;-)) Add to the phenomenon "Jewish Roots" groups and other Christian and former Christian Judaizing groups. As part of all this, Talmidaism is notable as one of the components. I think the short section on Modern Ebionites in "Ebionites" is appropriate. It says that there are people still practicing a form of Evyonut, and allows them to follow links. Maybe something similar, in an article discussing the modern Judaizing phenomenon would provide notice of Talmidaism, and other similar groups. But it is a disservice to vote them out of existence on Wiki because of more a censorship type response than objective expression. Also there is a problem concerning the difference between Nazarenes and Ebionites. Let me suggest a better way of looking at the problem than calling people Jewish-Christians, etc. Yeshuines (who were not Christians at all) were concerned with the man Yeshua (Jesus) as known from his life example and teaching. Paulines, and related groups like the Gnostics (Paulines or Pneumatics) were/are concerned with the resurrected Jesus (the Risen Christ) as revealed in visions and spiritual/mystical communication to Paul of Tarsus and others. Of course, I think the Pneumatics are full of it---but that doesn't matter because they sincerely believe in these revelations as much as we seek more rationally derived infomation. Ancient Nazarenes came to compromise to certain Pneumatic, Pauline doctrines. Some Ebionite later took up Gnostic/Pneumatic beliefs. I hve an article from a Christian biographical dictionary that makes this distinction (Ebionites Proper vs. Essene type Ebionites) well.</li>

<dd>For whatever it might be worth, I agree with you. There are indeed modern-day followers of the belief system espoused (according to Christian polemicists, at the very least) by the 3rd and early 4th-century Ebionites. This is a noteworthy phenomenon <i>in the context of the Ebionites article</i>. The terms "Talmidi Judaism" and "Talmidaism", however, have never, as far as I can find, ever been applied to such groups, collectively or otherwise, except for by one specific group of claimants to this tradition, who use the term gratuitously to describe everyone with whom they think they agree on theological and eschatological issues. Such sheer conjecture is <i>not</i> encyclopedic, hence my opposition to the continued inclusion of this article in WP. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 07:44, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This label was created by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> because he could not bear to use the terms Talmidi Judaism and Talmidi Jews. I let it stand as a compromise with him in the course of editing the article. It's all explained on the Talk page. As far as the origin of the term Talmidi, it's a modern designation. It's inception and purpose are also explained on the Talk page, as an umbrella term to include more Yahwistic groups than the Ebionites. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 13:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b>The ebionites really did exist. Why would you want to do away with the truth that the Ebionites were Jews not worshippers of Jesus? The early church fathers speak of them and in a quite negative way. My guess is that the church attempted to erase them from history being that their writings no longer exist. What little we know about the movement 2000 years ago shows that they didn't accept the virgin birth, trinity, or the writings of Paul. Early followers of Yahshua were Jews. They weren't looking for a new religion but reform within their own. Any true studier of the scriptures will eventually come to realize that most of the church doctrines are nothing more than tales of pagan dieties transferred over to a man named Jesus/Yahshua. Those that birthed the religion known as Christianity voted these pagan stories in example: Council of Nicea. Gentiles find themselves extracted from the churches as they begin to question as they learn. This is a great article to show them that they are not the only ones out there. Many go on to convert to Judaism or to be Noachides. I think it would be ashame for this article to be removed. Bethany

<li><b>KEEP.</b> Bethany is an Ebionite from our group. She is giving her two cents, which looks to be one cent more than some. I think some editors take themselves a little too seriously. The one notable difference is from a few (Loremaster, Wetman?) who recognize that an attempt should be made to chronicle rather than suppress things they may not understand or have the scholarly background to tackle--like some of the Users. I vote Keep to make a point that some folks voting Delete are fabricating excuses based on something other than editorial issues. Also it is apparent to me that while a good number of written sources Ebionites were consulted, contemporary information was not checked. I had to make corrections as to the year we started, and a claim that I was a Baptist minister (!!!! Never&#160;!!!!) and this incorrect information is still mirrored and cached all over the internet. The way to improve Wiki is to research the information from actual living sources, rather than delete everything outside your experience. Loremaster (if he is responsible for Ebionites) took corrections I placed, while I tried not to place an ad, and presented them in a responsible way. I think something can be learned. What the hell is a sockpuppet? Sounds like adolescent slang for something derrogatory.

I am a member, but joined only to make a correction concerning the Baptist minister matter.
