<li>The trouble is that if keepers <i>stop</i> voting "keep", and deleters <i>keep</i> voting "delete", the school article gets deleted, and the keepers won't like that. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 06:38, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It exists now. Therefore, it takes a consensus to delete. Having reflex "keep" votes (a big, persistent criticism that "particular school particular vote" folks like me have) and then taunts that everyone must stop voting delete until the golden dawn really doesn't help. There is no consensus on keeping, none on deleting, but the delete folks, so far as I've seen, haven't been targeting other Wikipedians for abuse nor running pages to marshal -bot like votes. (And I figure that I would have been called if there were such a thing, since I vote delete on most schools because most anything isn't notable.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:53, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>:Schoolwatch is vote-neutral. It only tells you if a vote for deletion is on, and which article that vote is on. It doesn't tell you how to vote. "No consensus on keeping" is a straw man; outside speedies, no article needs consensus to keep. Actually a lot of people seem to think that schools are intrinsically encyclopedic (an opinion that I share), hence the consistency of recent school VfDs in opposing deletion of schools--indeed in most cases returning a majority vote for keep. The deletion of any school article seems to be becoming a minority position. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:20, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch</a> states that it <i>[...] is a campaign to ensure that articles on schools are allowed to develop on Wikipedia</i>. Is that "vote-neutral"?--<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 15:43, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, in the manner in which it is executed, the Schoolwatch page is vote-neutral. Anybody can pop it onto his watchlist and vote according to his preferences. The fact that people interested in preserving schools from arbitrary deletion act as if this kind of publicity will attract more keep votes than delete votes suggests that they believe that in general school articles on Wikipedia are fairly popular. This belief seems to be born out by events; as schoolwatch has been used more so the proportion of people voting "keep" on school VfDs has grown, to the point where now it quite often exceeds those voting delete--an unusual event on VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:56, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some 64 school-related deletion listings started so far this month have been closed, and all the data was kept. A school playing field was merged with redirect to the associated school article, two listings were withdrawn by their nominators, and the remaining 61 articles were kept. Articles listed for deletion included three about middle schools and one about a primary school. The rest were presumably secondary or high schools. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:58, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Nominated: 75; kept: 65; redirected (merged): 1; withdrawn: 2; pending: 7</b></dd>

</dd>
<dd>The pending nominations seem to my eye to all have overwhelming <i>keep</i> votes, which if true will bring the result of VfD nominations for May to 75 nominations, no deletions, and just one merge and redirect (which doesn't require a VfD decision). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:24, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not sure what your point is. I will continue to vote for deletion of high school articles as a matter of principle. Just as there are notable people, there are notable schools.

<li>I just want to remind everyone that non-notability is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">criterion</a> for deletion because notability cannot be wholly separated from subjectivity. Non-notability should be a minor factor in the decision against an article, not the whole case. <b>Keep</b> because this battle against schoolcruft cannot be won. You people who nominate these articles for deletion must realize that for every school you nominate, two thousand 14 year olds are hammering away at their keyboards about their own local school.
