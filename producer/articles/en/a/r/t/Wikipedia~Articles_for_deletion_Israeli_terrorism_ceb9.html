Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page. The result of the debate was <b>No Consensus</b> default to <b>Keep.</b> I count 33 Keep, 28 Delete, and 3 Merge (counting "rename" as a vote to keep, since we can't delete &amp; rename), which is roughly 44% Delete, 51% Keep, 5% merge; soundly <b>No Consensus.</b> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 01:18, August 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A slight recount, as it appears the number of votes was a bit off: I see 30 Keeps and 30 Deletes. (The nominator's vote, even if the identity is in question, should be counted as a delete). Reviewing the "rename" votes appears that they are likewise split: there are 5 "Keep, but rename" (counted as Keeps), and 3 Rename <b>OR</b> Merge-- which should default to merge, rather than "keep" -- since we can't, as you say, keep &amp; merge. Plus, there are 3 clear "Merge with State Terrorism." (1 vote to delete the "troll nominator" was not counted either way). My feeling is that in this instance, Merge votes should be considered a special form of "delete"-- with a request to removing the separate article, and combine the factual info into another one. Thus, they should not be counted against "Delete" in the final tally. Thus, it's pretty much 50/50. Still a No Consensus, of course-- which is just why VfDs will continue to be problematic. --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 06:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This one was a difficult one to close. I considered leaving it alone, but it was the last one in the archive, so I decided to suck it up and close it. I used a pencil &amp; paper to tally votes, but I'm not suprised I missed some; it was just so blasted confusing. Anyhow, no consensus seems to be the right call. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 07:53, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Pardon me for having to edit this already existant VfD page, I do not happen to know how to archive this previous VfD page. I bring this page to a VfD delete for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel it is inherently biased</li>
<li>A page of this manner already exists dealing with Israeli state terrorism and this should be merged there AT THE MOST</li>
<li>This page could easily be renamed Jewish Terrorism as that it what it deals with and such a page is inherently biased as it attacks Jews</li>
<li>This page has been heavily edited by known anti-Semitic and anti-Caucasian racists [personal attack removed] ... and despite popular concensus in the real world that accusations against Israel are laughable, these claims have been allowed to remain on Wikipedia</li>
<li>The last time it was brought to VfD vote, there was not really a true concensus met and there should be a revote. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 00:50, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have concerns about the nominator and whether this is a good-faith nomination. I also want to distance myself from his comments about Mustafaa. Nevertheless, the page should be deleted because it's a POV personal essay. It doesn't define terrorism, it's unencyclopedic with no sources, and it has no chance of becoming encyclopedic, because there are no reputable or scholarly sources who would agree that the incidents listed are examples of terrorism. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:40, July 30, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Brother, I assure you my nomination is completely in good faith, I merely seek to rid the world of the sick propaganda that the Socialist Establishment espouses, namely articles such as this one. My comments about "Mustafaa" were not meant as a personal attack and I am sorry if they have been interpreted in such manner, however I do not rescind my statements one bit. I beleive it has been established time and time again on wikipedia that Mustafaa is biased against Whites and Jews and anyone who is proud of their Whiteness and adherance to Judaism. Do I even need to point further than to the Islamic-Arab allusion his username alludes to than to prove that he is a Socialist Racist? But thank you for backing me up, I wish I could state myself so eloquently as you but yes, this article is very POV and has ZERO encyclopedic content. -<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 02:53, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This page needs cleanup , and definetly needs sourcing; but it does discuss a a very real issue in our world. Though as it stands it is a poor article.

<li>Barring the nominator's user name, I think the article should be kept, but a rename sounds good. The word "terrorist" by itself is breaking NPOV - what you might call a terrorist, I or others will call them freedom fighters, or vice versa. The new title, IMHO, should be Violence committed by Israel. Plus, it could be hard to merge this article into State terrorism, since some of the acts committed by Israelis were not under the direction of the Israeli Government or, as pointed out, retaliation against attacks from the groups residing in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a>. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 07:57, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. We can't delete articles just because someone doesn't like them. The article is perfectly NPOV and represents all points of view fairly.

<li>While I agree with Slim and Jayig; I think its worht noting that perhaps this article is talking about the wrong things. You have to look at the fact that Israel in the not so didtant past sanctioned torture. Beond that, Israeli Tarrorim has a phenomenon is worht mention; that is simply because it exsists in a good portion of people's minds in our world, in needs to be adressed. I think this page addresses it in entirely the worng way. Rahter we should be looking at how and why people came to look at Israeli actions as terrorism in the first place, who those people are and why they came to their conclusions. --<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouieS_5c23.html" title="User:LouieS">LouieS</a> 14:07, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Louie, fairies exist in the minds of lots of people in the world, but that doesn't make them real. Our policies say we should cite the views of published majority- and significant-minority opinion (not tiny-minority opinion). When I last looked, not a single source was cited, so the article as it stands violates our content policies, and were it to be cleaned up to be in accordance with them, much of its current content would have to be deleted. The point is that it's unfair to single Israel out when there's no article on British terrorism, French terrorism, Italian terrorism, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:28, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not a proponent of the singling out either. I think the solution here is to extend the information relating to other examples of state terrorism. Surely, this would help put things into perspective. This can start by extending the country sections of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> article -- if a country's section becomes large, a new article should be created. I think the "don't single anyone out" argument should always be dealt with by extending the information that we represent rather than removing information. Should we not have created an article on Windows until we have Linux? The detractors can add balance by adding information rather than removing it.</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: First off this is TelAvivKid/ProudWHITEIsraeli, I had to make this account because once again my account was banned (read: censored). This account will probably be banned soon too since SlimVirgin said I can't return until I "prove I am not Alberinu". Right. Well that should be easy&#160;:-/. No worries though, I was just on a friends account reading this and decided to answer some questions, Ill probably stop editing after this. First off I am not Alberuni, I dont even know who that is, but if hes anti-Semitic then he deserves to be banned or whatever. For you nosy Commie bastards that want to know more about me, I am in my 20s originally from Tel-Aviv, now living in the United States, HAPPY? I started reading Wiki about 2 months ago and have been especially reading this page until I decided to stand up for Jews everywhere and VfD this POS. I'd just like to say all you a-holes who have accused me of racism while being blind to your own hatred of the White Race, you are truly HYPOCRITES. How come I dont see any articles about how the damn Mexicans are terrorizing the US by coming over here ILLEGALY and lowering our standard of living? How come I dont see any articles on how East Asians are increasinly taking over Slavic lands in Asia ILLEGALLY and IMMORRALY? Huh?
