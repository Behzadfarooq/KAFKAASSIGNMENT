<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>merge all</b> to their respective locales. I'd like to note that the contention that a WikiProject and not this AfD should decide this issue is contrary to both <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>, which characterises AfD as a <i>public</i> debate. On the other hand, most of those that support deletion seem not to mind a merger very much, so that's probably the most consensual outcome.</p>
<p>As is usual with mass AfDs, yours truly is kindly requesting the community to carry out the decision - i.e., merge the content and turn the article into a redirect. Please link to this AfD in the redirect edit summary and leave the AfD tags on until the merge/redirect is done.

<li><b>Merge</b> all. I do not see any point in someone taking an online database and creating an article for each entry. It would be better for a user to look at the source database, which is likely to have more up to date info. Will someone make it his job to update these 3 sentence articles when the library's collection of circulation stats change? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>. If we leave out the information on circulation and number of cardholders, all that is left to merge is the name of the library and a link to its website. Is that worth merging? I think it is fair to assume that just about every locality of substantial size in America has a public library; what would be notable would be if one <i>didn't</i>. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 15:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge all</b> into their respective communities' articles.

<li><b>Keep and allow the Project team to decide</b> - As this is a part of WikiProject Ohio, I would STRONGLY suggest that the folks from that project team be made aware of this deletion effort ASAP, and do not take any action until that project team has a chance to thoroughly discuss this. Deleting stuff that is maintained by a project team without their consent is against the spirit of these teams. Outsiders' opinions are fine, but let the team do its job. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Mingus_78b1.html" title="User:Scott Mingus">Scott Mingus</a> 17:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly agree that in matters that involve a significant amount of special expertise, the team involved should be consulted and have a large say (although perhaps not the final word). In this case, I think that most of us possess the knowledge to evaluate the notabiility of stub articles about small to medium-sized library systems. I think it would also be different if the articles were brand new, but they are mostly at least a month old, as I remember, and some older - the team must have been aware of them, since they are tagged as part of the project, and chose to leave them in place. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge all</b> per Shimeru. Is there really anything more than a sentence or two about any of these? As an alternative (or in addition to) merging into each locale's page, could merge all into Ohio Public Libraries. A unified article covering them all might be a viable article...more useful ("where are the libraries?" instead of "tell me about a library if I know which one I want (by name, not location!)"). And would provide more likely notability and opportunity for content beyond a mere directory listing (history of libraries in the state, interesting/unique policies, features or collections, etc). <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 17:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I would object to a "list of Ohio public libraries" article - to me, a list of non-notable things is almost as bad as individual articles. Wikipedia is not a directory. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but such an article could be more than a list. Presuming reliable independent sources are found, a discussion of the state library system including (and not limited to) a list would be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:24, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My impression of how libraries are organized is that most areas started with local libraries, and only much later developed regional and state systems - and often only to provide services such as inter-library loan. You could certainly talk about the history of libraries in a particular state, but there would be a lot of broad generalizations, and discussing them as a 'system' might be rather stretching it. Nine tenths of the funding, control, and activity is still on the local level. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep and allow the Project team to decide</b>- I say let the WikiProject Ohio team decide how to handle this. They may opt for a more consolidated article or merging the article with an article about the location the library is in. That aside, the WikiProject Ohio team <i>did</i> request that this article (and several others) be written, so obviously not everyone views this as "non-notable." I would prefer to see the articles remain and expanded with more history and background. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRidinger_3a67.html" title="User:JonRidinger">JonRidinger</a> 01:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>, this is a perfect example of a correct mass nomination (very similar articles about very similar subjects), so no need to make individual AfD's. No indication of notability as would be indicated by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources. I don't mind if this is made by an individual editor or by the members of a project: while the project members are perfectly free to defend the articles by showing that they are notable by providing us good sources to indicate that these libraries have any distinguishing features beyond existing, there is no reason to keep articles only because they are made by the members of a project. On the contarry, they may well lack the impartiality and distance needed to look at these articles and subjects on an AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being a stub is not a reason for deletion. Every library is unique, and the fact that published references are missing from these articles does not mean that such references do not exist. Libraries often have collections about their communities or specific topics which are not duplicated elsewhere, such as Mount Allison University's collection of 19th-century and early 20th-century high school trigonometry textbooks, or the Toronto Reference Library's impressive Sherlock Holmes collection. In some cases, such a collection was built by a private collector and was later donated or bequeathed to the library, and bears the donor's name.

</ul>
<p>In general, I think that Wikipedia deletion process throws away a lot of good, or at least salvageable, articles, and that the damage to the encyclopedia and to the morale of individual editors caused mass deletions does outweighs any benefit. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:06, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge all</b> for this and similar, though there will be a few about which assertations of notability can be made, the better precedent is to merge unless others appropriate.

<dd>Wrong on both accounts: mass nominations are accepted standard procedure, and a project doesn't decide which articles are kept and which deleted (although their input as to why they feel any particular article should be kept can of course be valuable). So, do you have anything to say about these articles, or can your opinion (and all similar ones) be ignored as not discussing the merits of the articles wrt policies and guidelines? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
