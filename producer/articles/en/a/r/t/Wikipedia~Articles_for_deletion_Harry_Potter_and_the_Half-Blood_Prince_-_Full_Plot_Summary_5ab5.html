<li><b>Strong keep</b> The controversy over the attempt to prevent Canadian purchasers of the book from reading their own books, and the resulting protest by way of posting the plot on the internet, is of legitimate interest as a recent event which deserves historical preservation in this encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete:</b> Very useful? The plot summary on the main page for Half-Blood Prince is very useful. This is just over-indulgence. And I'm not at all certain that placing nearly the entire contents of the story in an article is kosher with regards to copyright laws. If it's useful like you say, its only use would be to make reading the book unnecessary.

<p>I'd like to point out that people aren't voting according to the rules. What we <i>should</i> be voting on is whether or not this is encyclopaedic and belongs on Wikidedia. In my view, it doesn't fit either requirement. There's no precedent on Wikipedia for this type of super-detailed, chapter-by-chapter synopsis and it just goes overboard in my opinion. If you can't afford to buy the book, you can borrow it from a library or a friend or wait until the movie comes out on TV. Wikipedia is not here to provide free e-books. My vote is to <b>delete</b> with prejudice--meaning that we don't want to set a precedent here; the brief overviews/synopses we have for other major works (including The Satanic Verses, Huck Finn, Pride and Prejudice, and even the other Harry books) are plenty. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 16:03, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Tentative Keep</b> <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> raises legitimate points. If the chapter by chapter plot summary can be argued to remain on Wikipedia then by all means remain. Personal opinion though, I find it extremely useful to find what each chapter is about, a sort of... table of contents if you will. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaultran_7df9.html" title="User:Paultran">takagawa-kun</a> 19:27, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539 (1985), the use of less than 400 words from President Ford's memoir by a news magazine was interpreted as infringement because those few words represented "the heart of the book" and were, as such, substantial." <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 23:46, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>How about this: in <b>Twin Peaks Productions v.

The conclusion of the court? "A detailed summary of plot constitutes an abridgment that exceeds what is required to serve any legitimate purpose".

<dd>I've voted, however I would like to second the above. Voting should never take priority over the legal status of WP, and if the Board feels that this article constitutes a copyvio sufficient to initiate legal action, then it should be removed post-haste.

<dd>Thirded. If this is a copyvio, Harry Potter is such a vast money-making empire that I have a suspicion we could be at great risk of a lawsuit.

<dd>I agree with this. Usually, Wikipedia errs on the side of caution (we're not permitted to use logos of other encyclopedias anywhere on the 'pedia, even if they <i>do</i> constitute fair use) because no one wants a costly lawsuit that could shut the entire project down.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Highly informative. The potential for copyvio should be investigated but it seems similar to many other plot summary articles on WP.

<ul>
<li>Yes, <b>but is it encyclopedic?</b> THAT is the question this Vfd was to answer. Summaries as part of an (encyclopedic) article are fine, but when the summary stands on its own is it still part of the encyclopedia ideal? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 12:34, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this VfD is asking more questions than just "is it encyclopedic?", most deleters seem to be arguing it's a copyvio. I believe the full plot summary was moved to its own article so the main article would have as few spoilers as possible and also for size considerations. In my interpretation, the size of a plot summary is likely to be in direct proportion to both the size of the book/thing being summarized and the hype surrounding a release. They key word in most definitions of the word "encyclopedia" I've seen is "comprehensive", though I am all for succinct summarization at a language level generally but in this case I think everything included is relevant. Feel free to clean it up without removing clarity yourself. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 12:55, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Don't be sarcastic. That Wikipedians are not lawyers is not a good enough reason to forestall a pending lawsuit.

<ul>
<li>I suggested an investigation should be undertaken, if it is determined by someone official that the plot summary content should be removed then someone official should remove it regardless of this vote. But until then, legal considerations that don't fit within a defined area of wikipedia policy are orthogonal from a standard vote for deletion and discussion of the issues by the wikipedia community. Have Harry Potter publishers actually threatened a lawsuit? Would some consideration of the merits, rather than just the threat, of a lawsuit be undertaken prior to the removal of any content? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 14:08, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your suggestions are already being undertaken. And yes, if the Board intervenes then this VfD becomes unnecessary. But until then, please stick to explaining <i>why</i> this article ought to be left alone instead of taunting other Wikipedians about their legal concerns. How is a chapter-by-chapter summary "more relevant" than a shorter summary?

<ul>
<li>Ok good, I thought for a minute you were saying voting and discussion should cease here because the Board of Directors has been summoned. Anyway, isn't the burden of proof on the pro delete crowd to prove (or for the b.o.d to determine) that the article is unworthy of wikipedia since it doesn't obviously violate any wikipedia policies? The chapter by chapter summary seems to be relevant to the overall plot of what happens in a lengthy book, though regardless I fail to see how excessive summary length means we should delete it (or drastically reduce it after merging back). Putting full plot summary details in its own article for the purpose of keeping spoilers separate was a good idea. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:25, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I'd say that is way fewer spoilers, though it does give away the big kahuna spoiler. I may be wrong but I think at one point all spoilers were moved to the full plot summary article, size was obviously a concern too. The spoilers in H. B. P. probably should be moved to the bottom of that article to keep them as separate as possible.

<li><b>Strong Keep and Condense</b>: While I don't see this as a copyright infringement, it is longer than the length for articles regulate and should be shorten and possibly renamed. It is not a substitute for the book itself but it is immensely helpful for those who wish to be informed on the major plot points. It is rather a bit longer than other summaries for each book. While I would like the other summaries lengthened, this one has not only the major plot points but some of the minor plot points as well. It should be condensed by at least 3 page lengths especially when other books in the series which are much longer and not nearly this well expanded on. It should be proportionate to the size of the original condensing to approximately 2-5% of the original book length and 5-10% but not to exceed 15 pages printed materials in regular Times New Roman 12pt font if not newly released.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no reason that a plot summary cannot be as long as the contributors wish to make it. The amount of interest in this book certainly justifies a longer article.

<li>You don't need a super-long summary to point it out.

<li>The chapter by chapter organization seems to make it easier for the entire community to participate in the summarization process.

<li>That seems way too short to me, that isn't a summary, not enough core context, it basically just gives away the ending. The HP phenomenon seems to be about the overall story of what happens, and what happens to the characters, rather than just the ending of each book. Also, summarizes should probably be in some proportion to the size of the book being summarized and HP books are actually quite lengthy. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 12:26, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, and the link touts it as a substitute for the book itself ("The whole plot is now summarized in a Wikipedia page. If you feel you simply have to know what happens in the book, you can read that, instead of buying the book.")

<dd>Tl n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius' summary is a detailed <i>analysis</i> of the themes and topics involved, not a chronological detailing of events. Atlas Shrugged has no plot summary on Wikipedia, only character, place, theme, etc. analysis. I agree that there is probably considerably more written in Wikipedia on Atlas Shrugged than Harry Potter, but it is in-depth, not merely a recounting of events. The Bible is the most influential book ever written, and as such it receives a special status. In some instances I think the Bible articles could be trimmed down, anyway. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy summaries are miniscule in comparison to this one. The opening volume of the series is summarized by a mere 290 words, even shorter than the "short" summary at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Blood_Prince_231d.html" title="Half-Blood Prince">Half-Blood Prince</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">James</a> 04:10, July 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So you're saying that you would like this article to be less summary and more analysis, but such things are generally encyclopedic? Great! I look forward to seeing your improvements. There have been many calls for condensation in any case, but that should be discussed somewhere other than VfD. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesteve_4de4.html" title="User:Thesteve"><font style="background: darkblue" color="#FFFFFF">&#160;T</font><font style="background: #0000AA" color="#FFFFFF">h</font><font style="background: #0000CD" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font><font style="background: blue" color="#FFFFFF">St</font><font style="background: royalblue" color="#FFFFFF">ev</font><font style="background: #6666FF" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font></a> 04:21, July 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>delete-temporaily</b> Considering the popularity of the book, at least give a month breathing time so others can spend the time reading the book without giving away any pertanent information.</li>
<li>I disagree with the copyright arguments. It is legal to photocopy 25% of a work and this article sumarizes the plot in much less space than 25% of the book. Furthermore, I disagree with the non-encyclopedic nature of this article arguments. I beleive that the mere fact that the article exists is an interesting social commentary in and of itself and highly academically useful. I believe that BOTH the article and the discussion should be saved indefinately. Moreover, as Wikipedia is an opt-in set up (that is people have intentionally choose to access information from the site) I don't believe it harms anyone who wishes to read the full text of the story themselves. Rather, people can exercise their own disciple and choose not to read this article. That is what the spoiler warning at the top is for. I vote KEEP and ARCHIVE Forever (and link to this discussion) SkyJamer</li>
<li>It is most certainly NOT legal to photocopy 25% of a copyrighted work that is in print. There is no hard and fast guideline, but most publishers will not allow more than 10-15% of an in-print work to be reprinted even if you were to pay them royalties; printing even that much without even asking for permission would almost certainly be seen as a copyright violation. Copyright law, including what does and does not constitute fair use, is an extremely complex subject, and cannot be summarized by blanket statements like "you can reprint this percent without permission".

<p>On a lighter note, many people have expressed a desire to delete the page because it is too long, and is currently up to 52K. However, when you add up the size of its VFD page plus its talk page, the size is now 78K. Remarkably, though, the discussion has been mostly civil, and with very little vandalism.
