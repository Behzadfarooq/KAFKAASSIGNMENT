<p>The Thousand Day War was a civil war in Colombia from 1899 to 1903. It caused extensive damage to the country, took 100,000 lives and resulted in the separation of Panama. In a way, it was a continuation of the civil wars being carried out before it.</p>
<p>The liberals attempted a revolution in July 1899, mainly because the conservative government had excluded them from the government. This was added to the fact that liberal coffee plantation owners were going bankrupt and that the conservatives introduced unbacked paper money in Colombia, inflating the peso. Most of the war was a guerilla war in the towns and the countryside of Colombia. The conservatives, unable to calm the state of unrest in the countryside, and the liberals, having devastated their armies in the war, signed a peace treaty aboard a USS Ship in the caribbean coast of Colombia.</p>
<p>Since I know little about US intervention, I left it out, although for whoever decides to write about this war, the US intervention should be an issue touched in this article should be in it.</p>

<p>The Day id Done, by Lester del Rey, is widely regarded to be one of his finest works of short science-fiction. It is the story of one of the last Neanderthals as he struggles surronded by the intellectually superior Homo Sapiens. Most think of it as the best example of identifiable "prehistoric" science-fiction. Indeed, it is so emotionally powerful that it caused Isaac Asimov (one of the big three) to break down in tears on a subway while reading it. He told Lester that this was of course due to the horrible writing, but privately he said it was one of the most moving stories he had ever read.</p>

<li><b>Free Electricity Contest</b>: A science contest challenged scientists to invent a generator that makes zero cost electricity. If invented, it would lower the cost of living and thus reduce poverty worldwide. The contest was open to everyone and was reported by the news. Geniuses Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein joined the contest. Einstein won the contest with his invention nuclear power. Tesla invented electricity-based motors related to his Dynamo Electric Machine and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wardenclyffe_Tower_6686.html" title="Wardenclyffe Tower">Wardenclyffe Tower</a>. Some believe that Tesla should have won the contest, because people today pay an electric bill to nuclear power plants. In Einstein's time, nuclear power was thought to be zero cost. Also, Einstein had only a formula then, and no working machine, whereas Tesla had working machines. Tesla's power was also non-polluting, whereas nuclear plants make nuclear waste byproduct. Some believe the electric companies wanted people to continue paying electric bills, so they favored Einstein's formula, which was years before it would become a real machine.</li>

<p>Tesla theorized about, planned to build, or claimed to invent the following inventions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Electric Submarine</b></li>
<li><b>Wireless Torpedo</b>: Based on his patent 613,809 for "teleautomation", Tesla hoped to develop the "wireless torpedo" into an automated weapon system for the US Navy.</li>
<li><b>Ozone Generator</b></li>
<li><b>Wireless Transmission of Electricity</b>: electricity transmitted from power stations and received by antennas on houses and electric cars</li>
<li><b>Teleforce/Death Ray</b>: a destructive energy transmitter he claimed to have built <i>"when unavoidble... may be used to destroy property and life."</i>--- Nikola Telsa, 1915. He was believed to be working on a form of death ray at the time of his death. He offered the US War Department the secrets of his "teleforce" weapon on January 5, 1943 but was assumed to be crazy. He was found dead 3 days later and, after the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were declared to be top secret. It appears that his proposed death ray was related to his research into ball lightning and plasma.</li>
<li><b>Mechanical Oscillator</b>: compresses air until the air is a liquid</li>
<li><b>Free Energy</b>: $0 electricity and $0 heat tapped from the earth's natural electricity (not energy created from nothing)</li>
<li><b>War Robots</b>: Tesla envisioned wars of machines, not of human soldiers. He made the first of a race of robots which could carry out combat maneuvers. These weapons' destructive actions and ranges would have virtually no limit, he believed.</li>
<li><b>Earthquake Machine</b>: a pocket-sized device that could shake a building apart by piling up waves of energy</li>
<li><b>Tesla Shield</b>: a theorized electromagnetic shell which armaments could not penetrate. It was a magnetic field dome made of energy that will eventually be built big enough to protect a city from attack during wars. Tesla shields would transmit electrical energy without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance. Today, the beginnings of force field technology is being built and tested using <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_%28physics%29.html" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>. Currently, it is successful in repelling electromagnetic waves only.</li>
<li><b>Anti-Gravity Aircraft</b>: gravo-electric aircraft</li>
<li><b>Thought Camera</b>: In 1933, Tesla theorized about a device that could photograph thoughts. <i>"I expect to photograph thoughts...In 1893, while engaged in certain investigations, I became convinced that a definite image formed in thought, must by reflex action, produce a corresponding image on the retina, which might be read by a suitable apparatus. This brought me to my system of television which I announced at that time..."</i></li>
<li><b>Planet Machines</b>: Tesla theorized about energy from the planets' rotation. <i>"One day man will connect his apparatus to the very wheelwork of the universe... and the very forces that motivate the planets in their orbits and cause them to rotate will rotate his own machinary,"</i> predicted Nikola Tesla.</li>

<p>Over the past 27 years that he has been involved with powerlifting, he acquired a vast amount of knowledge on how to produce strength. He has devoted his life to developing innovative techniques, programs, and equipment. Experience with several different training methods has given Lou somewhat of an expertise in strength training. This knowledge has led him to produce twenty-five World and National Champion Powerlifters, twenty-seven lifters who have totaled over 2000 pounds, and a World Record holder in the 400-meter dash.</p>
<p>Lou has, for many years, been a contributing writer for the monthly publication, Powerlifting, USA. He, also, writes instructional articles, gives seminars across the country, makes training videos, and is the owner and trainer of Westside Barbell Club located in Columbus, Ohio. Because of these and other activities, he continues to pass on a wealth of valuable knowledge to the next generation of competitive sports men and women.</p>

<p><b>How it All Began</b></p>
<p>Louie’s weight training roots began at the tender age of twelve (12) when he began Olympic lifting. He was first exposed to powerlifting in 1966, at a power meet in Dayton, Ohio. He was amazed by the look of the powerlifters that he saw at the meet. Unlike his previous training partners who had to tell people that they lifted weights, these men were big and strong and it was very obvious that they lifted weights. He never lifted Olympic style again.</p>
<p>After that power meet, Louie went into the Army. After basic training, he was in the infantry but did not go to Vietnam. He was, instead, sent to Berlin. There he was able to train regularly. He found that there wasn’t anyone who knew anything about powerlifting. It was then that he read a powerlifting article about the Westside Barbell Club of Culver City, California. Having nothing to lose, he tried their method of squatting. To his surprise it worked. Having never met them, the guys at that gym got Lou started on the right foot.</p>
<p>After getting out of the Army in 1969, he built a power rack, got some weights and began training full time using what he had learned from Bill West, George Frenn and the guys through the magazine articles. They became, in a sense, his only training partners.</p>
<p>Lou entered his first national meet, the Junior Nationals, in Patterson, NJ, in 1971 and got third. In 1972, he made the top 10 in the Powerlifting News. Lou made his first Elite total in February 1973 when there was no gear used. He got 605 – 380 – 670 and totaled 1655.</p>
<p>As time went on, Lou continued to improve and compete. However, he was plagued by a laundry list of injuries. He has broken his fifth vertebra twice, snapped his left patella tendon in half, and detached his right bicep from the bone to mention a few. Each time he has continued to train and compete doing exceedingly well.</p>
<p><b>What it has Become</b></p>
<p>After Bill West died, Louie referred to his place as Westside Barbell Club, but never publicly until 1986. Now, Westside Barbell Club and Louie Simmons are trademarked names. As a result of Louie’s proven techniques, he is a strength consultant for the Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and numerous college football teams. He is also a strength consultant for many athletes from around the world.</p>
<p>Lou has done a great deal of work with other world-class athletes who are not involved in powerlifting. According to John Saylor, Coach of the US National Judo Training Squad, “in addition to his work with college and professional football teams, he has worked with track and field athletes, mixed martial artist fighters, collegiate wrestlers, and athletes from many other sports. There is nobody who knows more about developing strength, power, and speed for sports in general."</p>
<p>Louie broke his fifth lumbar vertebra and was on crutches for the better part of 10 months. Unable to do any strength building exercises, he came up with the Reverse Hyper. It helped with the pain, first and foremost, and then it repaired his back to its former strength.</p>
<p>As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. The Reverse Hyper is one of the many pieces of equipment that Louie has created. It was patented in 1993 and now holds 3 patents for the three different variations available. The Reverse Hyper is not only a tremendous machine for building lower back, glute and hamstring strength, but is excellent for the rehabilitation and prevention of lower back injuries</p>
<p>The Reverse Hyper is not the only piece of equipment that Lou has patented. There is the Plyo Swing, the Tread Sled, and the Belt Squat Machine. Through his website, <a href="http://www.westside-barbell.com" class="external text" title="http://www.westside-barbell.com" rel="nofollow">Westside Barbell</a> he sells equipment that he personally uses and endorses.</p>
<p>Lou’s goal has always been to share what he has learned with others. And now he can proudly say that several of the men who he has trained are doing the same. At least seven (7) of the guys who have trained with Lou over the years are now doing videos, seminars, and giving advice on website forums and a number of other venues for getting information out to those who need it.</p>

<p>Commonly used expression with no useful true meaning; the 'lowest common factor' in any situation is always one, a trivial result. The user is normally meaning 'highest common factor' but using it in a non-mathematical sense. This probably results from the (non-mathematical) user failing to understand that any common factor must be less than, or at least not greater than, any of the input values. In a non-mathematical sense then the 'highest common factor' must contain all that is common to all the inputs and this seems to be what the user intends.</p>

<p>Ian Knapp is a UK based singer songwriter. The music: raw, melodic, edgy, acoustic rock.</p>
<p><b>Reviews:</b></p>
<p>"Incredible stuff. He's your 'New Favourite Artist'. He's my new favourite artist, I'll tell you that right now......I’m going to play another song from him, 'cos that is just too good."</p>
<p><b>- John Richards, Host of The Morning Show, KEXP, Seattle</b></p>
<p>Included in the Top 30 of 2005: "How does a singer-songwriter become canonized? For some, like Jeff Buckley or Elliott Smith, you have to die way too young. For those that continue to produce music well past what should be their prime, undisputed legends like Bob Dylan, those sages seem to speak to the masses because they are willing to wear their hearts on their sleeves. That emotion, coupled with a keen sense of musicianship and a grasp of the English language, transcends beyond touching just one generation. Simply put, the legends are the poets of our generation. They are our pied pipers and we follow. Maybe it’s too early for me to lump newcomer Ian Knapp in that status but he comes darn close to encapsulating all of the ingredients for future canonization."</p>
<p>"Simply put, Into These Oceans is a fantastic album... The lead track, "If The Aliens Came", is one of the best social commentaries I've heard... [Spaceman] warrants multiple listens and after a relatively rough week at work, it was this song that made me remember why I get up in the morning and bust my butt..."</p>
<p>"That introspection, and how he stirs up our own passions and feelings in the process, is why I believe Ian Knapp has a bright future. And, as long as the earth remains screwed up and in need of repair, Ian will have plenty of material to write about. You can bet that this album will receive my nomination for best album of the year."</p>
<p><b>- Ben Montgomery, CDReviews.com</b></p>
<p>"Ian Knapp is a compelling performer who combines acoustic guitar with potent lyrics about politics and humanity."</p>
<p><b>- M. Myers, KEXP, Seattle</b></p>
<p>"The best of the recent crop of male singer-songwriters to grace the 75orless mailbox, Ian Knapp reminds me of John Wesley Harding. Not his voice, but the sarcastic social commentary laid over a damned catchy acoustic guitar. You can practically hear the curled lip as he sneers at Mr. Mickey Mouse for being "junk food for the soul," or predicts that "If the aliens came... they'd turn 'round their spaceships" because humankind is so retarded. The album ends sweetly, though, with the exquisite "Spaceman," a lovely welcome to a wee baby."</p>
<p><b>- Meredith, 75orless.com</b></p>
<p>"America has its first post-9/11 singer-songwriter; however, he isn’t from the U.S. Nevertheless, no other new guitar-slinging solo artist conveys the troubled state of public consciousness than Englishman Ian Knapp. You can hear it in his voice – stripped of its strength, trembling, questioning. There’s a fire in Knapp’s vocals that is not lit by heartbreak or romance; instead, it percolates from our current fears and disillusionment. Even the title of the album – Into These Oceans – makes one think of drowning, lost in the waters of a world turning upside down. The song itself is about escape, the only solution to these increasingly scary and confusing times."</p>
<p>"Knapp is a fine poet, and as tempting it is for me to quote him here, it’s better to simply trust me and listen to his record cold like I did. He has a way with words that is less common with his nonsensical peers and can be compared to new wave lyricists from the '80s such as Roddy Frame from Aztec Camera or Elvis Costello. The music is mostly folk-oriented with occasional bursts of rock &amp; roll energy, especially on "Jumping the Wall" and "Pieces of You," the latter having a riff reminiscent of Madder Rose’s "Panic On.".... the greatness on display should have industry observers predicting future hits for this man." 4.5/5</p>
<p><b>- Kyrby Raine, Shotgun Reviews</b></p>
<p>"British singer/songwriter Ian Knapp has a love and hate relationship with the human race... the hilariously sarcastic opening track "If the Aliens Came"... [is] a bitingly funny commentary on society's gradual moral decay... [It] combines Elvis Costello's vitriol with Thom Yorke's alienation from the planet Earth. Knapp's voice — raspy, quivering — is effective in its unpolished delivery. Knapp's vocals recall Mike Scott's from the Waterboys except that he isn't aiming for a big sound; instead, Into These Oceans is fairly low-key and intimate. However, that doesn't mean it's mellow. Knapp's influences include Nirvana as well as Bob Dylan, which is why his guitars can be brittle and edgy at times. 'Jumping the Wall' is almost like a parallel world recording wherein Kurt Cobain had lived to produce a solo album." 4/5</p>
<p><b>- Michael Sutton, All Music Guide</b></p>
<p>"Singer-songwriter IAN KNAPP should be raved constantly about in the NME right now. With a voice that erupts in raw passion, Knapp's vocal skills alone is a keen instrument, sharp as saber tooth."</p>
<p>"Winging his way towards political and personal issues, Knapp is definitely in the Bob Dylan mode with a sense of urgency that explodes like a volcano. He's got a deadpan sense of humour that is pointedly funny, reflected in the opening track "If the Aliens Came." Knapp's words are memorable and touch the heart with open hands."</p>
<p>"There's more variety in the music here than you'd think, not everything is strum-strum and even then they're usually toe-tapping riffs. "Into These Oceans," "Pieces of You," and "The Dream" are all standout numbers. Outstanding debut." 10/10</p>
<p><b>- Adam Harrington, Whisperin &amp; Hollerin</b></p>
<p>"Singer/songwriter Ian Knapp's "Into These Oceans" is one of those debut albums that'll be discussed years from now. It's an intense experience, packed with real emotions and smart lyrics - the kind of record that Bob Dylan's son should've recorded. "If the Aliens Came." opens the album on a darkly humorous note, accurately realizing that extraterrestrials would probably depart our beloved planet once they saw how dumb and evil we are. I'm surprised by the wide musical range on this album. I usually fear the 'singer/songwriter' tag as it often means some boring bloke with an acoustic guitar borrowed from his ex-hippie mum. None of that here. This is a shockingly confident and mature first LP." 10/10</p>
<p><b>- Barry Andrews, Reviewcentre.com</b></p>
<p>"London-based singer-songwriter Ian Knapp is armed with equal parts melody and passion. His lyrics are astute and delivered with an urgent, wavering falsetto and his ability to turn a phrase is truly unique. With so many lesser talents being hailed as the new Dylan, Knapp is the only one with the intellect to back it up." Editor's Pick</p>
<p><b>- The Editor, Download.com</b></p>
<p>"Right off the bat as the first song "If the Aliens Came" chimes in and you hear Ian Knapp's vocals you can tell there's something extraordinary happening. It is excruciatingly world-weary, noiselessly angry, and hopeful all at once. When he sings you can forget the meaning of pretension, a word that a horde of wannabes have personified for as long as we've been numbed by them."</p>
<p>"In his hands, the acoustic guitar becomes a bludgeon, an instrument that emits the poignant yearnings of a sad man who threatens to smash it on monstrous faces that make our lives a big lie, fragments of a severed dream. Yet it all swiftly changes into a thing for buoyant times, waving it in the air like a flag after some private conquest."</p>
<p>"Seethe with him on the abovementioned "If the Aliens Came," celebrate "Into These Oceans," fall in love with our children on "Spaceman" [an art that we seem to have forgotten], and drink a couple on "Mouse on A Wheel" and hurl the bottles at the walls besieged by memories that creep from the dusty parts of our minds."</p>
<p>"Knapp is that long-lost prophet drunk on madness, wide-eyed and exhausted. He doesn’t come like a savior, claiming to be this and that, forcing his doctrines down our throats. Ian Knapp is the everyday man who has taken the language of life down to a level that we all can relate to. He makes us forget who he is. In fact, it doesn’t matter at all. What matters are the stories. Nobody ever tells them anymore. He talks about things we have been struggling all our lives to say and makes it sound so effortless. In gratitude we ought to take the cudgels and wave his guitar like a flag after some private conquest, screaming at the sky."</p>
<p><b>- Mondo Castro, Manila Standard, Philippines</b></p>
<p>"...On Jumping the Wall, Knapp uses an electric base to great effect, with a rock-punk run through a song reminiscent of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start The Fire. Elsewhere, as on the title song, this electrified instrumentation takes him nicely close to college-rock icons The Connells. One to watch, as there are signs that more is to come."</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are Tenzin Tsundues out there, men neither craven nor willing to shut up, and unaffected by the demands of 'realpolitik'. Power to your flag and banner, Tenzin. May they fly from a thousand places, unexpectedly." ......</p>
<p>(Dilip D'souza in Mid-Day edition dated May 23, 2005)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tenzin Tsundue is a restless young Tibetan, who after graduating from Madras, South India, braved snowstorms and treacherous mountains, broke all rules and restrictions, crossed the Himalayas on foot and went into forbidden Tibet! The purpose? To see the situation under Chinese occupation for himself and find out if he could lend a hand or two in the freedom struggle. He was arrested by the Chinese border police, and after cooling his feet in prison in Lhasa for three months, was finally pushed back to India.</p>
<p><br />
Born to a Tibetan refugee family who laboured on India's border roads around Manali, North India, during the chaotic era of Tibetan refugee resettlement in the early seventies. Tenzin Tsundue is a writer-activist, a rare blend in the Tibetan community in exile.</p>
<p><br />
He published a book of poems 'Crossing The Border' with the money begged and borrowed from his classmates while studying in Mumbai. His literary skills won him the first-ever 'Outlook-Picador Award for Non-Fiction' in 2001. In this all-India essay contest Tsundue took first prize from 900 other entries. His writings have been published in International PEN, The Indian PEN, The Indian Literary Panorama, The Little Magazine, Outlook, The Times of India, The Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Better Photography, The Economic Times, Tehelka, Mid-Day (Mumbai), Afternoon (Mumbai), The Daily Star (Bangladesh), Today (Singapore), Tibetan Review, Tibetan Bulletin, Freedom First, Tibetan World, and Gandhi Marg. He represented Tibet in the Second South Asian Literary Conference in New Delhi in January 2005, which was organised by the premier Indian literary association, Sahitya Academy.</p>
<p>Tsundue joined Friends of Tibet (India) in 1999. Since then he's been working with the organisation as its general secretary. In January 2002 his profile peaked when he scaled scaffolding to the 14th floor of the Oberoi Towers in Mumbai to unfurl a Tibetan national flag and a banner which read "Free Tibet" down the hotel's facade. China's Premier Zhu Rongji was inside the hotel addressing a conference of Indian business tycoons. The world's media featured Tsundue's antics and Indian police officials reportedly congratulated him in prison for standing up for his rights. Recently, in April, he repeated a similar feat with a stunning protest that captured the imagination of the world. Single-handedly, he snatched the world media attention from the visiting Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jia Bao in the south Indian city, Bangalore.</p>

"Seeking Buddhahood is one thing, and freedom for a country is another. We are fighting for freedom in the world and not freedom from the world."</p>
