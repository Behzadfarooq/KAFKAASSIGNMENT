<li>Like the nomination said, it needs to <b>WIN</b> to be considered notable. The newspaper doesn't seem to be notable and the BBC is only a blurb from a tech blog, not an independent news piece (and even he says he doesn't know if it will catch on.)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree the BBC mention is trivial, but regarding the Zoinks! Magazine article, you argue that the newspaper doesnt seem notable? Setting aside the fact that you do not back this statement up, the newspaper itself does not need to satisfy the notability requirements, the article simply needs to be non-trivial and from an independent source. The fact that a non trivial article about the comic was written in an independent print newspaper is a point in favor of notability. And the Destructoid reference above is an article completely devoted to Dueling Analogs, talking about it's subject matter, tone and style. This is a non-trivial, independent reference to Dueling Analogs. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability_(web)</a> web content is deemed notable if "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." These two articles satisfy this requirement and establish the Dueling Analogs comic as notable acording to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability_(web)</a>. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 08:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> (<a href="../../../f/f/o/User_talk%7EFforde_e4c5.html" title="User talk:Fforde">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fforde_26f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fforde">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Read the article yourself. That article has nothing to do with notability. It has to do with verifiability which is completely different. But since verifiability <i>is</i> a requirement for a source, lets take a look. There are two criteria listed that could make a source dubious. Either the publication has a poor reputation for fact checking, or it is self published by the subject of the original wikipedia article. Neither of these cases are true so the publication passes the test for verifiability. Perhaps you meant to question the fact that the magazine referenced is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Non-scholarly_sources" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, rather than that it is verifiable or notable. It has been published (in print) since 2001 <a href="http://comixpedia.org/index.php/Zoinks!_magazine" class="external autonumber" title="http://comixpedia.org/index.php/Zoinks!_magazine" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and as the magazine focuses on webcomics it could be considered an expert on the subject at hand. The magazine practices editorial oversight and all content is attributable to an original author<a href="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=contributors" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=contributors" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. All of these things contribute to the magazine's reliability. Yes it is a nitch magazine that you personally may never have heard of but that does not mean it is not reliable. I don't understand why you are so adament about deleting this article. You asked for proof of notability, you have received it. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 17:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> (<a href="../../../f/f/o/User_talk%7EFforde_e4c5.html" title="User talk:Fforde">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fforde_26f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fforde">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Verifiability and notability go hand in hand. Verifiability does have a section on sources, read it again. Also read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Furthermore, Wikipedia serves as a resource for the general public, not a niche segment of the population. Therefore, notability has to establish why the general public would care about the article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. - <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 19:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I already have disputed all the sources. The award was only a nomination, not notable. The BBC article admits itself that the webcomic is not notable. The magazine is a publication dedicated to webcomics and covers hundreds of other webcomics deemed not notable for wikipedia. Once again, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but independent verifiable OUTSIDE sources are needed to show why the general public would care about this in 10 or 100 years. It looks like no information exists that would establish why anyone outside the webcomic fanbase would care about this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> applies to all articles, not just the ones you listed. Since you are a newly created account, why not spend more time exploring wikipedia and its guidelines in order to learn what its all about before jumping into an AFD which relies on Wikipedia guidelines instead of personal preference? - <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 20:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Zoinks Magazine is a magazine devoted to the best of the best of web comics. It does not contain hundreds of comics as you suggest, in fact they have been criticized for including too many articles and too few comics. This is an independent outside source. The <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destructoid.html" title="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> reference is also a non trivial, independent reference to Deuling Analogs. Yes web comics certainly are a niche interested but I was not aware that a topic had to appeal to everyone to be included in wikipedia. My arguements are not personal preference, in fact I am not even personally a fan of this comic, but as you said this does not matter. I feel it is notable, based on Wikipedia's guidlines for notability, and I think it would be a mistake to remove it from Wikipedia. I am not going to go back and forth on the reputability of the sources provided any more though. I feel the sources are reputable and establish notability. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 21:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, Fforde, If I'm understanding you correctly, you are saying that CyberneticTigerZ's three paragraph blog post<a href="http://www.destructoid.com/friday-comic-intermission-dueling-analogs-29347.phtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.destructoid.com/friday-comic-intermission-dueling-analogs-29347.phtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> about this comic on destructoid.com is a nontrivial article from a source with a reputaton for fact-checking and accuracy and that this article describes this webcomic's achievements, impact or historical significance. This is incorrect, as a three paragraph blog post is trivial, neither CyberneticTigerZ nor destructoid.com have reputations for fact-checking and accuracy, and the blog post just describes the webcomic rather than suggesting it is of any importance. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 21:14, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I feel that the article may be a weak keep, I just wanted to point out to Pierski that he has already made a "keep" statement" above: it is custom that you only say "keep" or "delete" once (you are allowed to change your mind of course), and add further comments with a "comment" or similar note. Furthermore, while your input here is valuable, I would urge you, before editing the article any further, to consider <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. While I don't think you have done anything wrong, it may be better if you leave alone articles where you have such a strong conflict of interest in the future (you <i>are</i> Napierski, I presume?). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Also, the <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystiq.html" title="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> interview [<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/02/joystiq-profile-dueling-analogs-steve-napierski/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/02/joystiq-profile-dueling-analogs-steve-napierski/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] was just released this morning. I wanted to make sure it was added to the page to help its "keep" defense. And yes I <i>am</i> Napierski. -- <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierski_0574.html" title="User:Pierski">Pierski</a> 19:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
