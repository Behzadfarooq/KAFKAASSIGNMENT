<p>Animals use pheromones to send chemical signals to each other; one pheromone used by snakes (C. elegans) is called daumone. Pheromones are an important classification of chemicals that are widley used in chemica6l research to help facilitate the production and development of drugs for humans. Also known as, (R)-(3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yloxy) heptanoic acid, this chemical facilitates entrance into the dauer stage of life in which the snake stops aging to protect the snakes from adverse environments. The chemical formula for daumone is C13H24O6, and although the chemical has been synthesized in lab, little information is reported about its physical and chemical properties on the MSDS. Therefore, melting point, and boiling point are unknown, although it is reported that the chemical has low solubility in aqueous environments. Since it is a naturally occuring chemical, daumone does not have any known isomers, either geometric or optical. The optical rotation is known to be -81 degrees. Information specific to this chemical can be found in the February 2005 issue of Nature in an artical called: Chemical structure and biological activity of the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer-inducing pheromone. This article discusses the biological implications of the chemical and outlines the in-lab synthesis, which required 10 separate steps.</p>

<p>Sonnet 60</p>
<p>by William Shakespeare</p>
<p>No longer mourn for me when I am dead</p>
<p>Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell</p>
<p>Give warning to the world that I am fled</p>
<p>From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:</p>
<p>Nay, if you read this line, remember not</p>
<p>The hand that writ it; for I love you so</p>
<p>That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot</p>
<p>If thinking on me then should make you woe.</p>
<p>O, if, I say, you look upon this verse</p>
<p>When I perhaps compounded am with clay,</p>
<p>Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.</p>
<p>But let your love even with my life decay,</p>
<p>Lest the wise world should look into your moan</p>
<p>And mock you with me after I am gone.</p>

<p>Kafarakab (prounounced "Kfara-ab" in Arabic) is the franco-phone spelling of the name of a scenic village in the mountains of Lebanon. The village is of particular significance because it is one of the various historic points of origin of of the well known Maalouf family. This family history is traced back to the very beginnings of Christianity in the Middle East begining with the Ghassani tribe, which converted to Christianity nearly 2000 years ago. The family name is now wide-spread worldwide. Family lineages are detailed and well preserved, and conferences and a sense of family pride still preserve traditions, reunions, and culture. The preservation effort has the intent of documenting every known person bearing the Maalouf name.</p>
<p>Aside from this notoriety, the village is quaint and picturesque. It is of no great size, consisting of only a handful of old homes built on terraced mountainsides lined with grape vineyards and many varieties of fruit trees. The breathtaking view is perhaps the most impressive aspect of this red terra cotta rooftop cluster - including a view of the snow capped Lebanon mountains to the east, and the Mediterranean sea and the city of Beirut to the west. The village sits at about 4,000 ft, and is truly one of the small places from which a great diaspora has influenced the world. There are Kafarakab Maaloufs are all over the world in many distinguished professions. Wikipedia already includes an article about Nasim Maalouf, who is known for his great accomplishments in trumpet music repetoire in Paris, France. I too am a Maalouf, and this Wikipedia article is only my third internet publication. Please add to this reference, as I plan to link family conference websites, migration information, geneology, and modern day Maalouf celebreties and success stories.</p>

<p>--69.229.63.105 07:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)Phatima Cabaski Kagura Kagurina of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamanca%2C_Spain_ec2a.html" title="Salamanca, Spain">Salamanca, Spain</a>, November 15,1990. Daughter of Kea Kasona and Kohl Kagurina. Died on June 6,2006 Kagura was an extraordinary child with two known talents of; <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telekinesis.html" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a>. Kea did not like this fact at all, to her this was an embarrassment. At the age of 5 Kagura and CyC traveled to the USA, where in a private school she met her best friend Daniel Miguel. There was when her talents were discovered as well. She was blest for three months only. On July 18,1995 Kea put Kagura in a mental hospital in Jakarata, Indonesia(this was also her death place). In this prison was where Kagura was burnt and electrocuted by her sick nurse (not named for security reasons). Though she never lost her beauty, the only known solution for this is that every night at 6 p.m. there will be a wolf's howl and then the next day she was cured of all damages taken. On September 16,2000 CyC tried to break Kagura out, this was not a success, this was tried 6 times. On the last trial her telekinesis fell out of her hands. For 14 years Kagura suffered and was rejected by her mother, which she only visited her once. There was this one time when Rev. Jocusco tried to commit an <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exorcism.html" title="Exorcism">exorcism</a> on her. Kagura's brain unbalanced and she caused a small hurricane there. The room was demolished and this was when Kea went to pay all damages, and just that. On June 5,2006 Kagura contacted Daniel and was able to talk to him for the last time. The next day at 6 p.m. she died. On June 15, 2006 CyC found a letter in Kagura's room, lot 6 number 6 , the letter she found was from Kagura. The letter went like this; "Dear Diary, Now that my end is near I want to write about what I have just seen in the near future. "I open my eyes, find myself swimming desperately up to the surface. I am able to reach the shore, this handsome boy named Kris grabs my hand to help me out. There he leads me to his house where I am handed a room. Then I see myself misusing my telekinesis and psychic abilities. I also see myself kill at least 4 innocent people and worst 1 beautiful little baby. After that horrible scene I see myself laying on the floor with a bullet through my heart and on my way to hell. Then that all changes and I'm in front of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> Saying "If I am to become that horrible monster, I do not wish to live up to that point." I begin to cry my eyes out. There I here this majestic voice say "You will pass through the fist part put I will stop the second part, so go in piece." I then see a vision in my vision. CyC is in my room, reading my letter. She begins to cry madly, I dont understand. But now I know why. I saw CyC dying on June 19,2006 and I see her traveling down to hell. "Cyc this is a problem that can in fact be solved, you know what to do. So do it, I insist you to." Finally I see my mother, father and the rest of my family dying rapidly. This, I do not like. For the closing of my letter I would like to thank God. I could not be mad at him like some would have. I know that I wasn't assigned the easiest of tasks, but i am glad I was at least able to see the wonders this life brings, not only that but also the suffering it brings with it. God I am grateful for all you gave me, and mother, you will always stay in my heart, I love you. I could not leave without telling you that i forgive and always will love you, for eternity. If God forgives and loves, to those that don't, then why should I private myself to that same act. I know it's hard to do this, especially to someone that has done you lots of damage but I strongly recommend for people to follow this example. Now I will die in peace, I will miss the people I love, don't cry and suffer for my death. Good bye, I know I will see you soon." Kagura never reached a hospital, she literally died in the streets. The most horrible thing about her death is that her own mother did not make her a funeral. All she did was put her in a titanium container and throw it in the ocean. In addition; CyC Duarte March 16,1991-June 19,2006 her death place was the USA.</p>

<p>Gomme syrup also known as sugar syrup is an ingredient commonly used in cocktails. Gomme syrup is comprised of a sugar and water mixture. Gomme syrup is made with the highest percentage of sugar to water possible before crystalization. To make gomme syrup just add sugar to boiling water until the water is fully saturated with sugar (no more sugar will dissolve at this point) Simple sugar is made the same way although a 50% sugar to 50% water mix is used.</p>

<p>Origin San Francisco, California, United States Years active late 1990s–present Genre(s) Jazz, Funk, Hip-Hop Label(s) Reel Deal Music Members Chris Arenas Chris Spano Matt Fleming Tony Jurado Lexxx Luthor Mic Blake CB</p>
<p>The band formed in 1998, when bassist, Chris Arenas, and drummer, Chris Spano, began performing with keyboardist, Matt Fleming. The trio enlisted Dj M3, the well-noted San Francisco house/hip-hop DJ (who now heads the SF-based record label Green Gorilla Lounge), and a host of Bay Area horn players. Throughout the late nineties, the group infiltrated the Bay Area's acid-jazz and hip-hop circuits, performing at parties such as Toph One’s, "The Funkside," and Mr. Brown’s, "Elephunk" and "Double Trouble". Raw Deluxe soon made their first trip to Europe, performing throughout the Eastern part of the continent during the summer of 1999.</p>
<p>In 2000, Raw Deluxe was voted "Best Jazz Band" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian’s, "Best of the Bay". The band was also nominated for 2001 Best Music Act, on citysearch.com, along side artists such as Green Day, Boz Scaggs, and Vinyl, where they were noted as “One of the best original acts currently in the Bay Area." The group was then nominated for the 2002 SF Weekly Music Awards, "Best Soul / Blues / Funk" category.</p>
<p>In July 2001, the group released the critically acclaimed EP, "Back to the Jungle," with the Reel Deal Music label. XLR8R magazine noted the CD as "Killer jazz-funk from this San Francisco outfit, complete with horns, wailing keys and tight rhythm. They've been quietly winning loyal fans for the past few years, and with these six original tracks it's easy to see why. Check 'em out." The single "Get Some" was also featured on the Subkoncious Records compilation, Elephunk / Live-N-Direct that year as well.</p>
<p>In October 2005, the band released their follow up album "Back By Popular Demand". During the course of the recording the band enlisted guest MC's Lexxx Luthor, CB, and Mic Blake of the seminal jazz/hip-hop group Alphbet Soup. By the release of the album the MC's became offical members of Raw Deluxe due to Alphabet Soup's saxophonist Kenny Brooks and drummer Jay Lane's busy touring schedule with Grateful Dead guitarist/singer Bob Weir's band Rat Dog.</p>
<p>Today band is comprised of Chris Spano - drums, Chris Arenas - bass, Matt Fleming - electric piano/organ, Tony Jurado - saxophone and features MC's Lexxx Luthor, Mic Blake and CB of Alphabet Soup. The group continues to perform regularly and has come from it's underground status to playing both nationaly and internationally with acts such as Digital Underground, Olu Dara, and The Breakestra.</p>
<p>Members of Raw Deluxe are also featured in other side projects. Bassist Chris Arenas started the band New Libation Orchestra featuring Jeff Raines and Ben Ellman of the New Orleans funk band Galactic. He also performs with the legendary New Orleans guitarist Ernie Vincent, leader of the legendary 1970's funk band Ernie and the Top Notes. MC Mic Blake has another hip-hop group called Bop City Pacific based out of Oakland, CA.</p>

<p>An angry dwarf army rolled over to me and farted in my taco. So I got angry and slapped him. After I slapped him I analysed the taco (in which had been farted on recently), and then that gave me proof that dwarfs are angry and gas-filled.</p>

<p>In the sixteen hundreds coffeehouses were popular meeting places for people of leisure. Many rich and famous people met in coffeehouses to discuss recent events, as it was around this time that the first British newspaper was produced so there was plenty to talk about. Coffeehouses were also sometimes used by businessmen and merchants for meeting clients and closing deals. It was also around this time that the new drink chocolate had been brought over from Southern America, before that the few remaining Aztecs living in Mexico had been making the drink out of the crushed cacao beans and peppers but had recently been brought to England by the Spanish. Another two popular drinks in coffeehouses were sherbet; a sour fruit drink and cock ale; a cheap ale that sometimes had pieces of chicken in it. In 1652 the first coffee house opened in London by a Jewish Turk. The only women allowed in coffee houses were maids and cleaners, only men were allowed to relax there, it was a law, many petitions were set up to allow women in coffee shops but all failed until around sixteen seventy five when there was over three thousand coffeehouses across England so many of them allowed women the law was abolished. Inside coffeehouses men gambled, met up, looked at paintings and traded as well as drinking coffee. Coffee was originally only available in Turkey until after the war of Vienna the coffee stolen from the defeated Turks was spread slowly across the world.</p>

<p>Results of Odessa Numismatics Museum's scientific-research activity have been embodied in a regular periodical – “Bulletin of the Odessa Numismatic Museum”. The Bulletin’s issues include materials concerning publication of unique and rare coins of ancient cities of the Northern Black Sea Region , analysis of the coins’ features (typology, semantics of images, chronology, weight data, metallic formulation) synthesized with historical events, economy and worldview of the past times. Such publications introduce into research practice previously unknown findings and enrich the Corpus of coins of our Region . The Odessa Numismatic Museum’s research practice continues almost bicentennial traditions of renowned Odessa researchers-numismatists and contributes its share to the scientific investigation of the Northern Black Sea Coast history. In 2004 were published "Collected Articles of Numismatics of the Northern Black Sea Region". There're included 19 ussues of "Bulletin of the Odessa Numismatics Museum" as result of Museum's scientific-research activity for five years. Necessity of this edition has been caused by two reasons: constantly growing interest to ancient numismatics of Northern Black Sea Region both in Ukraine and abroad and also that's why all issues of "Bulletin" were carried out as not commercial issues in small circulations and today became rare books. In tables there're resulted images of 363 coins, among them there're many rare and unique specimens.</p>

<p>Willy and the wet sneakers was a psychedellic group in the early to late 70's known for their hits such as "Cardboard Jelly" and "Oh Baby". The band originated in massachusetts,usa. Frontman Bob Turini is often regarded as the greatest rhythm guitar/lead singer ever to live. Starting in 1970 the band took little time in findind their audience and record label for that matter. They were soon inked to one of the largest record deals of their era. A fallout almost occured in 72' that would eventually happen in 1980 when Bobs Girlfriend (Julie) claimed that the guitarist hit on her. Bob disregarded it and then The band performed before crowds as large as 200,000. Lead guitar was Willy Sneaks. After a show in San Francisco, Bob destroyed a hotel room and broke the servants jaw. Bob Ended up in prison for the night and while in prison he wrote the famous album "Sneakers of all sizes and colors". This then went on to be one of the best guitar driven albums ever.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.geo.uio.no/IPA/" class="external text" title="http://www.geo.uio.no/IPA/" rel="nofollow">International Permafrost Association (IPA)</a>, founded in 1983, has as its objectives to foster the dissemination of knowledge concerning <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permafrost.html" title="Permafrost">permafrost</a> and to promote cooperation among persons and national or international organisations engaged in scientific investigation and engineering work related to permafrost and seasonally frozen ground. The IPA became an Affiliated Organisation of the <a href="http://www.iugs.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.iugs.org/" rel="nofollow">International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)</a> in July 1989.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../p/e/r/Permafrost.html" title="Permafrost">Permafrost</a> or perennially frozen ground is defined as earth material that remains at or below 0° C for at least two consecutive years. As such upwards of 25 % of Planet Earth is underlain to some degree by permafrost and in extreme conditions reaches depths of 1500 meters. Permafrost occurs in the high latitudes and mountains and plateaus of both hemispheres.

<li><b>Created</b>. It looks like some of the information in this submission got clobbered, but I went back to the page history and created it. Thank you for your submission. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 23:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>213.40.67.66 15:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC) My guide is so easy, even a caveman can do it! Use it to convert from almost any format (AVI, MPEG, VOB/DVD, etc) into crystal clear DVD-quality video for iTunes and/or your iPod.</p>
<p>If you're going to rip DVDs into Videora, you first need to install DVD43, which de-protects any DVDs in your PC. Then, DVD Shrink is needed to combine the movie's VOB files into one, and lastly, Videora iPod Converter is needed to get the videos encoded properly for iTunes/iPods. If you're only converting downloaded videos, and not DVDs, you only need Videora iPod Converter, which I will from hereon refer to as just 'Videora'. Note that any videos created with this guide will only be playable in Quicktime 7, iTunes 6 or an iPod video.</p>
<p>Videora iPod Converter (freeware): [Website/Download] <a href="http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/" class="external free" title="http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/</a></p>

<p>DVD Shrink (freeware): [Website] <a href="http://www.dvdshrink.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.dvdshrink.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdshrink.org/</a> [Download] <a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/sendfi...ink32setup.zip" class="external free" title="http://fileforum.betanews.com/sendfi...ink32setup.zip" rel="nofollow">http://fileforum.betanews.com/sendfi...ink32setup.zip</a></p>
<p>Encoding downloaded videos with Videora is fairly easy and self explanatory. If you need explanation, start reading from Step 11 below, and instead of using VOBs and such, just use the videos you want on your iTunes/iPod.</p>
<p>Getting DVDs into Videora: ---You only need to perform the following four steps once--- 1) Download and install DVD43 from the above link, and restart. Make sure it's running after your computer starts up again (it's a smiley face in the system tray). 2) Download and install DVD Shrink from the above link. 3) Open DVD Shrink, and go to Edit -&gt; Preferences... 4) Go to the Output Files tab, and uncheck Split VOB files into 1GB size chunks. Click OK. ---Continue---- 5) Click the Re-Author button on the top of the window. 6) Find your DVD drive in the DVD Browser list, and open it. Drag the Main Movie to the left half of the window. 7) Click on the Compression Settings tab in the right half, and then pick No Compression in the drop down menu for video compression (it says Automatic by default). 8) Only check the audio track you want encoded to your iPod/iTunes (probably the first one). None of the subtitles will be converted, so you can uncheck all of those, too. 9) Click the Backup! button on top. Wait patiently as DVD Shrink analyzes your movie. 10) In the Select backup target drop down, select Hard Disk Folder. In the next box, type wherever you want your DVD files saved. Press OK and wait while it does its stuff (may take up to 20 minutes). Once DVD Shrink is done, move on to the next step. ---Start here for encoding downloaded videos, or keep reading for DVDs---- 11) Open Videora iPod Converter. Click Transcode New Video, and navigate to the folder you chose in DVD Shrink for backing up the movie. Open the VIDEO_TS folder. (If you're using downloaded videos and not a DVD, just find the video you want to encode, and ignore the VIDEO_TS and VTS stuff) 12) There should be a file called VTS_01_1 in the folder (if you're not using a DVD, just find your video right now). Select it and begin encoding with H264/320x240/640kbps Stereo/128kbps if the video is fullscreen, or see this image for widescreen. Make sure that if your movie is widescreen, you encode with my widescreen profile. The encoding process takes awhile to complete, and if your PC is slow, it might take as long as the actual video. Sometimes Videora will jump to 100% quickly, but this is a glitch, and it's not really finished until "Transcode Complete" appears. 13) Once the encoding is done, Videora will say "Transcode Complete" and the final video (to add to iTunes) will be saved into whatever folder is written in the 'Output files to' box in Videora, under Setup. 14) To get the videos on your iPod, right click the iPod in iTunes, go to iPod Options and then pick a transfer method under the Video tab. Automatic updating is recommended if you're using the iPod on one PC.</p>

The Lyman School for Boys was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts about 1886 and was closed in 1972. It was the first reform school, or training school in the country, replacing the State Reform School near the same site, which was opened in 1846. The school was named for its principle benefactor, Theodore Lyman who had been a mayor of Boston and one of the founders of the Waltham Watch and Clock Company.</p>
<p>Lyman School was situated near Lake Chauncey in the town of Westborough. It comprised about one thousand acres of which about five hundred were prime farmland, maintained by its students. The farm remained a principle means of support for the school until about 1955 when the agricultural nature of the region changed to a more industrial composition. At that time, training of the students was also changed to reflect these changes.</p>
<p>Students were sent to the Lyman School when the courts had determined that it would be in the public interest. Until about 1970, juveniles in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were afforded none of the (now) commonly accepted Constitutional rights. Therefore, many boys were sent to this reform school for “crimes” such as truancy and being a stubborn child. In fact, the laws in the Commonwealth even allowed stubborn children to be put to death.</p>
<p>Students at the school were subjected to strict discipline. They were required to conform at all times to some strict rules that were enforced with corporal punishment. Students lived in so-called cottages. These were monstrous brick buildings that provided shelter for three to four hundred boys in each cottage. The top floor of each cottage comprised a dormitory and the lower floors, the living space.</p>
<p>Pictures and information about this school are currently being maintained by Dick Bolt in (<a href="http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html/" class="external free" title="http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html/" rel="nofollow">http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html/</a>). There are two authors known to have attended the Lyman School and lived to write about it. They are Mark D. Devlin, the author of <i>Stubborn Child</i>, (<a href="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html" class="external free" title="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html</a>), who recently died, and Richard B. Johnson, author of <i>Abominable Firebug</i>, who writes considerable details about students’ daily activity at the school.

<p>Biography for Johanna ter Steege, most international actress of the Netherlands</p>
<p>Mini biography From 1979 to 1984 Johanna ter Steege studied at the academy of dramatic art in Kampen to become a drama teacher. Her initial desire to develop theatre for and with children prompted her to seek a career as an actress and a teacher. From 1984 to 1988 she attended the school of acting at Arnhem to become a stage actress. Considering acting "the language of the heart", one of the most important things she learned was that the personnel and creative development of an actor are closely knit. Her acting experience ranges from Shakespeare, Sophocles, Strindberg and Chekhov to improvisory clown acts.</p>
<p>At the academy, collaboration with fellow students resulted in the very successful theatre group "De Trust", directed by Boermans. In 1987 Johanna was asked for a role in the film Spoorloos (1988) (aka "The Vanishing"), directed by George Sluizer. This role met international acclaim, winning her the "Felix Award" (Best Supporting Actress) in Berlin.</p>
<p>Inevitably, her career shifted from the theatre to the cinema. For the past twelve years she has traveled all over the world, acting in different languages and working with renowned directors, such as Robert Altman (Vincent &amp; Theo (1990)), István Szabó (Édes Emma, drága Böbe - vázlatok, aktok (1992), aka "Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe"), Heddy Honigmann (Tot ziens (1995) aka "Goodbye", for which she won Best Actress at the Locarno International Film Festival) and Bruce Beresford (Paradise Road (1997)).</p>
<p>Johanna has also worked with actors such as Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Isabella Rossellini, Gary Oldman, Tim Roth and Klaus Maria Brandauer. In January 2001 ter Steege played Countess Geschwitz, in the play "Lulu", directed by Jonathan Kent, both in the Almeida theatre in London and in Washington.</p>
<p>Was cast as the lead character of Tania in Stanley Kubrick's "Aryan Papers," a Holocaust film based on the novel "Wartime Lies." The project was only weeks from production in Slovakia when Kubrick canceled it, not wanting it to come out after Schindler's List (1993) which had just been released. He had a similar experience with Full Metal Jacket (1987) which came out just after Platoon (1986).</p>

<li><b>Response</b>. I think there should be a Wikipedia article about Johanna ter Steege, but this biography copies the IMDb biography of her too closely <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0824373/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0824373/bio" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and would be a copyright violation if we tried to include it at Wikipedia. If you want to do a new biography of her for Wikipedia, I think it would be a good idea. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Alan Huffman (born April 7, 1955, in Jackson, Miss.) is an American author and journalist. He graduated from Murrah High School in 1973 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Mississippi in English, history and art in 1982; he also attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Millsaps College. He lives in Bolton, Miss.</p>
<p>Huffman is the author of two books: Ten Point (University Press of Mississippi, 1997), and Mississippi in Africa (Gotham, 2004). He has contributed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Los Angeles Times, Outside Magazine, Preservation magazine, Smithsonian magazine and the Washington Post Magazine. Huffman has also been a farmer and an environmental and political researcher.</p>
<p>Ten Point is a photoessay book with illustrations by Florence West Huffman (Huffman's grandmother) chronicling a Mississippi Delta hunting club comprised of both men and women, black and white, from the 1920s through the early 1960s. The club disbanded after the swamp was destroyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Mississippi in Africa traces a sweeping saga from the slave quarters of the antebellum South to the war-ravaged streets of modern-day Monrovia, Liberia. The pivotal event came when a Mississippi slave holder named Isaac Ross decreed in his will in the 1830s that his plantation be sold and the money used to pay the way for those of his slaves who chose to immigrate to a freed-slave colony on the west coast of Africa, in what is now Liberia. A contest ensued among Ross's heirs over the will, during which a slave uprising was alleged to have occurred, resulting in the burning of the plantation house, the death of a young girl and the lynching of a group of slaves. Eventually the courts ruled in favor of the will and about 200 of Ross's slaves immigrated to Liberia, to a place called Mississippi in Africa; the others remained enslaved in the U.S.</p>
<p>Huffman tracks down the descendants of everyone involved in the story -- the freed slaves, the slaves who chose not to immigrate, and the divided slave holding family -- to find out what truly happened and what ultimately became of everyone involved. The book, which is set in both Mississippi (in the U.S.) and Liberia and spans two centuries, also considers how history is fabricated and handed down.</p>

<p>He was born and raised in Artesia, New Mexico to mother, Mary Frances (Dorado) Samora, and father, Ronny Alex Samora Sr. (1953-2006). He had five brothers and four sisters and was the third to the youngest. At the tender age of fifteen, he was stricken with Wegener's Granulomatosis which he contracted from a reaction to the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. His mother insisted that he had already obtained the shot, but no records could be found. Initially, doctors had no idea what type of illness they were looking at. He was hospitalized for one year at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico where doctors still could not diagnose his illness. Several tests and surgeries later Samora was sent to Bethesda, Maryland where he would undergo more procedures and research to determine his ailment. He stayed in Maryland for a few months at the Children's Inn at NIH. His mother and oldest sister, Penelope Sarabia, stayed at the Inn with him to help him through that difficult time in his life. It was at the Inn where they diagnosed him with Wegener's Granulomatosis--a terminal illness. He was murdered by Richard Sigala and Eleuterio Venegas, Jr. in the early morning hours of September 29, 2001.</p>

<p>Two complete seasons have been played. Team America, have won both Championships. In Season 1, After going down three games to none, Team America capped off an amazing comeback by winning four straight games and taking the series. Team Internacionale to a three game lead with dominating play, but the combination of magnificent team play and the weakness of the Scottish-born O'Neil led to the loss. In Season 2, Team America won four games to one once again with great teamwork and suffocating defense from the defense of Redlitz, whom the likes of Kobe Bryant and Ben Wallace have been compared to.</p>

<p>In 2000 he finally tied the knot with Sammy and they bought a house in South Dakota. Unfortunately, this was also during his sophomore slump. "Motherfucking Riot" did not sell nearly as well as "Big Storm of 1988" and Erik soon found himself in debt. With nothing more, he pawned his wedding ring, effectively ending his ten day marriage.</p>

<p>Erik went to Oxford Academy in 2002, graduated in 2006 with a Master's in engineering. He attempted a comeback with the single, "My Chest is On Fire" but it only found an audience amongst homosexual men in their forties. He's currently working with Rick Rubin in the studio and hopes to have a new release out by the end of the year, one which will include, as he calls it, "a motherfuckin' hip new sound."</p>

<p>Oh, come on... this one is self-explanatory enough. The reference word is "dishwashing", and "dish washing" redirects to "dishwashing" -- why shouldn't "dish-washing" do that too? When I searched, this was just the word. I don't feel I need any sources on this one, only my personal explanation.&#160;:)</p>

<p>He was born and raised in Artesia, New Mexico to mother, Mary Frances (Dorado) Samora, and father, Ronny Alex Samora Sr. (1953-2006). He had five brothers and four sisters and was the third to the youngest. At the tender age of fifteen, he was stricken with Wegener's Granulomatosis which he contracted from a reaction to the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. His mother insisted that he had already obtained the shot, but no records could be found. Initially, doctors had no idea what type of illness they were looking at. He was hospitalized for one year at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico where doctors still could not diagnose his illness. Several tests and surgeries later Samora was sent to Bethesda, Maryland where he would undergo more procedures and research to determine his ailment. He stayed in Maryland for a few months at the Children's Inn at NIH. His mother and oldest sister, Penelope Sarabia, stayed at the Inn with him to help him through that difficult time in his life. It was at the Inn where they diagnosed him with Wegener's Granulomatosis--a terminal illness. The disease is an auto-immune disorder where the body is constantly fighting invaders. The immune system becomes so strong that it begins to fight foreign invaders and the person's own body as well. The granulomas begin to form because of the attack that the body is facing. The doctors gave him a couple of years to live. The disease destroyed his sinuses and his hearing. He became about 70% deaf in one ear. In addition to hearing aids, he also had to wear any eye patch for a long time because of the numerous surgeries that were performed on his eye ducts. He could not work because his illness left him with tattered lungs that he could hardly breath from. He loved eating, cooking, video games, hunting, drawing, painting, music, mechanical, and electrical work. At times, his illness would keep him from doing the things he loved. He tried with all his might to overcome the challenges that he faced. While the future looked bleak for this young man, he was determined to graduate from Artesia High School. Although he missed most of his Sophomore year and all of his Junior year, he graduated with a 3.3 and was able to walk with his graduating class. He made up the lost years by attending summer and night school. Samora beat the odds that the doctors gave him. He lived well beyond the couple of years that doctors had suggested, but someone else decided that they weren't going to let that happen. Samora was murdered by Richard Sigala and Eleuterio Venegas Jr. (accomplice) in the early morning hours of September 29, 2001 in Artesia. He was viciously shot in the head by Sigala and thrown in the street in the Morning Side district of Artesia. Since he was murdered, an autopsy was perfomed and doctors were amazed when they examined his body. Although he was severly sick, doctors said that he had one of the healthiest bodies they had ever seen. They wanted to use his body for medical research. He had barely turned 22 one month prior to his death. The murderers were captured, tried, and sentenced to prison where they still reside. He left behind his family who loved him very much and who still think about him everyday. He had several nieces and nephews who he also loved very much. One day he will awaken to a life of peace, good health, and happiness, because the former things will have passed away.</p>
