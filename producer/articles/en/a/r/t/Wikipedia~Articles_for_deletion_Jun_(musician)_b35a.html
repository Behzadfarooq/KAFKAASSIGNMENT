<li><b>Comment</b> The Japanese wikipedia article on X Japan (<a href="../../../../ja/x/_/j/X_JAPAN_f487.html" class="extiw" title="ja:X_JAPAN">ja:X JAPAN</a>) mentions Jun as a guitarist when they were an indy band, and there is an article (<a href="../../../../ja/%E9%AB%98/%E4%BA%95/%E5%AF%BF/%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF.html" class="extiw" title="ja:高井寿">ja:高井寿</a>) about him. Perhaps to be taken with a grain of salt, as there is just two anonymous IP editors who worked on the Japanese bio article. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 01:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, even more so, as the references to Jun in X JAPAN (Japanese wikipedia) were all added just four days ago. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 01:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not sure whether I am reading this right but hasn't this article already been <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF&amp;oldid=7401804" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%AB%98%E4%BA%95%E5%AF%BF&amp;oldid=7401804" rel="nofollow">considered for deletion</a> at some point but the respective tag was quickly removed by the anonymous article creator without any comment? Anyway, this could very well be a case where information is transfered from one Wikipedia to another without considering its validity. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 13:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that looks like a speedy deletion tag. Via Amazon, I could verify that the part about 高井寿 writing several instructional guitar books is true; but, that alone would not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> reference that puts him in X Japan at any point is needed, to keep the article. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 14:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, not happy yet. This page is not WP:V as described by Cyrus below. I can make a geocities page that puts me as the keyboardist of X, and that would be just as verifiable. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 01:16, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are missing the point. This <i>best source</i> (as I have stated numerous times by now) does not qualify as a reliable source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it is self-published material, neither backed by the official website of the band nor those of the former members which we can be certain about. The other references you have introduced in this dispute are no better, as they all rely on user contributed content. Given that the flow of information between Japan and the band's non-Japanese fans is not only hampered by the years which have passed since the group's split but also a considerable language barrier, widespread gossip and misinformation would come as no surprise. Any further discussion on this particular matter should take place on <strong class="selflink">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jun (musician)</strong>. ~ <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 00:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>OK, finally and with lot of help I have got the reliable sources you have said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rommel, was a japanese band, Jun or Shu or H. Takai was one of their members (you can see also this in his OFFICIAL webpage), well, look at this: <a href="http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A" class="external free" title="http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,41051.sm;jsessionid=1342D8071BA23965902521B05A61684A</a> Rommel information from Rockdetector a copyrighted news article webpage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frontman "Shu" (Hisashi Takai) had credits with EMPEROR and X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, then we have Extasy Records official webpage (<a href="http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.extasyrecords.co.jp/eng/company/index.html</a>) look what it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1986.04 Establish EXTASY RECORDS upon releasing X' new single, [ORGASM]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you check the Wikipage about this: <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgasm_%28song%29.html" title="Orgasm (song)">Orgasm_(song)</a> oh, look at the cover there's a guy at the right, who is he? JUN. (you can also check this in his official website). Do I have to say more? You can see, copyrighted webpages talk about Jun, and lot of more sites also, as you can see the 4 ciations I added yesterday in the main article (<a href="../../../x/_/j/X_Japan_f22f.html" title="X Japan">X Japan</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcat21_ccea.html" title="User:Darkcat21">Darkcat21</a> 19:23, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see what Rockdetector's FAQ has to say about the origin of its content:</dd>
<dd><i>CAN I CONTRIBUTE TO ROCKDETECTOR?<br />
<b>Yes you can.</b> We are always on the look out for people with specialist knowledge, solid writing skills, dedication and enthusiasm.<br />
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION?<br />
Direct from bands, labels, PR companies, <b>contributors</b> and twenty years of information gathering.</i></dd>
<dd>So basicly this site is yet another unfit source, as it relies on user contributed content, just like Wikipedia. Same goes for the supposed cover scan you mentioned, its origin and authenticity cannot be verified by existence alone. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Original_images" title="Wikipedia:No original research">this policy</a> regarding the viability of images as sources. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 20:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But none of those things are mentioned in the article. I do not object to a well-sourced article that shows notability, but this is not it. If there was an assertion of notability here, then we could get back to talking about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 13:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
