<dd><b>Comment</b> I think many voters have, however, missed the point. I think that <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> is suggesting that if they do not bear the standard DVD logo, it may for a reason. Various companies have introduced copy-protected or otherwise restricted formats such as <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flexplay.html" title="Flexplay">Flexplay</a> and copy-protected CDs. The protection mechanism requires the format to differ from the standard, and therefore these formats are never in strict compliance with the standard. Standards organizations seem to be taking the principled (and realistic) stand that these products not really be reliably playable on all standard playback gear, and therefore may not bear the trademarked CD or DVD logos.</dd>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> is insinuating that consumers should regard"Disney DVDs" with suspicion, and that they may contain some kind of stealth DRM or copy protection or copy <i>tracking</i> mechanism which may be revealed at some later date. Since Disney is extremely assertive about IP protection, this is not a totally paranoid speculation.</dd>

<dd>I happen to agree that consumers should treat the absence of a standards logo as a red flag. Unfortunately, as far as I know any notion that Disney DVD's are not standard DVDs is speculation. The fact that Disney DVD's do not bear the DVD logo is a rather trivial fact, <i>unless</i> <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> or someone else can cite credible sources that suggest that there's more to this than Disney corporate ego.

<dd>Having an article on the subject could lead to further examination, thus having written down what we already know is not a bad idea. There is no reason why Disney could not have the standard DVD logo beside their own, other than the discs not really being DVDs. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> 05:05, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Splash, and stick to my original <b>Delete</b>.</dd>
<dd>If there were such a thing as a Disney DVD that wasn't just an ordinary DVD made by Disney with their custom logo, then an article that actually explained this would be great. As it stands, the current article is just speculation that Disney DVDs are somehow different without offering any explanation how.</dd>
<dd>It is quite common for CDs and DVDs to not carry their standard logos without necessarily having DRM present. I have not seen any evidence to the contrary (on Google, or on Slashdot, where people have often mentioned creating backup DVDs for children to use without damaging the original) that a Disney DVD is anything other than the standard format described <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html#DVD-Video" title="DVD">here</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovakreo_5e83.html" title="User:Novakreo">Novakreo</a> 28 June 2005 07:06 (UTC)

<dd>I have also backupped my <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copy_control.html" title="Copy control">copy controled</a> audio cds to my computer, and there still is DRM present, right? --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> 28 June 2005 07:26 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a>, the fact that the Disney DVD's carry a substitute for the DVD logo is a bit of subtrivia. It might be appropriate to mention it briefly in the context of some Disney article. However, DO NOT include any personal speculation about the significance of the fact UNLESS you actually have a verifiable outside REFERENCE you can cite as to what that significance might be. You could quote speculation by someone notable but you can't put in your own speculation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 28 June 2005 10:05 (UTC)

<dd>I was browsing DVDs at a store today and noticed that at least two Disney releases (<i>The Pacifier</i> and the Mickey/Donald/Goofy version of <i>The Three Musketeers</i>) carried the standard DVD Video logo. Also, if there were truly any special DRM voodoo, it seems that they would create similar names for their other labels—Touchstone, Miramax, etc. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><i>tregoweth</i></a> June 29, 2005 02:06 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. I'm sure the DVD Forum does not <i>require</i> licensees to carry the logo. On the Diskey disks, it is probably just Disney ego. I'm not a Disney-watcher, but I could easily imagine their having policy of never allowing any non-Disney logo to appear on their stuff. Certainly, I could imagine them thinking that having a special Disney DVD logo enhances their brand more than the lack of the regular DVD hurts them. Whatever... just musing out loud here, of course. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 29 June 2005 09:55 (UTC)</dd>
