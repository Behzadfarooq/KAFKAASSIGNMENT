<p><s>The result was <b>No consensus</b>. To be honest, this is really more a closure with "no action required", as the concern is that this article requires a lot of cleanup and that any useful content needs to be merged into <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>. As of this time, I note that there are {{cleanup}} and {{mergeto}} tags in this article, so I think it's safe to close it as no consensus at this time. If no further action is taken to address the concerns raised in this AfD, the best course of action would be to simply redirect this article (without merging) to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a> as redirects are cheap and I'm sure some content from this article has already been merged there anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 04:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p><b>Delete</b> This page should be deleted for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is poorly written.</li>
<li>It is made by a user who has been caught fabricating sources and evidence in the past.</li>
<li>It is made by a user who runs and or is affiliated with a pan Turkish website, which is clearly a website full of POV, origional research, and goes on to claim such things as "the Etruscans were Turkic" (See here: <a href="http://www.turkicworld.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.turkicworld.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).</li>
<li>The useful content on this page should be moved to the Scythia/Scythians page.</li>

<li><b>Question</b> Is there evidence that the material in this article is inaccurate or fabricated (beyond your assertion that one of the editors has done so in the past)? I certainly agree this article needs greater citation but as it does at least have two references at the bottom, this article seems a <b>Cleanup</b> issue, not an AfD.

<dd>The user that has created this article has been quite active at trying to push his POV on Scythia related articles. He has continuously been proven wrong yet still insists on pushing his POV. I believe two of the articles he has created have already been deleted. Also, I already said that usable information from this page should be transferred to the Scythia page.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 22:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Khosrow, in answer to my question if you have any evidence beyond your assertion of past behavior, you have responded with an assertion of past behavior. I'm not an admin, but looking at an item on <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">User:Barefact</a>'s [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact#Mediation_for_Scythian-related_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact#Mediation_for_Scythian-related_articles" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>] I see that both you and he entered a process of mediation with administrator <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a> three days ago (Oct 1) regarding "dispute over Ossetian Language, Scythia, and other disputes" (User: Barefact's words and assertion, not mine) which leads me to consider that this AfD is part of an ongoing user dispute between the two of you. I also see that admin <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a> was [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex_Bakharev#Scythians" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex_Bakharev#Scythians" rel="nofollow">notified</a>] regarding the creation of this article on that same day.</dd>

<dd>This is only on going because Barefact insists on putting his false information in. Also, I dont on which discussion page it was on, but User Ali Doostzadeh proved to everyone that Barefact falsified a quote to suit his opinion. What Barefact did not know was that Ali had the book that Barefact got and distorted the quote from.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 23:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I find it ironic in an AfD arguing about "proper sourcing" that you are a) unwilling to look up said discussion page to prove your point, or far more importantly: b) provide evidence that there is inaccuracy in the current article under AfD. If this user has improperly sourced in the past that is certainly cause for concern, but has nothing to do with the value or contents of THIS article. So far your only clear argument is that the article needs sources, which is certainly true, but suggests a <b>Cleanup</b> vote from AfD. Everything else appears to be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">Straw man</a> argument (including the argument about poor writing -- this article tends to severe run on sentences, but expresses itself decently), and that fact again suggests a <b>Cleanup</b>, not a Delete.</dd>

<dd>it is simple epmiricism, not a personal attack, to say that Barefact's contributions have been a useless waste of time. However, this is about deletion of the "Scythian European Kingdoms" article. The title should be deleted, see below; <i>some</i> (little enough) of the content can be merged into the Scythia article (also see below). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:03, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Much of the content of this article would pertain to the "Scythia" article. After the move, get rid of the "Scythian European Kingdoms" title because it is useless (wrong capitalisation, "European" is not a good concept in this case since the kingdoms in question were located in "Western Eurasia", squat on the 'boundary' of Europe and Asia. In fact, in classical terminology, 'Europe', 'Asia [minor]' and 'Scythia' are three terms on equal footing). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Please see the guidelines in the AfD box there regarding not blanking an article until the AfD discussion is closed.

<li>Not to be overly-argumentative dab, but AfD is not to destroy an article because it has some problems or a bad name. It's an open call to wikipedia editors to consider the possibility that an entire article should be removed in toto, based on the criteria in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_guidelines_2dea.html" title="Wikipedia:List of guidelines">Wikipedia guidelines</a>. Not being particularly familiar with this subject, I only entered this conversation as the nominating criteria above are NOT generally reasons for deletion, only for improvement and editing, which is generally discussed on the article discussion page. Based on his comment on my talk page, an admin will investigate if this article contains original research, which IS a valid reason for deletion. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>you seem to be confused. OR is no reason for deletion. An unsalvageable title is. Fwiiw, I <i>have</i> "investigated" this article and opted to move parts to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>. At this point, the deletion debate is about the title and edit history. Since I have copy-pasted some bits over to Scythia, we should not delete this one, strictly speaking, we should keep it for its edit history. I therefore suggest we move it to Scythian kingdoms and make that a redirect to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>, and then delete the new redirect at <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian_European_Kingdoms_0ea5.html" title="Scythian European Kingdoms">Scythian European Kingdoms</a>. does that make sense? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:10, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
