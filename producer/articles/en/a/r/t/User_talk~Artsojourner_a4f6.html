<p>You seem to be interested in art - at least, I assume so from your user page! You might like to look at the "years in art" articles, some of which I've done some work on over a long period. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_art.html" title="List of years in art">List of years in art</a> is still far from complete and might be an area where you could make a lot of contributions.

<p>Hi. I'm not very good with the photography side of things myself, but if you look around the edit pages you'll come across instructions for uploading images into articles. It takes a bit of trial and error to get it right - I've only done it once myself. I suggest you raise the query with one of the users who do it a lot, such as <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">User:Dante Alighieri</a>. They would be more use than me if you get stuck.</p>
<p>Yes, you can make changes to an article about yourself or someone you know, as long as you're careful. (Obviously you can't put stuff like "Artsojourner is the cleverest person on the planet" or anything like that!) Some people disapprove of the practice, but there's no rule that says you can't. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 18:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Artsojourner, great to see another visual arts editor on board - there are surprisingly few on wikipedia! Just wanted to say that my comments on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_years_in_art_7558.html" title="Talk:List of years in art">Talk:List of years in art</a> were not directed at your additions at all, in fact I was delighted to see another user help build the page and agree with your <i>Birth first, Deaths second, Events third</i> guideline.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">User:Deb</a> has built this resource almost single handly, and IMO, and with help from editors such as yourself, is a potential candiate for <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">Featured lists</a> someday. - <a href="../../../c/o/i/User%7ECoil00_d9ba.html" title="User:Coil00">Coil00</a> 19:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just try any way I can to help I am more interested in meaning and how people and art relate and I think this is a great project in that light.</p>
<p>Again thank you for your comments. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 09:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry this response is so tardy. I haven't checked my messages for a while. I was very excited to help with the integration of Betty Beaumont into the environmental sculpture/environmental art articles. She must be an absolutely amazing person. I cross-referenced her in every way I could think of, since her work really spans a lot of categories. What a giant she is (albeit definitely of the gentle variety)! (I can imagine meeting her at a party. "So, what have you been doing - while I was expanding the planetary consciousness?"...)

She talked a bit about her trials with her landlord and the new series she has been working on revolving around displacement of artists here in NYC and elsewhere. She is not aware that I decided to start this article. When and if she ever finds out I hope she is pleased. A gentle Giant indeed. She Rocks! I gotta tell you. We had actually met to discuss Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountian College among many other things and I tried to get her to talk about abut what she is doing now......Thank you for your contribution and help.

<p>Here's a suggestion for how to put together material for a short article before creating a Wikipedia page (thereby avoiding that speedy delete situation). While you can certainly assemble information and write a draft in another programmelike Word or Appleworks, you can also do this on a Wikipedia user sub page. The latter method has the advantage of allowing you to readily see whether or not the formatting will work (such things as notes [&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;], italics, wikilinks, etc.). All you have to do is start from your own user page: <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">User:Artsojourner</a>, add a backslash "/" and the name of the draft article (e.g. "/Pinky Bass") = User:Artsojourner/Pinky Bass. You can then start editing your new user sub page. You can add a link to the draft on your user page so it's easy to get to. When the article is "finished" (i.e. it contains enough useful information on the subject, written in an appropriately encyclopaedic style and with correct formatting) you can the ncopy and past it to a new Wikipedia article page. While you're working on the draft on your sub page, you can frewquently use the "Show preview" button to see how what you're writing will actually look when it's saved. One caution, don't add <i>Categories</i> to your draft, otherwise it creates confusion, just add the categories to the final Wikipedia article. Make sense? <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 14:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Geez! Hoary some of your edits and explanations seem so callous.

<dd>In just a day of recent edits, I find that you, instead of getting to the root of a problem or situation, had rather just delete it all rather than deal with it. I feel that this is a breach of respect for the other editors on here. You tend to overreach and have said in some of your edits that you dont have the time to bother. What does this mean? This seems pointless and ill conceived for you to waste all of this time if you dont wanna bother. In fact, you seem to have this idea that you know more about editing than anyone else on here. Anyone can just delete something. Deleting something is not the same as editing since deleting doesn't need any thought. Other editors spend their time building an article and adding pertinent information to include in these articles. You dont seem to respect your work on here as many of your comments seem pointless and harsh with no feeling other than disdain for what you are doing or bothering to do. It just leaves otehr editors frustrated and aggravated.</dd>

<p>Anyway, I couldn't find anything much on Lee Isaacs on the net so far (I tried searching "Isaacs, Lee" also).</p>

<dd>Yes he is correct--I will see it on the Afd-- but let me take the opportunity to suggest that you might try stronger first sentences: not "Lee Isaacs is an American photographer, living and working in Birmingham, Alabama." but "Lee Issacs is a notable American protographer, known in particular for ..." There are deletionists who don't read beyond the first sentence, and some delete anythingthat does not literally contain the word "notable" in that sentence. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I hope I was able to help. I've actually never heard of her or her art. I just browse through the deletion discussions and pick out some articles and try a google test. Depending on the results I can get from google, then, I either recommend deletion or keeping. I figured especially that if the Alabama State Council on the Arts saw fit to put her in a documentary, they know what they're talking about and she must be notable. Let me know if anyone shows up in that deletion discussion and makes strong arguments for deleting the article; I have a lot of experience with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and I can argue convincingly from policy. Also, if the article gets deleted anyway, let me know and I will begin the process of having it undeleted. =) Can't guarantee that I'll be successful, but I'm pretty confident about it.
