<p>William Faulkner's 1931 short story describes a lynch mob forming (despite ambiguous evidence) on a hot September evening. Told in five parts, the story includes the perspective of the rumored victim and the mob's leader.</p>
<p>Trivia: this is one of Faulkner's shorter stories.</p>
<p>It was originally published in Scribner's magazine, and later appeared in collections of his short stories.</p>
<p>It includes an appearance by Hawkshaw, the barber who was the focus of Faulkner's later story, Hair.</p>

<p>Carter High School is a relatively young school located in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Province of South Africa. Having opened its doors for the first time in January 1977 with 5 teachers and 53 pupils, it has grown into a large well respected school with an enrolment of approximately 1200 pupils and an academic staff of around 50. The learner population is drawn from more than 20 primary schools and comprises a great number of cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>The school derives its name from the Honourable Mr Justice T.F. Carter who sat on the Natal bench. The schools motto is, "Justitia et Veritas" ("Justice and Truth"), which links the schools present aims with the ideals for which Judge Carter stood.</p>
<p>At Carter, a holistic approach to education is underpinned by the principles of Justice and Truth within a caring environment where achieving a balance between the needs of the individual and those of society is a vital goal. Carter’s aim is to develop informed, responsible individuals capable of making decisions and interacting successfully within the context of their homes, families, workplaces and society.</p>

<p>A Brief History of Thomas Bowden</p>
<p>The history of the Great War Veteran Lieutenant-General Thomas Bowden can hardly ever be fully explained but I will try to put his great accomplishments to ink.</p>
<p>In 1901 Thomas McSnazzy was born in a remote town in Northern Ireland, from an early age it was apparent that the child was bound for great things. In 1902 Thomas Bowden (He changed his name as it wasn't snazzy enough.) swam the English Channel twice, the second time because he left his towel behind. When world war one erupted young Bowden was amongst the thick of the fighting, acting as a commissar and officer. One can only presume how many men died because of Thomas but the number would have to be above 700 (historians believe that at least half this number where actually the men that he executed for fleeing the battle.)</p>
<p>In 1934 on a visit to Hong Kong Bowden realized he had never been to America so he promptly swam the Pacific Ocean surviving off small aquatic rodents along the way. He reached America in 1942 and was conscripted in the army quickly rising to the rank of master chief amongst the marines. During this war he blew up Iwo Jima as it was the only way to stop the spreading of the Japanese, he did this by overloading a battleships engines (reference: Pillar of Autumn)</p>
<p>It was not until the Vietnam conflict that Bowden resurfaced. In 1965 as the first battle of the war raged in The La drang valley Thomas acted as a water boy for the soldiers at the front after having decided after blowing up Iwo Jima that he would never kill again. Bowden and Lieutenant Robby Taylor were left behind when the marines where evacuated. As Charlie advanced on the hill that the two men held Bowden was faced with a hard decision kill or be killed. Together the two troops bagged themselves at least 2400 Charlie. It was only after the two were evacuated that Robby revealed that he had been shot 76 times but had been too embarrassed to tell Thomas of his injuries (75% of these wounds where inflicted upon the lieutenant Robbies pants.</p>
<p>It is thought that these two great heroes’ now reside in Alaska where they drink Smirnoff ice and Bowden watches Rob dance for his amusement.</p>

<p>Thines is a beach situated 3 kms south of the town. It is sandy and long. In its part right where the road leads, the beach is organised with beach bars and cafes. There are also umbrellas and seaslongs (no fee for their use). Nightlife included... For those who seek silence and relaxation, the beach is so long that a few meters away from the beach bars, one can be quite isolated.</p>

<p>The complete Germs anthology. Everything from the very first recordings to the last efforts of the classic lineup, namely six songs done for the film Cruising. Only one was ever actually released on the soundtrack; Lion's Share.</p>
<p>The album was published in 1993 by Slash Records and is thought to be a prototype for hardcore punk.</p>
<p>It is really a shame that the Germs are better known for their trashy, selfdestructive and charismatic singer Darby Crash and his demise than for their music, because M.I.A. The Complete Anthology proves that they were easily one of the best bands on the LA punk scene in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Tracks:</p>
<p>1: Forming 2: Sex Boy 3: Lexicon Devil 4: Circle One 5: No God 6: What We Do Is Secret 7: Communist Eyes 8: Land of Treason 9: Richie Dagger's Crime 10: Strange Notes 11: American Leather 12: Lexicon Devil 13: Manimal 14: Our Way 15: We Must Bleed 16: Media Blitz 17: The Others Newest One 18: Let's Pretend 19: Dragon Lady 20: The Slave 21: Shut Down(Annihilation Man) 22: Caught In My Eye 23: Round And Round 24: My Tunnel 25: Throw It Away 26: Not All Right 27: Now I Hear The Laugther 28: Going Down 29: Lions Share 30: Forming 2</p>

1 FREEQUENCY CONVERTER I. FREQUENCY CONVERTER Frequency converter is circuit which converters A.C to D.C and after that D.C to controlled A.C. For conversion of A.C to D.C frequency converter uses rectifier bridge circuit. For conversion from D.C to controlled A.C it uses inverter circuit. Block diagram of frequency circuit is as follows</p>
<p>II. OPERATING PRINCIPLE OF FREQUENCY CONVERTER Frequency converter operation comprises of two steps. They are Rectifier operation for conversion of A.C to D.C Inverter operation for conversion of D.C to A.C i. RECTIFIER OPERATION For conversion of A.C to D.C we may use uncontrolled rectifiers i.e. diode rectifiers or controlled rectifiers i.e. thyristor rectifiers. In most of the cases uncontrolled rectifiers are used because of economy. IGBT inverters are used if we want to use the regenerative power from inverter circuit to feed back to supply terminals.</p>
<p>ii. INVERTER OPERATION For conversion of D.C to controlled A.C we use voltage source inverter circuit in general. Now days mostly IGBT are exclusively used for inverter circuits. D.C link capacitor is used in the middle stage in order to smooth the D.C input to the inverter circuit.</p>
<p>2 RECTIFIER</p>
<p>Rectifier is a device which converts A.C to D.C .In most of the frequency converter circuit’s diode bridge rectifier is used for rectifier operation because of its easy operation and less cost. For understanding the rectifier operation easily we consider single phase bridge rectifier as shown bellow. During positive half cycle diode D1 and D4 are forward biased. During this interval diode pair D1 and D4 will be conducting. During negative half cycle diode pair D3 and D4 are forward biased and they will conduct current through the load during negative half cycle. During this operation direction voltage and current are in unique direction. So the resultant output voltage and current are regarded as D.C</p>
<p>3 phase diode bridge rectifier circuit is as shown bellow</p>
<p>Each diode pair conducts for 60o depending on the line voltage of the supply which is subjected to maximum of line to line voltage. Output waveform of the dc voltage is as shown bellow</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: In all practical rectifier circuits uses a capacitor at the out put stage in order to reduce the ripple voltage in the output stage. With the increase in size of capacitor the ripple content in the output voltage decreases with increase in effective cost and size of rectifier. Diode rectifiers are uncontrolled rectifiers. SCR rectifiers are known as controlled rectifiers as we can control the magnitude of output voltage. Also with in crease in number of pulses the ripple factor for voltage approaches zero.</p>
<p>3 INVERTER I. Inverter Inverter is circuit which converts A.C to D.C or D.C to A.C. If the input to the inverter is a voltage source then that inverters are known as Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). The other type of inverters is known as Current Source Inverters. Voltage source inverters are divided into three categories. 1. Pulse width modulated inverters 2. Square wave inverters 3. Square wave inverters with voltage cancellation. II. Pulse width modulated inverter</p>
<p>In PWM inverters in order to produce sinusoidal output voltage at required frequency a sinusoidal signal at rated frequency is compared with triangular waveform to produce switching pulses. In PWM inverters, inverter will control magnitude and frequency of output voltage. Amplitude modulation ratio is the ratio between control voltages to triangular voltage.</p>
<p>Frequency modulation ratio is defined as ratio between switching frequency and frequency of control signal.</p>

<p>Many people think of it as a sack with meat in it. However it happens to be an insult. After months of research and watching movies I had only ever heard it being used once. Men In Black After the bug takes the woman from the morgue, Will Smith tells him stop and he says "see you later meatsack". After viewing this moment i was shocked, up till then i thought i had created that word. So please people be on the look out for the phrase "Meatsack". It may turn up anywhere.</p>

<p>William Lucardie is an Australian contemporary bush poet known for his broad array of modern writing styles incorporated into a colonial Australian setting, he is perhaps the youngest person currently involved heavily in the field. Some of his popular works inculde, <i>The Dutch Pudding Can Man</i> and <i>Journeys</i>. Also in conjunction with his works in literature he has made 3 albums over the past 5 years, however only one of these was released and even so was distributed in such small numbers very few people are aware of his works. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Will69.jpg">Image:Will69.jpg</a></p>

<p>Born in 1982 in the small Victorian town of Swan Hill William Lucardie travelled through his childhood and adolescent years attending school and assisting his father, Bill, in his Crane Hire Business, which inspired much of his work, such as <i>Crane Summer</i>. William was a fervent player of Australian Rules Football, Cricket and was quite partial to fishing, his fondness of the latter reflected in his second album <i>I Love To Fish</i>.</p>

<p>During the year of 2006 William recieved heavy flak and criticism from the media when he released his latest collection of poems that condemned soccer and its participants. William, a radical anti-soccer individual, labelled soccer in his poems as "shit", "faggot sport" and "the scourge of the sporting world." Despite heavy backlash William claims to still stand by what he said and believes all those to be associated with soccer to be "un-Australian".</p>

LivRe! is the portal developed by CNEN - Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear (Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission), through its CIN - Centro de Informações Nucleares (Nuclear Information Center), aiming to ease the identification and the access to free journals available on the Internet.</p>
<p>The Portal covers scientific journals, magazines, bulletins and newsletters.</p>
<p>Free access journals are spreaded over several categories:</p>
<p>free access to all the issues and articles. Great part of the titles are included in this category; free access requiring mandatory registration; free access only during a pre-established period from the publishing on; free access only after a period following publishing; partial free access, that means, only part of the articles are available for free. The following data are available for each title: time coverage, language, secondary sources indexing the title, if it is a peeer reviewed journal, optional comments and contents description, as supplied by the publisher.</p>
<p>Beyond displaying journals by initial letter of its title, searches can be done by title words and by subject field.</p>
<p>Searches can be refined selecting only peer-reviewed journals or only journals indexed by any secondary source.</p>
<p>Your collaboration by sending us comments or suggestions is essential to improve the LivRe! Portal. Talk to us, pointing out new journals for inclusion, suggesting new features or amending mistakes you have detected.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, Matt Rosen is world renkown for his overall exellence. Born from humble beginings on October 29 1993, Rosen gained the Annual Montmorency Buns Award for Oustanding Achievment in the field of being excellency. After retiring at being the best (age 12), Rosen succesfully signed to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex_Crusaders_84f3.html" title="Middlesex Crusaders">Middlesex Crusaders</a> Cricket team, and was quickly contracted on to the Englandd set-up, where he Kept Wicket and opened the batting, setting a new record for the highest score. As Rosen un-famously said (due to Shakespeare copying) 'To be or not to be, that is the question'*</p>
<p>He currently attends University College School.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Note: For those skeptical enough to realise Shakespeare was alive long before Rosen, let me assure you that he has also invented time (and space) travel, and will be willing to share it with anyone... for the right price (just ask <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a>). To meet rosen to discuss these matters, all you have to do is smash your head 73 times on a circular piece of reinforced polycarbonate meisuring 17" x 19" and backed with a solid piece of platinum- this is to make sure you are rich enough to afford time travel (and the surgery to fix your head).</li>

Hannah Marcus is a little known genius who lives in the suburbs of London. She is often confused with the singer who bears her name, something she has born with patience for many years. Her Grandfather Raphael Marcus was a brilliant man who was one of the only surgeons who would operate on a patient who refused blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Marcus was the original inventor of time and space travel, but her so called friend Matt Rosen stole the secret one day three years ago and is now selling it for exorbitant prices. However, the part of speech and clothes decoders, he never found, so anyone wishing to buy the full package should contact Marcus through the Australian outback phone system, (as seen in Crocodile dundee Two).</p>
<p>Marcus is renowned for her amazing English work, and won the Cardinal Biggles English Prize for a book she has wriiten under a pseudonym of Katherine Mahogany.</p>

<p>EL.DY.K (ELliniki DYnami Kyprou) is the code name for the greek military regiment that is stationed in the Repuplic of Cyprus as a result of the zurich-london treaties. A similar force was formed by the Turks and was sent to Cyprus because at that time the newly formed Republic didn't have any direct military protection.ELDYK was then stationed at a military camp near the village of Gerollakos. The formation of the National Guard didn't have any affect on ELDYK because its soldiers and officers were only greek citizens.In 15 July 1974, units of the National Guard led by officers loyal to the greek military regime overthrew the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Archbishop Macarios, who escaped the attack against him by miracle and went to London. This caused the Turkish reaction and accusations that the greek cypriots were preparing to unite with Greece in one state, the famous "Enosis".To protect the turkish cypriots, Turkey prepared an invasion that started at the morning of 20 July 1974.Infantry landed near the city of Kyrenia but the resistance of minor national guard forces made the first two days very difficult. In the night of 20/21 July 1974, ELDYK was sent, by the greek commanders in Greece and Cyprus, against Kioneli, a village that was the base of the Turkish Force of Cyprus and many armed turkish cypriots. Without any help from artillery and other heavy weaponry, it had some successful progress but couldn't advance to the final target.It withdrew to its camp with minimal losses. After the first peace treaty and the seize of fire, the Turks continued to send troops and heavy weaponry even though the dictatorship in Greece had fallen in the meantime.In 14 August 1974, ATTILA 2 started and the Turkish forces launched a big offensive against Nicosia and the greek cypriot lines. The resistance lines broke and the Turks attacked the airport of Nicosia but there they faced heavy fire coming from greek commandos, that had arrived from greece during the first hostilities, and the men of ELDYK. Turks withdrew and the airport was given to UN. In 14 August 1974,Turkish heavy infantry force followed by M48 tanks came close to the military camp of ELDYK in Gerollakos. At that time the regiment of ELDYK was resisting the turkish invasion in other sectors of Nicosia and a minimum force was left to guard the camp, around 40-50 men armed only with their rifles and grenades. Turks attacked immediately but their casualties were severe.Three attacks were useless so they waited for the next day. The greek morale was high due to the leadership of Captain Sotiris Stayrianakos who stood up there. Turks launched 2 attacks the next day suffering great losses but the time was up for the Greek defenders. Without ammunition and any coverage from other units, 33 soldiers led by their captain attacked the Turks and were killed by them. Rumour says that the Turks blew up everything in the camp, even the wounded ones, because of the fear of further casualties. Everyone of the defenders is either missing or killed in action. "Sotiris Stayrianakos" military camp is the center of the ELDYK regiment that is still positioned near Nicosia.</p>

Samvedi is a local community from Vasai, Thane, Maharashtra. It's the group which followed the Samavedic Brahmins as their House Purohits. 'Samveda' is one of the four Veda's. as Lord Krishna himself proudly said " Vedanam Samvedosmi". Basically from Eastern India these Brahmans settled in South Vasai in 700BC to 300BC during the period of Emperor Ashoka or before. In South Vasai Aagashi, Vatar, Kofrad, Bolinj, Umrale, Naale, Rajodi, Wagholi, Mardes, Gaas, Navaale &amp; Bhuigaon are the only 12 villages where Samvedi Brahmans are residing. This place is near to the Holy Pilgrimage named Vimala Sarovar (Nirmal).Main sarnames of these Brahmans are Vaze, Naik, Joshi, Mhatre, Patil, Deshmukh, Vartak. The prominent Brahmans here include Koknastha Brahmins, Karhade Brahmans and Gujrathi Brahmans, who are entitled to perform poojas of these Holy Places.</p>

Crest A coney segreant Argent. Supporters (granted 16 April 1692), Two lions Gules each charged with 3 billets and crowned with a ducal crown Or. A long pedigree is recorded in the Ulter's Office.</p>
<p>MP (Whig) for Leominster, 1679-1681, 1685-87, 1689-1710, and 1715 - 16; Stong Whig Com. of Appeals in the Excise 1689-90:</p>
<p>Joint Reciever &amp; Paymaster General of the Forces , June 1690-98; after that date the office of sole Paymaster Gen was united to that of Vice Treasurer.</p>
<p>Distinguished himself in the battle of the Boyne, 1 July 1690, (The handkerchief with which he staunched a wound there recieved by King William, was (1888) at Casiobury Park, Herts, the seat of the Earl of Essex), and at Aughrim, 12 July 1691;</p>
<p>One of the Lords justices of Ireland Sept1690-92. On 7 April 1692, he was cr. BARON CONINGSBY OF CLANBRAZIL, Co Armagh.</p>
<p>He took his seat 5 Oct 1692, and in the next parliament 6 Oct 1698; he also sat in the 1st Parliament of Queen Anne, but not later.</p>
<p>Vice Treasurer 1692-1710; High Steward of Hereford, 1695 till his death Cutos Rot. and Lord Lieut of cos. Hereford and Radnor, 1714-21</p>
<p>CONINGSBY OF HAMPTON COURT</p>
<p>On 18 June 1716, he was cr. BARON CONINGSBY OF CONINGSBY, Co. Lincoln, both being with a spec.rem. An ardent supporter of the revolution of 1688, and throughout his life resolutly resisted, somerimes with more zeal than discression the aims of the Jacobite fashion. When William crossed to Ireland, Coningsby was with him, and when the King was wounded at the battle of the Boyne, he was by his master's side. He was appointed joint reciever and paymaster-general of the forces employed in the reduction of Ireland, and from 1690 to 1692 he acted as junior of the three lord justices of Ireland, together with Lord Sydney, the treaty of Limerick, so it is said, having been arranged through his skill. His political opponents accused him of having used his position to gratify his greed. The embezzlement of stores, the appropriation of the estates of rebels, the sale of pardons, and dealings in illicit trade were among the offences imputed to him; but such among the ofences were of slight moment so long the royal influence was at his back.</p>
<p>Through the kings favour he was created Baron Coningsby of Clanbrassil in Ireland on 1 April 1692, sworn as privy councillor on 13 April 1693, and pardoned under the great seal in May l694 for any transgressions which he might have committed whilst in office in Ireland. From 1695 to his death he held the honourable office of chief steward of the city of Hereford, an appointment which involved him in a duel with Lord Chandos, another claimant of the post, ‘but no mischief was done.’</p>
<p>In April 1697 he received a grant under the privy seal of several of the crown manors in England, and in October 1698 he was again created the vice-treasurer and paymaster of the forces in Ireland. During Queen Anne’s reign he acted consistently with the whigs. but his services received slight acknowledgement even when his friends were in office. All that Godolphin did was to write a civil letter or two complimenting Lord Coningsby on his judgement and experience in parliamentary affairs, and it was not until October 1708 that Coningsby was sworn of Anne’s privy council. He was one of the managers of Sacheverell’s trial, and, like most of time prominent whigs, he lost his seat in parliament through the tory reaction which ensued.</p>
<p>With the accession of George I he resumed his old position in public life, and once more basked in court favour. He was included in the select committee of twenty- one appointed to inquire into the negotiations for the treaty of Utrecht, and, according to Prior, was one of the three most inquisitive members of that body. As a result of their investigations, the impeachment of Bolingbroke was moved by Wallpole, that of Harley by Coningsby a family feud had long exited between the two Herefordshire families of Harley and Coningsby and Ormonde’s by Stanhope. Two years later Harley was unanimously discharged, but this concord of opinion was only obtained by Coningsby and some others withdrawing from the proceedings.</p>
<p>For his zeal in behalf of the Hanoverian succession he was well re-warded. The lord-lieutenancy of Herefordshire was conferred on him in November 1714, and in the following month he obtained the same pre-eminence in Radnorshire. A barony in the English peerage was granted to him on 18 June 1715, and he was raised to the higher dignity of Earl Coningsby on 30 April 1719. In the later years of his life Coningsby was involved in perpetual trouble, he was a widower, without any male heir, and with innumerable lawsuits.</p>
<p>For some severe reflections on Lord Harcourt, the lord chancellor, in connection with these legal worries, he was, as Swift notes in his diary, committed to the Tower on 27 Feb. 1720. After having having been in ill health for some time, he died at the family seat of Hampton, near Leominster, on 1 May 1729.</p>
<p>By his first wife, Barbara Gorges, whom he married in February 1674, and from whom he was divorced, he had four daughters and three sons, and his grandson by this marriage succeeded to the Irish barony, but died without issue on 18 Dec. 1729. his second wife, whom he married in April 1639, was Lady Frances Jones, daughter of Richard, Earl of Ranelagh, by whom he had one son, Richard, who died at Hampton on 2 April 1708 when two years old, choked by a cherrystone; and two daughters, Margaret and Frances. The second countess was buried at Hope-under- Dinmore on 23 Feb. 1714-15, aged 42; and Lord Coningsby was buried in the same church in 1729, under a handsome marble monument, on which the child’s death is depicted in striking realism.</p>
<p>The grant of his English peerage contained a remainder for the eldest daughter of his second marriage. Her issue male, John, the only child of this daughter, Margaret, countess of Coningsby, by her husband, Sir Michael Newton, died an infant, the victim of an accidental fall, said to have been caused though the fright of its nurse at seeing an ape, and on the mothers death in 1761 the title became extinct. The younger daughter of Lord Coningsby mar-ried Sir Charles Hanbury Williams. the well-known satirical poet, and was buried in the chapel of St. Erasmus, Westminster Abbey, in December 1781.</p>
<p>Coningsby’s troubles in law arose from his purchase of the manors of Leominster and Marden. After elaborate investigations, he convinced himself that the lord’s rights had in mamy instances been trespassed upon by the copyhold tenants. He caused ejectments to be brought against many persons for being in possession of estates as freehold which lie claimed to be copyhold, and as these claims were resisted by the persons in possession, his last days were embittered by constant strife. his collections concerning Marden were printed in 1722-7 in a bulky tome, without any title-page, and with pagination of great irregularity, but were never published. When his right to the Marden property was disputed, all the copies of this work but a few were destroyed, and these now fetch a high price in the book-market. Some proofs of his irritable disposition have been already mentioned. Through his sharpness of temper he was exposed to the caustic sallies of Atterbury in the house of Lords and to the satires of Swift and Pope in their writings.</p>
<p>His speech to the mayor and common council of the city of Hereford in 1718 on their presumed attachment to the Pretender, a speech not infrequently mixed with oaths, is printed in Richard Johnson’s ‘Ancient Customs of Hereford’ (1882), pp. 2254;. A. portrait of Coningsby and his two daughters, Margaret and Frances, was painted bv Knellet in 1722, and engraved by Vertue in 1723. The peer’s coat-of-arms is on the left hand, and a roll of Magna Charta is in his hand. His two daughters are dressed in riding ha-bits, and with a greyhound and King Charles’s spaniel. He was also painted by Kneller ..singly and there is a whole-length of him in 1709 in his robe as vice-treasurer of Ireland.</p>
<p>Numerous letters and papers relating to him are preserved in public and private collections, but especially among the manuscripts of Lord de Ros, his descendant (Hist. MSS. ‘Comm. 4th Rep.), and the Marquis of Ormonde and the Rev. T. W. Webb, of Hardwick Vicarage, Herefordshire (ib. 7th Rep.) (Chesters Registers of Westminster Abbey, p. 433; Robinsons Mansions of Herefordshire, p146-9; Townsend’s Leominster, 1341-1381: Luttrells Relation of State Affairs (1857).

<p>He married&#160;:-</p>
<p>1stly (lic Vic Gen, 18 Feb. 1674/5) Barbara, daughter of Ferdinando Georges, of Eye, co Hereford, a merchant from Barbados and of St Barthomomew by the Exchange, London merchant, she being about 18 and he about 19. This marriage (after the birth of seven children) was disolved by Act of Parliament).</p>
<p>NOTE&#160;:- Ferdinando Gorges, of Eye in Herefordshire, a merchant from Barbados, contrived to possess himself of some of the Coningsby estates, and to marry his eldest daughter Barbara to Thomas Coningsby when a lad. The marriage licence was applied for to the vicar general of the Archbishop of Canterbury on 18 Feb 1674-5, when Coningsby was described as aged about nineteen, and Barbara Gorges was stated to be about eighteen years old. (Marriage Licences , 1558-1690, Harleian Soc, xxiii,237).</p>
<p>The missdeeds of Ferdinando, who is sometimes styled Captain Gorges, were productive of ruinous loss to his son-in-law, from which he could never suceed in extracting himself. She was living as late as 1715</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2ndly, about 23 April 1698, against her father's wish, (Her father disinheriting her and leaving all his money to Greenwich Hospital. Francis, younger of the two daughters and coheirs (whose issue became sole heir) of Richard (Jones), Earle of Ranelagh. She who was born 1674, died at Hampton Court, 19, and was buried 23 Feb 1714/15 at Hope under Dinmore, co. Hereford.</p>
<p>Admon 5 Feb 1717/8</p>
<p>He died 1/5/1729 and was buried 9 May 1729 at Hope under Dinmore, aged about 73. The Barrony of CONINGSBY them became extinct, but the Earldom devolved.</p>
<p>Note:- His hanging a man named Gafney without trial in 1691 in Ireland, was afterwards made the subject of a serious parliamentary enquiry at Westminster, and found to have been an arbitrary and illegal act. Mathew Prior fiercely attacked him in a long and indiferent ballard, and Pope refers scornfuly to his "harangues." His gallentry at the Boyne and Aughtrim got him his Barrony, and his zeal for the Hanoverian cause his Earldom. He was a dull, muddleheaded man, as can be gathered from his State Paper on the policy of William and Anne; he hated Harley,and when the later was told at the same time of his threatened impeachment that Coningsby had declared that he would have his head, he replied, "I am sorry I cannot return the compliment, for I would not have his if he would give it to me!</p>
<p>FROM Members of Parliament page 115/116:-</p>
<p>" Coningsby, Thomas (1657 - 1729), of Hampton Court, Herefordshire Leominster 1679 (Oct.), 1681, 1685, 1689, 1690, 1695, 1698, 1701, (Feb.), 1701 (Dec.), 1702, 1705, 1708, 1715 - 18, June 1716</p>
<p>Coningsby’s ancestors had been landholders in the West Midlands since the reign of’ Edward I. Sir I Humphrey Coningsby, a judge, bought Hampton Court, four miles from Leominster, about 1510 between the accession of Elizabeth I and the Civil War his descendants were seven times elected for three counties. Coningsby’s grandfather, Fitzwiliam Coningsby, was expelled from the long parliament as a monopolist; he was replaced in the House by his Humphrey Coningsby, who was like wise soon disabled as at Royalist. ‘His estate valued at £4,000 pa. was heavily mortgaged; Coningsby described his grandfather as ‘a man of great extravagancy and expense, as well as beyond description negligent in the management of his affairs’.</p>
<p>Their fine was set at £4,000 on a declared rental of just over £800 p.a. but much of it was seemingly never paid. When Fitzwilliam Coningsby’ stood for Leominster in 1661 he was denied the poll because he was in prison for debt; he was not on good terms with his eldest son, (from whom he alienated what-ever be could, including the furniture and the title-deeds. Coningsby’s mother escaped from her husband’s creditors for a time by obtaining a post at Court, but by 1675 she was a prisoner in the King’s Bench, and her steward, without her know-ledge or consent, arranged the marriage of Coningsby. who was only just turned 17, with the daughter of Ferdinando Gorges. a notorious slaver called the ‘King of the Blacks’. The marriage to a woman equally lacking in sense and breeding turned out quite as badly as might have been expected, though the financial acumen of Con-ingsby’s father-in-law soon pulled the estate round. A local historian describes Coningsby as ‘contending against the disadvantages of a neglected educa-tion, although he never overcame the evil effects of a want of early discipline and self controll.</p>
<p>Upright, courageous and high-principled, though vain, impulsive and impatient of control, Lord Coningsby’s greatest enemy was himself."</p>
<p>Coningsby was first returned for Leominster at the second general election of 1679 in place of James Pytts who had voted against exclusion. Hence-forward he was to be invariably elected ‘whether absent or present, without trouble or expense’. When he left for Westminster, Gorges, who was a cousin of Shaftesbury, urged him ‘to write to him all the proceedings of Parliament ... to encourage the people to choose him again, seeing him stand up 4r the good of the subject so much, and advising the mobile of that corporation every post’. An active Member, he was named to ten committees in the second Exclusion Parliament, of which the most important was to prepare an address insisting on exclusion, but he did not speak. He was duly re--elected to the Oxford Parliament, which he ‘very nobly attended with good horses and men, according to his brother-in-law. He was appointed to the committee of elections and privileges, and secured an unexpected success with his maiden speech, when he proposed that the hapless Secretary Jenkins should carry Fitzharris impeachment to the Lords. Writing to Gorges, he complained that instead of sitting like a free Parliament, he thought they sat more like a company of slaves in a garrison… The King’s guards were the greatest grievance of the nation’ At a meeting in the lodgings of John Scudamore, Lord Scudarnore, Shaftsbury is said to have offered Coningsby a captaincy in the revolutionary army. As the most moderate of the Herefordshire Whigs, Coningsby and Scudarnore were on excellent terms until Mrs Coningaby discovered through the keyhole— an intrigue be-tween her husband and Lady Scudamore.</p>
<p>Coningsby remained under suspicion of holding Whig cabals at his home, attended by John Birch and John Dutton Colt. Laurence Hyde advised him not to stand in 1685 unless with the approval of the Duke of Beaufort (Henry Somerset’). Never the less he was re-elected. In James II’s Parliament he was named to two unimportant committees, and a speech sometimes attributed to him was probably delivered by Thomas Christie. He was restored to the commission of the peace in 1687. but he returned negative answers in 1688 on the repeal at the Test Act and Penal Laws, and was again removed.</p>
<p>In the Convention, Coningsby was again an active Member, serving on 47 committees, acting as teller in eight divisions and making eight recorded speeches. According to Ailesbury’s list he voted to agree with the Lords that the throne was not vacant and he took part in the inquiry into the authors and advisers of grievances ordered on 5 Mar. 1689 He was appointed to the committee for the Wye and Lugg navigation, and with Paul Foley acted as teller against adjourning the debate. He showed a keen interest in Irish affairs, being appointed to the committees to inquire into the delays over the relief of Londonderrv and to consider raising money from the forfeited estates of Irish Jacobites. He took part in preparing the bill of attainder, but was against muss exceptions to the bill of indemnity. "This is lumping indeed!’ he exclaimed, he acted at teller with Sir Patience Ward on an amendment to the bill for restoring corporations 23 July, and Sir Edward Harlev wrote with evident relief: ‘Mr Coningsby carried himself very worthily’. Harley was probably less satisfied with Coningsby in the second session. IHis concern with Ireland continued; he was appointed to the committee for the, relief of refugees, but he acted as teller for adjourning the’ debate on Commissary Shales. on 26 Nov; and commended the modesty of George Churchill in the sums he took for convoys, He was teller for adjourning the debate on the bill for restoring corporations on 2 Jan.1690. and probably voted’ against the disabling clause. A few days later he told the House: ‘Surrenderers were the scaffolds, And regulators were the builders: will you leave them Out?"</p>
<p>Coningsby remained a firm whig, nevertheless. He was in high favour with William III after ban-daging the latter’s wound at the battle of the Boyne. His last years were darkened by domestic bereave-ment, unsuccessful litigation and political reverses, He died on May 1729, and his grandson, the last of the family, survived him by only a few months."</p>

A strange person, called Oliver Bussel was revealed as the killer after being caught red-handed, as it were, as 'Jack the Stripper'. He tried to run, but tripped on his laces and ended up sprawled half-naked across the front of a van, which braked and flung him skywards. His penis landed underneath a bus. He survived, but later hung himself by his testicles in his prison cell.</p>

<p>Disney is a channel run by The Walt Disney Company. Disney Channel shows a variety of shows for teens as well as younger children. After every 65 shows for each series, Disney stops it. In the 90's, Disney aired shows that were suspenseful, like The Famous Jett Jackson, and scary, like So Weird. These shows have been stopped because they have completed their 65 episodes. Even though these shows and others were popular, Disney stopped them. However, some people have noticed that new Disney channel shows such as That's So Raven have passed their 65 episode limit. That's So Raven is an extremely popular show on Disney. Now the question is, why doesnt Disney Channel bring back all these old shows? Many people would like it if they did. There are online petitions that show how much they want these old shows back.</p>
<p>Ex. <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/dis33pet/petition.html" class="external free" title="http://www.petitiononline.com/dis33pet/petition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petitiononline.com/dis33pet/petition.html</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-18_16a6.html" title="Edit section: Fire Dance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fire Dance</span></h2>
<p>Loie Fuller’s dancing progressed from Vaudeville skirt dancing to inspirational abstract art when she extended her skirts with bamboo rods. <i>Fire Dance</i>, or <i>Le Danse de Feu</i>, was one of the first dances with these rods and it was also one of the first to utilize the new electric lights to their full effect. <i>Fire Dance</i> began as the <i>Dance of the Sun</i> in her 1895 production of <i>Salome</i>. It premiered as a solo in 1896 to a stunned and mesmerized audience.</p>
<p>Part of what captured the audience’s attention was Loïe’s abstract (or what we now call Modern) movement, but the other part was the way in which she utilized the new electric stage lights. Before this time, Ballets and Operas we performed with gas front lights to a still illuminated house. They also used all kinds of lavish sets or at least painted backdrops. Loïe did away with any kind of colorful background and hung the stage in black velvet. She also turned out the house lights. From the darkness she would appear, first as a ghostly creature then as an illuminated jewel in the center of the stage.</p>
<p>The trap door was removed and replaced with a pane of glass. From below this, two of the new electric lights shined upwards through the glass. Another light came from directly above the dancer, while still others came from the sides at all angles. Doing away with the standard ‘front light only’ created a depth to her movement the audience was not used to. Now add to that her work with color.</p>
<p>Loïe was the first to create and use color scrollers. She took large circles of glass and painted on gelatin of various reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues and violets. These disks were then mounted at the front of the light and were turned by the hand. For <i>Fire Dance</i> she had over 14 electricians manning a light each and they would take the cue to change to the next color from Loie’s brother, who was her master electrician. Stationed at one of the lights below Loïe, he would take a cue from her foot, then turn his wheel slowly to the next blue or purple. Seeing this change the electricians at the shins would rotate to their next color, and so on up to the final man hanging from the cat walk directly above Loïe. These effects in the pitch black of the stage and house, where what made her living fire such a success.</p>
<p>This success was due in part to the Art Nuevo movement of that time in Paris. The idea of a women becoming fire was directly in line with the link of humans and nature. She inspired artists like Toulouse Lautrec, Jules Cheret and Pierre Roche. August Rodin did a number of studies of dancers, based on inspiration and coaxing from Loïe. And Loïe taught and mentored Isadora Duncan before Duncan went on to be given the crown of “mother of Modern dance”.</p>

<p>ThanksUSA is a non-profit, non-partisan 501(c)(3) foundation whose acronym stands for Treasure Hunt Aiding Needs of Kids (and Spouses) of those Serving the United States of America. Begun in early 2005 by two Virginian youngsters, Rachel, 10, and Kelsi Okun, 8, on a family vacation, ThanksUSA is an online treasure hunt focused around American history, geography, and culture. By solving puzzles and games like crosswords and soduku using clues based on facts from 12 different states, players get the chance to compete for an array of grand prizes such as mountain bikes, electronics, a chest full of jewels, a trip to Disney World, and even an all-expense paid vacation to Washington, DC for four with exclusive access to monuments and federal buildings as well as accommodations at the historic Willard Intercontinental hotel.</p>
<p>ThanksUSA has gained national media attention. It was designed to thank the troops for their service overseas as well as support their families here in the States. Donations given during registration as well as independently from such federal agencies as the Department of Defense and private agencies like the Walt Disney Company, the Motion Picture Association of America, and CBS help to provide secondary-education scholarships to children of those at war in addition to prizes offered in this hunt. “Your goal in Thanks is: Number one, to have fun. Number two, to spend time with your family. Number three, to thank the troops. Number four, to learn about history,” says Rachel Okun, a fourth-grader from McLean, VA.</p>
<p>The girls’ mother, Deanna Okun, vice chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission and their father, B. Robert Okun, vice president of NBC universal along with their former teacher, Carolyn Ferek, from Haycock Elementary school have arranged the financial details of the military family scholarship program. This year’s scholarship deadline has already lapsed as of May 30, 2005 with around 4,000 participants in the running for 1,000 scholarships from $1,000 to $5,000 each; however, more than 500 applicants have already signed-up for the 2007 scholarship contest. The treasure hunt portion of ThanksUSA began on Memorial Day (May 29, 2005) and lasts until Labor Day (September 4, 2006); all U.S. citizens can play.</p>
<p>Mike Hacker, a spokesman for ThanksUSA, says, “This treasure hunt is about American values, culture and history. These are the things are soldiers are defending. We all have an obligation to support those who defend us and to let them know we care about the job they are doing for us all.”</p>

<p>Special science While the goal of modern physics is a so-called "unification", such that all of reality is subsumed under a single, elegant, and deduced "law" of science, there are peculiarities that seem to exist on each of the many levels of organization of the material systems of the universe. Each level of organization may be said to have a special science that pertains to it, even though as scientists, we might rather find the commonality between levels. Matters of discipline structure, the history of science, and even mere jargon contribute to this complexity. Many aspects of "special science" are merely different names provided for homologous and fundamental natural laws.</p>

<p>This forum created by Lukage (with help of other General forumers) serves the purpose of hosting the people of the Starkingdoms Public forums.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">gb2gt</a> stands for 'go back to game talk', which refers to the <a href="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=11" class="external text" title="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=11" rel="nofollow">Game Talk</a> in the StarKingdoms public forums. This is used to tell the people of Game Talk to stay out of the General Forums and keep to their own kind. Being a Game talker is a crime against the world, this is why <a href="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">gb2gt</a> was created. <a href="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">gb2gt</a> is a safe place where General forumers can be to get away from the crap that Starkingdoms Public forums have. Such as Game Talker, Forum Nazi's and Server Down Times.</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">gb2gt</a> was to make a forum exclusive to the <a href="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=3" class="external text" title="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=3" rel="nofollow">General</a> forumers and to keep out the people of <a href="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=11" class="external text" title="http://forums.starkingdoms.com/viewforum.php?f=11" rel="nofollow">Game Talk</a>. <a href="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gb2gt.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">gb2gt</a> created a Starkingdoms community without the need of Starkingdoms. Without Game Talk all the General forumers are able to communicate peacfully. People of Game Talk still may join up, this is why a 'Training Area' was created to help put some intelligence into these mind deprived lost souls</p>

<p>Today, 17th July, 2006, I flew in the aircraft called the 'Four Aces,' which had once been a part of the 'Flying Circus.' It was flown out of Smith Field in Fort Wayne, Indiana as a part of the 'American Barnstormers Tour 2006.' The lady who sold me my ticket said that it used to be piloted by Jimmie Woods. My pilot wore white coveralls and was named Gary Lust. It was a wonderful experience. --199.8.208.34 23:13, 17 July 2006 (UTC)Anon.</p>

<p>Constable Robin Cameron, 29, originally of Beardy's-Okemasis First Nation Reserve, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, along with her partner, Constable Marc Bourdages, 26, originally of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Eustache%2C_Quebec_e19e.html" title="Saint-Eustache, Quebec">Saint-Eustache, Quebec</a>, responded to a reported assault July 7th, 2006 near the small community of Spiritwood, located in central <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>. Curtis Alfred Dagenais, 41, was involved in a dispute with his mother and sister, apparently concerning inheritance of family property. Dagenais feld upon Cameron and Bourdages arrival and led two RCMP vehicles on a 15 km chase down country roads. The chase ended in the area south of Maldrid, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>. Dagenais fired several high-powered shotgun bullets into the front windshield of the lead car containing Constables Robin Cameron and Marc Bourdages. Both officers sustain tremendous head injuries. The officer in the second car was able to return fire as Dagenais turned his shotgun on her, however Dagenais succeeded in slipping into the surrounding dense bush as she contacted aid for the wounded Bourdages and Cameron.</p>

<p>Cameron received care at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_University_Hospital_4573.html" title="Royal University Hospital">Royal University Hospital</a> in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for nine days, however the severe brain damage she had received, coupled with her past stated wishes, compelled her family to end further medical intervention. Constable Robin Cameron passed away around 11 PM, July 15th, 2006. Her partner, Constable Marc Bourdages past away around 1 AM the following morning. Both left behind young children, devastated families, and sent shock, anger and grief across <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Cameron's father, a retired <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> officer himself, issued a family statement thanking the community, <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> for the tremendous support he and his family have received since the tragedy. He went on to account how Cameron was a role model to her family and community having achieved her childhood dream of becoming a member of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police_60d8.html" title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>. Many felt that her achievement was especially exceptional as she had endured difficult teenage years during which she became a young mother and temporarily dropped out of high school. Suspect Dagenais remains at large and is now the focus of an intense manhunt and a nationwide warrant for his capture. It is believed that Dagenais is still concealing himself in the dense brushland surrounding Maldrid, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>. <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> have deployed tracking dogs, however Dagenais is hiding in an area well-known to him.</p>

<p>Kill the Hippies is a Kent, Ohio-based punk rock band founded in 1993. They have completed many national tours and continually turn down major label interest. They distinctly play with the "Ohio Sound," made popular by bands like Devo and Rubber City Rebels. They continue those traditions of song craft and social commentary with typical Midwestern cynicism, but the strenght and importance of the group is in the fact that, despite critical acclaim and interest from major record labels, they continue to perform and record without corporate funding or contracts. One could see them perform in a major arena or a rural VFW hall.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-18_16a6.html" title="Edit section: Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning</span></h2>
<p>Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning (or RLGS) is a genome analysis method that allows for rapid simultaneous scanning of thousands of landmarks. RLGS employs direct labeling of DNA, which is first cut by a specific series of restriction enzymes, and then labeled by a radioactive isotope (usually Phosphorus 32). A two-dimension electrophoresis process is then employed, yielding high-resolution results. The radioactive second-dimension gel is then allowed to expose a large sheet of film, which is then developed, yielding a visual representation of the results in the form of an Autoradiograph. These auto-rads can be examined against each other, revealing any changes in gene expression that lead to visual differences in the film. Each autoradiograph contains thousands of spots, each corresponding to a labeled DNA restriction landmark.</p>
<p>RLGS becomes very useful when doing full-genome scans, and can effectively do the work of thousands of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymerase_chain_reaction.html" title="Polymerase chain reaction">polymerase chain reactions</a> at once. It readily detects alterations deviating from normal, and thus is exceptionally effective in identifying hyper/hypomethylation in tumors, deletions or amplifications of genes, or simply changes in gene expression throughout the development of an organism.</p>
