<li>I checked Wiktionary; they don't have this word. But I Googled without excluding Wikipedia, so I could compare possible derivative sites that aren't literal mirrors but use WP as their basis. Most of the top-ranked sites (first couple of pages) are legitimate academia, and not just copycat sites replicating a wikihoax or blog postings retelling an urban legend or Everything2 fluff. The concept is discussed in English as a concept by academics-of-philosophy without obvious local-ness. I doubt more than a thousand people worldwide knew the word or idea in any year for three millennia until maybe the last few decades. Did Oxford or Yale students learn this if they weren't philosophy majors? Based on quality (not quantity) of Google results, I'm changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:25, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> --I wrote the article, and I vote that it be deleted on the grounds that it is self-refuting: if 'peritrope' were a real thing, more people would have written about it already. Therefore, the writing of the article only serves to demonstrate that the topic needed to be written about. But this is to say that the article should never have been written, because 'peritrope' is far too idiosyncratic a 'non-topic' to ever be written about (if it wasn't, more people would have written about it, and there would have been no need for an article). In short: the article's very existence demonstrates a need for itself, which in turn can only be generated by the obscurity of the topic (its alienated and 'idiosyncratic non-entity' as humblefool put it).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, admittedly there is not much scope for expansion, however it is more than a dic def., correctly categorised it could be useful for people interested in philosophy.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 03:42, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - despite the attack of the sockpuppet wonders, I think two-hit wonders is about as valid a topic as one-hit wonders - in my experience, they tend to be one-hit wonders who are able to parlay the fame of that one hit into... a <i>second hit</i> (which is usually a cover of another band's previous hit).

<center><s><b>WHY YOU NEED TO VOTE TO KEEP</b></s></center>
<center><s>ATTENTION TWO HIT WONDER FANS AND PROSECUTORS!</s></center>
<p><s>I just want to say that Two hit wonders are real!</s></p>
<p><s>If you are reading this, you may or may not know that the two hit wonder community's faithful devotion to two hit wonderism is currently under siege from doubters of the two-hit wonder craze. Those of you who frequent the hit wonders section of Wikipedia.com may notice some recent vfds. Click them to see the travesty of Wikipedia. A faithful member of the two hit community by the alias of "KelisFan2K5" has spoken out against prosecutors of the two hit wonder craze.</s></p>
<p><s>The problem right now is that there is a group of ignorant two hit wonder opposers who believe that two hit wonderism is "non-sense" and is vandalism and/or a false proclaimation. TWO HIT WONDERS ARE REAL AND IS SWEEPING THE GLOBE. OPEN YOUR EYES.</s></p>
<p><s>In order to support all the offended two hit wonder fans out there, and also to back up KelisFan2K5's bold stand, I will lay out my argument in a series of proofs.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #1: It should be quite obvious by now that Two Hit Wonder Forums is a lively and growing fan community. What started out as a simple means of communication between friends of the wonders turned out to be an extensive base and archive of information regarding our mysterious two hitters. Unlike many fan forums, Two Hit Wonder Forums is actually active and is visited/updated almost every day. Also, it should be noted that the rumour mill is still live and kicking despite the paucity in two hit wonderism for a good 9 years or so. Other X-hit wonders that do not have a "mania" named after them do not have fans that generate rumours about the next wonder. Two hit wonders has very faithful fans that generate rumours because they are excited and anxious to see a two hit wonder in their next appearance due to "Two hit wonder fever" (which is a symptom of "Two hit wonder mania"). And plus, isn't the whole point of rumours a sly way for artists to gain popularity and ground before a huge upcoming release of their work? Enough said.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #2: Considering the internet did not become popular until well after the casettes sales ended, it can be concluded that Two hit wonders came into existence after other two hit wonders left the spotlight of the music industry. However, the "VFD" section of the website clearly shows that people still greatly care for two hit wonders even after they left the music spotlight. That is a proof of "Two hit wonder mania" because TWENTY-TWO dedicated fans posted with their deep heartfelt thoughts on two hit wonder's unfortunate ejection from the spotlight. Now, from a worldly perspective, 22 is not a big number at all. But Two Hit Wonder Forums is not a huge and official website and is just a simple and humble fansite dedicated to the topic. Therefore, it would be difficult for it to gain a lot of traffic. However, despite the lack of popularity, TWENTY-TWO people still managed to find that website and post their thoughts (some of which are very touching and serious songs and poems). Now, for those of you who doubt the existence of such a dedicated fanbase, I bid you to consider how you may have seriously offended such devoted people, you sick and inconsiderate "Two hit wonder mania" doubters.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #3: Two hit wonder fansites still exist, despite their disappearance from the mainstream music scene for the clean 9 years. Not to mention that these are not only fansites but there is also a "Page of Worship". "Worship" is normally used to define someone's unconditional praise towards a god-like figure. To simply think that there are fans out there that would out and out worship the "Great Two Hit Wonder" itself, is proof enough that "Two hit wonder mania" is indeed a true phenomenon. I would go as far to say that any "Two hit wonder mania" doubters are intolerant of this religion, belief, and creed. By doubting the exist of "Two hit wonder mania", you also neglect and disacknowledge the existence of a worship medium towards the enigmatic Two Hit Wonder. You know what happens when you become an intolerance extremist? You turn into a nazi. And do you guys want to know what happened to the nazis of Germany? They lost World War II and are regarded as one of the most disrespectful groups in all of history. If you doubt the existence of Two Hit Wonder worshippers, you should very well just say "let's eradicate all visible minorities because they are 'non-sense' and a 'vandalism' to the world".</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #4: Dedicated Two Hit Wonder fans have held private Two Hit Wonder statue dedications to commemorate such great and joyous artists. That's right, for the past two years on January 7th, Two Hit Wonder fans have gathered for the annual "Two Hit Wonder Statue Commemoration" to celebrate such an important day in the history of mankind. During these parties, the fans get together and buy a customized statuette that features a two hit wonder's face in order to recognise their greatness.</s></p>
<p><s>This easily proves the existence of "Two Hit Wonder mania" because only topics with a "mania" named after them have such dedicated fans that would be obsessed enough to have a statue commemoration for the subject without him/her even knowing. Also, "obsession" is another symptom of "Two Hit wonder mania" and obviously, these fans display that. EB 07:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The incoherent bit at the end of the article appears to be a reference to the Republic or Ireland's national football team having a training camp in Saipan before the last football World Cup. Perhaps too much Guinness before writing the article? Particularly since they then don't bother mentioning that team captain <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Keane_2c22.html" title="Roy Keane">Roy Keane</a> was so incensed by the amateuristic state of the training camp it resulted in a very public spat with manager <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_McCarthy_15d2.html" title="Mick McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> and Keane leaving the team. This is mentioned in Keane's article, it could possibly be mentioned in the main Republic of Ireland football team article perhaps, but the term 'Saipan Incident' does not appear to have been widely used, and is therefore not appropriate. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 09:24, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

The article is NOT promotional, I took the time to add TWO additional hosts, how can I be promoting TWO competing hosts??? Furthermore I contend that if this article is 'promotional' and should be deleted then so should the Keenspace and Keenspot articles on which it was bloody well based!! And yes I know my comment isn't in your precious format but at this point, having taken the time to add TWO new entries, AND justify BOTH of them I'm very much sick of this entire process. You want to pretend as though Keenspace is the only webcomic host in the world, FINE, fact is there are TWO more that I know of (and if there had been SEVENTEEN that I knew about I would have bloody well added SEVENTEEN!) and I'm trying to convey that reality into the article on webcomics, it is ridiculous for anyone to want to edit that out. As I very clearly stated in my prior explanation, these are ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS, conveying a clear and accurate picture of reality, which is what Wiki in theory is supposed to be doing, requires providing information on ALL the options, not singling out ONE provider, THAT is promotional favoritism of the worst kind, in fact if deletion on the articles I added procedes I'd have to question how much Keen payed to have exclusivity on Wiki's perception of reality!</p>

<li><b>Keep for now</b> etu Although this entry is of no interest to me, I have to say that the biggest objection to it is the tone. It sounds like an ad. It should be rewritten from a more objective tone. It needs some sprucing up in the comparison/contrast area, too. Right now, it is too promotional. It needs to be expanded wrt how it compares to other services, who its competitors are, etc. Either that, or it could be subsumed into another entry about webcomics, along with the Keen site entries. 2005.04.08

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - The album is not being clearly sold here. The purpose of the music is to attract the attention of Dysthymia, and to extend it onto finding more information on that. The music from the album is in direct experience with a serious social problem such as depression. How can you make an assumption that because it is being told in a diffrent way, than say text books or Dr. Phil, that it is not legit? The problem with "censorship" to the articles is the lack information that is given to anyone who chooses to find it. I understand that thier are people who purposefully exploit themselves, but that is not what's being done. No money is being involved here, and there are links that clearly lead to further information on the disease. I do not believe this page should be deleted.

<li>Anonymous votes dont count.

<li><b>Merge all</b> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_KoL_eaa6.html" title="Radio KoL">Radio KoL</a> <b>DJ/writer/show articles into parent article</b>, and break out a section(s) for that, then <b>weak vote to delete</b> rather than having redirects. Fans will eventually create dozens of stub articles (and some good ones probably) for all the DJs if that becomes WP's policy. While I think Radio KoL is pioneering enough that it's about as noteworthy as gamecruft or Webradiocruft can get, it hasn't gotten very much attention outside the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> community. So it's barely making my bar of keep-worthiness. Soon there will be dozens of <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> trying to do this, with dozens of DJs/live-bloggers/live-adventurers/et cetera on each. For these 144's of hosts, some notability guidelines must be used. This is still game-centered content, so I think guidelines should be more like <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">Fiction semi-policy</a> than those used for entertainers in mass-market industries (for instance, signed a recording contract with a major label, completed one tour). Online hosts of ANY sort, in-game or not, need (in my judgment) to have widely established some verifiable noteworthiness individually to have their own article, rather than a short description in a section of the Radio KoL article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:03, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is explaining two long running servers and their history (in progress). Not only is it explaining the uniqueness of the servers and how it is democratic, but the way the users have gathered together to form a group of people that interact outside of an online game through the use of the forums mentioned. If you think showing the IPs is that we are trying to "advertise" then we will take them off. What we are trying to show is a history of the group not try push ourselves on the masses. Also, you say "I wish they directed their efforts on improving the TF articles". Users that are editting this have and will continue working on those. You may want to check the history of both and compare users before making statements like that, which are false. <b>Keep</b> --Cassius 17:47, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be necessary to remove the IP addresses and IRC channels. However, this article is not meant to be an advertising tool, or one of vanity. Axl's TFC is a developed community with a unique history, and this article is intended to articulate that history and how it has affected the game on which it is based. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 18:03, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this is a great arcticle which purpose does not fit advertising nor vanity. It merely shows what Axl's TFC is about, its history, its uniqueness. I wouldn't mind missing the IP addresses, but a link to the official website seems in place. I say we keep this topic, for the critisism is not accurate. <b>Keep</b> Shino 19:38, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I've already mentioned, we use a <i>slightly</i> different definition of sockpuppet on VfD than does Wikipedia at large. I fail to see how this is "breaking policy," but your point is a minor quibble, at best.

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems to be a legitimate term amongst Biker types.

Note that none these sites are about the "Black Hills Run", but rather casually mention it, as if they expect the reader to know what they mean. My guess is that it is done as an adjunctant to the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgis_Motorcycle_Rally_cc62.html" title="Sturgis Motorcycle Rally">Sturgis Motorcycle Rally</a> or is an alternate name for it. (Let me say that it shocks me that that is a red link).

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgis.html" title="Sturgis">Sturgis</a> annual event draws many thousands of motorcyclists to the Black Hills of South Dakota, and might be the single most notable event in the non-racing motorcycle community. Bikers' activity are underrepresented on the Internet and rarely draw online mention more authoritative than the links that Dsmdgold provided. The "Black Hills Run" is most likely a fringe event organized by one club with word-of-mouth publicity; it could have persisted for decades without attaining as much significance as Sturgis. <s><b>No vote</b> pending documentation.</s> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:20, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> BaronLarf's revised version. I hope we can find more documentation on long-past years, but getting one source on the record helps.

<li>I will rewrite this as a temp article. This is a very important book by John Maynard Keynes first pointing out the problem with the peace treaty. It was the also the first book to create Keynes' reputation in the general community and also served as a guidepost when he was involved in the discussions for establishing the financial framework for the West after the second world war. This is an important book by an important author and deserves a decent article. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 10:42, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As promised, I have rewritten this as an article The Economic Consequences of the Peace/temp. I would suggest that we put this temp article in its place. The book was a bestseller with 140,000 copies in 11 copies sold by 1924. It established the accepted wisdom of the Treaty of Peace as a Carthaginian peace. It was influential in the decision of the US not to join the League of Nations and was influential in undermining public support for implementing the Treaty regarding Germany. All of these points plus the ones made above are made in the article. The Economic Consequences of the Peace was one of the most influential books written in the twentieth century by anyone. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 05:53, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
