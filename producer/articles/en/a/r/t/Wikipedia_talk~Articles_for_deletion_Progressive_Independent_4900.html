<dd>No it isn't. I simply didn't bother to log in. The political articles are so hag-ridden with ideology that I no longer like to spend my time trying to de-POV them. In this case I decided to add my comment because, while not a member of that community, I find it an important and near-unique resource.

<dd>My politics are conservative, and one should be able to derive that from my username.

<dd>In other words, you offer the lowest price in town ...for the products you don't have in stock. The reality is that <b>the only articles you've tried to have deleted about political sites are about non-GOP ones</b> (language fixed to make my point more clear--talk is cheap, so I don't count self-serving claims about how balanced you'd be if ever the occasion arose. The fact is that you have only tried to get articles deleted about non-GOP sites).

<li>Doc, if you're an English professor, presumably you teach your students to avoid rhetoric fallacies -- such as <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_arguments.html" title="Strawman arguments">strawman arguments</a>. The former I think is obvious, but here's a hint for the latter: no Wikipedia notability standard I'm aware of refers to anything like "level of discourse" or other needlessly vague subjective standard.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Calton, yes I do teach those in the appropriate course, along with more than 40 other specific fallacies, so here's a hint right back: I did not claim that my comments were true because of my professional expertise. I implied (claimed) that my professional expertise offered me some insight into the reasons for deletion (i.e.- notability).

<dd>There is no such 'notablity standard'. It's a mere guideline, and clearly states that its very existence is problematic.

<p><b>Comment</b> I believe the opposition to the PI entry has a political rather than a principled basis. I note, for example, the fact that RWR8189 is a Reaganite who has only objected to non-GOP political sites, and Calton's objection ("American Left's ... Circular Firing Squad...elsewhere") is couched in terms frequently applied to progressive posters at DU. I would also point out that neither the (trivial) Conservative Underground entry nor the entry for the People For Change forum are being similarly attacked despite the fact that neither community would meet the 'notability' guidelines (and no, I don't think they should be attacked; they, like PI, are signficant in their own ways). <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 16:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hm. Let's make this simpler then. <i>We don't do analogies on AfD</i>. Each nomination is (theoretically) viewed on its own merits, without reference to any other. That being said, you may continue to infer that no one could possibly disagree with you without having some hidden and presumably sinister agenda, but that mindset is a better fit on the partisan shows of talk radio -- in which demonizing those who disagree with you has long since been not only tolerated but expected -- than it is here.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I am a casual user of wikipedia. This is the first time I have been inclined to comment on something. Being both a member of PI and a big fan of wikipedia, I can't help but be dissapointed in how some wikipedia members have handled some of my peers from PI. I'd like to refer you to a Wikipedia guidline, <i>Please Do Not Bite the Newcomers</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Being a member of PI I can say that the majority of the people there are reasonable and friendly. The fact that they are new to making an entry, and unfamiliar with many of the nuances of wikipedia entry does not excuse the almost immediate attack to these newcomers. I would suggest removing the deletion tag and marking the article for cleanup (which PI is already doing).--Kralizec 08:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I see that I have been accused of being a DU member on your board <a href="http://www.progressiveindependent.com/dc/dcboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=104&amp;topic_id=22839&amp;mesg_id=23062" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.progressiveindependent.com/dc/dcboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=104&amp;topic_id=22839&amp;mesg_id=23062" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You know, there are more people than one that use the "Jersey Devil" screen name on the internet. I've been on Wikipedia for more than a year to prove myself in not being some kind of a sockpuppet for another board. The fact is that your website has an alexa ranking of over 2.5 million <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=progressiveindependent.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=progressiveindependent.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. According to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in order for a website to be notable it must meet one of the three:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>This criterion excludes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.[4]
<ul>
<li>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>This criterion includes</b> reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.[5]</li>
<li>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.[6]</li>
<li>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no evidence of any of these critera being met and therefore your site is not notable no matter how much you think it is notable. We've dealt with thousands of people trying to plug their websites on Wikipedia, this isn't anything new that we haven't dealt with before. Your posters are acting as if this is some "big conspiracy" by some other board to try an "silence" you and are now trying to play victims when clear facts showing meatpuppetry emerge.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 00:48, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, what is this? You have shown your bias, Jersey Devil. I can only hope there are reasonable people who will not heed your call. I am a member of PI but in no way do a few members such as Atlant or whoever else represent the views as a whole. You are plainly guilty of pigeonholing. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pigeonhole" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pigeonhole" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> At the best, you have failed at even representing the effort being made at PI to make this entry up-to-standard, depite the members' discourse at the complexity and resistance of making a good-willed entry here. I also remind "regular Wikipedians" to note that <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">User:Jersey Devil</a> seems to follow some guidelines while ignoring others. I would like again to refresh "fellow Wikipedia regulars" memories. <b>Please Do Not Bite the Newcomers</b>. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>] Perhaps you haven't read it in a long time, being so regular as you are. In this guideline it states, <i>We have a set of rules and standards and traditions, but they must not be applied in such a way as to thwart those newcomers who take that invitation at face value. It is entirely possible for a newcomer to this site to bring a wealth of experience from other venues, together with ideas and creative energy which, current rules and standards notwithstanding, may further improve our community and end product. It may be that the rules and standards need revising or expanding; some of what the newcomer seems to be doing "wrong" at first may prove to actually improve Wikipedia. Observe for a while and, if necessary, ask what the newcomer is about before defining what he/she is doing as "wrong" or "substandard".</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This article was attacked almost immediately by <a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">User:RWR8189</a>, who has shown a blatent disregard himself of several guidlines, including the above newcomer's guideline and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a>. Until I cited the newcomers guide, the main complainers had given little or no recommendations before deciding to slap a delete tag on it. Once again, the newcomers guide says, <i>If you really feel that you must say anything at all to a newcomer about a mistake, do it in a spirit of being helpful. Begin by introducing yourself with a greeting on their talk page to let them know that they are welcome here, and present your corrections calmly and as the contributor's peer, perhaps also pointing out things they've done that you *like*. If you can't do that, then it is better to say nothing.</i> A mere reading of this AfD shows the opposite of this behavior. Indeed, you the main critics of this entry have taken the role of a "superior" rather than a "peer".</p>
<p>I can go on citing the guide, but my point is made. I am making this appeal to those "Wikipedia regulars," who, upon reading the re-written entry, will see the attacks on the entry are unwarranted.--Kralizec 20:01, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first contact with Zoraida was a welcome note on his/her talk page. I did not believe that PI was notable enough be included in the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Underground_d747.html" title="Democratic Underground">Democratic Underground</a> article, so obviously it would be consistent to nominate the article for AfD when I became aware of its existance. Zoraida responded by making several bad faith edits and acting in a very uncivil manner.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My problem with this article doesn't center around the way it is written, it is a problem of notability.</dd>

<dd>The fact still remains that this article is not consistent with the notability guidelines that have been cited several times, and it seems a consensus has emerged around this point, and I anticipate this discussion is near its conclusion.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 02:44, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<a href="../../../c/h/l/User%7EChlamor_3af6.html" title="User:Chlamor">Chlamor</a> 03:40, 16 April 2006 (UTC)An introductory comment from Tinoire the Admin at PI who registered to post it herself but could not due to security software problems on her computer:</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> My apologies for disturbing this fascinating discussion. I'm the Admin at Progressive Independent and I've been genuinely saddened to see some of the comments on this page as well as the passionate intensity with which certain voters are trying to get PI's entry deleted without even according the courtesy of a rewrite. I think it's been made quite clear on our website that we agree the article is weak and some of us have been working very hard to bring it up to "notability/NPOV" standards with the understanding that we have 4(?) days to do so. Despite my perception that there's something not quite right about the way our entry was jumped upon and immediately tagged for deletion because someone took offense to a comment the original editor had made on DU's page that merely mentioned that, in addition to People for Change, another website was also launched (PI) so that she could link the entry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Underground&amp;oldid=48253230" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Underground&amp;oldid=48253230" rel="nofollow">10:06, 13 April 2006 65.172.237.186 (→the last paragraph under Criticism)</a>. Her entry was rudely deleted and redeleted and again redeleted by RWR8189 before he decided to go to the Progressive Independent Page and request that be deleted. If mention of People for Change is deemed noteworthy, I don't understand the vehemence with which mention of PI, which outperforms People for Change is deemed otherwise and I've found the neutrality of certain arguments questionable.</p>
<p>I ask you, is this how things are normally done at Wikipedia when new people show up? Were all of you put through this wringer? Or were you given time to absorb constructive criticism and modify your entries?</p>
<p>The writers at PI are responsible for much of the initial research on important issues like PNAC that most people had never heard of 4 years ago. The work done in our Election Fraud Forum by published authors and mathematicians (who fight the statisticians) has been well received as has, for example, one user's compilation on <a href="http://www.progressiveindependent.com/shalom/katrina/katrina_timeline/KT&amp;R-Chapter_1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.progressiveindependent.com/shalom/katrina/katrina_timeline/KT&amp;R-Chapter_1.htm" rel="nofollow">Hurricane Katrina</a>.</p>
<p>In a couple of days we hope to have an entry notable enough to stand at Wiki so that others can build upon it, though one of our members did note that Wiki takes great pains to point out that these are not rules or even official <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_criteria" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_criteria" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_criteria</a></p>
<p>Jersey Devil, if you're not the same Jersey Devil from DU, I apologize for my assumption.</p>
<p>And yes of course, IF my vote could be counted, it would be, from a neutral point of view- "Keep" with editing. Much editing. <a href="../../../c/h/l/User%7EChlamor_3af6.html" title="User:Chlamor">Chlamor</a> 03:40, 16 April 2006 (UTC)Chlamor</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: A couple observations. First off, <i>Don't Bite The Newcomers</i> has been waved in our faces a few times in this discussion, but equally incumbent on said newcomers is not to bite the veterans. Instead, we've been lashed by the self-same newcomers with insults and the presumption that any AfD editor who can be identified as (or, as likely, accused of) holding political views opposed to their own must be acting out of bad faith.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, some of you seem to be operating out of the presumption that what we mean when we say "notable" is that an article is well-written, and to a NPOV standard. This is incorrect. We routinely vote in AfD discussions to delete very well-written and sourced articles that nevertheless are about non-notable subjects. This is one. Your forum is tiny, with relatively few hits and registered users. It has won no awards, been featured in no media sources, is frequented by no known major political figures, and has not been distributed by a major media content provider. The best article rewriting of which you are capable will not suffice until and unless your website gains the public prominence that it so far lacks. Improving the former will not sway us to any meaningful degree. Improving the latter would. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 08:28, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Every parent knows what 's wrong with that line of discussion.</li>

<p>Everything is embedded in a context, so yes, everyone "does" analogies. As there is an established precedent for including a similar website on Wikipedia (People for Change), a truly neutral and analytical criticism from discussants here would include clarifying the meaningful difference between the successful entry and this one. It would not include exaggerated umbrage or organized attempts to delete revisions without the benefit of even reading them. Thank you. Iverson 10:19, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> in response to Stifle-- the presence of new people here arguing for or against this article's deletion has absolutely no objective bearing on whether or not it should be deleted. For the record, I'm a frequent contributor to Wikipedia discussion pages, and also have edited several articles. I've also been a member at DU, PI and several other political discussion fora, and I can attest to the petty grudges that emanate from them. I suggest that this entire debate regarding deletion stems from such grudges and is politically-motivated. I'd recommend that the warring factions here somehow negotiate a truce and send their "troops" back to their respective fora. I think the article should be allowed to stand provided it is edited to reflect NPOV policy (which hopefully, will reduce page vandalism if the warring parties can come to an agreement). This whole discussion is a tempest in a teapot. --Nicky Scarfo 13:42, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am the chairman of one of the most active Democratic Clubs that can be found and I and members of my organization are proud of the excellent work that Progressive Independent is doing. The people who run Progressive Independent encourage all progressives to post there and avoid censorship. There are some larger supposedly Democratic groups/forums that are run by people who delete postings that more conservative Democrats, such as those in the DLC or AIPAC, consider objectionable to their goals of getting Hillary or someone more conservative into the White House. In those same supposedly Democratic groups Democratic leaders who are too liberal are often banned or "tombstoned" as everyone calls it. Among those under attack in those supposedly Democratic groups are posters who support truly progressive candidates, such as Dennis Kucinich, Maxine Waters or Cynthia McKinney (the most progressive of the Democratic leaders). It is not surprising that conservatives from those groups that attack progressives would try to have an entry about a fair and above-board organization, like Progressive Independent, deleted. If Wikpedia caves in to the right wing Democrats and Hillary backers and deletes the PI listing, then it will be taking a strong political position against progressive Democrats. Progressive Independent is an excellent site that allows its posters to speak about issues that concern them. The atmosphere at PI is generally pleasant and uplifting. Those who post there, respect the right of other posters to be treated with dignity. It is a safe haven for those who want to discuss Democratic and progressive issues without having to worry about attacks from conservative Democrats. PI is the kind of experience that progressives looking for an education and enjoyable time look rush towards. If progressives find the site through Wikpedia, they will be grateful to Wikpedia. How about standing on the side of openness and fairness and allowing the PI entry to stand. PI has not asked you to delete listings for conservative Democratic groups.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Patrick Henry (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patrick_Henry_bccc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patrick Henry">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This heavy focus on the alleged motivation for the AfD is misguided. The motivation is irrelevant. The implication of this rationale for "keep" is that, if a nonpolitical Wikipedian doing routine new-article patrol came upon this one, judged PI to be nonnotable, and listed the article for deletion, then it should be deleted; but if, five minutes before the new-article patroller got there, a conservative listed the article for deletion because of his or her animosity toward the left, then the article must be kept. That's not the way it works. If the site is deemed notable, the article should stay, even if the AfD listing was made in good faith by someone who agreed with PI's politics but considered it nonnotable. On the other hand, if there's a consensus that the site is nonnotable, then the article should go, even if the deletion brings pleasure to a vindictive and politically motivated nominator. (I'm not addressing whether that's an accurate description of <a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a>, because it doesn't matter.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 21:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How often are you, as an attorney, ready to accept pious claims of disinterested motivation at face value? My guess would be in the range 'seldom' to 'are you joking?'. If motivation is irrelevant here, then Wiki has no claim to status as an encyclopedia, because its articles are at risk of being purged (or kept) merely on the say-so of people with an ideological agenda. The analog would be the courts being forced to accept even the most transparently self-interested and incredible claims by the powerful as evidence, as is common in places where "the rule of law" is a bad joke. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 14:58, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, Mr. Lane, that all sounds good in the realm of pure reason, but it's a post-Kantian world, baby. Problem is that no consensus is going to be reached by two warring political factions. Even if a decision is made on a majority or plurality of users, then that decision may very well reflect the political motivations of the majority/plurality of those making the decision. Point is that an objective, non-politically motivated decision on this article is not possible because the well was poisoned from the start and only got worse as the discussion continued. A vindictive right-winger made the initial RfD, then a flood of PI members came in to challenge it, then some disgrunted DUers joined in the fray to support deletion, in turn encouraging more PI members to come out. This is such a shitstorm that whatever decision is made will be politically-motivated, all started by the original RfD, which was politically-motivated. So yes, the political motivations of those requesting deletion is highly relevant as it has made any objective discussion of the matter impossible by poisoning the well at the beginning.--Nicky Scarfo 23:14, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your argument that "no consensus is going to be reached by two warring political factions" seems to assume that the AfD can't be resolved unless warring political factions reach agreement on the substance of their disputes (Iraq, fiscal policy, or whatever). In fact, however, the AfD notice has drawn responses from many Wikipedians who aren't part of a faction, or who, if they are, aren't carrying the war into this venue. (You might also be interested in reading <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#There.27s_no_such_thing_as_objectivity" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#There's no such thing as objectivity</a>.) As for the influx of politically motivated participants, the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion guidelines</a> authorize the admin who closes the AfD to disregard such comments. This is not an "election" that PI, DU, or anyone else can try to pack by recruiting non-Wikipedians to show up and "vote". Therefore, I continue to believe that the alleged motivation for the nomination is irrelevant. (I admit, though, that Wikipedia editors and admins are only human, and their AfD decisions may be influenced by their distaste for the tactics of one side or the other.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 07:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On what basis do you accuse my RfD to be "vindictive" or "politically motivated?" I have discouraged the mention of non-notable political forums wherever I encounter them on Wikipedia, whether they are from the left or the right. Your accusation is without merit, I have made no personal attacks against other editors during my time at Wikipedia, and I expect the same level of discourse from others.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 00:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/l/User%7EChlamor_3af6.html" title="User:Chlamor">Chlamor</a> 01:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)"Comment" I posed this question upstream:&#160;:Can the entry be edited while the AfD is being discussed?</p>
<p>And was offered this answer: Yes, it can be edited. As the deletion notice on the article states, "You are welcome to edit this article, but please do not blank this article or remove this notice while the discussion is in progress."</p>
<p>Probably unbeknownst to the respondant the answer is not the case for this (PI's) entry due to the initial warring that took place. After the AfD was put on PI's entry there was a retaliatory AfD put on DU and then RWR8189 then took the liberty of editing DU's page and removing the AfD so the PfD was then removed from PI's entry by Zoraida. An Admin came, put both AfDs back on to "respect the process" and locked both articles from editting. DU's AfD and edit lock were summarily removed and Zoraida accused of "vandalism". RWR8189 was merely asked to "please not remove those again" and PI's page locked.</p>
<p>Now this is all water under the bridge, apologies for tired metaphor, but is it still the case that PI's entry is locked and cannot be edited?</p>
<p>To my understanding, with an AfD, (which I would like to see overturned if at all possible) we should still be able to edit the page while the AfD is being discussed during the 5 day discussion period. We're unable to do so and have a substantial edit we'd like to submit so interested parties can expand and comment for the next 3 days before a final decision is made. If you would like to view what we want to submit, I'd be happy to send it to you or provide a link where you can read it.</p>
<p>As a point of material fact Atlant is NOT an Admin at PI and only just joined the other day.</p>
<p>Let us also recognize that age and wisdom do not necessarily correlate so no matter the number of years one spouts dogmatic ideology that ideology will never turn into wisdom.</p>
<p>And of course we all know The Meatpuppets were one of the best punk bands ever. Don't we?</p>
<p>So, is the PI entry still locked for further edit?<a href="../../../c/h/l/User%7EChlamor_3af6.html" title="User:Chlamor">Chlamor</a> 01:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to take this moment to thank all the PI members for diverting attention to another victim of Wikipression, the People for Change website so often mentioned in your impassioned pleas, has now been submitted for deletion as well. So once again your tomfoolery has resulted in another site suffering your exigencies, much like the Democratic Party you all rail against, you must always take everyone down when you enter conflict.</p>
<p>So thanks for that, guys. Really, none of this matters in the least. Of course, our website is at least in the top million of sites on the web! And to Tinoire, I love you so. See you at the voting booth, kids. 70.32.164.21 03:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)Mike Hickerson</p>

User:</p>
<p>In my opinion, the pro-deletion faction is unecessarily cautious. There is no chance that the opinions most frequently expressed on PI will become largely popular.</p>
<p>A lot of the people there have views closer to my own than the right wing boards, even the more center-right ones.</p>
<p>Just as an example, it is not at all unusual to find posts on PI that advocate fundamental change of US policies, as opposed to reframing or more palatable presentation, or even having the policies presented by this or that telegenic politician. So corporate rule enthusiasts, regardless of party affiliation or which politician they are devotees of, need not fear that the site's presence in Wikipedia will cause someone who was just on the verge of writing a check to a rich politician will instead decide to oppose the crusades on general principle, regardless of whether this or that country disobeyed America by obtaining weapons or whether the invasion and occupation of Iran is effected via nuclear or conventional weapons.</p>
<p>Not only are such views unlikely to become popular, it is a fair question whether expressing them might constitute a violation of the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>But those very aspects make it so unusual that anything that ends in "pedia" and includes any online forum ought to include PI.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by DuctapeFatwa (<a href="../../../d/u/c/User_talk%7EDuctapeFatwa_e46c.html" title="User talk:DuctapeFatwa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DuctapeFatwa_c886.html" title="Special:Contributions/DuctapeFatwa">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

There would have been some credibility if there was a long history with these guys of them hunting down and knocking off 'minor' sites without regard to politics.
