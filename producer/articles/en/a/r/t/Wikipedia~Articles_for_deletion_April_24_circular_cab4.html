<dd>Yes, the original article, before my recent edits constituted Armenian genocide denialist literature. The references were unverifiable, and there were no academic references.

<p><b>Comment</b>: April 24 circular is a "cited event" which is included in the literature (both sides). It is the most important, the milestone, even in the history of Armenian Genocide. It is not an original research. The day of the "April 24 circular" is recognized with the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide_Remembrance_Day_07e6.html" title="Genocide Remembrance Day">Genocide Remembrance Day</a> as the beginning of the Armenian genocide. April 24 circular is not the Armenian genocide itself to be claimed as a "parallel article", it is part of the Armenian genocide. It is not a fork, it is included in the article like the many other sub-articles. It is "genocide deniers", propaganda to eliminate this event, or other milestone events, from the history of Armenian genocide. Elimination of this article will bring a big gap in the storyline Armenian genocide, which genocide denier's main policy to eliminate the "milestones" from the "history of genocide".

<dd>There is an April 24, the symbolic beggining of the Armenian genocide. When intellectuals and artists were arrested and later killed, on which date, the Ottoman redirected the evacuation in the desert. There is no such notable thing as April 24 circular. This notability, YOU cooked it, much like you have cooked other notabilities and created articles. Assume good faith on the reasons behind my decision. You have created a FORK, of a date covered in the Armenian Genocide main page. Your disruptions have no end.

<p><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a>. Sorry, but I have said <i>There is no such thing as an 'April 24 circular', <b>having any notability.</b></i> You have, I assume, involuntarily distorted my message by adding a dot after the term circular and by mistake deleted my words. (check diff).</p>
<p>I do not deny the claim of a circular, I have said a second time in this very same page: <i>There is no such notable thing as April 24 circular. This notability, YOU cooked it,…</i> April 24 is recognized as the day when intellectuals have been arrested, most killed. What OttomanReference did is taking the Turkish government claim on the event (the very same page from the Turkish government website you have footnoted). Check the article on its state before Serouj edits, check the footnotes OttomanReference had provided and the text and compare them with the one from the page you have linked here. This page was created as a fork of the Armenian genocide article, check the genocide article section about April 24. OttomanReference created this parallel article by recycling the official Turkish government claim on April 24 events by cooking some notability over some obscure 24 April circular and completing it with original research. He created two parallel articles about Armenian casualties, in parallel to the already existing Armenian casualties’ article. The article he has worked on titled: <i>Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915</i> which seems as a good intentioned article, while the large majority of the notables who have been deported have been murdered, those mostly cited are those having survived. Ottomanreference had a history of disruption on the Armenian genocide article, having created documented socks, and the article still suffer of the disruptions he has created by using his socks to implement his changes.</p>
<p>Just as evidences, this is what he wrote above: <i>The title of the article is April 24 circular, if anything that is not related with the Talat Pasha's order was not included in the article. The version [2] version before Fad (ix) edited proves this point.</i> Now check April 24 on google, and see what are 99,99% of the results you obtain in connection with the Armenians, is actually not related to Ottomanreference cooked event, and thosefor can not be used to justify the existance of his cooked article, which is a FORK, the reason I have provided for its deletion, and not the reason you report I have given. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 06:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

April 24 is to the Armenian Genocide what <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> is to the Holocaust.
