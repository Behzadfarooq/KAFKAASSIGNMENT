<li><b>Comment</b> I am writing this note to record the fact that my first experience in creating an article has exposed me to ridicule, offensive behavior and a systematic pattern of argumentation from one of the wikipedia editors, "calton" whose comments are on this page. I was told by several friends and colleagues that wikipedia was untrustworthy and unreliable and a place so contentious that it wasnt worth the bother, since you merely ended up combatting spiteful and immature people more interested in proving their points than in creating a worthwhile body of knowledge. While I was making minor edits, I only occaisonally found this to be true, but when I posted an original article, I was made the subect of namecalling and defending my entries against systematic deletion with little or no positive input into the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now spend my time erasing all contributions that I have made to nuance the subjects upon which I have contributed, both as an unregistered user and a registered one.</p>
<p>This exceedingly sharp process of harrassment has not been limited to this page, but has been conducted on multiple forums where my edits were immediately nominated for speedy deletes while I was actually still in the process of posting them.</p>
<p>I have no problem with input, constructive criticism, or an honest difference of opinion, but being called a liar and having hours of my time wasted,---not out of a desire to improve the project but merely to assert dominance over another persons thoughts goes far beyond that pale.</p>
<p>The merits of the individual which I listed in this entry are obvious and many, and the consensus process is obviously free to come to whatever conclusions it likes regarding the entry's eventual inclusion or deletion, but I acted on behalf of perceived unfairness meted out to the very clever and entertaining author at hand. I had asked for the opportunity to edit the post in such a way as to make it a proper entry, replete with over 25 printed references to his preinternet published work, but Calton has been so aggressive and offensive that I doubt this will be very likely.</p>
<p>The bigoted motivations which prompted the original deletion discussion motivated me to take action to correct this basic injustice, but I see now that this organization is sadly the victim of its trolls.</p>
<p>Calton, and the people who share his approach: You win. I won't be posting anything else, and I will remove all of the content which I have provided so that you can be free from opinions which diverge from yours.</p>
<p>To the several people who did offer advice and sympathy, thank you: your comments were decent and very helpful, I wish you well in your endeavors.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an all new article which clearly outlines notable contribution on the part of the subject. Not to mention that there is good reason why Dare should be retained on wikipedia. (Besides the overwhelming mantra that Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia) A previous post was defaced on numerous occasions and then nominated for deletion in what clearly arose from homophobia. I have taken the time to accurately research and document this individual, being a bit of a buff on witty writers. The original article was a mess, and very inaccurate. I have cleaned up all of the inaccuracies, and am glad to have this article reviewed by other wikipedians.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarstenboswell_4f17.html" title="User:Carstenboswell">Carstenboswell</a> 03:37, 5 April 2006 (UTC)carstenboswell</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (obviously thats my opinion!) wow calton, you are systematically offering all of my edits and articles for deletion. If I wrote the article on Tokyo, would you delete that as non notable as well? Your page is full of complaints about your mean spiritedness, I can't imagine why. There are actually <b>14 pages of google references</b> to the subject under 'stephen dare', and <b>another hundred or so articles</b> mispelling his name as 'Steven'. <b>Lexis Nexus pulls up another 70</b> articles <i>not included</i> in the google search engines. Thatcher, you're right about much of his material being pre-internet, I didn't realize that you could cite paper articles. Do you simply cite according to research paper format?

<dd><i>am glad to have this article reviewed by other wikipedians</i> Man, your about-face was quick. As for your bogus charge, I look at New Pages each morning, and I tag obvious schlock: I feel no special responsiblity for the schlockees. As for "all the mean-spiritedness complaints" from my Talk page, I'm seeing griping from an axe-grinding Scientologist (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Terryeo_e26f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Terryeo">his RFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Terryeo_064a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Terryeo">ArbCom case</a>) and a multiply reverted POV pusher (read his <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User page</a> for a taste of his attitude)...and that's it. And the less said about your clumsy and inapt Tokyo false-comparison, the better; though I will say that when you're in a hole, guy, it's best to stop digging. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:14, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there are a number of methods under <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. My favorite for the moment is the <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOTNOTE_26e2.html" title="WP:FOOTNOTE">WP:FOOTNOTE</a> method, in which you place the note at the spot in the text where you want it, enclosed by &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt; tags, and a &lt;references/&gt; tag at the bottom of the page creates a auto-numbered footnote list. What you enclose at the note could be a url, a free-form text note, or a citation template. Research paper format (author, article title, publication title, volume/issue, date, page) is fine. There are citation templates to do that automatically or you can write it free-hand. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:14, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I remember looking through Lexis/Nexis the last time this came up and finding a few articles from Jacksonville newspapers that mentioned Dare and/or the Boomtown Cafe in the context of urban revitalization and creating an "artsy" downtown (for lack of a better word). I did not find evidence supporting other claims, such as a series of essays on urban redevelopment. In addition the article lacks an encyclopedic tone with comments like "by far his wittiest writing." Was Dare really "the first in the United States to identify computerization of the workforce as the driving factor of urban decline in the 80s and 90s, and to chronicle the various efforts of American cities to counter urban blight"? I have added {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags where I thought they were most important. Many of these claims are pre-internet but newspaper and magazine articles can still be found in libraries (remember them?) and the citations added (title, author, date, volume, page number, etc) I would support a <b>keep</b> provided the article was trimmed to include those things for which Dare is verifiably notable, which so far only includes the Boomtown Cafe and related urban revitalization in Jacksonville. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:35, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: there was a concern about him being called just "Stephen Dare", which would affect Google results.

<li>Like the <i>Social Policy</i> reference? I dug up the abstract:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Deifell notes how From the Hip assigned 280 writers and photographers aged 25 and under to document how young people are defining and doing service in their communities. By providing a description of a wide range of service activities and perspectives, From the Hip hopes to promote an understanding of the diversity of opinions on service. (SH)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suspect Dare's name is mentioned, at best, as one of the collective 280 young people that are the real subject of the article.
<ul>
<li>Or maybe you mean <i>Social Issues</i>, a journal which seems not have left a trace of its existence anywhere, nor does any article called “The Eternal Cities” seem to be anywhere found.</li>
<li>Let's face it, about the only reference that checks out is being quoted in a Jacksonville buiness journal -- as a café owner.

<dd>If the author continues to fail to provide sources and to bemoan his treatment here, I'll go along with the call to <b>delete.</b> I'm something of a newbie here, but I think wikipedia could stand to have better coverage of some obscure art and culture scenes. Nobody really needs Wikipedia to learn about Britney Spears (although we may end up with a better article than will be found elsewhere).
