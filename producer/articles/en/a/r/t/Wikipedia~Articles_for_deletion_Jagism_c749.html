<p>Why? Why is Jagism less relevant than Buddhism, Communism or any other 'ism'? This is nothing more than an ismist reaction and hopefully it shall be reversed. Long live Jagism. <b>DO NOT DELETE!</b> <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHendo%21_16b4.html" title="User:Hendo!">Hendo!</a> 11:56 19 October 2005 CET <small>User has 6 edits, 5 on this page. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 18:15, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</small> psst, new guys have to start somewhere, grass. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHendo%21_16b4.html" title="User:Hendo!">Hendo!</a></p>

<li>I'm sorry you think this is nonsense, but it's something I am very serious about.What is wrong in trying to change your life&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am putting Jagism into practise everyday and have several interested parties willing to try Jagism.It ain't a religous thing, just a simple philosophy where you make your own decisions. I am currently in the process of trying to write a pamphlet about Jagism and the positive benefits it can have on your life.Cheers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it less notable than Buddhism? Maybe because Buddhism has millions of adherents worldwide whereas a google on Jagism yields 12 hits including one speculating on a particular foible of his Jaguar being a "jagism"&#160;:-) That and it sounds like a vanity name for something which people already did anyway. So, either demonstrate notability (e.g. list of notable adherents) or delete. (later) checked some more: I really can't find any credible evidence that this exists outside of a very limited circle - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 12:22, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Everything starts from a small beginning - even Christianity started with just 12 disciples. Perhaps if this Wiki was available to the Roman Empire, they could dismiss any articles from Christians as having no "credible evidence that this exists outside of a small circle" or has any "notable adherents." Does the endorsement of someone 'notable' give credibility to an idea?</p>
<ul>
<li>When Christianity had 12 adherents it was probably not notable. It now has 2.1 billion, so is. What verifiable external evidence of notability has been presented for Jagism? None. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 13:28, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Isn't "jagism" a legitimate offshoot of the <i>Marxist</i> / <i>Trotskyist</i> dialectical method of apprehending nature, which regards the phenomena of nature as being in constant movement and undergoing constant change, though applied to personal choice, i.e. more akin to the discarded <i>Hegelian</i> idealistic shell? <a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDizietSma_2eb8.html" title="User:DizietSma">DizietSma</a> 14:21 19 October 2005</p>

<dd>This is a huge concept to grasp. People always tell me, “I’m going to make some major changes.” My response to that is simple: Certain aspects of your life might need a significant overhaul, but I don’t need to know about those big changes. I’m more interested in the minor change you plan to make today. Personal improvement starts when you change something you do daily—a routine, a habit, a way of working, or interacting with other people."</dd>

<p>Thanks for the support guys. There will be a web-site up shortly dealing with Jagism in more depth.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The purpoose of wikipedia is to be a compedium of verifiable, encyclopedic articles. Something need not be noted on google (many of our historical topics are not) but there must be <b>some</b> verifiable evidenece of the existance of the subject, and some reson to belive that it is significant, i.e. notable. if this can't be found on google, where <b>can</b> it be found. Have any books been published about Jagism? Have any newspapers or other media reported on it? are there large numbers of people devoted to it? It may be an admirable and valuable concept. We don't oppose it. Neither do we foster it. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, it is not the place where new ideas get promoted. Go out into the world and convice people of the importance or value of Jagism. Get them talking and writing about it, in one medium or another. Then come back here and we will report on what they say. (If people are already doing this, tell us here. Give us citations.) <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Message from Jag; Fellow disciples of Jagism, do not despair.Let the greedhead non forward thinking have their way. We know Jagism works and will continue to work it's way into a society that is, thanks to folk who refuse to try and change, gonna end up disappearing up its own ass.</p>
