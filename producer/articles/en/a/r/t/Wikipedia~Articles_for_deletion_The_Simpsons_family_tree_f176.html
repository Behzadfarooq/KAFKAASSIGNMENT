<p>Hyper-trivial, misinformative, and un-encyclopedic.</p>
<p>Reasons why this page should be deleted:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is extremely trivial -- even to fans of the show. The information given is so obscure, given its source, that most <i>Simpsons</i> fan sites don't provide this sort of thing (though there are a few that do)</li>
<li>The vast majority of characters on the list have never been mentioned on the television show itself. The source for this information is a long out-of-print tie-in book that was put out in 1991, which an extremely small minority of the show's famously obsessed devotees have ever read, and which most of the present staff that writes and produces the show have never even heard of. This family tree also has been contradicted by the show in the 14 years since it came out; for example, Homer and Marge's mothers have different names on the series than they do on this chart, and even though the article notes this contradiciton, it still underlines the fact that the book cannot be taken seriously as continuity. Put simply, its irrelevance (not simply its obscurity) makes it a poor reference source.</li>
<li>This doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Something like a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Simpsons_3821.html" title="List of characters from The Simpsons">list of characters</a> does because it's integral to understanding the show. This family tree is just ephemera that adds nothing useful.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it is of relevant interest to the show, and shows how things in shows can be contradicted from their beginnings and onward. While inaccurate, it still gives some accurate references like the connection between Homer and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Powell_7996.html" title="Herb Powell">Herb Powell</a>. It is also interesting to note the ancestory of the families, as well it is interesting to see that Homer and Mr. Burns are distantly related. Note, this particular book was also referenced in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> article for his birth date. -- <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/20px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="10" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 01:50, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or merge (though with this much material, probably better to keep).

<li>As summarized and paraphrased text, this is highly unlikely to be copyvio. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 10:07, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On looking at it a second time, it does not yet appear to be copyvio since it is only paraphrasing and summarizing only a portion of the family trees. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> | <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">Talk</a> 15:22, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the topic might be worthy of an article, but as it stands, this is simply a reproduction of material from a book acknowledged to be out of date.

<li>Though not canon, it does come from an official source (the book mentioned).

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> though I admit this was a bit of a difficult decision for me. On one hand, this is both fairly trivial and also bordering on copyvio. I know real family trees can't be copyrighted, but a fictional family tree that appeared in a book... I'm not sure. On the other hand, I consider the book an official source (it was me who changed the birthdate in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> article a few months ago) and this is genuinely interesting information that can't easily be found elsewhere. Plus, with the two images and all, it looks like a good bit of work was put into this, so I'd prefer not to delete without good reason. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:32, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why would we want to keep false information? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:22, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, as I said, I consider the book to be an official source (as would most Simpsons fans, I'd imagine). The official-ness of the book is without question, as series creator Matt Groening is the book's author. It's true that some of the family tree was later contradicted in the series... but then things within the series were later contradicted by the series as well. For instance, Smithers was a black person in the first season. Any time a fictional work grows past a certain size, continuity problems are bound to slip in, and such continuity problems are of great interest to fans. In any case, the parts of the family tree that conflict with the show are specified and discussed in the article, so readers aren't likely to be confused unless they merely glance at it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:43, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Which means Larry Burns is too, being the son of Monty Burns. So it begs the question: should we incorporate alternative continuities--comic books, official/nonofficial tie-in publications (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Golden_Books_2e45.html" title="Little Golden Books">Little Golden Books</a>), promotional publications--into the show guide proper, or link them to seperate wikis? I mean, it's noted in here that Comic Book Guy's real name is officially "Jeff Albertson", though Matt Groening said in some obscure interview it was "Louis Lane". Why the name change, anyway? Did Groening or some other writer forget that comment?
