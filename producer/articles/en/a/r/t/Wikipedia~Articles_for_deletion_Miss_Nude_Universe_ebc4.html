<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> The history here does appear to be murky; the web site claims that the pageant has run since the mid 60's, but it is unclear whether the pageant winners in the 60s were in the same pageant, or just one with the same name. It would be nice to have a reliable third-party history, and we don't have one. It has clearly never had much notoriety outside the "adult" community, except briefly in the 60s when Playboy was publicizing it (if that was in fact the same title.) If more sources were found, I might change my vote. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless more sources are found. I've heard news stories about this contest for years (on legit news programs, to boot). I'm really surprised there's no web site for this contest, especially in this age of all sort of "adult content" on the web. (Maybe I should start one, eh??) Does seem a bit odd, so dump it. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 04:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> google nets almost 450 distinct hits, which I think is enough to prove that this thing actually exists. I can't find any real press for the contest, which is kind of arbitrary since there are no notability guidelines for beauty pageants. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 04:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">PNC</a> applies here just as it does elsewhere, as indeed does our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. If you cannot find anything at all written about the pageant, how do you expect an article to be written about it? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would argue that there are enough reliable sources that make minor mention of the subject so that it passes <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 18:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would agree if the information can be used to build a meaningful article, but mere mention of its existance 500 times, doesn't build the text. See my note below about a Miss Nude Pageants article. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So where are these reliable sources that tell us about this subject, then? Please cite some. You appear to be conflating a non-zero count of Google search results with the existence of sources. <b>Counting Google hits is not research.</b> It's necessary to actually read the things that Google turns up. Do so, and you'll find that there's scant information that is directly about this pageant. I've yet to find a reliable source that gives the year that the pageant started, for example. If you find one, please cite it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:49, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> One would think that given how big porn is on the net, and that this pagent has apparently been running since the 60s, there would be some reliable sources. Damned if I can find them, however. This suggests to me that while we can verify its existence, it simply is not notable. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, there appear to have been at least two, possibly separate, Miss Nude Universe pageants -- the one that <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitten_Natividad_b9b3.html" title="Kitten Natividad">Kitten Natividad</a> is said to have won in the early 1970s, and the one owned by Rio Rivers that folded in 2005 after "15 years" in the business (<i>pace</i> infrogmation). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Page 124 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0595309267</a> confirms that at least one Miss Nude Universe pageant exists. But that is <i>all</i> that it says about it, including it in a laundry list of "other special pageants". I can also find sources that state that there was a Miss Nude Universe Pageant held in Naked City (<a href="../../../r/o/s/Roselawn%2C_Indiana_7b8a.html" title="Roselawn, Indiana">Roselawn, Indiana</a>) in the 1960s and 1970s. But Naked City closed in 1986 when Dick Drost left, and, once again, the sources don't actually say anything about the pageant since it is Naked City that they are in fact discussing. Indeed, there are several that say that it was actually Miss Nude America, not Universe. I can also find several biographies of people that state that they were "winner of Miss Nude Universe" in some year or other.
<p>There's tangential information all over the place about other things that mention this pageant, or some other similarly named one. There are people who are recorded as having won a title of Miss Nude Universe. There is a nudist camp that is recorded as having hosted a contest by that name. But the important 3 words are "about other things". There's scant information that is actually about the pageant directly. I am unable to find out even basic information about the pageant itself, such as a list of year-by-year winners, or even that all of these disparate snippets of information in discussions of other things are actually about the same single contest. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Brianyoumans' and Uncle G's comments. It appears difficult to get reliable information on the thing. Perhaps if someone later actually gets that information and actually types it in, the article could be revived.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, being a stub isn't a good enough reason for deletion.
