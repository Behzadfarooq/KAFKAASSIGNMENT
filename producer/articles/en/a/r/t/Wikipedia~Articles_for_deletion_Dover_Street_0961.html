<li><b>Keep</b>, at least for a while. I appreciate the work that Tyrenius has done, and I'm willing to let these run and see where they go. I'm still very concerned that these have crossed over into <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT an indiscrimiate collection of information</a> territory. I don't believe that a street is inherently notable just because something important once happened there or something on it is important, any more than a pair of socks is notable because somebody important did something while wearing them. To my mind the street has to be known for something like <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saville_Row_59d5.html" title="Saville Row">Saville Row</a> or synonymous with something like <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threadneedle_Street_e5c7.html" title="Threadneedle Street">Threadneedle Street</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a>. But it seems like there's enough potential for these articles to qualify. And it's also possible that my horizions are too limited; this is not a paper encyclopedia, so perhaps it's plausible that we should have 5,410 <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Street_b8b6.html" title="High Street">High_Street</a> articles, each with snippets of history. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 15:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The point is that these <i>are</i> well-known and notable streets. The information in the article brings out some of the reasons why this is so, and is therefore not indiscriminate. It is purposeful. You obviously haven't noticed that we do already have 5,410 High Street articles with snippets of history. Take <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> for example.

<dd>Sorry, I was unclear. The <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Street_b8b6.html" title="High Street">High Street</a> article mentions that there are 5,410 streets called "High Street" in Britain. It seems to me that from the standard a number of people are arguing, there's no reason we wouldn't end up with articles on all of them. Personally, I don't think that important things happening in a place make the place important unless the place becomes synonymous with the events, like Chicago's <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haymarket_Square_8145.html" title="Haymarket Square">Haymarket Square</a>. Ditto having shops or galleries, unless, like <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo_Drive_ab72.html" title="Rodeo Drive">Rodeo Drive</a>, the street becomes widely known on its own. Whether these two streets qualify under the standards I'd use, I can't say, but I don't yet feel that the articles demonstrate the quality I'm looking for. As to the other articles, quite a number of them seem to be containers for trivia, and I don't believe that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion of articles</a> is cause for keeping similar ones. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 23:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep both</b> I was absolutely astonished when I saw these two streets on AfD. They are in the heartland of London's West End off Piccadilly and both are the location for significant premises and historic events associated with the arts.

Not notability of any form" while happily contributing to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fratton_railway_station.html" title="Fratton railway station">Fratton railway station</a>, which has "a staffed ticket office, toilets, a light refreshment facility, car parking and a taxi rank"(!). <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, rightly or wrongly consensus says that all stations are noteworthy, within that I will make sure articles are accurate. With streets, I have no problem with Oxford Street or Shaftsbury Avenue being included, they are synonymous with the institutions in the street as Broadway is.

I would suggest a little more research before an AfD in the future, or at least waiting a day or two so that the article has the chance to be developed beyond an initial stub — and at least learn to spell the names&#160;:). That said, I'm sure this has developed the articles more quickly than might have otherwise been the case!

<li><i>Comment'</i> What research? My opinion is still is that these streets, regardless of what is located in them, are not notable in themselves but merely addresses.

<li>I see no evidence of any personal attack. Jpbowen has been most polite, restrained and friendly, while making the points he wishes to. A street <i>is</i> what is located in it: otherwise it is just a length of tarmac. There is a contradictory logic arguing that Oxford Street is "synonymous with the institutions in the street" while Dover and Albemarle Street "regardless of what is located in them, are not notable in themselves but merely addresses". In fact, if anything, it is the other way round. I'm not aware of any institutions in Oxford Street: it is merely an address (for shops). What research? Well, the famous associations with Oscar Wilde, Lord Byron and Whistler for a start. West End streets are rather like your claim for railway stations - they are all notable. There are other intermediary stages for stubs which are often better than going directly to AfD, e.g. a {{notability}} tag, which then gives editors a chance to improve the entry. If it is subsequently not improved, then the AfD is that much stronger. If it is done, then there's no need for the AfD. I realise you've made some very good and successful noms for AfD so I don't want to knock you, but I would urge caution when there is room for doubt. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:10, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We are going to disagree, sticking to London - Oxford Street, Harley Street, Saville Row are synonymous with the activities and institutions connected to them, Pudding Lane, Sidney Street, Cable Street are famous for events that happened in them, Whitehall and The Mall qualifies under both. Dover and Albemarle Street do not have either, they are being included because they are the address of something notable. IMO that is comparable to including someone because they are related to someone notable. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 07:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that's sophistry, or at least splitting hairs. If the street is the address of something notable, then it happened in that street. Last point is more comparable to including a street because it is joined to another street. Anyhow, let's just see how the AfD goes with new revisions. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:11, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Using the same logic, and the relations analogy, then one might say that the Kennedy family is not notable because only a few of them were really important. Rather than having an article on every notable address in a street, it makes more sense to have an article on the street as a whole, especially if, like Dover Street, there is a distinct character to it. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 09:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for all the lively discussion. Personally I believe any significant historic street with interesting associated events and buildings, especially if there are already Wikipedia links for them from other articles, is worthy of inclusion. This means many streets in a city like London, especially in the central area. Certainly a {{notability}} tag would have been more appropriate here initially in my view in any case. But some general guidance would be welcome. <a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbowen_d87e.html" title="User:Jpbowen">Jonathan Bowen</a> 20:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
