<p>The result of the debate was: We aren't yet at the point where headmasters automatically get articles as schools do, and with that out of the way, this man has never been committed of the crimes of which he is accused, so we have zero notable deeds by this man, and no claim by the keep side that he has ever done any. That makes this page little more than an attack - until a couple of days after creation the article contained the heading "Criminal History" where no such history exists. The use of possible sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry by the article's creator in this discussion gives even more cause for concern for the article's future if it was kept. The majority for deletion is present but not overwhelming, however if I was to close this as 'no consensus' it would be an abdication of responsibility. Per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, the level of care we <i>must</i> exercise with articles on living people leads me to close this as <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:56, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aren't you over-reacting just a wee, little bit. Considering this article concerns a public figure and is based on multiple references from the NY Times and other top-flight news sources, I don't see any violation of WP:BLP. Furthermore, the second page you referred to, WP:Not Evil, is an essay and thus has no bearing on the discussion. Wikipedia may be forever, but so are national newspapers - I hardly see that as a valid argument for deletion (and this is not a speedy delete). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:24, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nice to see you make good use of the argumentative technique of selective interpretation. (Spot the fact I listed a number of offences not of <i>global</i> note, coupled with the use of the word "every"?) Some instances may merit mention in a global encyclopaedia, for reasons of notability. Most are of note to no-one but the immediate community affected. This case for instance. If it ever <i>becomes</i> important beyond its currently limited catchment, then there <i>may</i> be an argument for constucting an article in the context of the case. Currently it's just an attack on the individual based on regurgitating in a global medium what appears to be being published on a small local front. Currently I wouldn't say it compares well in stature against - say - <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Gagarin_8e95.html" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Don't let that stop you whipping up the fervour though. There's nothing like a good lynching. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 23:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
