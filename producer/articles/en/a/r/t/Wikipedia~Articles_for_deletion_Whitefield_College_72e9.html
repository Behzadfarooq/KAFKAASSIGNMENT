<li><b>Keep</b> This appears to be a legitimate seminary, founded in 1980. Searching on 'Whitefield Theological Seminary' on Google brings up a number of pages of references, many of them listings on the CVs of faculty at other seminaries. This does not seem to be a diploma mill, and neither is it an accredited college - it is a Christian seminary, for training ministers and religious workers. We have articles on high schools and elementary schools, why not on seminaries? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:56, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please supply sources for notability. Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not keep articles based on what "appears to be a legitimate". How many students attend? Is this bigger than a high school? Can you compare it to a high school? Does it have classrooms? Is it ran out of an apartment? Do the teachers have accredited degrees? How many teachers are there? Why isn't it accredited? Source for claiming its not a diploma mill? Etc etc. Without such issues to be judged with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> independent from the place itself such as article will be about what it isn't (accredited) and what the group claims to be. That is not how article should be written.</dd>
<dd>Oh yeah, we don't keep all high schools and elemnetary schools. So that's not a reason to keep. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 07:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize for the length of the following; you asked for some verifiable information. I think most of the following is too trivial to include in the article, but it all contributes to my sense that this is a legitimate institution, in existence for some years. First: looking at the catalog (<a href="http://www.whitefield.edu/catalog.php" class="external text" title="http://www.whitefield.edu/catalog.php" rel="nofollow">catalog download</a>) this is in fact a "distance learning" sort of thing - they send lecture tapes out to students, who work with a mentor agreed on with the seminary. It doesn't appear to be that large - their administrative bulliten <a href="http://www.whitefield.edu/downloads/Administrative%20Bulletin.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.whitefield.edu/downloads/Administrative%20Bulletin.pdf" rel="nofollow">lists</a> something around 100 graduates.

<dd>Sorry, I fail to understand how lists of people of an unaccredited online "college" have to do with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Can you show this is notable? Or why we should care that "faculty" at other unaccredited schools have online degrees from Whitefield.</dd>
<dd>If you have sources to show notability or WP:V please add them to the article, and I'll withdraw this nomination.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 00:12, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I think this shows is that this is not a diploma mill; these look like pretty respectable people, I don't think they would all be claiming phony degrees. Second, although the school doesn't have many graduates, it appears to be fairly important within its little Reformed community - 2 of the editors of the Christian Observer (out of about 20) have degrees from this school, and lots of faculty at other seminaries.</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another point I think should be understood here: you are constantly pointing out that the school is unaccredited. The school IS accredited, by the only organization that it cares about, namely the Reformed Presbyterian Church, which recognizes it as a valid training school for pastors (from the catalog). The school states clearly in the same catalog that it does not have secular accreditation and that credits taken there may be invalid elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have noticed that <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> has a habit of nominating for deletion pages relating to religious institutions. Some of these articles have needed deletion, and I have voted to delete them. On some of them, it seems like he has not 'done his homework' in advance, and has nominated pages that ended up being kept. Sometimes, also, he can be quite, er, <i>robust</i> in his defence of his nominations. I would advise people to look closely at pages that <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> nominates for deletion, and to not be intimidated by his responses. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is a larger collection of these religious institutions that fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> than places that are diploma mills, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_St._Clements_University_8c53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Clements University">example</a>, that lack <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd>I got a better idea. Why not give sources that PROVE this is notable instead of trying to attack me. If you can show its notable, I'll withdraw the afd. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 07:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize if my comment seemed like a personal attack. I have been semi-away from Wikipedia for a little while, and the last time I encountered AFDs from you was about a month ago, when you were trying to get rid of 3 professors at Dallas Baptist Theological Seminary - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jim_Underwood_4be6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Underwood">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Underwood</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Darrell_Bock_a6b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darrell Bock">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darrell Bock</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_John_D._Hannah_4fd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John D. Hannah">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John D. Hannah</a> - two bestselling authors and a well-known historian of theology, all 3 of which survived AFD (Hannah just barely.) Certainly, everyone who nominates articles for deletion has their failures - I have myself - but I thought this was a notable enough pattern to mention. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, those two failed. So what? They ended up getting well-sourced and proved notability.
