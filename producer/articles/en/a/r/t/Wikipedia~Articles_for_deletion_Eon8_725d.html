Some website thats only claim to notability is the fact that no one knows what it is for. Sounds like a brilliant marketing tactic to me.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I see no real reason why any site would be this deliberately obscure unless it was to create hype. Wikipedia is meant to be an impartial observer, but with no solid information yet as to what Eon8 is, anything written in this article is mere speculation and conjecture that cannot be independently verified by anyone. Wikipedia cannot be an impartial observer if it lets itself get entangled in the hype -- we need to stay above the fray long as possible until the hype settles rather than be part of it. -- <span style="border: 1px solid #003333;"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><font style="background: #003333" color="#FFFFFF">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</font></b></i></a> <b><a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia%7ECounter-Vandalism_Unit_8507.html" title="Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism Unit"><font color="#B34040">C</font><font color="#66B38C">V</font><font color="#408CB3">U</font></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><font style="background:#FFFFFF" color="#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</font></a></b></span> 15:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really don't think all this waiting business is the way to do things. We don't customarily keep things because they <i>might</i> turn out to be significant; in fact, we pretty much do the exact opposite! As I said, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Restoring the article if it turns out to be significant is a piece of cake. Ain't no thing. Right now, it's just a thing on the web, and not even a thing that everyone's talking about -- sure, it gets some blog action, but there's a reason why "stuff some guys said on their blogs" is not generally accepted as a Wikipedia source. It may turn out to be significant, but it may not. Point is, we don't know, which pretty much underlines the fact that <i>it is not yet significant</i>. The fact that a lot of us are clearly intrigued by it speaks well of these guys' ability to get people interested, but that doesn't make this site encyclopedic material. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 18:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i><b>Strong Keep</b></i> - SOMETHING will happen. Wikipedia should not deny the existence of this page. If eon8 turns out to be a hoax, you should STILL keep the page for the sake of wikipedia remaining the world's foremost archive of all relatively interesting stuff. Famous or not (and eon8 is becoming a fad), I want to know what's going on, and wikipedia was the first place I found that provided some explanation of the site. Since it's useful to me, keep it around, why not? 71.224.37.10 21:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

The idea of waiting for the countdown to end is absolutely ridiculous and is an invitation for more art self-promotion/viral marketing abuse of wikipedia. Wikipedia is absolutely not supposed to be a cog in a marketing machine or a free billboard for "edgy" web artists. If the site does in fact turn out to be notable after the countdown ends, THEN create an article. To do so now is simply to blindly help someone promote themselves for zero encyclopedic reason.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Some documentation should be available on Wikipedia about current events. You were correct to refer me to policies but I reiterate that this has become an internet event which people have been discussing ad nauseum. I do believe, however, that the page should be rigourously monitored for misuse by those who are disscussing it. <a href="../../../m/0/n/User%7EM0nde_e817.html" title="User:M0nde">m0nde</a> 05:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I can just see a bunch of fat nerds in a basement sweating profusely at this <b>BLATANT ATTEMPT TO PROSTITUTE WIKIPEDIA!!!!!!</b>. The website has created buzz. It's notable. People are coming here to "vote" not to stack anything but because they want to weigh their opinion without making an account. Are these people's opinions worth <i>less</i> because they're anonymous?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Some of us, myself included, would argue that proposition. If you are only coming here to give an opinion, you are likely not familiar with Wikipedia policies. The above comments reflect this. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 02:12, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - Don't straw-man me. I know Wikipedia policies, I feel it doesn't matter in this case due to the fact this site has spread in less than two days to pretty much <b>everywhere</b>. You want to berate someone for policy, look at the guy underneath who just chewed out a new user for being a "sockpuppet" (apparently someone's got a faulty definition).

<dd><b>Response</b>: should i infer anything from the indentation of your post immediately below mine? along the lines of sock/meat-puppetry? by way of general comment rather than direct reply, if there are suddenly no end of new / anonymous users offering their opinions here on this, i suspect that that's as a result of the interest generated, and not because they are all in the pockets of theplanet / eon8. that that level of interest has been generated is reason enough to keep the article, i'd have thought? sepher 88.107.219.208 03:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: I'm suggesting that the number of hits / searches / threads / posts, here, and elsewhere on the net, are an indication of the widespread interest created. not that Wikipedia should be a "popularity contest" or a "billboard"? i think the "buzz" round the net is obvious. how many daft sites and anims have you seen spoofing it, or analysing it? lots, that's how many! it's an event. keep for now at least? it may be a 9 day wonder? it may just be the biggest thing since dancing hamsters! &#160;;) sepher 88.107.219.208 04:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Keep</i>, of course. This type of thing is exactly what Wikipedia should be useful for. I've heard of eon8 from three different sources in a matter of hours. Google is 24–48 hours behind, and Britannica obviously won't ever touch this. Where else will I be able to look for a reliable synopsis of this meme, along with thorough details as to what's been discovered? <b>Obviously</b> this is nothing but a viral marketing site, but I can't determine that solely by looking at the site (which is down) or forums (which are segmented and unreliable). If you want to bring the page to Wikipedia's standards, then eliminate the "crystal ball" paragraphs and stick to the core facts about this site and what it has been discovered about it. —<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETildebeeplus_a7bb.html" title="User:Tildebeeplus">tilde</a> 03:40, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
