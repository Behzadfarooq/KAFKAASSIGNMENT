<p>The user, being me, accidentally put it on the user page and user talk page trying to learn how this all works. The doctrine is not a just a religious theory but is a world wide group of people whose uniqueness is of great interest in all seminaries and theological studies. I will go to my talk/user page and figure out how they work. 23:12, 6 December 2005 postscript: I just left a better synopsis of this article at your, Mr. Gustafson's talk page. Slowly I am figuring this out. Thanks for your overview.</p>
<p>--- If an individual is not of seminary or theological background, this article may seem trite. However, within the large religious community this article is a vital resource for understanding this group of people. ---</p>
<p>Here is a copy of what I submitted to Mr. Gustafson:</p>
<p>Hello, Hope this is the proper spot. I have just started working on an entry on shout voice trump. Having studied the Rapture doctrines and seminary theology, this doctrine is unique because it involves people instead of belief. This doctrine is actually a large group of people worldwide. I have been researching it and currently have added some of the basic reference links I was directed to.</p>
<p>Your comments about user page and talk page need clarified. It took me awhile to figure out how Wikipedia works. I finally signed up with a username that would match the article title thinking that was proper. Then I tried to create the page accidentally on the user and talk pages.</p>
<p>Thank you for your considerations as I continue to expand on this group of individuals. You could say, that just as there are Methodists or Catholics, there are now a group of people who are Shout Voice Trump'ers for lack of an official title. I have had trouble finding clear resources and considered building a website but have now decided that the quality of Wikipedia would be the best choice for consolidating information for the research community. <small><small><i>Above unsigned comments from User:24.151.228.4 aka <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShout_Voice_Trump_6ad4.html" title="User:Shout Voice Trump">User:Shout Voice Trump</a>.</i></small></small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am convinced that it is a genuine good faith attempt at an article. There are references that help to support the article's point of view. There are issues relating to its notability (<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Shout+voice+trump%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Shout+voice+trump%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">36 google hits)</a> and the way in which the article is written. It is clear from the history that the author is trying to make the article as good a quality as he possibly can. But the AFD was put on the article almost immediately on creation. I believe that, as with all but nonsense articles, an article should be given a good chance to develop, say perhaps 1 month, and then we can judge. It is too early to really say one way or the other. So for the moment I am saying keep. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:30, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We could let this fester here for a year, the article could grow to featured quality, and that would not change the fact that the subject is not notable enough to warrant inclusion, period. You said it yourself: 36 google hits. No wikipedia article of any quality will change that. --Jeffrey O.

<li><b>Delete</b> if this really is a worldwide group of people, they're awfully quiet about it.

<ul>
<li><b>From Author:</b> Type in William Branham, the author of this movement and you get 291,000 hits at Google. As I previously mentioned, there is no official title for this group of individuals. (<a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidians_ac61.html" title="Branch Davidians">Branch Davidians</a> at google is 200,000 hits.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, look at it this way, Wikipedia would be one of the main sources for research on this topic. Also, at Google type in shout voice trump without quotes, 237,000, and you will see the validity of interest in this scripture and interpretations, which I plan to include. ie: other interpretations, rebuttals, size of movement... I found one site <a href="http://WMB1.com" class="external text" title="http://WMB1.com" rel="nofollow">WMB1.com</a> that shows church groups worldwide. It has also been translated and distributed throughout the world. Here is a quote from <a href="http://bibleway.org/wmb" class="external text" title="http://bibleway.org/wmb" rel="nofollow">Bibleway.org</a> "To the millions of believers around the world who have heard and received the Message which God has sent through His prophet, William Branham..." From the same site, India alone has had over 2,000,000 books printed. From my research it looks like the move has turned from who William Branham was to what his message, I Thessalonians 4:13-18, has produced.</p>

<li>Suggest <b>merger</b> with the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_M._Branham_512b.html" title="William M. Branham">William M. Branham</a> article. I have no doubt that this is a good faith attempt at an article. Google, on the other hand, yields 3 pages of results for "shout voice trump", none of which seem to identify a particular body of followers. While the teachings are worthy of an NPOV article, not sure these three words are the best choice for a title. The phrase itself is not something that is likely to be searched for. External links in the article also identify Branham's name, not "shout voice trump," as the common thread. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:51, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
