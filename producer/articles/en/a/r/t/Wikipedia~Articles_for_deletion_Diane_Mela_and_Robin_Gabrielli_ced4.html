<dd>If you've had speaking roles in released films and you're not on the IMDb then you haven't been trying. Nothing wrong with that, not everyone necessarily wants to be listed, but I don't think that means we have to reward those who do, and accept that it makes them notable. Acting does not equal notability. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:45, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would say that appearing in 8 feature films (albiet indie ones), plus television work, makes her a professional actress by just about any reasonable measure. There are loads of actors out there who would love to work that regularly. Think of how many actors don't even make it to their first or second feature film role, much less their eighth! If you're asking me to prove that she's not also a waitress or something on the side, I can't, but even if she did have another job it wouldn't necessarily make her not a professional actress. The body of work alone proves it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:09, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think "feature film" gives too much credibility to these movies. First of all, they aren't films at all; they were shot on video. Second, all Diane Mela's movies are by the same guy, Legge. Looking at IMDb, none of the movies report making any gross. The only reported budget (for Honey Glaze) is $2000, which, after subtracting technical costs there is maybe a few hundred dollars left over to pay all actors and crew. And that's a later, and therefore likely higher budget movie. I see no television appearances listed. So what we have here is a friend of a very minor B-movie director who appears, either for free or for pennies, in these movies he makes, which never seem to make it to theatres. Here's what an online reviewer and self-proclaimed Legge "expert" said: "We’re talking zero-budget DIY film-making here - shot for very cheap on location on video camera using friends, neighbours and family as actors." There may be actors who might want to work that regularly (if you can call 7 roles in 16 years "regular") but probably not for free. Sorry, but I just can't see how she can be professional. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:07, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep Both</b> Why should we <i>not</i> include actors who aren't terribly fameous?

<ul>
<li>...but, we must remember that actors are part of culture, accountants and plumbers are not. Also, since nearly everyone enjoys some sort of movies, so acting can hardly be considered a niche subject. That's why IMDB is one of the most popular websites in history, and plumber databses are nowhere near as popular. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:09, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I think we have the answer why this R. demon is all hepped up about wanting to delete these actors. It's because with his own words on this page he says that IMDB will list anyone on the IMDB if they've worked on any film and yet he doesn't even rank "anyone" with his bit of extra work on The Time Machine. <b>He's a want-to-be actor himself!</b> He's just jealous of these people! You don't "do" extra work unless you want to be an actor!!! Also, note that his friends who have made films aren't on IMDB either!!! So they must be really low on the totem pole too!!!&#160;:) lol <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 00:16, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Interesting theory, albeit completely retarded. Could I be on IMDb for being an extra in a single movie? I don't know; I haven't tried, because that would be pathetic. And my friends who have made films actually <i>are</i> on IMDb, and I find it odd you would say they're not considering you know absolutely nothing about them. Am I jealous of Diane and Robin? Well, somehow being in a handful of universally panned B-movies without making a dime off it doesn't sound like a dream come true. I suppose they might have been fun to make though. No, if I'm jealous of anyone I doubt it's Michael Legge's friends and neighbors. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:26, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I will not keep my observations quiet. My name is being bandied about by fiend and even on other VFD's! It is being implied that I am advertising or that I am part of a plot! Half the articles I began to work on have been deleted! There must be a motive to these people attacking all my contributions! I have a right to make these comments and I'd like to see you shut me up. You have a real nerve Gamaliel singling me out to chastise. Is it policy for users to personally attack people that articles are written about. I've noticed fiend making fun of casting aspertions at and insulting almost every person of whose article he has voted to delete. Some of the things he has said could be considered slander! You are in fact personally attacking me Gamaliel by posting your comments here you could easily have left me a message. Peoples motives are important this demon fellow is abusing VFD and is following all my edits and contributions around. He has even accused me and others of vadalizing Wikipedia because we contributed to articles that he did not like. What do you call that? I call that grossly stepping over the bounds of civility. Where were you then. I don't care if you are an administrator don't you dare single me out to yell at and neglect any others who have been campaigning against all my articles and have been making comments about me "personally." <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 03:27, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I cannot monitor every article on Wikipedia, so I have no idea what kind of interactions you've had in the past. However, the only person I see here attacking others, making fun of the user name of another editor, and inventing sinister motives for other users is you. If you feel that you have been attacked by others in other articles, please privately report it to an administrator or follow the steps outlined at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> instead of complaining and attacking others in an unrelated article. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 16:46, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Personally, I'd like to see any evidence backing up anything Plank has just accused me of. There should be a record of it somewhere if it's true. Sure, I've made an occasional quip about some of the people who have articles, and their weak claims to notability (and I am by no means alone in doing so), but I hardly see how that qualifies as "abuse" or "slander". I suspect Plank thinks I'm "following him around" because I nominated to delete a bunch of "actor" substubs he created (these two included), but all that involved was a simple peek at the page for that "Democrazy" movie he is so cracy about; they were all right there. And he might want to note that I did not nominate "Democrazy" for deletion, nor did I even vote to delete it when someone else did, so this is hardly a vendetta. Someone needs to take his pills (oh, is that slander?). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:13, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
