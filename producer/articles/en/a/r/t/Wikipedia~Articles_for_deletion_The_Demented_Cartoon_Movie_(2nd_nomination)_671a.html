<li>You just listed a bunch of Flash cartoons that reference this series and Google hits. You didn't show if it was given nontrivial coverage by reliable sources; you didn't show if it won any notable, independent awards; and I would hardly say every site that hosts this Flash series would count as "distributing" the series. I can't see how this series at all meet the guidelines for notability. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 17:35, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>My opinion is that this work is worthy of a wikipedia article by itself and I backed it up by listing some take-offs that I know of.

<li><b>Keep</b> as this Flash cartoon has had a large effect on the internet culture. Phrases such as "Zeeky Boogy Doog" and "Kamikaze Watermelon" have become known on their own. Of all the junk articles on Wikipedia, this isn't one of them. --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 07:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I listed some of the repeated use of catch-phrases and characters in the last deletion discussion. I'll add them to the article if it survives this round. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillpg_d182.html" title="User:Billpg">Billpg</a> 11:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you could repost them in here and get them on the article page. I'd like to see how it looks in the article. I think the list he had was a good indicator of the type of impact it has had.--<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 07:47, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Citations</b>
<ul>
<li>For example, although user-submitted, there are 15 definitions on the Urban Dictionary having to do with one of the film's catchphrases. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>"Zeeky Boogy Doog" has shown up in numerous YTMND pages (url removed by <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> because of blacklisting)</li>
<li>Fooby, the Kamikaze Watermelon makes an appearance in this short, user (not me) created video. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Or there's this Garry's Mod rebuild of the first Fooby appearance <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>I'm sure a Google search could find more, but these tidbits from this cartoon have bled into other media forms. If you wanted, you could argue that YouTube is a film media. Either way, there's a clear impact on the internet world. If anyone would like to do hitcounts on Google, they can, but evidence such as this helps more.--<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 07:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Ridesim. This movie is one of the more well-known Flash animations, and as he said, some of the phrases used in the movie are used elsewhere. Not to mention it's simply hilarious. --Xbolt 05:55, 16 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Xbolt (<a href="../../../x/b/o/User_talk%7EXbolt_6409.html" title="User talk:Xbolt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xbolt_c53b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xbolt">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

Also, media that make references to a subject are <i><b>not</b></i> a guideline for notability; 20,000 Flash animations can make a reference to an obscure in-joke but unless the joke has coverage from an independent source, it's not notable. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 22:29, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would you like to see the article improved with a section on the impact of the cartoon? It seems to me that there is none right now, but we have some information for starting a section on it. --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 03:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. Let me repeat myself, "impact" is not a criteria for notability. Read the notability guidelines for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web content</a> to understand what constitues notability on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, the article complies with the notability standards. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Chriterion 3</a> indicates: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." The subject gained notability after being published on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albinoblacksheep.com</a>, a "well known" website whose publishings are made by webmaster, rather than by simple user publishing. The creator (Brian Kendall) does not own or operate said website. This qualifies the article as <b>compliant</b> and should be decided as <b>keep</b> due to Albinoblacksheep's notability as an "online publisher." --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 07:07, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
