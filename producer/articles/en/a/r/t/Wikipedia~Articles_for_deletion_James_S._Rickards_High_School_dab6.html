<li>I am totally serious. If wikipedia only takes "above average schools" then people who attend(ed) "below average schools" will have no reason to feel the project is for them. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:06, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Those people are exclude because no-one wants to look them up. If you start excluding things that people <i>do</i> want to look up because they aren't <i>good enough</i> for wikipedia, you will alienate anyone who tried.

<li>A school can be noteworthy for many reasons besides academics. It could be architecturally significant. It could win sports championships. It could run a significant charity drive. It could earn a place in <i>Guinness World Records.</i> What I am saying, as with <i>any other local institution of similar size</i> is that it needs to set itself apart from the crowd in some way. Failing to provide adequate basic education only makes it more insignificant. Don't you think it would serve the purposes of education better if a school could <i>aspire</i> to Wikipedia inclusion? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 22:43, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Failing to provide adequate basic education makes a school much <i>more</i> signficant if most schools do provide it. Wikipedia articles are not supposed to be rewards or incentives for the subject, they are supposed to be a resource for people who want to understand the world better. I don't know if excluding schools for low performance would serve the purpose of education better, but it would certainly motivate a lot of vandalism. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By what logic is any obscure institution, academic or otherwise, rendered noteworthy by failure at its primary mission? Spectacular failure may invite derision. Do you suppose this qualifies? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 04:22, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You yourself said "it needs to set itself apart from the crowd in some way". I didn't realize you meant in <i>good</i> way, as if wikipedia is some kind of beauty contest. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 14:21, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Earning a D score from the Florida Dept. of Education isn't particularly unusual, for what it's worth. As far as I'm concerned, it's not a claim to notability, but that's only if you're worried about individual notability. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well one reason I strongly oppose trying to apply notability to schools is that people consider "less than average academics" as making a school less notable, guaranteeing a systemic bias I would find it hard to live with. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 14:34, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A good point. In the (unfortunately unlikely) case that a <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> proposal that required notability was ratified, it would need to have clear criteria. While I disagree that all schools should be included, a school guideline would need to be consistent, with any inconsistencies erring on the side of inclusion. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:40, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Other positive factors may discount academics. A school in a depressed neighborhood whose faculty and students build houses for <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitat_for_Humanity_272a.html" title="Habitat for Humanity">Habitat for Humanity</a> could be notable. The oldest schoolhouse in New England would be notable for historic reasons, regardless of academics. A school for homeless children in Ghana could be notable for its humanitarian mission. However it is <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a> to protest that quality performance should not be one basis for evaluation. Wikipedia does not feature every film of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. We feature <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca_%28film%29.html" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca</a></i>.
<ul>
<li>Hmm by that logic wikipedia shouldn't feature every Simpsons episode. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it really shouldn't. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:43, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>So every one of the 10's of thousands of virtually identical high schools in the US should have its own Wikipedia article? Dear God! --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 21:09, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Yes</i>. Wikipedia is not paper. High school is a notable period in many people's lives, and each typically affects many thousands of people. If we can have individual articles on television show episodes then I see no reason not to document High Schools.

<li>Not only nationwide: this is the world wide web. I suppose there are hundreds of thousands of primary and secondary schools. Imagine the number in China alone. Many schools have identical names.

<li><b>Keep</b>, As a student who attends this high school, I dont think its nonimportant. However, some may see it that way. But is there any need to get rid of it? Below average academics? Yearly we attend and get top 5 in Mu Alpha Theta entirely due to our IB Program. Get your story straight. We may have poor overall academics, but we have some of the best students in the nation roaming through our halls year after year.

<li>That's interesting, is there convenient way we can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> it so we can put it in the article? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:21, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>LOL, and your point would be—? Are you implying that www.rickards.leon.k12.fl.us is not a reliable source of information? Have you any idea how many articles there are on Wikipedia with *ZERO* sources cited? —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 09:54, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, and that's a <i>big</i> problem in an encyclopedia that does not rest on the authority of its contributors. However, even though it is true that many articles are not in accord with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">Wikipedia's policy on citing sources</a> nobody has suggested that that is inappropriate policy. And, although people in these school debates keep asserting that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> should be the only criterion for inclusion, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a> would seem to say otherwise. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:06, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>www.musnews.tk is governed by FAMAT (Florida Association of Mu Alpha Theta) and is part of the National Mu Alpha Theta organization. I think thats pretty credible.</li>
