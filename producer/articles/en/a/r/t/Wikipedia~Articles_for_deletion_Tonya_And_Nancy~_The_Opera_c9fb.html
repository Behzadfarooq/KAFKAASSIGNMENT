<dd><b>Comment</b> Ah, good point then, so I'll strike that out. Probably just copying the AP article. However, Sports Illustrated is definitely a major publication. I don't know if it's only in the online issue of SI or in the print magazine, though.

<dd><b>Delete</b> Alright, after researching <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I strike my weak keep. Wikipedia is not a news report, and as of now, article is of a non-notable play which is currently getting minor press for its goofy newsfriendly topic. Should it move to bigger venues, win awards, gross a substancial amount, etc., then we can reconsider the article in the future per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 05:50, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The opera was mentioned in a number of media outlets around the US that were not just copied from the AP. All are available on LexisNexis - search string used: [tonya w/4 nancy AND (music! or opera!)]
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
<li>The Orlando Sentinal (May 4)</li>
<li>Baltimore Sun (May 3)</li>
<li>Seattle P-I (May 3)</li>
<li>Boston Herald (May 2)</li>
<li>In addition, this got coverage last October in the New York Times (Oct. 18, 2005 - Arts Section, page 2):
<ul>
<li>Anyone searching for an opera built on violent conflict more recent than the Trojan Wars need look no farther than Tufts University, where plans are in progress for a spring production of <i>Nancy and Tonya: The Opera,</i> based on the rivalry between the ice skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding that led to an attack on Ms. Kerrigan before the 1994 Winter Olympics. PlaybillArts.com reported that the opera, with a libretto by the novelist Elizabeth Searle and music by Abigail Al-Doory, a Tufts graduate student, features an aria based on Ms. Kerrigan's lament: <i>Why? Why? Why?</i></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I fully trust Lexis-Nexis, and as I noted above, the article appeared in Sports Illustrated online and other AP articles. However, is this opera noteable yet? Right now, it's just human interest news, considering it only premiered a few days ago as a college production and is receiving attention primarily for the novelty of a Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan singing. Having reviewed <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enot_aa34.html" title="WP:not">WP:not</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, I don't think the article is noteable or any different than any other student production by graduate students at other colleges -- the only difference is that the subject matter made a nice human interest story for a day. Now, if the play expands to a major venue, wins an award, or makes tons of money, then I'd argue for keeping the article. But right now, it's not yet noteable and is simply a college production which had a good press release going for it. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 20:06, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I can see your point and where you're coming from. My stance is that it is notable <i>because</i> it is a college production that has garnered national (international disputed) attention. It is extremely rare for that sort of attention to happen, and is the main reason I'd say keep. I definitely appreciate the additional reasoning you've offered, though. --24.50.144.90 20:25, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> Trust me, I was torn with this, which is why I voted "Weak Keep" originally before changing my vote to "Delete". To use a recent example, there was a cat named Molly that was trapped in a NY wall recently which received a great deal of attention for a week across the globe. It made a nice human interest piece, but then the story disappeared a month ago when the cat was rescued. An article was attempted for Molly the cat, but was deleted as non noteable. My belief is that it's too early to evaluate T&amp;N, as its importance might disappear by next week never to be heard of again. Now, should it follow the path of operas like the Jerry Springer one and become even a small scale success -- i.e., we're still hearing of this opera a year from now -- then I'd fully support keeping this in Wiki. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 20:42, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b> The opera has now been covered by NPR's "Only A Game" program: <a href="http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/330/510052/5383921/WBUR_5383921.mp3" class="external free" title="http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/330/510052/5383921/WBUR_5383921.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/330/510052/5383921/WBUR_5383921.mp3</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>This program is carried by about 118 radio stations, so at this point I think it's fair to say that this production, regardless of who is producing it, has garnered significant national attention.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> There is another article here that mentions press that goes back a couple years: <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/114669333737030.xml&amp;coll=7" class="external free" title="http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/114669333737030.xml&amp;coll=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/114669333737030.xml&amp;coll=7</a> And here is an AP article in USA Today from 2005: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2005-10-13-harding-kerrigan-opera_x.htm?POE=click-refer" class="external free" title="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2005-10-13-harding-kerrigan-opera_x.htm?POE=click-refer" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2005-10-13-harding-kerrigan-opera_x.htm?POE=click-refer</a> There is also video coverage here: <a href="http://www.kptv.com/Global/category.asp?C=36238" class="external free" title="http://www.kptv.com/Global/category.asp?C=36238" rel="nofollow">http://www.kptv.com/Global/category.asp?C=36238</a> And here is an article from The London Daily Telegraph from a few months ago: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2006/02/10/soicus10.xml" class="external free" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2006/02/10/soicus10.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2006/02/10/soicus10.xml</a> Furthermore, the writer, Elizabeth Searle, is notable. She's had several books published and has been reviewed by the NY Times Book Review <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.6.22.42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.6.22.42_e4dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.6.22.42">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> From everything above, its pretty clear that the opera is being produced. Its pretty clear that it has gotten some press. It is not for us to judge the value of said press one way or the other. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.240.19.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.240.19.206_65d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.240.19.206">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
