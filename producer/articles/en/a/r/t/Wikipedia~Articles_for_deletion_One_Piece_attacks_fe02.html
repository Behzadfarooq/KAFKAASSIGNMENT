<p>The result was arrived at after a debate that was uglier than it needed to be.</p>
<p>The nomination was a very poor one. The use of the word <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">cruft</a> in a debate of this nature is always ill-advised, and to state that as the reason for deletion means that the vast majority of the debate descends into argument by assertion. One man's "cruft" is another man's priceless tidbit on information, and regardless of anything else it's incredibly rude to the individuals who have volounteered their time creating the article to use a belitteling and pejorative term. Moving on...</p>
<p>It's standard practice to list all previous deletion debates, so everyone knows the history. Not required <i>per se</i> but always a good idea.</p>

There nothing wrong or useless giving infomation OP attacks. There more information coming, please help me by filling out the article."</i></li>
<li>The page at that time was "substantially identical" to the deleted article, and thus a candidate for speedy deletion... but it slipped the net.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_One_Piece_Games_74f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece Games">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece Games</a>, a group nomination where all were kept, closed 31 July 2006.</li>
<li>A strong argument could be made that the <i>existing</i> article is also a candidate for speedy deletion, as while a lot more detail has been added (extra attacks, descriptions, etc.) nothing to indicate either why this is signifigant not any reliable sources have been added.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the reliable sources are the problem with this article. Although it took until the fourth of October for it to come out, "Its [sic] completed unsourced." The website linked is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Due to the requirement that all articles be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">unbiased</a> there must be the ability for articles to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. <b>Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.</b></p>
<p>This is, to some degree, a rip-off <sup><b>1</b></sup> for the "defenders" of the article. Since this point was lost in the morass of circular discussion, they never focused their energy on <i>finding</i> sources to it. The debate from 5 October onwards about items of fiction serving as their own source is an interesting one, but is not sufficient to eclipse both the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">foundational principles</a> of Wikipedia and long-established collective consensus.</p>

<p><small><sup><b>1</b></sup> Yes, this does say "rip-off." A fast one, the run around, etc. While it seems unlikely that reliable sources could be found, it was not shouted out that this was the criterion. It's <u>always</u> the criterion, so this is also a <i><b>t</b></i>ip-off: The quickest way to end almost any deletion discussion is to provide reliable sources. Don't get sucked into arguing about what's important.</small></p>

<p><small>I would say move them to the character's article. However, having an attack list would make the character own article page neater. But I am all for delete. <a href="../../../k/l/j/User%7EKljs_03ee.html" title="User:Kljs">Kljs</a> 7:33, 17 September 2006 (EMT)</small></p>

<dd><small>How would having an attack list in the character's page make it <i>neater</i>? It was like that for the longest time, then we decided when the pages where being cleaned, to make a break out page of all the One Piece attacks for characters that have more then five attacks in order for the pages to not be half actual data, and half attacks.

<p><small><b>Neutral for the moment</b>: Could you explain the arguement a bit more?

<dd><small>Let me see if I can, I was reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">this</a> and then had a look at the page. What does the one page attacks page consist of&#160;? Well when you break it down, it's a list of the different ways <i>one character can punch another in the face</i>. Using this logic, we should create a page for <b>DC universe offensive use of superpowers</b> - Superman has quite a few and using them in combination he can work up more than 5 "attacks". Once we have done this, we can move onto the same for the Marvel Universe etc. When you consider that minor <i>characters</i> should not have their own articles unless there is good reason.... attacks? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 20:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Except it's not different ways a character punches someone in the face. In case you haven't watched much anime, the characters tend to have "named attacks" that are different from their normal ones, which is different from the way American comics tend to do things. If Superman had, say, an attack called "Fury of Krypton" where he did a bunch of attacks using his powers, I could see your point. But he doesn't. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 04:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>But he does have named and defined superpowers which basically amounts to the same thing. Johnny Storm has about 6 or 7 offensive attacks that have defined names in the comics (Supernova, fireballs etc) - a quick check (and it is quick as I'm off to the station) suggests that we don't give those their own articles. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 04:53, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small><b>Neutral for the moment</b>: I am neither for or against deletion, though I have disagreed with the need for this page since its creatation I have come to understand why it was created in the first place. Some of these attacks are listed for support on the main characters pages. Sometimes we reference a move on the pages, its nice to have something up explaining how that move works. When they were on the pages, they took up a lot of space and made it look sloppy which displeased many editors of the said pages who had to work around them. They were given their own pages to solved this problem, allowing room for expansion on details (which hasn't happened too much it seems). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 19:42, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><small><b>Keep</b>: Sheesh, do we have to go through this again? Surely you've noticed how many attacks the characters, especially Luffy and Sanji, have?

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay seriously am getting sick of this, we've stated our case more then once to you people. We've told you more the once that this is not the only attack guide for an anime series (check Naruto, Bleach and DBZ for example) and it IS vital to the articule, this is not fancruft. We've been professional about it despite a few immature people puttng down useless information and even tried to compromise by giving it its own page and rules to follow but once again you people keep coming back trying to delete it. What is it that we have to do to prove this is nessercary, hmmm? Please tell me cause all am hearing is very useless claims. Oh and in case you haven't noticed this whole article, each and every page, is written from fans of the series, shall we delete this too?-<a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetro7_f882.html" title="User:Retro7">User:Retro7</a></li>

<li>This is fan material, in Games we have a consensus that strategy guide material gets moved to the game wiki. I think the same should hold true for anime episode and series guide material. This is simply not encyclopedic. An encyclopedia is for people to reference unknown information, a good article would tell them what they need to know about the series and where to find more info. The One Piece article and associated pages however, have become a dumping spot for fan research/listmaking and fan club activities. We need to find a better wiki for this info, drive it there and kick it out the door without stopping. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkfred_e4f9.html" title="User:Darkfred"><strong>Dark</strong>fred</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarkfred_d9f4.html" title="User talk:Darkfred"><sup><strong>Talk to me</strong></sup></a> 18:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can give examples of many cases where fans have expanded upon wikipedia articles in this such way. These pages tend to be the most informative pages on wikipedia despite being questionable as to whether they are true encyclopedic anymore. Fans care about the areas they are intereasted in, you can't change that... Its no different to the Star Trek, Doctor Who, Home and Away, Mortal Kombat pages and so forth. Sine they are fans, they pay more attention to the series and have a lot of info they wanted to put up, odd bits they've noticed... Things like that. All I can say is every Wikipedia One Piece page is a 'working in progress' so to speak and we're trying to improve them. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 16:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Commenting with a <i>DON</i></b>.</p>
<p>First: I must comment on something, you caught the One Piece section at a major crossroads, we are at the tail end of choosing, once and for all, what names should be dominent; the names used by Viz and 4kids, or the original names. We chose the original names for the most part, and now we are starting to actualy bring the articles up to speed. We are just <i>now</i> begining to rewrite stub articals, add references, and all the other things neccisary to bring these pages to Wikipedia's standards. We are working to get the character pages nice and tidy, this would be a massive setback.</p>
<p>And, there are very few frequent editors of the One Piece section, if any of <i>you</i> want to help you MORE then welcome to, we need the help, please, if you know a large amount about One Piece, <i>please</i> help bring these pages to par.</p>
<p>Second: There is no actual guidelines for fancruft, and being fancruft is not a reason for deletion in and of itself. This is not a "indiscriminate collection of information" and as Wikipedia defines that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b><br /></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not simply:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s).</dd>
<dd>Travel guides. An article on Paris should mention landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a café au lait on the Champs-Élysées. Such details are, however, very welcome at Wikitravel, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.</dd>
<dd>Memorials. Wikipedia is not the place to honor departed friends and relatives. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered.</dd>
<dd>Instruction manuals. While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at Wikihow or our sister project Wikibooks.</dd>
<dd>Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples.</dd>
<dd>Textbooks and annotated texts. These belong on our sister project, Wikibooks.</dd>
<dd>Plot summaries. Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles per Wikipedia:Article series."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This catagory fits into NONE of those, in other words: <b>not an indiscriminate collection of information</b>. Don't bring this up again, you would just be making an ass out of yourself.</p>
<p>And as I said: we are working on bringing all of the One Piece pages up to par, and I will bring up that this page should be our top priority. And another thing: The pages under <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu_%28Naruto%29_8413.html" title="Ninjutsu (Naruto)">Ninjutsu (Naruto)</a> are not currently up for deletion. Why is that? The Naruto Ninjutsu are just as much "fancruft" and "indiscriminate collection of information" as the ones for One Piece, and there are <i><b>SIX PAGES</b></i> of them, and only ONE for One Piece. And this is very important as well: the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f257.html" title="Kamehameha (Dragon Ball)">Kamehameha Attack</a> HAS IT'S OWN PAGE. If giving ONE ATTACK it's own page is not fancruft, then this is not fancruft either. <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a> is the same thing as this; for one character.</p>
<p>Now, it looks to me like I just nuked your grounds for deleting this page.</p>
<p>Now that I have stated as to why this is NOT fancruft, anyone who still thinks that this should be deleted, post a goddamned good reason that is "indiscriminate collection of information", or "Fancruft" or "Listcruft", or I will notify some Admins that this was dicided to be kept due to no ground for deletion.</p>
<p>I think that all of you that just said "indiscriminate collection of information", "Fancruft" or "Listcruft" should alter your post to give more exact reasons, or I don't think that your votes should be counted, or should just be removed.</p>
<p>You will notice that I used swearwords in my post, this was not to insult the people on the side of deleting; this was to enphisize my point; I said that I would be commenting with a <i>DON</i>.

<dd>Those categories aren't the only possible indiscriminate collections of information. Indiscriminate lists of things like every gun in every video game ever, or every song about love, or every female fictional character, have all shown strong support for deletion.

<dd>JIP: And if Superman alone deserves this honor, why does the entirety of One Piece not deserve it? One Piece is the fourth best selling Manga in the history of Shōnin Jump, the second current best selling, and is Japan's most popular series currently.
<dl>
<dd>First, I think Superman is known in more countries than One Piece.

<dd>Like I said already, we <i>are</i> bringing the articles up to par. And in the more then half a century that Superman has been around, they have found the time to put a lot of details into his powers.

If we're going to compare this to the superman article: this does not describe what each one is at all and it doesn't list every last thing superman's done. This list pretty much has every single thing they've called what they've done. If you wish to try to spout popularity, Superman's an iconic character embodying a superhero, and is over 60 years old, who started the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books_1c51.html" title="Golden Age of Comic Books">Golden Age of Comic Books</a>.

<p>Oh, and let me add another big one that noone has mentioned, verifiability. What verifies that this information belongs here? The series? That's self-referential in nature. Why would bringing up pages related to this series neccessitate this page? Why does a translation effort need this page? Do you not have any sources for the list to verify that all your translations are completely correct? This page has almost no use to an encyclopedia. If you have no verifiability, perhaps you should read <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html#What.27s_wrong_with_an_in-universe_perspective.3F" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">What's wrong with an in-universe perspective?</a>, as that is what this is.

<dd>I was simply trying to bring up something that was already mentioned; I just worded it wrong. What I ment was that if one character can have a page devoted to his abilities that have been tweeked, added, removed, increased, decreased, for sixty years; why must an entire series, who's pages are still being fixed up mind you, have facts split up over a large number of pages as opposed to having them all gathered for easy reference?</dd>

<dd>So what usefulness does it have in an encyclopedic aspect? "Wikipedia is an out-of-universe source, and all articles about fiction and elements of fiction should take an out-of-universe perspective." As I've said, this has no real usefulness unless you are a fan of the series. In fact, the average person doesn't care about every last translation into japanese, because most of the english speaking population doesn't know it. I'm also looking at the talk page, several of these 'attacks' have only been used <b>once</b>.

And this page serves the perpose of consolidation; why should this information take up space and make the character pages look bad, when the information can be in one place for easy reference, and as I have said, many times, the pages are not done. And if the Kamehameha attack is not fancruft, then why is this?.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think whether it's a work in progress or not is to the point. This is never going to be an appropriate article, because it's a list of material which is only of interest to fans (=non-encyclopedic) and which can only be sourced from direct observation of its subject (=no verification). This is a shame, since a lot of work has apparently gone into it. But an encyclopedia should provide an external overview, not an obsessive list of detail for insiders.

<dd>Sure, you already 'went over this', but you didn't address the concerns raised. Again: this is not a court of law. No-one needs to cite precedent or statute. What we need to do is give reasons for a judgement about whether this belongs in the encyclopedia or not. Of course <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> is an opinion essay - I said so above - but that doesn't mean it can be discounted as a reason. 'WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information' very obviously does not entail that any article with an inclusion policy is automatically encyclopedic: 'indiscriminate collection' refers to WP as a whole, not to particular articles. As I've already said, there are boundaries set by the task of writing an encyclopedia. Those boundaries are fuzzy, and identifying which side of them a particular article lies isn't automatic or easy. Insisting on reading guidelines as if they were statute law, and insisting on the letter rather than the spirit, doesn't help with that task. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 10:52, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Quoting from the intro paragraph to the list, "Characters are only listed here if they have five or more attacks [which] would take up too much space on their normal page. If a character with named attacks is not here, than the attacks may be found under their article." To me this says that this is a break-out article, designed to relieve pressure on the character and series articles by moving detailed information which is essential to an understanding of the topic out of the main article in order to avoid giving it undue weight. The nom said, "..if a character is important enough to have their own article, then surely the attack can be listed there.." and yet I see that most of the characters do have their own articles, and listing all of their attacks in those articles would be giving the attacks undue weight. Therefore this list is referenced by statements such as, "See Attack List for detailed descriptions of Luffy's attacks." Darkfred suggested "...at least rename to One Piece/Attacks so that it is obviously a sub-page," which I think is a good idea. I find a lot of statements to the effect that, this information "couldn't possibly be of interest to non-fans." Yet I disagree. When I am talking to someone, and they mention a tv show I don't know anything about, Wikipedia is usually one of the first places I go to find out what the heck they are talking about. There are situations where someone who's never heard of One Piece before would want or need to know what the Eight Flower Clutch is. I would think, however, that attacks that are "only used once in a single episode," should not be included on this list. However, the fact that a group of editors has recently gotten together to work on improving the quality of the One Piece articles is a good sign. If we give them time to work, before too long this list won't include the one-off attacks. Look at the changes that have been wrought in this article just since it was nominated for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_Piece_attacks&amp;diff=79822012&amp;oldid=76206089" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_Piece_attacks&amp;diff=79822012&amp;oldid=76206089" rel="nofollow">(diff showing differences between version that was nominated, and current version as of my comment)</a>! The only real problem I can see with this list is the fact that there are absolutely no sources listed at all, and I'm not sure there ever will be (except the show itself). Other than that, however, I see no grounds for deletion of this article. (P.S. Today is the first time I'd ever heard of One Piece) ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks&#160;:D! And the reason for keeping the once used attacks is simple; someone might want to look them up too. (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 00:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>It looks like this piece of fancruft is going to be deleted! Great, I was hoping for that! Unfortunately, Wikipedia is still infested by other attack lists. Once this ordeal is over, let's move onto the others. I'm not sure if I can delete articles (I just created this account), so can others do it for me? The articles I've found are <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu_%28Naruto%29_8413.html" title="Ninjutsu (Naruto)">Ninjutsu (Naruto)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_genjutsu_in_Naruto_d81e.html" title="List of genjutsu in Naruto">List of genjutsu in Naruto</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_taijutsu_in_Naruto_c5b4.html" title="List of taijutsu in Naruto">List of taijutsu in Naruto</a>, <a href="../../../f/%C5%AB/i/F%C5%ABin_jutsu.html" title="Fūin jutsu">Fūin jutsu</a> (NOTE: Sheesh, Naruto alone has eight pages just for attacks o_0), <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon_arts.html" title="Demon arts">Demon arts</a>. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydromasta231_6acc.html" title="User:Hydromasta231">Hydromasta231</a> 23:34, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fancruft is not a reason for deletion, and I have proven that this is not fancruft anyway, so I want an apolgy for calling the page that. There is also no CONCENSUS for the deletion, meaning that it cannot be deleted. And I will now strike all of the people who said "delete" because they thought that it was fancruft and never gave a good reason. When they post a goddamn good reason for deletion that I already did not nuke (with a <i>DON</i>!) they can un-strike the post. Oh yeah, I broke the page up to make it easyer to read.(<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 00:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC))

<dd>Yes, I would agree, or at least almost agree, with you on the counts of all of those articles you mentioned. This is somewhat like having a list of all possible effects <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talisman_%28board_game%29.html" title="Talisman (board game)">Talisman</a> cards can have, or having a list of all ways you can move or command a unit in <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Civilization (computer game)">Civilization</a>.

<li><b>Suggestion</b>: It won't matter to anyone when this fancruft is deleted from WP (as I have warmly recommended above): its authors can quickly turn it into one or more articles (maybe dozens of articles!) suitable either for one of <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Wikia" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Wikia" rel="nofollow">a large pile of existing Wikia wikis</a> or for <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/Start_a_new_Wikia" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/Start_a_new_Wikia" rel="nofollow">a new Wikia wiki</a> for fans of this particular kind of thing. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:34, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do you people not listen when I proove that this not Fancruft, not to mention the fact that: <i><b>FANCRUFT IS NOT A REASON FOR DELETION!</b></i> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 05:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>I can't speak for people other than myself, but I'd regard a "proof" that this list is not <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> rather like a "proof" that apples don't come from trees. Also, I'm deterred from looking for the "proof" by the bulk and repetitiveness of what's above. Since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP is not an indiscriminate collection of plot summaries</a>, it's hard to believe that it's an indiscriminate collection of story elements. Meanwhile, what's wrong with Wikia as your repository for this kind of thing? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:36, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>First: It's repetitive because the delete-supporters kept saying the same thing, I had to post the same evidence over and over again.</p>
<p>Second: How often do you go to Wikia? The only Wikia reguarding One Piece is completely dub oriented, is years behind, is pretty dead, and the last time I checked, it was closed.</p>
<p>Third: There is nothing indiscriminate about this, and as ONUnicorn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I am talking to someone, and they mention a tv show I don't know anything about, Wikipedia is usually one of the first places I go to find out what the heck they are talking about."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you don't find something on Wikipedia, is the first thought that goes through your head "I'll check Wikia"? Plus, you said yourself: "it's hard to believe that it's an indiscriminate collection of story elements"</p>
<p>Fourth: FANCRUFT IS NOT A REASON FOR DELETION! How many times does this need to be said in order for people to get it through their heads? (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 06:46, 8 October 2006 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>If people repeat the same foolish (in your opinion) objection, write a single refutation of that objection, improve it, and link to or point to it clearly. No, I don't go to Wikia; and this is simply because my interests are pretty much catered for by WP and one other wiki (Camerapedia). The people who contribute to and read the latter don't delude themselves that their interests are shared by many in the world at large <i>or even touch upon widely held interests,</i> and I think most would be quite happy if their articles were described as camerafancruft. WP articles on more general aspects of some manga, game, kind of camera or whatever can easily be, and commonly are, supplemented with external links. These external links can point to other wikis. Lastly, the idea that fancruft is not a reason for deletion only has to be said a single time, persuasively, and without typographic SHOUTING in order to get into people's heads. It has already got into my head. I know full well that there is no fixed policy that fancruft isn't a reason for deletion (if it were, thousands of articles would go); I also know about guidelines, and I know that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> -- but I shan't repeat myself. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:07, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Okay, the reason that I SHOUTED, was that people kept saying "Delete it, it's fancruft" so many times, I snapped. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> says: "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">Wikipedia:Article series</a>." This aritical can be called in some way, a plot summary. More accurately, a combined summery of a series of small parts of the plot, but a plot summery none the less.
