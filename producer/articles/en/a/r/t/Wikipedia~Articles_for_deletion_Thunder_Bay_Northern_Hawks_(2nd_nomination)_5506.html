<p>Junior sports teams are rarely notable and do not meet any of the notability criteria for inclusion on WP. There is no reason why this page is any different - only notable teams should be included - so I would like to see the removal of ALL Junior/Juvenile and Children's teams that do not have genuine notability. How can any team in a Junior B/Juvenile/AAA Hockey League be notable? These teams do not compete in significant tournaments (though I'm sure their Moms and Dads and very proud) and are not professional. WP is not intended to be used as a catalogue of things that exist but an encyclopedia of things which are notable. This, and all the other Junior teams, are not notable and should be removed on mass. At best they could be mentioned on the article about the league - if the league is genuinely notable enough to warrant its own page - most will not. Robertsteadman 14:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For information - the first nomination was closed early due to too many comments, spamming by someone trying to protect the page and personal abuse being meted out at those wanting the page deleted. Robertsteadman 14:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

That said, though he did spam, he didn't say "come and vote keep." Verbatim, from my Talk page: "Hello, a user has decided that he does not want us placing hockey stubs on Wikipedia to expand later into teams. In particular he doesn't like Junior teams... I was wondering if you could please voice your opinion." What's more, this professional hockey team is no less notable than many of the high schools we have on Wikipedia, and every one of those are kept. This has been copied and pasted from the previous AfD. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> 14:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - that was our original decision, but we had an admin a couple months ago tell us to create individual articles for each of the teams because we couldn't use team logos and such in league pages. DMighton has put several hundred hours of work into carrying this out. I personally wouldn't have a HUGE problem with keeping it at league level only, but the only reason <a href="../../../h/o/c/WP%7EHOCKEY_7a0a.html" title="WP:HOCKEY">WP:HOCKEY</a> has created all these articles was due to a specific request from an admin so as not to violate <a href="../../../f/u/p/WP%7EFUP_daa7.html" title="WP:FUP">WP:FUP</a>. Several hundred hours of work later, those same articles are up for deletion. It's not fair to DMighton's work to delete it all, especially considering that the creation of all the team articles was essentially imposed upon the project from above (and, as I mentioned, I still believe the article is notable and should be kept). <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 20:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Akin to the Rookie leagues - <i>each and every team</i> of which has an article - and the numerous amateur leagues in baseball (the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_League_f96c.html" title="Cape Cod League">Cape Cod League</a> is averages a few hundred spectators at best during its games, and even some teams there have articles), the Junior B leagues are all feeders into Junior A and college programs. The mere fact that nom has, in both this debate and the previous one, equated these league with kiddie squads demonstrates that he has little idea what these leagues are about and who plays in them, and therefore can have little enough grasp on their notability. As far as nom's bad faith goes, his threat to nominate <b>all</b> junior league teams (the highest level of amateur competition in Canada) for AfD provides telling evidence. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 21:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: There is clear intent to flesh this out into a more complete article.

<li>Second: <b>Comment</b> - Robertsteadman: Please stop commenting on every vote. You have made your position abundantly clear, and there is nothing to be gained by arguing with every person who disagrees with you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sports bore me to death. I've only watched 2 sports contests in my entire 45 years although I've unwillingly attended dozens. I have no interest in any sport league, minor major junior senior whatever. Nonetheless, Wikipedia isn't written to please me. It's an encyclopedia that aims to have a great breadth and depth of knowledge from all over the world. If there's room for <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollie%2C_Iowa_f0e9.html" title="Ollie, Iowa">Ollie, Iowa</a>, a town of 240 people, I think there's room for this article and also for the other teams in all the junior leagues in Canada. For those who insist that this team has no notability, perhaps you were thinking of me, and thank you kindly because, yes, for me, it is absolutely non-notable. But as others on here have pointed out, the team has real notability for, at the very least, the 100,000 people in Thunder Bay. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

They are below Junior A and are, in fact, well below Rookie Ice Hockey.... If some evidence of genuine notability can be provided I will support a KEEP vote - but none has been offered.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As several editors now have commented, junior leagues are (1) <i>not</i> "juvenile," (2) the highest level of amateur hockey competition in Canada, (3) at the <i>least</i> comparable to American college hockey, since around five times as many NHL players are alumni of junior league teams than are alumni of college squads, and (4) at roughly the same age range as college players, which are explicitly notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Leaving aside that there is no such thing as "Rookie Ice Hockey", none of this is anything other editors have failed to tell you. If you don't <i>agree</i> that junior leagues should be notable, I refer you to my previous advice to work on changing consensus on notability criteria, but either you are interested in learning about how hockey is structured or you are not. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 01:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Juvenile is 18-20 year olds... and Midget is 16-18 year olds. You've failed to mention that the league is a Junior "B" league with a multi-tiered regular season and only the games played by the 4 Junior teams mean anything. Also, you've failed to mention that the midget and juvy teams are only mentioned in passing in an article that is not in question here. But, just for the sake of remaining civil...

<li><b>Comment</b> It is apparent you didn't read into it or didn't research it on any of the google hits you found last time you AfD'd this article. It is not a problem, I will explain. This JUNIOR league is multi-tiered during the regular season. As I can see, you seem to like euro football, so you might be able to understand this system. 3 different levels of hockey compete in interleague action... Junior "B", Juvenile, and Midget AAA... at the end of a roughly 40 game season... the 4 Junior "B" teams are the only ones allowed to compete in the playoffs... the playoff champion competes out west for the Keystone Cup. The Minor level teams compete in their perspective All-Ontario playdowns and no longer have anything to do with the TBJBHL... their results in the league do not enhance or disrupt their seeding in the Ontario minor playoff systems and are only used as "filler" for the Junior teams and as a way to warm up for the playoffs for the Minor teams. The Juvenile and Midget teams have not been included in the TBJBHL article other than in passing and have little to do with the Northern Hawks and therefore have nothing to do with this AfD. Hopefully this helps you. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 00:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC) -- Also, Junior A, B, and C classifications are only partially based off of skill level... in fact, they are based mostly off size of the centre they play out of and what league is closest to their town. As well, Junior B teams could be competative in Junior A or Junior C, as Junior C could be competative in Junior B and even a few could survive in Junior A... examples of successful league switching is all over the hockey world... the Barrie Colts, Markham Waxers, Orangeville Crushers, and Listowel Cyclones just to name few involved in an uncountable amount of league moves. Even the Bradford Rattlers just jumped directly from Junior C to Junior A. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 04:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As virtually everyone else has observed, notability is in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I do not feel that an article about a famous person's <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moortje.html" title="Moortje">cat</a>, or some <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Mirror_0349.html" title="Sky Mirror">piece of art</a> commissioned by a theatre in Nottingham are notable either. However, I accept that there are others who may believe differently, no matter how small a percentage of users may ever find such articles useful. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:01, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Notability is NOT in the eye of the beholder - that is a nonsense. The examples you gace are very poor - the cat is refered to in probbaly the most famous book of the 20th century, it is, quite probably, the most famous cat of the 20th century (certainly top 5). The artwork was commissioned from one of the UK's leading contemporary artists - not a 16-20 year kid learning the ropes. Notability is notability - kiddie sport is kiddie sport.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, kiddie sport is kiddie sport -- and this, given that it involves mostly people over the age of 18, is in no way kiddie sport. I don't want to become yet another person to comment that you obviously did no research before nominating this, so I won't. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 13:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The cat is only famous because of its owner. Anne Frank is notable, her cat is not, as it never did anything other than simply exist as Anne Frank's pet. By this argument, is the pet of any famous person notable? Maybe I will litter Wikipedia with articles about atheletes pets. Similaraly, the Sky Mirror itself is not notable. The artist may be, but at best, this piece of art belongs in that artist's article. What historical significance does it have? As I said, notability is in the eye of the beholder. I can accept that what you believe is notable is. All everyone here is asking is that you respect our beliefs. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 03:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I should have said this sooner, but I've been so wrapped up in other stuff... mostly logging statistics and earning a paycheck... In the hockey community, especially in Canada where there is no official allowance of sports scholarships and in the US where Canadian athletes almost never get half-scholarships due to their Canadian citizenship... Junior hockey, even at its lowest levels, is considered to be either compatible or higher calibre and higher in importance than College/University hockey (I'm not saying that Uni Hockey is unimportant -- but let's face it, a kid doesn't grow saying he wants to play U of G over his local Junior C club -- at least not where I'm from). This "Kiddie team" stuff has just got me thinking... Junior hockey teams are not and have never been considered lower in the pecking order than scholastic hockey... and this is a widely regarded belief in the hockey community. Junior hockey is to hockey as College sports is to Basketball or American Football. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 01:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This level of team is notable. For example, the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarnia_Bees_4130.html" title="Sarnia Bees">Sarnia Bees</a> have 10 NHL alumni players.<a href="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Sarnia+Bees" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Sarnia+Bees" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_Lumber_Kings_1d4e.html" title="Pembroke Lumber Kings">Pembroke Lumber Kings</a> have 40 NHL alumni. <a href="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Pembroke+Lumber+Kings#P" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Pembroke+Lumber+Kings#P" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stayner_Siskins_734e.html" title="Stayner Siskins">Stayner Siskins</a> have only 1 NHL alumni <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stayner_Siskins" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stayner_Siskins" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and yet the team has a major influence on the town. Even without being a feeder system for the NHL, this level of hockey is notable, as many of these teams draw large crowds, are major influences in their communities, and are large business enterprises. I don't understand why <a href="../../../g/o/_/GO_Finch_Bus_Terminal_2fb2.html" title="GO Finch Bus Terminal">this Go-Bus station</a> is notable, but for transportation/train fans, these type of Go stations are important. Many of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ice_Hockey_66a9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey</a> members have stated that they believe these Jr C, B, and A teams are notable hockey enthusiasts. Anyone wanting to work in the hockey industry in Ontario would be very interested in learning about these teams. Fans hoping to spot the next <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Gretzky</a> seek out these teams. (Gretzky was playing Jr.B hockey less than 2 years before he played in the NHL). Heck, look at all the fuss made over the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStaal_family_6db7.html" title="Category:Staal family">Stall family</a> and it's easy to see why fans would be interested in where players come from before the NHL.</li>
<li>As for the 'spam' issue of leaving messages on talk pages of members in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ice_Hockey_66a9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey</a>, I believe <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> applies. I did exactly the same thing with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Talk%7EWorld_Junior_Ice_Hockey_Championships_c90c.html" title="Talk:World Junior Ice Hockey Championships">Talk:World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> when I put on merge tags and proposed a rename. The idea was to get input from the people with knowledge and interest in the subject. I'm sure that DMighton just did the same. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColtsScore_c82e.html" title="User:ColtsScore">ColtsScore</a> 21:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The current guidline for living athletes is as follows:<br />
"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States." These are paid athletes, and they play at a level equivalent to U.S. college teams. It makes sense then, that their teams would be notable too.<br />
That's the current policy.<br />
There is discussion about changing the athletes' notability policy to make it more restrictive, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28athletes%29_79c6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (athletes)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (athletes)</a>, if anyone is interested in commenting. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColtsScore_c82e.html" title="User:ColtsScore">ColtsScore</a> 22:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, that is not a current policy. That is a current proposal. If accepted, I suspect it would only be a guideline, not a policy. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 00:10, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
