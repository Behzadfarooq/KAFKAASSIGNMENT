<li><b>Comment</b> I don't have easy access to the magazines mentioned in the article, but they're a pretty fair collection of magazines devoted to the hobby and apparently they published whole articles on this event, not just passing mentions. If this was just another audio swap meet, I'd say, sure, ditch it, but they're flying speakers in from the USA and the attendees aren't just locals.

<li><b>Comment - Note to closing administrator:</b> There has been criticism of those who have supported retention of this article who have made reference to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>, an effort to create clear objective standards for which school articles should be retained, and which should be deleted. While the guideline did not achieve consensus, it is light years ahead of any other guideline, and stands in stark contrast to the utter lack of any meaningful Wikipedia guideline used by school deletion voters, who have resorted elsewhere to rather insightful "arguments" for deletion, such as "Secondary school, ergo not notable" or "Delete all schools below the university level" or "a random public high school", with the helpful suggestion that redirecting from the schools "to really offensive sex acts" would be an acceptable alternative. It's time that we stopped the staggering waste of time playing AfD Roulette, in which nearly every single high school article (with minimal exceptions) with any meaningful content is retained, demonstrating a clear consensus and explicit precedent for retaining such articles. I recognize that there are those who prefer some arbitrarily high standard for retaining such articles, but unfortunately we have no consensus on these self-imposed made-up standards, let alone anything that approaches the comprehensive, good faith effort to do so at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. If <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is unsatisfactory, let's see an alternative standard that will achieve consensus in the community, or even the faintest evidence of an attempt at achieving such a consensus guideline. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even following the rejection of the policy cited in my original rationale (regardless of its misrepresentation later on in the discussion), I still incline towards a <b>weak keep</b>, due to its status as a selective (and therefore harder-to-get-into) school and the fact that at least one former student went on to bigger and better things.

<li>Right, first of all <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is a <i>proposed</i> guideline.

<li>It doesn't quite say that. What is says is that a school may warrant a separate article if it verifiably meets one of a series of criteria. It would be worthy of "comprehensive coverage" if it's a post-secondary school or part of a series on a particular school district (I assume "comprehensive coverage" means "an article the size of those we have on the major universities of the world"). Given that it verifiably meets the criterion of having a notable alumna (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_Pittman_8f57.html" title="Jana Pittman">Jana Pittman</a>), that may explain some of the keep votes.

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's a common argument, which I'm very reluctant to accept. I think that we should separate the waters: if there are notable alumni from this school, then we should have articles about them and their notable achievements, not their schools. I can't also regard the fact of this school being selective as notability. There's thousands of selective schools and that is really no big deal. Besides, if we were to keep only elitist schools then it would pretty much turn Wikipedia into a vehicle for advertising those institutions, while at the same time discriminating other not-so-selective schools. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 18:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There seems to be some misunderstanding about whether a school's own website is a reliable source of information. In fact, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote it, and where the material is:</p>
<ul>
<li>relevant to the self-publisher's notability;</li>
<li>not contentious;</li>
<li>not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing;</li>
<li>about the subject only and not about third parties or events not directly related to the subject;</li>
</ul>
The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all.</blockquote>
<p>On that basis, a school's website can be a useful source of information. Sometimes school administrators lie or try to cover things up, but in general the enrolment figures or the history of the school are likely to be described accurately if incompletely on the site. (By "incompletely", I mean that a school's own history may ignore or gloss over past misconduct by students, teachers or administrators that may be relevant.) --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 06:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was going to give up on voting down non-notable high schools, but WP:SCHOOLS has been rejected and it seemed to be the only thing making these articles the least bit legitimate. There are thousands of high schools in the US alone and when you take in all secondary schools across the globe (can't even imagine how many there are in India or China, for example) do we really need to have articles for all of them? This is not a directory, we don't have articles for every hospital, every business, every police station, etc. nor do we need them for all high schools. High schools are are relatively the same and Wikipedia is not the proper source to look up there differences.

<ul>
<li>Guinea and Equatorial Guinea, I'd delete them both. And why not toss in Guyana for that matter. What on earth does a story about someone trying to delete countries have to do with high schools? Besides wouldn't the more relevant precedent -- the fact that about 99% of all high school articles with any meaningful content survive AfDs -- justify retention of this and all such articles, based on precedent? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the deleted countries have generally been microstates with only one or two inhabitants - the point remains that if even countries don't get inherent notability it is hard to see how schools (which generally lie within countries) should. Furthermore, surviving AfD is very different than being kept. The AfDs frequently close with no consensus and are even occasionally deleted. This is despite the fact that the keeps sometimes result from borderline votestacking. Furthermore, precedent is by itself a very weak argument for keeping something - there is nothing wrong with revisiting it when necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if I understand correctly, precedent is that any microschools with one or two students should be deleted, but larger schools should be retained. And if precedent is "a very weak argument" for retention, why would you just use it to justify deletion? I agree that issues should be revisited, but we seem to be revisiting these issues two or three times each day, and the precedent that we're setting is that high school articles with a bare minimum of content are kept as a matter of course. If you look through most AfDs, the overwhelming majority of articles are deleted, often based on the votes of a relatively small number of individuals who spend much of their day participating in such AfDs, deciding if articles meet their own personal preferences. And while your general opposition to most such articles may lead you to see votestacking, what I see is that the fact that schools generate so much strong interest, with substantial numbers of people taking the time to vote for their retention, is evidence of broad support for schools. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point was that if precedent matters then one has the issue that not even countries are inherently notable. Once we have gotten to the point that entities are not inherently notable, Librarians above claim fails and therefore would require at minimum more justification. As for the votestacking issue, even at least one user in favor of keeping schools in general User:Forbidden Word, thinks that it is votestacking as well (only he seems to see that as a good thing). That schools are continually being AfDed would indicate at minimum that that there is a substantial minority which disagrees with the process. Indeed, when non-school editors comment on a school AfD they are more likely to go with deletion than retention, indicating that the prevailing consensus among Wikipedians is not to keep all these schools. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good grief, your last sentence is one hell of a leap of logic! Incidentally, I'm not entirely sure how you're defining votestacking here. Is that anyone who registers a vote you don't agree with? Because I see the same names voting for deletion on pretty much every school AfD as well as the same names voting for retention. Therefore if anyone is votestacking, the deleters are doing it every bit as much as the keepers, except they're demonstrably not getting so much support. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:30, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page history reveals that this began as an autobiography to promote the subject in his election bid. While the page has since been cleaned up, the subject is a non-notable candidate; standing in a seat he has no chance of winning. While I am happy to have pages for candidates with a reasonable chance of winning, Anderton needs a swing of around 25%. It is true that he briefly came to attention with his racist remarks, it did not blow up into a scandal, and he has since faded back into obscurity. <a href="../../../t/e/i/User%7ETeiresias84_aea7.html" title="User:Teiresias84">Teiresias84</a> 01:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The racist remarks had the potential to cause a controversy, but they simply didn't - they were only mentioned in two newspaper articles at the time, and it was very quickly forgotten.

<li>Excuse me, but if this site is allowed to post episode guides &amp; results for other television shows (such as Celebrity Deathmatch, for example), then I fail to see why this really needs to be deleted. Now I'll admit that some of the verdicts couldn't be worded 100% like the one's on the show, &amp; that the spirit of the show could make it seem as though some of it is vandalism, but having seen every episode myself (&amp; editing it weekly with the latest verdicts), I can assure you that I always make sure to post the verdicts as accurately as possible. Still, if any one here actually has links to the episodes as well, that'd definitely help. But I, for one, being a big fan of the show, enjoy this article &amp; would like to keep it up.

<li><b>Comment</b>, SlyDante makes a very good point, however I am concerned about the lack of context and verifiability. No vote either way at this point. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 04:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you very much, <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a>. And I am actually worried about the context &amp; verifiability as well, because as far as I know, no episodes have been released on DVD yet, &amp; very few have been posted on the Internet. If it would help, I could try e-mailing MuchMusic for help in filling in the missing verdicts &amp; verifying/fixing the others. But aside from all of that, all the info here pretty much comes from the memories of fans like me, &amp; once again I assure you all that I try to make sure that it is all as accurate as possible. Also, I do <i>not</i> believe this is "listcruft", as much like an episode guide, this helps to inform the reader as to what videos have been featured on the show.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is neither a real estate spam or conflict of interest. It is only a record for the historical page regarding the Wespoint collapse and the herigage buildings' history of the apartment. Of course, the apartment itself is the evident that the remaing investors survied are enjoying their life style with the facilities and environment of the apartment. The combined unique features of the apartment cannot be found in all other apartments in Port Melbourne. 30-Oct-06 220.238.76.132 06:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments against deletion</b> The primary purpose and goal of Wikipedia is to provide free education and knowledge exchange. The article of Bayview Apartment may sound like a real estate spam if the people read the article at the surface. Actually, the Bayview Apartment is a window opening to a broader explorer to the heritage buildings, which indicates the historical economy, culture, community in Port Melbourne. More information will be added regarding the heritage buildings if this article could be kept for future viewers. In the past decade, Port Melbourne has been dramatically and rapidly transformed from a working class slum to a very attractive and livable suburb closing to the Melbourne city. That’s why these words such as “due to its location, convenient shopping and dinning environment, and enjoyment of the leisure” were inserted into the article. Bayview Apartment contributed a remarkable and significant influence to the transformation of Port Melbourne, especially to the Bay Street, which is virtually a heritage street. The retail shops of the Bayview Apartment make the Bay Street more variable and vibrate the Port Melbourne community. Then the article mentioned the collapsed developer Westpoint, who built the Bayview Apartment, inevitably Bayview Apartment become a historical mirror of the collapsed Wespoint. Westpoint went to under became one of the biggest news in the financial market in Australia history. Westpoint originally organized two schemes to investors through either buying the unit of the apartment or the promising notes through the financial planners and its sales network. The investors who bought the promising notes ended with the tragedy of their life saving lost. Those who bought the unit eventually are survived because today they still own the property and keep the market value and may enjoy a moderate capital gain in the current property market situation. The article paid attention to the investors survived. Does it sound like an investment scheme promotion seminar? The purpose of this article does not promote any sort of the investment but gives to a future viewer a recognition that “bricks and mortar” make more common sense than “promising notes and mezzanine companies” if a future viewer may not be a sophisticated or astute investor. Therefore, the article itself is very educational to the future viewers, which exactly is in compliance with Wikipedia’s policies and objectives. Obviously, the notability of the Bayview Apartment speaks itself. After 10-20 years, people may forget the lesson of collapsed Westpoint (one of the most notable financial collapsing in the Australia history). However, if people walk pass the Bayview Apartment building and read this article in the Wikipedia, free encyclopedia; Bayview Apartment has full of the historical stories in a very broad aspect. 31/10/06 220.238.76.132 13:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is no doubt that Bayview Apartment is a window to those notable events. If the window was shutted, the viewers might not be able to see the insight/outsight. People may not be so enthusiastic and interested in finding the history for the sake of the history. But if people see the heritage buildings of the apartment, that may trigger their curiosity to type the words “bayview apartment” in the search box of Wikipedia. Then all the stories will be revealed and Wikipedia reached its objective.(Note: the Bayview Apartment is a huge complex which occupied a whole block of the land by multiple buildings. Two heritage buildings are a visible attraction) 01/11/06 220.238.76.132 13:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b> but some data points: I checked the status of "ale" in <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a>. It exists there, but in an old version that has not been updated in 2 years. No popular outrcy at this has materialized, save for a single polite nudge from a single user <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=ale;dist=unstable" class="external autonumber" title="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=ale;dist=unstable" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The Debian "popularity contest" statistics, based on about 18,000 users who vonlunteer automatic information about their installed packages, estimates that the "ale" package is used regularly on 30 of the 18,000 systems. There are about 5,700 packages in Debian that have higher estimates. Among packages with with similar scores we find <a href="../../../n/n/_/Nn_%28newsreader%29.html" title="Nn (newsreader)">nn</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashem.html" title="Slashem">slashem</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sendmail.html" title="Sendmail">sendmail</a>. (For comparison, a small program which I hacked together 9 months ago to scratch a personal itch and never advertized widely, certainly not notable, ranks at 8,400 with an estimated 12 regular users). The Imagemagick packages in Debian show no traces of including "ale" as a compiled-in part. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 00:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> ah well, in light of that, I've changed my vote (again) to neutral. It has been around for a long time, but I haven't used it in years, and it sounds like nobody much else is using it any more either. It might be worthy of an article for its historical interest, but I can't offer any references or sources, which is really what would be needed to justify saving it. I know I read an article about it once, but that was long ago, and I can't say where. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 09:07, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Well, many ALE users (including myself) compile it from source to get CPU-specific optimizations, so popcon isn't particularly useful. popcon is especially useless since the package is that far out of date. ALE is still useful, and I know a few people who use it regularly (including myself) -- it just seems that nobody writes about it when they do. 21:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To finish the job: Pure speculation. References cited include IMDB, which happily tells you that *they* aren't sure about it either (yes, IMDB is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> this far away from the target date), and an interview with Spielberg in which the project is mentioned <b>in passing</b> towards the end. Film is supposedly due in 2009, not that this is confirmed anywhere useful. We can be almost certain that the US will have a new president by then, and almost certain that the memory of the Olympics in Beijing will be fading from our minds.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I uncovered a citation mentioning <i>Interstellar</i> (see <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external text" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">article</a>) from October 25, 2006 that's independent of IMDb and the SpielbergFilms.com interview, the Wikipedia article's two initial citations. This may reflect that the film is not <i>too</i> speculative in nature. Otherwise, however, there do not seem to be any other follow-up sources that are independent of those already included in the article. I find it a tough call to determine the validity of this article, since Spielberg is a very noted director. Is it reasonable to take into consideration whether a director has consistently followed through with announced projects in his/her Hollywood history? --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 07:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, because we're still too far off completion for their record to be relevant. If Spielberg made a <i>passing</i> reference to some project he has conceived for 2012, 2015, or even 2020, would not be grounds to start an <i>encyclopaedia article</i> based on it. The Variety "article" (more of a sidebar to me) is about someone being promoted, and again makes only passing reference to it. All we seem to know at this point is that the project exists, and our baseline is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability, not truth</a>. IMDB isn't reliable this far away, and SpielbergFilms.com is nothing more than a fansite. Variety may indeed be a reliable source, but to suggest that this project <b>needs</b> an article <b>right now</b> purely on the basis of a throwaway comment at the end of a sidebar piece is pushing the policy just a little too far. 81.104.170.167 08:05, 29 October 2006 (UTC

<dd>PS - this isn't final. Having the article deleted now does not mean that it can never come back - when there's enough information available to actually write an article about it, then one can be written.

The site takes itself seriously, and the interview with Spielberg is a primary source. Furthermore, you've tried to downplay the interview by saying that Spielberg mentioned <i>Interstellar</i> in passing, when he actually gave reasonable detail about it for a film in development -- who is the brain, who is directing, who is producing, who is scripting, and how he doesn't want to compare it to <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29_dbd6.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001</a></i>. This isn't a project that's faded into obscurity -- the <i>Variety</i> article I cited in my initial comment above shows that it's still live, despite the "sidebar" nature. In addition, since lack of references was one of your arguments, I found this <i>Variety</i> <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945326.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external text" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945326.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">article</a> from June 2006 that announces the yet-unnamed project (obviously <i>Interstellar</i>).

Furthermore, this film can be considered of "<b>sufficiently wide interest</b>" to merit an article being that Spielberg is one of Hollywood's most notable directors. The same couldn't be said of a film under a first-time director. Also, reviewing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html#Unreleased_films" title="WP:NOTFILM">notability on unreleased films</a>, <i>Interstellar</i> is certainly not just "expected to be made", as the October 2006 <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external text" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">citation</a> reflects that it is a <b>live project</b> at a production company.

<p>The article purports to be dedicated to a list of top actresses published by an Indian film magazine since 2003. However, the article doesn't give any of the lists, but consists of a lead para arguing that Rani Mukerji is the top actress in Bollywood, followed by slighting mentions of other actresses. As it stands, the article is biased, and an attack on the other actresses and should be deleted for that reason. (The creator of the article has been linking this article to other actress pages, as a subtle attack on their standing vis-a-vis Rani.) However, even if the article were what the title would lead one to expect, a list of the ten winners for each year, it would still be trivial and non-notable. Newspapers and magazines publish lists of favorites all the time, none of which rate WP articles. Nobel Prize winners yes, Filmfare magazine, no. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:25, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Firstly, Filmfare's List of Top Ten Actresses is not notable enough (unlike <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmfare_Awards_065a.html" title="Filmfare Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>). Secondly, If the article includes the complete list, it will be a copyvio. From the <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_Publications_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_8511.html" title="Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service">Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service</a> case: "<i>In regard to collections of facts, O'Connor states that copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange them it would destroy the copyright owned in the data.</i>". The names or the list of the actresses are not copyright by Filmfare, but the creative choices Filmfare made in producing a ranking are copyrightable by them. The ranking is a <i>creative invention</i> of theirs—they did not simply publish the names of schools as in a directory. If the entire list is published, it won't be re-arranged and the title already indicates that the list belongs to Filmfare. It is not legal to take their list—published in their commercial magazine and website—and simply publish it on Wikipedia under GFDL. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 08:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Note that this article does <i>not</i> actually do that. Read it. You won't find a list of ten people in it. The problem with the article is not that it violates copyright, but that it appears to be an original analysis of why various actresses have held the positions on the list that they have, over the years. This article would be acceptable if such an analysis could be sourced, but from reading it, and seeing the personal bias of the author that is obvious from the content of the article, I strongly suspect that this analysis is a new analysis, being constructed firsthand by a Wikipedia editor directly in Wikipedia in contravention of our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Filmfare is widely considered the "standard" for film-news/interviews/views in India. Of course, I am not talking about regional cinema. I have edited the article to reflect <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> cinema. Another point I want to make is, remove all the 'original research' but keep the list. Unless it is copy-vio... though I don't see why it is. Finally Zora: If <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankable_star.html" title="Bankable star">Bankable star</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexiest_Man_Alive_1e53.html" title="Sexiest Man Alive">Sexiest Man Alive</a> are notable, despite the fact that they are "regional" to USA, and do not consider Indian/Chinese/Bhojpuri superstars, why not Femina's list? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaghabhat_eff9.html" title="User:Anaghabhat">Anagha</a> 15:04, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are over a million articles in WP and some of them are junk that should not be imitated. Bankable star and Sexiest man alive should be eliminated too, as non-notable ephemera. As for Filmfare being "the standard" -- that's your personal opinion. The only metrics that can be defended are objective -- circulation figures, in the case of print media, and Alexa rankings, in the case of websites. How does Filmfare stand by those measures, and how does it stand vis-a-vis its rivals?</li>
<li>Any real information in the article, as opposed to Rani-glorification, could easily be folded into the article on <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmfare.html" title="Filmfare">Filmfare</a> magazine. Title should probably be changed, to Filmfare (magazine) to make it clear that it's a magazine. Right now the article is stubby. Just add a section about the magazine's lists of the bests, and link to the magazine's website if that gives the lists. Hmmmm ... do we have articles on the top Indian film magazines and websites? With circulation and Alexa figures? That might actually be useful. Then all the various polls and such would have proper homes. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's frustrating to state the obvious Zora.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Well, in a future update that I'm planning out, I'm going to talk about how Palatov believes AWD is necessary for superkarts with as much power as he's planning on having in the selling version of the kart. He's personally stated that people putting 200-500hp in 4 wheeled automobiles of this size are not addressing a major concern of his, putting the power to the ground. would this assert his importance, given that he is trying something new for the purpose of bettering superkarts?

<li><b>Comment:</b> that's a good start, but just so you know, generally blogs aren't consider reliable sources(see link above).

</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> i emailed him asking if he's been featured in any magazines. he replied saying that he's been featured in MAKE magazine, issue 4, and also the Croatian EVO magazine. neither of these have articles (that i can find) have anything online. also i don't know Croatian. he's been featured in jalopnik here: <a href="http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/dp1/" class="external free" title="http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/dp1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/dp1/</a> (yes, another car blog), and car&amp;driver plans on a future article. also, i may have been incorrect in calling it a 'superkart'. Dennis did call it that on his site a few years ago, but looking at the wikipedia article for superkarts, it doesn't fit that at all. Dennis suggested "Miniature Le Mans Racer" in an emial, but i haven't found a real definition for that. It may be best to call it a "sports car/track car" Pik d 03:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>do not delete</i> As someone who was trying to understand more about the concept of "EMO" subculture, I think that this inclusion added a lot to my understanding. I think it was be a shame to delete it as future wiki searchers would be missing out on a better understanding of the meaning. I also think it is one of wikipedia's strengths that you can find something like the google video link from searching for info on there, it is exactly what you would never get from an alternative encyclopedia source.</li>

<dd>I don't think you quite understand the policies we use for notability. Per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, internet content is notable if <i>"The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</i> What makes a source non-trivial? For that, we can take a peek at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which explain reliable sources. The first cite in the article is a link to a web forum. Per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking. In addition, in the case of wikis, the content of an article could change at any moment.The same reasoning applies to trivia on sites such as IMDb or FunTrivia.com, where the degree of editorial oversight is unknown."</i></p>
</blockquote>
That also eliminates the IMDb link as potential indicator of notability. Your second link goes to Danielle Belton Online, the personal blog of an entertainment reporter for the <i>Bakersfield Californian</i>. While this <i>might be</i> an acceptable source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, I'm going to argue against it. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> makes exception for self-published sources if "a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material." I would not consider Danielle Belton a well-known professional journalist. The fact that she writes for the <i>Bakersfield Californian</i> is somewhat irrelevant, because that newspaper <b>did not</b> give column inches to the movie. To say that she gives the movie notability because she talks about it and she writes for the <i>Californian</i> is an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>. Her statement was not published by the <i>newspaper</i>, and thus relies only on her authority alone, which isn't exactly that of a national-level entertainment reporter. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:11, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>In response to these notes by SunStar Net, I will now present my full disagreement to them for the Wikipedia Adminstration:
<p>Kara Edwards meets the following criteria from WP:NOTE</p>
<p><i>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions.</i></p>
<p>Kara portrayed three major roles in the last third of Dragon Ball Z: Videl, Goten and Gotenks.</p>
<p><i>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following.</i> Again, DBZ's fan base is large, even though it started out as a "cult" following.</p>
<p>Kara also meets the following criteria from WP:Biographies of living persons</p>
<p>Verifiability: All information in the article was gleaned from Kara's official webpages, major metropolitan newspaper articles, or through conversation with Kara Edwards herself.</p>
<p>Neutral point of view: Although I am a fan of Kara's work, I did my best to make the page neutral. All biographical and career information was, again, provided by Kara Edwards herself with no embellishment; I had to add some "writing" to her resumé so that it would be more than just a bald list of her jobs, with no timeframe. Some might disagree with my calling the "Tanner in the Morning" show "popular", but by virtue of ratings and community response, it WAS/IS popular; therefore, I feel this invalidates any claim of non-neutrality.</p>
<p>I hold that any creation of a page that does not exist could be said to SUBJECTIVELY involve a certain amount of "original research", although this would really be closer to "fact gathering". There was NO ORIGINAL REASEARCH involved in my creation of this page; everything on it(Kara's basic biographical information, her filmography, her broadcast career, details of her wedding) was a matter of public record.<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiScOrD_tHe_LuNaTiC_2937.html" title="User:DiScOrD tHe LuNaTiC">DiScOrD tHe LuNaTiC</a> 12:41, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "through conversation with Kara Edwards herself" cannot be verified so any information of this nature should be deleted <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 17:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"through conversation with Kara Edwards herself" — Interviewing the subject directly, firsthand, <i>is</i> original research. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The "through conversation with Kara Edwards herself" refers only to the exact date of her wedding. If it makes any difference, I've removed it. Now the ONLY information on the page is from her official webpages or major metropolitan newspaper articles.<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiScOrD_tHe_LuNaTiC_2937.html" title="User:DiScOrD tHe LuNaTiC">DiScOrD tHe LuNaTiC</a> 19:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You misunderstand. I was answering your assertion that you need to do something interesting in order to get an article. Wadlow did nothing interesting except grow, just as this chap has done nothing interesting except live. The fact he was the tallest man in the world and Helldal is only the oldest man in Sweden is irrelevant according to your own logic. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 20:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First non-exhaustive lists have a purpose. In certain cases they can be a tool for countering systemic bias. For some examples <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brazilian_writers_7b47.html" title="List of Brazilian writers">List of Brazilian writers</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indian_architects_bde0.html" title="List of Indian architects">List of Indian architects</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bangladesh-related_topics_d037.html" title="List of Bangladesh-related topics">List of Bangladesh-related topics</a>. Second an advantage of Wikipedia, possibly the only one, is it's ability to do things encyclopedias would not. You're not going to find most anything in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimated_character_stubs_f76a.html" title="Category:Animated character stubs">Category:Animated character stubs</a> or much of what's in <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual articles</a> in an encyclopedia. So the "this wouldn't be in an encyclopedia" is irrelevant. Third they can provide information on the topic categories can not. Fourth my encyclopedia has a list of naval terms and I don't think it's exhaustive, but I'll have to check. All that said <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_double_bass_players_in_other_popular_genres.html" title="List of double bass players in other popular genres">List of double bass players in other popular genres</a> should likely be erased as cryptic.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>Certain subjects are going to be disproportionately less interesting to Wikipedians than they would to the public or encyclopedias. The articles listed for deletion here aren't good examples of that, but examples do exist. I gave examples of lists relating to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> because these are large nations with low internet access per capita. Although in retrospect Nigeria would've been a better example than Brazil. Anyway lists on those can be "worked on" allowing for expansion. In addition I think many nominate lists just because they don't like lists rather than for legitimate reasons to delete lists. (For example the list is based on a POV, the list is focussed on intersections that are never notable like say a hypothetical List of Lutheran ornithologists, etc) See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> for when lists are accepted.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I find these lists useful as an index, and I have been introduced to a lot of personages I hitherto knew nothing about as a result. <b>Ralphroysterdoyster</b></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as the lists are limited to those musicians for which a Wikipedia article exists, I find them useful. I read about, say, a jazz guitarist I like. I may then wonder what other jazz guitarists are covered here, I click the link, and I know instantly, and can read about any of them. It's a convenience that I see no reason to delete. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_W_30e5.html" title="User:Alan W">Alan W</a> 00:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is what categories for. The lists are basically impossible to maintain, and don't offer any advantage over categories. Compare this with, say, a discography: a discography can be illustrated, sorted by year, and annotated. It has a function way beyond the simple automatically-generated-list of a category. These lists don't. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is factually inaccurate. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_drummers.html" title="List of drummers">List of drummers</a> already includes annotation about what genre they're in and what band they're associated with the most. Show how a category does that.

<li>List of guitarists (which is the only one I nominated) ought to be 10,000, maybe 100,000, entries. What use is such a woefully incomplete list, and how could we manage such a large list if it were completed?

<ul>
<li>Ideally it's going by notability so there's not going to be 10,000 names. If it gets to huge you divide into sublists. Besides which even if you're correct do you think a category with 10,000 articles is any more workable? <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_actor_stubs_4a0a.html" title="Category:American actor stubs">Category:American actor stubs</a> has maybe 1,200 or so articles and it's on a "very large" warning.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I agree with the objections, but I don't think they warrant deletion. People obviously find these lists useful.

<dd>Sexual abuse as a sociological notion does not exist in clergy and non-clergy subflavors. Events, such as the Catholic sex-abuse controversy, merit their own articles for having been covered by the media, and individual confirmed/prosecuted molestors do as well, but this article was not about any specific events.

<dd>OK, thanks. Now, I understand the context and motivation for your original AFD nomination. I also get the point that "Sexual abuse by clergy" is not necessarily much different from "Sexual abuse by people in positions of authority" from a sociological point of view.</dd>

<dd>However, due to the Roman Catholic sexual abuse cases, there has been some focus on this question in the popular media and in religious organizations. In essence, people naturally asked "Is this phenomenon limited to the Roman Catholics?". Yes, it's true that there was a POV desire on the part of some Roman Catholics to say "No, it's not." And there was probably a POV desire on the part of some Protestants and Jews to say "Yes, it is". The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. It's not just a question of whether sexual abuse has occurred in non-Catholic religious organizations. The key problem that the Catholics had to grapple with was a willful organizational tolerance and cover-up of the sexual abuse across a major portion of the U.S. Catholic church.</dd>

<dd>The current article is much changed from the one that you nominated. However, it DOES treat "Sexual abuse by clergy" as a topic separate from "Sexual abuse by persons in positions of authority". I would like to hear your opinion on whether it would be encyclopedice to have an article such as the current revision under the title of "Sexual abuse by clergy" or "Sexual abuse in religious organizations". --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has been dramatically improved since the AFD began. Adding citations would be a good further step.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crazy Russian</a>. Firstly, I take issue with the title, which is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. The article's creater has confused subject with object. It should, if anything be "Sexual abuse committed by members of the clergy". Secondly, I see the scope as being too narrow for an encyclopaedic entry: It is better grouped under the broader descriptive of "Sexual abuse committed by persons in positions of authority". Deletion is not to hide the fact that sexual abuse cases are not perpetrated by people of the cloth, but to remove a divergent thread of opinion and the singling out of clergy as sex offenders, as opposed to teachers and doctors, just to give some examples. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it's a decent article, if there are elements of POV then we'd be better dealing with them than deleting the article. Agree with possible rename to "Sexual abuse committed by members of the clergy". wimbledon andy 11:28, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As we all know clergy abuse is a problem in all religions. All one needs to do is pick up any newspaper. It's vitally important for those who were abused by Priests, Nuns, Rabbis, Cantors, Monks, Pastors, etc. I think it's only those who try to cover up for those who offend who would want this catagory deleted from Wikpedia. For those of you who don't know, the term clergy abuse relates to not only sexual abuse, but also physical abuse, and other forms of manipulation for the gain of the individual doing the offending. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User_talk%7ENer_Israel_8e3c.html" title="User talk:Ner Israel">talk</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ner Israel (<a href="../../../n/e/r/User_talk%7ENer_Israel_8e3c.html" title="User talk:Ner Israel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ner_Israel_6b0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ner Israel">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Still delete</b> per my original nomination and JzG's sterling argument in the deletion review. I have been insulted and denigrated since I joined Wikipedia, with accusations of vandalism and bad-faith editing (and yes, that is a bit of a non sequitur, but it has relevance because much of the discussion has revolved around alleged misconduct on my part, <b>none</b> of which has been proven, or indeed exists other than in the minds of the people complaining). The 'new evidence' in the DRV does not amount to much, and I think that had people not have attacked me from the very beginning, the article would have been deleted more convincingly the first time round. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 22:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I said in the DRV, the editors working on this article need to take this opportunity to get the sources they pointed to into the article to indicate that this was indeed a notable member of the Christian rock genre; the fact that they shared a record label with such names as Amy Grant and Randy Travis is a pretty good start, but that needs to be sourced in the article immediately.

<li><b>Comment</b> The following links verify the content in the article as 441 being notable in the CCM/Christian alternative movement and identified as a part of a group of bands as noted in the DRV. Words used are "pioneering," "beloved," "trendsetting," and verifies the three album releases, chart positions and national distribution. <a href="http://441online.com/pics/ccmencyc441.gif" class="external text" title="http://441online.com/pics/ccmencyc441.gif" rel="nofollow">Entry for 441 in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music by Mark Allan Powell.

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you saying you'd like citation footnotes within the article? I can do that. As you may have seen, I edited the article for better format and included the sources listed above and certainly want to make the item conforming and effective. As for the credibility of the sources, the CCM Enclopedia, <a href="../../../c/c/m/CCM_Magazine_7634.html" title="CCM Magazine">CCM Magazine/Musicline</a>, <a href="http://www.christianexaminer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.christianexaminer.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian Examiner</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orange_County_Register_03f1.html" title="The Orange County Register">The Orange County Register</a> (mainstream newspaper) are authoritative for this genre. "Mainstream" press, as I mentioned in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_24&amp;diff=84408638&amp;oldid=84407734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_24&amp;diff=84408638&amp;oldid=84407734" rel="nofollow">DRV</a> and seconded by an editor, is sporadic for this genre. I'm working on finding additional sources for the latter album release, but they will be the same sources (CCM magazine, etc.). One issue of notability here is that there are many current acts (<a href="../../../s/w/i/Switchfoot.html" title="Switchfoot">Switchfoot</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jars_of_Clay_a94f.html" title="Jars of Clay">Jars of Clay</a>, <a href="../../../p/2E/o/P.O.D_d572.html" title="P.O.D">P.O.D</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joy_Electric_147d.html" title="Joy Electric">Joy Electric</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relient_K_3ad5.html" title="Relient K">Relient K</a>, to name a several) who got their opportunity/inspiration from the work of bands such as <a href="../../../4/-/4/4-4-1.html" title="4-4-1">4-4-1</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undercover_%28band%29.html" title="Undercover (band)">Undercover</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Again_4ab3.html" title="Adam Again">Adam Again</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_Boys_9c24.html" title="Altar Boys">Altar Boys</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifesavors.html" title="Lifesavors">Lifesavors</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crumbacher.html" title="Crumbacher">Crumbacher</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Choir_2f28.html" title="The Choir">The Choir</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The sources are presumably legit, despite the fact that the online links are only to 4-4-1's website. Since there weren't many websites in the early 80s, the odds of content originally from that era being on the original publisher's website is essentially zero. It would be better if someone can find the original sources in a library and do a citation to the print sources, leaving the URLs as just convenience links. However, the sources do demonstrate meeting the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> standards. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As you mentioned, online archives for these sources don't exist, AFAIK. I attempted to contact CCM Magazine but their email box is full. The items hosted on the <a href="http://www.441online.com" class="external text" title="http://www.441online.com" rel="nofollow">4-4-1</a> site were scans that I made of the items I still had as well as contributions from others who still had hard copy archives of these publications. The simplest place to put them for viewing was on that server/domain. The CCM Encyclopedia is a currently an in-print book. The OC Register article is active. This has all certainly been in good faith - with the amount of time I've already spent on this, fabricating references would take many more hours and is not in my nature. Thanks for everyone's time on this, it has earned from me an even greater respect of WP and the process. Gh228 21:02, 3 November 2006 (UTC)Gh228</li>

<p><b>Reason in a nutshell:</b> This is in all likelihood a paid translation of an autobiography of a person with no verifiable accomplishments.</p>
<p>This article appeared on multiple major Wikipedias on the same day in precisely the same form and shape (compare <a href="../../../../de/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="de:Gal_Rasché">de.wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../pl/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Gal_Rasché">pl.wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../fr/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Gal_Rasché">fr.wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../hu/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="hu:Gal_Rasché">hu.wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../nl/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gal_Rasché">nl.wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../sk/g/a/l/Gal_Rasch%C3%A9_f969.html" class="extiw" title="sk:Gal_Rasché">sk.wiki</a>). Other than de.wiki where the text originated, on some Wikipedias there was a substub on this person prior to that day, but it did not establish the notability of the character other than by having several interwiki links (which is probably how the substub eluded deletion).</p>
<p>On most Wikipedias, the translation appeared as the only major contribution of a new user named Djiggy or IP 84.113.1.108. The author tagged the edit as <i>"translation from german"</i>, even though on some Wikipedias, he explicitly said he can't speak the language he supposedly translated the article to (see userboxes: <a href="../../../../hu/d/j/i/user%7EDjiggy_05b7.html" class="extiw" title="hu:user:Djiggy">hu:user:Djiggy</a>)</p>
<p>The person described in the article is herself <a href="http://www.google.pl/search?q=%22Gal+Rasch%C3%A9%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.pl/search?q=%22Gal+Rasch%C3%A9%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">ungooglable</a>, so is her "proper" name (<a href="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Galina+Krutikowa%22+-wikipedia&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Galina+Krutikowa%22+-wikipedia&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>). It is also impossible to find any references to the international prize she won in Yugoslavia - <a href="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Interfer+99%22+yugoslavia&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Interfer+99%22+yugoslavia&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">see here</a>, which makes one wonder how notable could this throphy be.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a promotional article of a person that does not seem to have any verifiable claim to notability.</p>

As for verifiability - the first URL you've provided finds a couple of hits for the festival itself, but past the first pages, it's mostly a bunch of instances of mistyped "<i>interfere</i>" and hyphenated "<i>interfer-ence</i>" on various English-language pages. The other search is identical to the one provided in my original submission, except that it includes copies of the article on various Wikipedias. On a personal note, given the timeframe of your edits on various Wikipedias and the quality and nearly identical appearance of the translations you've posted, I have a hard time believing the explanation you've provided - although that's just my sentiment, and I can be wrong. --<a href="../../../l/c/a/User%7ELcamtuf_1a6c.html" title="User:Lcamtuf">lcamtuf</a> 00:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I know that there are very few references for Gal Rasché and it will be very hard to verify this article.

Keeping in mind of course that Ivanov is about as common as Smith, this is underwhelming. The Russian percussionist assocation (Российской Ассоциации исполнителей на ударных инструментах) pulled up exactly one hit and its to Russian Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> He is not "head of a couple organizations", just a member; he only heads the sadly ungooglable Russian Percussionist Association, which is a shame but it does not necessarily mean the whole thing is a hoax.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that verifying information about him is difficult, but this is something different from a hoax, and deleting the article need not be the best cure for that -- research is. Regarding google: Russian is a heavily inflected language and you have to search for him also in cases other than the nominative. Another thing is that while in the English part of the Web, you can sometimes find info even about your neighbour's dog, this isn't so for Russian, although the Russian web is much better developed than, say, its Byelorussian counterpart. Information is simply not so readily available on that side of the globe. Now about the ruwiki article: while you are correct that Galrashe started it, her self-promotion has been <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;diff=1101826&amp;oldid=1098394" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;diff=1101826&amp;oldid=1098394" rel="nofollow">removed by another user</a>, to whom I already wrote asking for sources on Ivanov. So there is some hope we'll learn more about him from an objective source. Once again: his notability is not that of a film star, he seems to be just a guy doing his job a bit better than others, in several respects. Whether to keep him or not will be your decision, all I'm asking is for him not to be treated on a par with the person who used him as a ladder, that just wouldn't be fair. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBansp_7ee9.html" title="User:Bansp">Bansp</a> 12:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can't help adding that I share Lcamtuf's suspicion that we are looking at a rather massive advertising campaign of the Rashe gal. I think part of it was posting an article about someone real and reasonably notable, and hooking the gal's bio to it.

<li>Regarding Yandex, the search results need solid sifting, cause there are several people by this name, including at least one pretty well known musician (like, <a href="http://kgamit.narod.ru/rus/sotrudniki/ivanov/ivanov.htm" class="external text" title="http://kgamit.narod.ru/rus/sotrudniki/ivanov/ivanov.htm" rel="nofollow">this isn't our guy</a>). While I agree with the general spirit of your comment, I'd suggest pointing at more specific sources (which of course we might need to delegate to Djiggy, as probably the most fluent in Russian among us here; finding a Russian speaker not involved in this campaign would be even better).

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes it was me who added information about Iwanows presidency of the association on ruwiki. I dont think that it possible to find any links which can confirm this at the moment, so i wasnt able to find any. The reason for this could be that the association was created only one year ago and Iwanow was one of the grounders. My source of this information was Iwanow himself. At the moment he is travelling much mainly in Russia to rucruit the members. I will search further, but i think my search for facts wouldn't be very successful because at the moment this organisation is simply to small. The publications in austrain shop are the same as <a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" rel="nofollow">here</a>. These two volumes are the guide for the starters, who want to play percussions. But his main work is the transcription of <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_36db.html" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s "Children's Album". <a href="http://www.artis.spb.ru/index.php?day=24.03.04&amp;lang=rus&amp;kat=&amp;teatr=" class="external text" title="http://www.artis.spb.ru/index.php?day=24.03.04&amp;lang=rus&amp;kat=&amp;teatr=" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to the announcement of his concert in St. Petersburg's Phillarmony on 24.03.04.--<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">djiggy</a> 15:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It' not only a recording, where you should look at. Moreover, do you really think that in his 23 years long carreer at Leningrad Phillarmonic Orchestra - the most famous orchestra in Russia - he has made only one reording? The reason for this, that you cannot find his name on other cds is just because that it is not usual to print a cast of the whole orchestra(About 200 Members!!!) in the booklet or even in the internet. --<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">djiggy</a> 09:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From the above information, I gather that the only reference that uses the word "boltzmon" is a popular science book that probably did not undergo a rigorous peer-review process. Do you have references from a peer-reviewed scientific journal that use the word "boltzmon"? That would demonstrate that someone has used "botzmon" as a name for something connected to a black hole. Anyhow, the fact that the only specific mention of "boltzmon" is buried deep within a popular science book further demonstrates that the term is non-notable. It is far more likely that someone will find this article when misspelling <a href="../../../b/o/l/Boltzmann.html" title="Boltzmann">Boltzmann</a>, and I think the aricle should be made a redirect to that article rather than be kept in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The given excerpt from the book only states that some unnamed (!) theoretical physicists brought forward this boltzmon hypothesis. This sounds very much as if the book's author just happened to mention some fancy idea somebody overheard within some conferece gossip but that is ever made it into a scholary article. (Google Scholar has zero hits!) Wikipedia does not document scientific ideas in its larva state, not even if some more or less renowned science writer was so uncareful as to mention it with three sentences in a book. <i>Furthermore</i>: The text in the article is a literal excerpt from this paragraph in the book, hence it is also a <i>copyright violation</i>! <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanders_muc_9c4a.html" title="User:Sanders muc">Simon A.</a> 21:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about an executive order, the legal details of which are of no particular importance or notability. There are currently relatively few articles about executive orders (full list here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>]) and those that do exist are about orders of a great deal more significance (domestically and internationally) than this one. This was a very troublesome article for a time, due to the fact that it was based on highly erroneous information, from a disreputable source. Once the facts were established, and all of the POV content was removed, one is left with an article of no particular significance. I suggest, therefore, that it be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 15:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like you to reconsider your thinking on this one. I don't care that much about keeping or deleting this particular article but I do think the idea that we should keep all Executive Orders in Wikipedia is something worth discussing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your "what next?" suggests that every "piece of legislation" should be included in Wikipedia. Surely you must be kidding. Every piece of legislation in what country? The U.S., Canada, Britain, Australia, Germany, Russia? After all, this is not the "U.S." Wikipedia, it is the English Wikipedia. So, assuming we did want to include every piece of legislation in Wikipedia, we would have no reason to include only U.S. legislation and not those of other countries, English-speaking or not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the real counter-argument to yours is that there are all sorts of legislation which are not worth documenting. Please review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. It might be useful to have a database somewhere that stores a description of every bit of legislation promulgated in the U.S. Wikipedia (IMHO) is not it. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You read into my suggesiton quite well. I can't imagine a single piece of national (federal level for an idea of what level I'm thinking) legislation that shouldn't be included in an encyclopedia. I also can't imagine a single executive order (or similar head-of-state action) that shouldn't be included. These are inherently "notable" if we want to use that measure, and they're easily verifiable as well. This isn't an "indiscriminate collection of information," but rather a very clear and focused information set that should be encouraged, not discouraged, especially since the source of such legislation/orders are often in difficult-to-understand legal terminology. This is exactly the sort of information an encyclopedia lacking space and scope limitations should be compiling and presenting. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:56, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mercedes-Benz is certainly notable, but is everything they do notable by association? These mixtapes are a series of MP3 collections hosted on the company's official site, consisting of — and here's the main problem — songs primarily by <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsigned_artist.html" title="Unsigned artist">unsigned artists</a>. That means it's not particularly useful to list them on Wikipedia, since there's no way to discuss the musicians in any sort of context, since no verifiable sources have really discussed what they've done or influenced in the music world (other than "they submitted their demo tapes to Mercedes-Benz"). (The one notable exception I've found out of the two articles seems to be <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosca_%28band%29.html" title="Tosca (band)">Tosca</a> from 11.) Also, the past Mixed Tapes aren't even available on the site anymore. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnint_1508.html" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 18:16, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge down</b> I like merging, and I am downloading mixed tape 14 right now. Maybe if someone figures out (possibly through contacting Mercedes-Benz) how to grab the others we could add links to those on the combined page. Driving music is an as-of-yet undefined genre, so information on it could be helpful. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Inedible_Bulk_4ec0.html" title="User:The Inedible Bulk">TIB</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Inedible_Bulk_5521.html" title="User talk:The Inedible Bulk">talk</a>) 17:12, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure I'd call it "driving music". Most of the music on Mixed Tape is modern jazz, soul, lounge and other light electronica, I always think of songs like <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar_Love_7029.html" title="Radar Love">Radar Love</a> when people talk about driving and music, but perhaps that's just me. As far as I know the "back issues" are only partially available from Mercedes Benz's iTunes music store (and of course floating around the net on P2P networks). I have all Mixed Tapes so far, so I can provide playlists for anyone who wants them. --<a href="../../../l/i/j/User%7ELijnema_e954.html" title="User:Lijnema">Lijnema</a> 20:12, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, I have very recently made edits to try to make 65535 seem more interesting and notable. Part of my reason for Keep is pedagogical-65536 is a concrete number so that a person who hates x's and y's etc can see interesting things without forcefeeding. For ex, I said 3x5x17x257=65535 is 2 less than the next Fermat prime, hoping the reader'll notice that 3 is 2 less than 5(second fermat prime),3x5 is 2 less thn 17(third Fermat prime),3x5x17 is 2 less than 257, and so on.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Per <a href="../../../1/7/2/WP%7E1729_2c21.html" title="WP:1729">WP:1729</a>, it's not that interesting that 65535 is a Mersenne number. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 16:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. On the contrary, 65535 is used in many more instances than 1729, such as in programming (65535 is naturally the highest integer that can be used in <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_Basic_5ea7.html" title="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a> before an overflow occurs). Plus, <a href="../../../1/7/2/WP%7E1729_2c21.html" title="WP:1729">WP:1729</a> is not a Wikipedia policy, but rather, an essay.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You misunderstood. 1729 is just the shortcut to that essay, which is not a policy but a very useful rule of thumb. If you run "65535 is a Mersenne number" through the questionaire in the essay, you should come up with negative points, meaning that it's not interesting that "65535 is a Mersenne number." If you can find three mathematical properties of 65535 that yield positive points in the WP:1729 questionaire, you might be able to get the members of the <a href="../../../n/u/m/WP%7ENUM_2602.html" title="WP:NUM">WP:NUM</a> project to vote keep in this AfD. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 18:19, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I really can not be bothered to edit articles in the games-mod space, I've got more interesting things to do. But this is a notable mod. Valve Software hired Adrian Finol off this, Valve liked the mod so much, they donated a map for the mod team to use (Avanti from <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Fortress_Classic_5188.html" title="Team Fortress Classic">Team Fortress Classic</a>). I have multiple reviews of this from PCZone. And just a google search will give you some more ammo <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Apczone.co.uk+%22front+line+force%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Apczone.co.uk+%22front+line+force%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>. The above gamespy link was pretty trivial, a list of 10 top Half-Life mods, but Gamespy also hosted 2 proper feature interviews with the FLF team seen <a href="http://archive.gamespy.com/spotlights/november00/flf/" class="external text" title="http://archive.gamespy.com/spotlights/november00/flf/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/january01/pink/" class="external text" title="http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/january01/pink/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>I sincerely apologize for the add under ambient music, that was going too far (I'm still learning the do's and don'ts about Wikipedia). As far as the Saraswa article goes, please don't delete it. It is not purely self-promotion, it is edited from a review was not actually written by the artist himself, furthermore the page was created from request. Saraswa has interest from several major record labels and is in currently negotiating a deal for major distribution. Saraswa is a notable artist, and does not warrant deletion.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:Mattsmawfield (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EMattsmawfield_d619.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Mattsmawfield">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> Obviously biased but i would really appreciate my early post being kept. I had miniscule info to work with and i've left all the details on the article. If Brett was mentioned online i wouldn't have written this, i thought he made just enough impact to warrant a mention, i don't think it's fair to delete because he isn't in a google search. thanks all the same...please be gentle, suggestions VERY welcome Stuedgar 22:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC) Stuedgar</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Seems at best an unknown artist who apparently flourished for a very few years and disappeared. With some sources and, ideally, information on galleris that have his work, he might move into the notable band, but I've not been able to find anything. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 23:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Again the best i can give you is what the text book says, which is New York galleries, nothing on current residence of work. I think he makes it into the text as much for the life story as his output in honesty, but if i don't overstate his importance and I give the solid details i think he is revelant enough for a short mention. No hard feelings if it HAS to go but i'd like it to stay. thanks for the suggestions Emeraude. I'm aware he hasn't had the impact for a mention in google searches but i'd be over the moon for his history to make the transition from text to web via Wikipedia. If anyone else has come across him in their fields or studies, or thinks he is interesting enough as a footnote for a quick mentions please lend your support.

<dd>Answer: I said, quoting you originally "not 'mainstream research <i>publications'</i> ". But OK, let's read the opening sentences from the Australian Ass. for the Study of Religion (a 1998 press release by the way): "<i>I am editing</i> a handbook of information on new religious groups and associations in Australia. The greater part of the information included in the handbook is <i>provided by the groups themselves</i>."

<dd><b>Comment</b>, They would be, if they in fact proved more than the bear bones of existence. I'd note that only two sources (the first and third) in fact mention the group <i>at all</i>, with the second being a paper on the general phenomenon which <i>doesn't</i> mention it. Of those two sources mentioning it, the first merely includes it as part of a list of satanic groups, which proves that the author has heard of it and very little else. The third does pretty much likewise, but adds that the group has "less than fifty members", which seems to suggest that it's not a particularly serious concern. Therefore, <b>delete</b> based on the sources provided. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:38, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the tip on the second source. That said, we're still left with three sources there which mention this group in passing as part of a list of similar groups, which doesn't establish notability at all. Quoting from <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">this guideline</a>, we see that something must be "described by multiple independent reliable sources", with <i>described</i> the operative word - I don't see a description in any of those sources beyond the barest mention of the name (and, occasionally) the alternative name in either Latin or English. It's generally accepted that a mention which only says that something exists proves nothing beyond the fact that it exists. The AASR website has quite rightly been called into question by another user for containing information provided from the group itself, which renders it somewhat less than "independent" and may well render it unreliable to boot. I don't have any Russian, so I can't pass any judgement on exactly what's being said there, or indeed anything else regarding the independence or reliability of the site. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's perfectly entitled to be standard procedure, but it renders the information less than impartial. Don't just take my word for it - it's in that quote I cited earlier, "described by multiple independent reliable sources". Simply reprinting information provided by a group or a person isn't being independent. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Never the less this information was processed by Dr. Rowan Ireland which makes it perfectly independent and reliable source, unless of course you have a proof that he enjoys worshiping Satan in his spare time, then he's not busy reading lectures at uni. That is the only thing, I'm afraid, that will make this source not independent. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 08:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you and I might be defining "independent" in different ways. I'm not saying that Dr Ireland <i>himself</i> isn't independent, he certainly has the capability to be. What I'm saying is that the <i>information</i> contained in that source isn't independent. Dr Ireland can be a Satanist, a Zoroastrian or a Raelian for all it matters, what matters is where he gets his information from. If Dr Ireland wrote a book in which he described this group in reasonable detail, that would be a description by an independent and reliable source. What we have here is a press release saying that Dr Ireland was intending to write a book (which doesn't appear to have been released, incidentally). The information he tells us he will use is sourced directly from the group itself (i.e. it isn't independent - unless you take the view that the group would really provide impartial information). Such information as is in the press release is very scanty indeed (i.e. very probably not a description of the group). Having multiple sources telling us that the group exists is a good start, but it isn't the end of the deal - there are multiple sources stating that I exist, I know this because I applied for a passport today, but it doesn't make me notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"What I'm saying is that the information contained in that source isn't independent". If we'll follow that logic, it could be said, that Bibliologist shouldn't use Bible, because Bible is not independent source on Bible, but rather he should use, let's say - Quran? -- <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 10:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PS. And it was published as CD-ROM "Australia's Religious Communities: A Multimedia Exploration", and it's professional edition of included information on Ordo Sinistra Vivendi as can be clearly seen from this review <a href="http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000065.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000065.cgi" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 10:48, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, there's a considerable difference there. A Biblical scholar won't <i>just</i> use the Bible - he or she will also use other material from other scholars, as well as the critical faculties of his or her own mind. There's no evidence in that press release that Dr Ireland had done either (in fact there's considerable evidence that he hadn't used material from other scholars). Had he written this book, it could well be a different story. Additionally, if the only evidence we had on the existence of the Bible came in the form of some people saying "Other examples of religious books are the Bible, the Talmud, the Bhagavad Gita..." and nothing more (as remains the case in this review of the CD=ROM database - it's still just proof of existence rather than anything else), then I doubt it would be worthwhile to include an article on the Bible. Of course, that isn't the case here, which rather causes problems for our friendly neighbourhood strawman. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One particular concern raised was original research, and that construction of such lists should be in the form of verifiability from sources that have already collated such a list, rather than having readers having to resort to inspection to check the content. As such, this list is verifiable and constructable from <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030820/cth2.htm#12" class="external text" title="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030820/cth2.htm#12" rel="nofollow">this <i>Tribune</i> article</a>, <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~msmith03/songtitles/songnonsense.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~msmith03/songtitles/songnonsense.htm" rel="nofollow">this list</a>, and <a href="http://www.oldiesfun.com/2001archivesbeunique/03-02-01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.oldiesfun.com/2001archivesbeunique/03-02-01.htm" rel="nofollow">this list</a>, for starters.
<p>As to whether the scope of the list is too narrow or too broad (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Appropriate_topics_for_lists</a>): This list is not a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complement_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Complement (set theory)">set complement</a>, its criteria being inclusive ("everything with property X") rather than exclusive; and it is not, contrary to what it is stated above by <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrackerTV_a31e.html" title="User:TrackerTV">TrackerTV</a>, infinite, since the total number of songs in the world is finite. <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a>'s problems with the article lie in whether neologisms constitute nonsense, and are addressed by sidestepping the problem entirely and relying upon sources that have already done the work, such as those previously mentioned, rather than original research by Wikipedia editors that then has to be argued about. Quite a lot of the article can be retained even if all of the entries that cannot currently be sourced are removed, and the sources contain much that isn't already in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find the logic "Song lists can't be infinite because the number of songs in the world are finite" fairly ridiculous. There's a finite number of grains of sand in the world, too.

<li>If you find it ridiculous, then your knowledge of logic is insufficient. I suggest reading our article on <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finite_set.html" title="Finite set">finite sets</a> which tells you that any subset of a finite set is itself finite.

<dd>Of the 14 footnotes in the article as of this minute, only 4 or 5 actually appear to pertain to the subject of this article, and none of those appear to establish notability -- they just list him as a soldier who enrolled (note 5), was one of a thousand who took part in a battle (notes 1 &amp; 2), and mustered out (note 8). This is standard genealogy -- we could find similar information about thousands upon thousands of other soldiers who are listed in muster rolls. Why is this guy notable among the thousand soldiers at Tippecanoe? The article still does not say. A quote from one or both of the two <i>Battle of Tippecanoe</i> books which mention him would quickly dispel my objections. —<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> 02:49, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, looking again... very little of it. Mostly the bits about the 'notorious incident hanging over their heads for a decade' and the 'family strife'. I guess I agree that it isn't, on the whole, OR. On the other hand, many of the sources are obscure and/or unpublished - the "Ransdell Family Archive", for instance. And this doesn't change my view that this is family history and not anything really worthy of an entry. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

But I would argue that removing the 2 items sourced by the archives would not affect the notability, in fact, those two items are tangential and not terribly relevant. The <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a> stuff can be toned down and the article salvaged. If it was a notorious incident in that town (the trial) then it wasn't just of interest to that family, but to the town as well, hence why I would argue it has a place. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 03:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>S/he is adding more data, but ironically, the more that's added, the less I believe it meets notability as it is showing that there really is no non-trivial mention of the person in question if they're trying to meet notability by inserting a quote about his company and not himself. I'd like to wait and see if my request to add the quotes from the Tippecanoe books per Kevin (on the Talk page) happens.

<li>Hmmm. Whilst I've not looked into this save very briefly, it is not enough to survive AfD to make a mere assertion of notability. The purpose of AfD is to see if these appearances <i>are</i> valid or not; to weight whether they are notable or not. Noone's seeking a speedy deletion, nor even a 5-day PROD here. AfD is instead being asked to do some thorough (admittedly fairly heavy) legwork and reach a viable decision. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:28, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Point taken, thank you for bringing that to my attention. I will try to do alittle more work to back up my nominatin but it still stands. I think if it comes to AFD, it should be analyzed for every possible reason to keep it or to delete it. From what I read, it appears as thhough this article adds value to wikipedia and hence my keep vote. After reading your comment, I do agree and will downgrade my nomination to a weak keep. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 23:31, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Nomination for Deletion</b> Non-encyclopedically notable student society which was only established in 2003. Cambridge has a strong comedy tradition, but this just not comparable to the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Footlights_136e.html" title="Cambridge Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a>, or equivalents at say, U.Chicago or even Bristol. The original creator of the article has put up an pre-emptive defence of the society <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Improvised_Comedy_Ents" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Improvised_Comedy_Ents" rel="nofollow">here</a> - I encourage people to read it. My rebuttal is that while Cambridge may be famous for comedy, ICE has only beeen around for 3 years and is unlikely to have achieved a remarkable level of fame (if it has, then show us); coverage in student newspapers and stalls at the fresher's fair are not acceptable or credible indicators of encyclopedic notability (and Wikipedia is not a campus info booth). An equivalence is also claimed with the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Imps_44d1.html" title="Oxford Imps">Oxford Imps</a>, but this Dark Blue group appears to be significantly more accomplished than ICE (and I'm not very sure Imps is encyclopedically notable either). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:59, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There was an idea awhile back that lists should only cover subjects worthy of an article. For example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mennonites_4aec.html" title="List of Mennonites">List of Mennonites</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonite.html" title="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>. This doesn't fit that, but it is a subject of interest well-maintained. On pop-cultural things Wikipedia is more expansive than an encyclopedia. At first I didn't like that, but I've come to accept it. Still I would support and join a ListWiki if the presence of lists is becoming that repugnant to people.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.
