<li><b>Strong keep</b> and urge considering another snowball speedy. Our article could frankly be stronger, but Noah is a well-known columnist who has written memorably for many years on major subjects for a number of prominent publications. Beyond that, although I am sure this is a good-faith nomination and not a WP:POINT violation, there comes a point where seeking to delete a prominent but harmless article like this one goes beyond obeisance to process and risks putting Wikipedia in a position close to self-parody. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 13:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know how much newspapers fact-check their biographies, but surely the fact that the bios are published on Slate and Washington Monthly websites means they don't contain obviously false information, and that corrections are made whenever it's pointed out that something is incorrect.

<dd>Maybe they do, but the point is its on the site he works for. So its not really a source independent of himself. It's not like someone found his worthy enough for a bio.

<dd>Isn't that really just a vicious circle though? A writer for undoubtedly notable news sources and opinion journals cannot be notable if his work is published in sources that he is employed by? That's an overextension of notability as a deletion criterion, in my view. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 16:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But Slate and Washington Monthly won't publish the bios of their head of computer maintenance or their receptionist, self-written or not. So it is at least marginally independent. Slate and WM publish bios on its <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_figure.html" title="Public figure">public figures</a>, and I think we should too. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 16:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with Jersyko -- disallowing a bio from the author's publisher is going too far. We would accept the author's writings as reliable because the publisher provides editorial oversight.

<dd>Ok, fine, we'll count that as a source.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Timothy Noah is a well-known journalist: Senior/contributing writer for two major, influential publications with impressive past resume; winner of two prestigious awards in his field; has appeared as a media/journalism expert and commentator on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june02/history_1-28.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june02/history_1-28.html" rel="nofollow"><i>PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer</i></a>, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0009/23/rs.00.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0009/23/rs.00.html" rel="nofollow">CNN's <i>Reliable Sources</i></a>, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2005/12/06" class="external text" title="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2005/12/06" rel="nofollow">WNYC-NPR's <i>Brian Lehrer Show</i></a>, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/04/i_c.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/04/i_c.01.html" rel="nofollow">CNN's <i>International Correspondents</i></a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1829841" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1829841" rel="nofollow">NPR's <i>Day to Day</i></a>, and likely others; is widely quoted by supporters and opponents alike, for example: <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001968.html" class="external text" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001968.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/001005.html" class="external text" title="http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/001005.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and dozens of other places. This seems to me to be an open-and-shut case for keeping the article, and the fact that it has been re-nominated for deletion suggests to me that there is something going on here that has nothing to do with the subject's notability. I don't care what his politics are, and I especially don't care what he has written about Wikipedia. Last time I looked those were not criteria for keep or delete. If an article about Timothy Noah can be deleted, I fear for the future of the project. When I have a moment I'll add these references to the piece - but they were trivially easy to find in a 10 minute session on Google, and there are many others there, plus I expect many others not picked up on Google - so, again, I question the motives here. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 22:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although that hypothetical won't happen, the statement in your last sentence is not true: there is no way this article could or would or should be deleted, as the subject's notability is, as it always has been, beyond peradventure; and at this point there are overtones of arguing for the sake of arguing, which should stop. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't doubt that you've had that experience, but I didn't say that there are references out there in the ether that I'll at some point locate and post, I actually posted them here a few minutes ago. And I intend to post them in the article - or anyone can. But do these references satisfy your concerns regarding "multiple independent of the author" indications of the man's notability? And if so, when they are posted to the article will you withdraw your request for deletion? I have no dog in this fight - I wasn't involved in the last round, so I'm not defending my own position here - I just see a request for deletion of an article about someone I've heard of (as opposed to the many, many, many articles that survive about which I have never heard), so my attention was piqued. I understand that the references have to actually be in the article, but I would like a reading from you and others if these references would turn <b>delete</b> into <b>keep</b> for any of you, and if not, why not. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 23:23, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
