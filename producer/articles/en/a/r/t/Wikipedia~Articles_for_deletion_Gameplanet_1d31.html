<p>This article is nothing but an advertisement for a bunch of non-notable individuals and a lot of it is just nonsense to boot (I'm curious to know what sort of "regular event" "meat" is, for one thing).

<li><b>Conrad</b>, if it would help put your mind at rest, regarding the advertising issue the gameplanet forums have absolutely nothing to do with the GP store.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is there any other verifiable claim to notability except that one web award? Low Alexa rank. The drug scandal claims are whoppingly unimpressive — some people speculated about celebrity names and guessed some right??? If the site is notable the article should concentrate on that instead of listing some guys' screen names and random mentions about a radio chat show host once reading a line from a web forum. Chatty unverifiable trivia makes the site appear <i>less</i> notable. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 10:49, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The media in question did not specifically refer to Gameplanet forums, but in the video items gp was clearly visible. This was to prevent any legal repercusions. But If you think this is bad, wait till you see the something awful wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh and, by the way, the drugs scandal case was a very very important case in nz. it capitivated the media in nz for about a week, and the primary focus was on the information leak on the internet THROUGH GPFORUMS which identified the celebrities involved. And it is in the process of being written, you may or may not notice, but it is nigh on 24 hours old, and hasnt been completed yet. --<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubwaynz_26cd.html" title="User:Subwaynz">Subwaynz</a> 11:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To those who disagree with this nomination, I apologise if you feel my deletion proposal was hasty and that this subject is notable. I'm not very knowledgable about online gaming communities nor am I from New Zealand, but I assumed that if this article was about a notable subject it would have been in just a little better shape than it was. Here is the diff just before I nominated it for deletion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gameplanet&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=56083828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gameplanet&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=56083828" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Take a look at it and hopefully you'll understand my motivation for deleting it. Oh and by the way, I was contemplating nominating it for a speedy deletion but thought that it might have some redeeming value so instead nominated it for a standard deletion so that attention might be brought to its problems and those who opposed deletion could voice their opinions.--<font color="green"><b>Conrad Devonshire</b></font> <sup><b><font color="purple">Talk</font></b></sup> 16:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Subway you enormous god damn tard. Those people arent that notable, honestly, and his point about something awful member section being only writes and important front page people, he is correct. GET A CLUE. - Lemonus</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Knowing nothing of the Something Awful entries, I took a look to see how they compare with regards to the "personalites" sections. Personally I see the Something Awful entry itself as more of an entry about a type of publication (as it appears to have articles rather than freeform chat which would be the Something Awful Forum). If you take Something Awful itself and compare it to, say, The Times or Washington Post (taking two other publications at random), you'll note that the two paper entries have a notable contributors section. The Something Awful Forum entry doesn't. (I'm from NZ btw) <a href="../../../r/2/b/User%7ER2b2_b388.html" title="User:R2b2">r2b2</a> 06:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm from NZ, never heard of it, but it seems to have some notablity within NZ, and please keep it civil.

<li><b>Comment</b> My god this is frustrating, everyone seems to think just because they dont know of something that they feel it is not relevant, while this is a broad comment, it is what the users of wikipedia feel. the whole idea of an encyclopadia is to provide a medium to collate information from the world around us. why do i go to wikipedia? to learn about something i have no idea about/havent heard of. If i was a prospective forum member and i wanted to learn about gpforums, and i went to wikipedia, i then learnt all about gpforums, and i saw the notable members aspect, and when i DID join gpforums i would know why people post replies of why they hate wushu, or brock. It is not about why a United States wikipedia user doesnt know about someone or a topic (from nz). I just think that people should stick their noses where its actually wanted. The notable members part complied with wiki policies, sgt molloy was featured in the mainstream media. So, however much you think your the expert on everything world wide, your not. The notable members are an integral part of gpforums and is what makes gpforums what it is today. If you dont like it, or havent heard of it, but it complies with wiki policies, then dont be a knob and delete it, wikipedia is diverse, so is the world. Thats what an encyclopedia is designed to do.--<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubwaynz_26cd.html" title="User:Subwaynz">Subwaynz</a> 06:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Aside from "Sgt. Molloy" who was mentioned in the news, none of those members are notable anywhere outside of Gameplanet itself, so they shouldn't be here. I have left Sgt. Molloy here for now, but I should also mention that his real name needs to be mentioned in the article if he is to stay.--<font color="green"><b>Conrad Devonshire</b></font> <sup><b><font color="purple">Talk</font></b></sup> 19:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
