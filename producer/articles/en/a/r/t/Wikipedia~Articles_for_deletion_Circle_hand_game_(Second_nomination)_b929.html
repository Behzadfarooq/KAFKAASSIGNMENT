<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. OK, I read it all. The sources, the article, the entire discussion here. I must say, the discussion here was the most entertaining of it. Despite the persistent hammering by large caliber arguments on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> themes, the counter arguments put up a spirited defense of the article. Even though I take it that I'm one of only a few people to grow up in the U.S. without having heard of this game, I was persuaded by the common folklore arguments. Unfortunately, common folklore doesn't provide the facts and details needed to write an article. That gets back to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> arguments. On balance, it can't stay without sources because despite what everyone else seems to "know" about this, it still needs sources. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 07:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is for those of you who say because the nature of this game is that it can't be cited, it should be deleted. Folklores and bedtime stories have been passed around by word of mouth for thousands of years, yet they cannot be sourced, does that mean they should be deleted on wikipedia as well? This game is very popular amongst children and young adults, and has been passed around by word of mouth and popular culture. Just because you haven't heard of it does not make it unpopular. From personal experience, I can say that the vast majority of young adults have heard of this game, making it more popular than some folklores. 10:00, 9 December 2006

<li><b>Keep</b> - The nature of this game is one that cannot be sourced. You're not going to find information in any newspaper articles, because it is somewhat of an underground thing, and even if it were sourced, that article would be inaccurate because the game does have so many different rules from school-to-school. The page should remain because it is a popular game in schools. Perhaps it should be locked for editing, but not deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> - While the rules may vary from place to place, the overall game is very popular. It should be kept because it's not "Urban Dictionary" or fake.

<li>There's so many things wrong with that I don't even know where to start. First of all, I said there IS sourcing (albeit it doesn't look very good, but it's still there.) Second of all, how is ignoring verifiability ignoring NPOV? Just because a statement exists as a source doesn't instantly make it NPOV, nor does a statement that isn't sourced always not NPOV. Third, this isn't <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> seeing as it's obviously been around (see: this discussion and people saying "I know about this game.")

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b> OK, time for today's Wikipedia lesson: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has <b>already been published by a reliable source</b>. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is one of Wikipedia's three content policies. The other two are <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three. The principles upon which these policies are based are negotiable only at the Foundation level.</p>
<p>And further into the rule <i>The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. <b>If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it</b>.</i> and <i>Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources</i></p>
<p>Already you have stated there are no reliable, third-party sources on this, so the article Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a></p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."</i></p>
<p><i>kipedia is not the place for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say.</i></p>
<p>Well, by looking at this, we see the article in question is in violation of this policy. So we have an article which is NOT 'improving' wikipedia, is Original Research, does not cite reliable third party sources, and is not verifiable by the common person. BTW: <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> is meant not as a way for someone to use it as a 'get out of jail free' card to add whatever they want.

<li><b>Delete</b> There have been a number of these types of games that have been nominated for AfD in the past month or two. All have been hoaxes and follow a similar pattern in which a number of people, likely sockpuppets/single-purpose accounts, come to the AfD and talk about how popular and widespread the game is. These same accounts post ridiculous statements on the articles talk page. While this particular article seems to be a little less extreme in this sense, it still certainly hints that its a hoax in the same way. I doubt the game actually exists and even if it does, an unverifiable playground game with varying rules <i>and</i> names certainly in unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I understand the issue of verifiability is problematic to the article, due to the nature of the game... I for one, had seen this game come up at least once a day at my high school. I'm not suggesting that my experience lends any merit to the article, but I am aware that this isn't some inside joke people just randomly decide to make an article about. I'm positive that there must be a reference to this game somewhere, someplace (even, perhaps, in a book of adolescent school games, or whatever). This isn't really something just "made up in school one day"; it was just something you were passively made aware of in adolescent, like birthday punches and wedgies. This is all from the bottom of my heart. --<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.Logan_5bcc.html" title="User:C.Logan">C.Logan</a> 03:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I had seen something like this going on back when I was in high school, but it's an entirely unencyclopedic topic. The article states that the only real rule is the use of the circle-hand, then lists a bunch of unsourced rule variations. Then it lists a bunch of strategies. This is all original research, and should not be allowed.<br />
It's quite similar to what often happens with that "The Game" article, where random people keep trying to add in their own rule variations, strategies, and various other nonsense. The difference here is, that article actually has a print source, and removing all of the OR doesn't leave us with a blank article. This article has no reliable sources, it isn't verifiable, so it has to go. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not suggesting that there's a problem with notability (which is what your star trek example would refer to).

<li>You missed my point. My point was that Wikipedia is not meant to cover everything which is true, just things which are verifiable. And if there are no sources, it is <i>not verifiable</i>.

<dd>You missed my point, which is that it most certainly is verifiable. You already knew about it before this article, didn't you? And so does everyone else voting here (except for "The Way", apparently... what hole did they crawl out of?). If three people sit in a room together and one of them brings up some childhood game, and the other two say "oh yeah I remember that," then that's verifiability. It doesn't matter if they can't find a newspaper article or a scholarly journal on it. It's verifiable because everyone here in this vote knows that it's real. That's enough verifiability for folklorists, for example, who often have only oral history to work from. We all know it, so it's verifiable. If our standards then say that it's <i>not</i> verifiable, then our standards are methodologically wrong. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 00:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the Malcom reference, while I agree it could be concidered source, the Blog would not. Also, this 'game's article needs to have multiple, reliable, independent, non-biased, third-party sources cited for it to pass the AFD.

And it's part of the MitM canon, so it's on the same level as the show. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 01:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A <i>fictional</i> program, that is. Time for an admin to put this puppy to bed. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see anything in the notability requirements that requires that every source be nonfiction. If a fictional show is referencing a real-life game, there's nothing wrong with us noting this reference. In fact it would make a good subsection of the article, "The circle hand game in fiction". There is absolutely nothing wrong with such a reference, you'll see that sort of thing all over Wikipedia. And you're still ignoring the WWE Tough Enough instance, which is a second reference on television. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 04:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
