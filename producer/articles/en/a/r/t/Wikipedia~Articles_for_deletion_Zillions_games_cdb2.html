<li>"probably advertising"&#160;? how do you know without researching the truth? There is no advertising in this at all, and I make no money witrh this. Please don't spread half-truths or liews without knowing what is going on, thanks. I was asked to write an article for each game by administrator Silke two. I onloy started doing this AFTER it was suggested to me by an administor. If you now want to delete them I suggest, you sit together and agree on your policies. That I document only my own games, has simple reasons like shear workload associated with it etc. I have asked other Zillions game to document their game in Wiki accordingly. Since these are many, I am not willing to document their games. I have doiscussed all that in length with admin Silke2 already, and we agreed on the important subjects.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Regarding maths: yes, some definitions have been invented by me about 20 years ago, since in the area of tilings there was no word for the property of neat and nowhere-neat tilings then.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just going to interrupt here, to point out <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuous_function_%28topology%29.html" title="Continuous function (topology)">continuous</a> tiling</i>, and its opposite, <i>dis-continuous tiling</i>. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 15:39, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But this and other definitions have meanwhile (over the last 2 decades) become used more and more amongst people who research in these and similar tilings, see Journal of Recreational mathematics. Special areas of maths have their special language; this makes it much easier to communicate.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, (with the exception maybe on the article of 'slices'), I think the documentation of everything else is well justified.</dd>
<dd>The area of tilings and puzzles has undergone quite a lot of blossoming the last two decades (maybe widely unknown to the ordinary public or even to mathematicians who do not read journals like <a href="../../../j/r/m/JRM_90b7.html" title="JRM">JRM</a>).</dd>

<dd>Karl, we are discussing both the game articles, and your edits to puzzle related articles. Wikipedia is not a place for original research, and you should certainly not be adding your own name and claimed achievements into Wikipedia.

<dd>I would also like to point out the fact that <i>recreational mathematicians</i> are <b>not</b> <i>professional mathematicians</i>. And the terminology of mathematics is generally regarded as being decided by the professional, rather than amateur, mathematicians. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a></dd>

<p>By the way, Zillions games are without violence, blood splatter, horror,etc, but thinking, intelligence games without time pressure and stress. They represent a much more healthy way to enjoy games that the point-and-shoot arcade games etc. Yes, they deserve more publication because they can help people increase their mind power and teach cids better skill than shooting well. I hope you can see these aspects and appreciate them.

<dd>Almost 100% of the edits he has made to puzzle related articles which are not explicitely about the games, are to add links to his zillions website, and introduce terms and ideas he himself (above) admits he made up (i.e. original research), into a field of mathematics that, apart from him and a small group of his (non-professional) friends, does not use them.</dd>
<dd>Apart from this, his edits are to add things such as "Karl Scherer [i.e. him] solved this maths problem on date X, with the following theorem", which is both original research, and definitely non-neutral, as well as vanity.</dd>
<dd>The articles will remain in the category for the duration of this VFD. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 20:46, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Most of the reasons given for deletion here are based on the assumption that these articles are ads for non-notable games.

Also, many of them are simply an attempt to justify adding all zillions games as links - by splitting the games up into very small categorisations, creating an article for each category, and then adding external links to the games in each article. It is a massive abuse of Wikipedia. This is why I am including them in the deletion and urge an <b>Extremely strong delete</b> (n.b. I have voted elsewhere, so this vote should not count in addition to my earlier vote). <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 07:35, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, you seem to be contradicting yourself. Here, it sounds like you're saying "delete everything listed"; below, you exclude pre-existing articles like <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tiling.html" title="Tiling">tiling</a>. So it seems vital to clarify the intent, and to ask what care has been taken to separate edits from new article creations. In any case, do we have prior history with <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">Karl Scherer</a> that suggests intentional bad behavior? He claims he was <i>asked</i> to create articles by an administrator (presumably <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a>, misspelled); is that disputed, or was it misunderstood, or what? Yes, we need a massive deletion of all the separate games articles, perhaps accompanied by a merging of the content into a single article. Yes, we need to educate the author about what's expected in Wikipedia. What I see is a somewhat misguided attempt to contribute, not a deliberate attempt to spam or to distort mathematics and games terminology — unless I hear facts to the contrary. But this proposed vote is not clearly enough limited in scope. It strikes me as excessive on the part of <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>, more of an angry rant than a reasoned response. In fact, with a little guidance Karl might happily do most of the cleanup work himself, sparing the need for this debate and vote. Otherwise, <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> seems to have it about right.

<dd>Check his talk page, you'll see our discussion, and his completely reasonable and polite responses. And -Ril-'s not-quite-so-reasonable comments. He had his games linked from one of the pages, I informed him that editors don't tolerate external links of that sort, and that they would only make sense if there was an article about them directly. I also pointed out that some people don't like to have what they deem is 'minor' information in wikipedea, and noted that he should try to put them in one big article. I doubt his intent was to advertise, only to inform people about the things he knew the most about and was most enthusiastic about. I find this whole process sad to see, it should have been handled in another way first, considering the user's positive attitude. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> 14:33, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What is really sad in reading his <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarlscherer3_33d3.html" title="User talk:Karlscherer3">talk page</a> is that he seems to have begun creating all the Zillions pages because he believes that's what you recommended! Yet, despite that, <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> launches an assault. Karl claims to have a doctorate in mathematics, which is <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> evidence that he may be a bit strange (said tongue in cheek), but <i>not</i> that he is unwilling or unable to place nicely with others. Yes, I believe adding numerous links on WP pages to one's own work shows a certain lack of professional and social awareness; it is inappropriate, disturbing, and creates a bad impression.

<dd>exactly as if the entire set of articles is designed to create enough articles to spread the games accross, so that all of them can be listed without there being a huge list of external links in any one article. <i><b>This is an appalling abuse of Wikipedia</b></i>.

<dd>(b) are articles describing friends of his, which is also original research, not NPOV, and non-notable</dd>

<dd>On top of that, many of his edits to <i>pre-existing</i> articles are to insert claims that he (i.e. Karl Scherer) has solved such-and-such a maths problem. Which is (a) not verified, (b) not NPOV, (c) original research (as it is him doing the insertion), and (d) a massive vanity edit
<dl>
<dd>This users edits over the past 2.5 years constitute nothing but these, and consequently I can see him only as a massive problem.

<dd>The indents were getting a bit deep for me, so I'm responding to <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> at the same level as my previous comment. We agree on two key points. (1) Yes, his edits look a bit egocentric. (2) The Zillions proliferation is over-the-top. We also agree that <i>if</i> he is deliberately google-bombing that is abusive and to be condemned. We <i>disagree</i> that such is the case. We also disagree, apparently, about the best means to resolve these difficulties. Read his own words on his talk page; they do not support your position that his behavior is a manifestation of evil intent. Nor can I agree that "a newbie in their first edit would know". By all means, we seem to be reaching a massive concensus that the behavior and its artifacts need correcting, so some action is called for. However, <i>at this point</i> we do not have concensus that we need an overreaching deletion to accomplish this, nor do we have consensus that the person (not the behavior) is to be attacked. Can we please first try educating the guy? After all, what kinds of social skills can we expect of someone living in a country with more sheep than humans (tongue firmly in cheek)? Also, I understand (and sympathize) that you are upset because the boor spilled red wine on your beautiful white Wikipedia carpet; but please turn down the flames, at least reserving boldface for votes. The mess can be cleaned up, and we might as well be <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civil</a> in doing it.

Yes, fine, you think this deserves a vfd. That's not his point.

<dd>Curious, how perceptions differ. The white wine suggestion made me smile. I took it as a tacit acknowledgement of my diagnosis, and a hopeful sign of a more productive tone. At the end of the day, style and personality aside, we all want a better Wikipedia. Red wine <i>is</i> a metaphor, and (at the risk of speaking for <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>) white wine might be taken as an alternative to ripping out the carpet. Is either of you two (<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlike2_a0fe.html" title="User:Slike2">Slike2</a> or <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>) experienced Wikipedians willing to guide <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">Karl</a> through the nuances of what is and is not an appropriate contribution? Shall we first give him a chance to clean up his own mess, perhaps also assisted by a targeted delete of <i>only</i> the Zillions sprawl, leaving him to back out the vanity edits? (And I use "vanity" in the Wikipedia sense, with no interpretation of user intent.)

In regards to the metaphor, I fear it's lost on me - I have no idea which action correlates with ripping out the carpet, and there seems to be no mention of "having the spiller himself clean out the carpet" (and it wouldn't seem to be red wine, because these 'stains' are really quite easy to get out). I don't know how well your suggestion would work <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarlscherer3_33d3.html#Please_note" title="User talk:Karlscherer3">at this point</a>, but asking him to clean it is worth a try, though I doubt it'll do much: he seems to have been discouraged to the point of leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Karlscherer3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Karlscherer3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, thanks to <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a>'s absolutely innapropriate behaviour (I'm not talking about the vfd).

<li>The 3rd paragraph of the 3 that introduce this VfD is <i>N.b. apart from the 40 or so listed above there are at least 104 articles of this form. This is a place to consider deletion of all of them as a collection. The list is available at Category:Alleged spam by Karl Scherer</i>. The first 4 words of the first paragraph are <i>Includes (but isn't limited)</i>, before listing 40 of the articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> N.b. the current voting state is 1 to Keep, 1 to Keep the non-game articles but delete the rest, 1 to abstain about the non-game articles, but delete the rest, and 30 to delete all the articles.
