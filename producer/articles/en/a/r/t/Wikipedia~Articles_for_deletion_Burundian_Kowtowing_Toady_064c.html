<p>Article describes a species invented for unpublished Harry Potter fanfiction.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I disagree with the deletion nomination, for obvious reasons; being the author of an article will do that. That aside, however, I'd say that it is a relevant article. I quote from what I presume is the relevant section: <i>"Original inventions. If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move, it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it."</i> The Toady emerged through hubbub on a high-traffic fanfic site, and has been published on said site in - to my knowledge - at least two independent fics by different authors, not counting my own ones. In my view, this should qualify as "secondary sources", and also rejects the "unpublished fiction" criticism. The verifiability requirement is also satisfied, as the comment threads in which the Toady is discussed are easily available on the SIYE website.<br />
I also refer you to the article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thestral.html" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a>, which is in itself an original invention, albeit by a published author. Its main use by secondary sources is, of course, in Harry Potter fanfics. The fact that there have been no moves to delete this article suggests to me that similar articles are equally permissible.<br />
Supporting evidence of fanfics and pure-fanon inventions being permitted include <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draco_Dormiens_b356.html" title="Draco Dormiens">Draco Dormiens</a> and The Tale Of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westala_and_Villtin_e0b4.html" title="Westala and Villtin">Westala and Villtin</a>.<br />
If the motion to delete is carried, I request a 48-hour delay (on grounds of imminent travel) to allow me to comment on any counter-arguments and save a backup of the article on my home computer.<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b>:Thanks for taking the time to come by and discuss this. I'm not sure that the precedents you cite are applicable in this case, in that they apply to specific works of fanfiction, rather than specific aspects of those individual works. It's also worth noting that The Very Secret Diaries (the redirect destination of Draco Dormiens) was nominated for AFD once (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Very_Secret_Diaries" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Very_Secret_Diaries" rel="nofollow">link</a>) and closed with a 50/50 keep/delete split, and that many of the keep votes did so with the claim that it represented a "notable internet meme", a claim that probably would not apply to Burundian Kowtowing Toady. It is also unlikely that individual fanfiction stories would qualify as secondary sources, in that they are not themselves independent analyses of the Burundian Kowtowing Toady, or historical/media accounts of its creation. Rather, they are additional examples of primary sources.-<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 19:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two comments on this; in what way is an article about a single fanfic more eligible than an article about a single fanfic construct being used by multiple authors in multiple fics?<br />
Secondly, as far as the other fics go, it's a bit hazy whether they're primary or secondary sources; parts have fed into the construction of the Toady, parts have featured the Toady based on its appearance in the original discussion thread, and there have even been a few meta references directly referencing its creation. Not sure if that has any bearing on it, just thought I'd fling that out there.<br />

<li>From the Fancruft page: <i>"Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are highly controversial. It is also worth noting that many articles on relatively obscure topics are featured articles. Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its deletion, but it is rarely the sole factor."</i> Article has already been acknowledged to be well-written (Colin Kimbrell, <i>"This article is well-written and formatted..."</i>), and at least two external references exist.<br />
Original research does not apply, as the article documents the creature's inception over some time, including use <i>prior to my own</i> in several fanfics.<br />

<dd>Sometimes when we get an article that's of value but not really encyclopedic, we decide to move it to a different wiki project, either affiliated with us or completely independent but with a compatible license. Dictionary definitions go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>, how-to articles go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>, non-notable webcomics go to Comixpedia, etc. This process is called transwikiing, and I was asking whether anybody knows of a wikiproject for stock fiction resources, since your article might be a good fit for such a project, if there is one. "<a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_work.html" title="Derivative work">Derivative work</a>" is a legal term, which basically just means a creative project that incorporates aspects of some other preceding project, like a hip-hop producer who uses samples in a song or a cartoonist who draws a picture of the Mona Lisa sticking her tongue out. A Harry Potter fanfiction is a derivative work, since it uses characters and settings devised by <a href="../../../j/2E/k/J.K._Rowling_a858.html" title="J.K. Rowling">J.K. Rowling</a>. I mentioned it here because a sentence in your article released the Toady for use in derivative works, and I thought that might bolster a claim for a transwiki to the hypothetical source I described earlier. It's not likely to help or hurt your case for Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:33, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
