<li><b>Comment</b> Other executives of YBF were VfDed a while ago - see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ben_Pickering_ad74.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Pickering">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Pickering</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greg_Smith_%28politician%29_1f65.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg Smith (politician)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg Smith (politician)</a>. The article does not cover these claims to be a media commentator (or established just to what extent) or why YBF is important that its executives count as notable in their own right. I agree one doesn't have to be an MP or devolved assembly member to be notable in politics but that does not in itself make everyone notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 09:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The anonymous user should look at other AfDs to see that both this is standard practice and contributers are strongly encouraged to log in to prevent sock puppetry, especially from ISPs that have made only three contributions, all on AfDs. As for vanity, I note that these objections were posted on the same day that I received an email from the subject themselves. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 09:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct. Anonymity doesn't make the rationale invalid.

<li><b>Keep</b> - these days the extra-Parliamentary coalition of conservative groups is becoming more important in preparing the Tory Party for government, much as happened in the 1970s. The YBF is a part of this and as such the people behind it are of note, not least when they are former national youth leaders and elected officials with links to figures such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Seldon_f697.html" title="Anthony Seldon">Anthony Seldon</a>.

<ul>
<li>It is not "Timrollpickering Land" and I find it telling you feel a need to resort to personal abuse. It has always been standard practice in Wikipedia when seeking a consensus to note when votes one way or the other come from users with little history, given the problems there have been with <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sockpuppets</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The failure of the delete lobby to address the valid and strong points made by the keep lobby and instead to indulge in attempts to silence it suggest a personal vendetta. Anyone might think Timrollpickering and Blaney had a history, or that Timmy's thwarted ambition colours his contributions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hannibal s (<a href="../../../h/a/n/User_talk%7EHannibal_s_7a32.html" title="User talk:Hannibal s">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hannibal_s_5b2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hannibal s">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>Note: Again comment is unsigned.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again a resort to personal abuse. To my knowledge I have never spoken to Blaney in person and probably never been in the same room as him, unless we were both at a gathering. I am merely following standard Wikipedia practice that has been followed on numerous pages seeking consensus in the past. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> trying to separate the debate on the AfD itself from all the personal abuse and lack of understanding of Wikipedia practices. For a page to exist in Wikipedia it must prove inherent notability in itself. Claims about being "a media commentator" on an AfD page are not enough - if this is relevant information and makes the subject notable, <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_Bold_2c3b.html" title="WP:Be Bold">be bold</a> and add the information to the page. In regards the role of YBF you need to prove not that the organisation is notable (that's a case for any AfD on it, for the record I would support keeping that article) but that being the executive of it confers notability on the individual. As I note above other executives have had pages created on Wikipedia and AfDed (with considerably less fuss). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am interested who is behind activist and policy groups that feed the Conservative Party, the more full disclosure of these things the better. The repeated failure of those who want to keep these things secret and delete this entry are an affront to democracy. Their insistence on playing the man and not the ball exposes the deficiency of their arguments. User:Hannibal_s</li>
<li>Note This is second vote by the same login. <s>Mea culpa - the confusion arose from an edit conflict making it difficult to check the full page. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Comment</b> First off you are repeatedly attacking me for following the Wikipedia conventions. If you want to "play the ball and not the man" then redirect your criticism of those conventions to the discussion pages on deletion policy. Secondly this is not about keeping "activist and policy groups" secret - this discussion is in no way about whether or not to delete the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Britons%27_Foundation_ecb4.html" title="Young Britons' Foundation">Young Britons' Foundation</a> page.

<dd><i>Young Britons Foundation</i>. I'd say that's notable as an organisation but not notable enough for its officers to merit separate articles.</dd>

<dd><i>London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham</i>. Former opposition councillors in London boroughs do not on those grounds merit articles in Wikipedia.</dd>
