<li><b>Keep</b> A quite useful conceptual model presented in a manner that is both lucid and witty. While the term itself may be uncommon it evokes the increasingly common position many educated people find themselves in of trying to balance sincere attempts to address orientalist critiques of the western perception of the other and a respect for the values of pluralism with a dedication to the tenets of some of the more attractive facets of liberal humanism, many of which seem to be under direct assualt by, at the very least, a loud and vocal minority in the Ummah. Frankly if this is erased it is extremely likely that at some point in the future a far more offensive entry that covers similar ground with less skill will appear.<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.132.html" title="User:152.163.100.132">152.163.100.132</a> 07:03, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If this is a neologism (which the author states it is), what makes it one any moreso than any word with "phobia" tacked onto the end (including islamophobia). If it is not, it is just as self indulgent. To legislate entries such as this is to legislate common sense, which I beleive the author has in abundance, as well as a <i>sense of humor</i>.65.96.64.93 07:10, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> yes, its a neologism, but thats the same as all emerging concepts. if being labeled an islamophobic will hinder someones ability to freely discuss an argument(and suffer an attack ad hominem), then this term correctly applies. please look at the multiple other places/articles where this term is mentioned on the internet before you ignorantly say that it does not belong here.Tesseracter 07:34, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No it wouldn't, because unlike those, Islamophobiaphobia is a real and somewhat common idea, while the others exist only in the realm of humor. Please argue on the merits of Islamophobiaphobia itself please, not on the basis of a slippery slope fallacy. Did Islamophobiaphobia exist as a term before this article? Yes it did. Was it a serious idea? Absolutely. What real basis is there to delete this article other than the fact that it appears to bother you? On the merits of the concept itself, you have failed to give anything substantive. <a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibigon_e00e.html" title="User:Bibigon">Bibigon</a> 16:18, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, "homophobiaphobiaphobia" gets many times more hits than "Islamophobiaphobia", but we certainly don't need an article on it: it's a neologism that has not come into widespread use, and not every state of mind a person can have requires a made-up name and an encyclopedia article. If you really think the concept of Islamophobiaphobia deserves a mention, and if this is not all just a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> stunt, add a paragraph to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> mentioning the new usage. No one learns anything from an article which is large find-and-replace edited from the original. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 16:30, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It could be <b>merged</b> with Islamophobia, perhaps. But I don't see a slippery slope here. There is a phobophobia AKA phobiaphobia, although wikipedia doesn't have an entry for it (fear of phobias would seem to be an inconsequential hypocondria), but not phobophobophobia. Additionally, one finds some more hits on Google when searching not on "Islamophobophobia" or "Islamophobiaphobia" or "Islamophobia-phobia", but on "fear of Islamophobia," which amounts to the same thing. Actually, results from that search indicate there could be two kinds: people afraid of being called Islamophobes, but also people afraid of being victims of Islamophobia, although this is not addressed in the WP entry (similarly, one finds a homophobiaphobia). The latter (fear of being victims of Islamophobia) seems fairly notable in that a Guardian poll indicated 2/3 of Muslims in Britain were considering leaving because of their fear of islamophobia. There's also a Times article by Mick Hume that states <i>"fear of Islamophobia today is considerably stronger than the phenomenon itself."</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 17:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is the purpose to judge the notability of the neologism, or the whole article? The article could be renamed <i>Fear of Islamophobia</i> or something similar (<i>Reactions to Islamophobia</i> was mentioned above), the <i>phenomenon</i> is of some note for the reasons I noted above even if the word isn't. However, it's something that could be merged into the Islamophobia article. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 03:15, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of those references portray not only accusations of islamophobia but the reactions, often apologetic and cautiously conciliatory, to said claims despite their hostile and sometimes inherently threatening delivery.

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge with islamophobia, since the concept is at least as legitimate and far more relevent. You could also delete both articles, since islamophobia isn't a serious concept, just a part of popular imagination, and therefore not worth fearing in the first place.</li>
