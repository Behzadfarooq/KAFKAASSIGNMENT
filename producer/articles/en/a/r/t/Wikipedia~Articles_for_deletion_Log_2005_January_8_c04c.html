<li>This article is of no real value in its original form, and can be deleted. But Damstredet is in fact an interesting little street, and I notice it is mentioned in Yahoo Travel as one 'thing to do in Oslo' <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2787470-damstredet_telthusbakken_oslo-i" class="external autonumber" title="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2787470-damstredet_telthusbakken_oslo-i" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>It looks like some life has been stirred into the article by the listing here (that often happens&#160;:) - I think there's enough there now to start being swayed in favour of a "keep" <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 09:21, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I listed for the reasons I gave. It was a substub - 13 words saying it was a street of old houses. Is Wikipedia to be a repository for 13-word articles for the 10,000,000 un-noteworthy streets of old houses on the planet? As I said in my original message, it needed one of two things done to it: expansion or deletion. I am glad it has been expanded, but if it was not, I would have had no qualms about its deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 09:36, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Being a substub about a completely un-noteworthy street should be. There was no way of saying that this was not a vanity article about someone's home street. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 04:51, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>The simplest of google searches would reveal that it's an Oslo tourist attraction.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 06:06, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it's an Oslo tourist attraction then I would expect it to be mentioned on the Oslo page. If it's worth an article, I would have expected an article to have been written. It obviously wasn't a big enough tourist attraction to have been dealt with on the Oslo page, so it certainly wasn't a big enough attraction for its own page. As the fact that there was a substub there made clear. The vfd page is meant to clear up such points. Preferably in a manner where the <i>articles</i> are discussed, and not whether you think a Wikipedian has done the right thing by even sugggesting a page should be looked at. If you want to complain about someone's actions, then do it on their user talk page, not here. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 22:54, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the debate is public, not personal. If you thought it should have been included in the Oslo article, you could merge it and redirect without requiring it to be deleted. That you say "if it's an Oslo tourist attraction..." implies that you didn't bother finding out, and simply asked for it to be deleted because you personally have not heard of it. I want to discourage editors from doing that, not just you, so why would I bring it up on your talkpage and not here? The VfD is supposed to be for editors to ask whether articles should be deleted and to form a consensus. Consensus involves discussion. If you don't want your listings discussed, don't make them. If the article really does require deleting, someone who doesn't mind discussion will do the nominating at some point. We're not short of would-be deleters. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 01:33, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>If you thought it should have been included in the Oslo article, you could merge it</i> - I didn't know whether it should have been, or whether it should have just been deleted. It <i>looked</i> like it should have been deleted. That's why I listed it here, which is the correct place to list it under those circumstances. Look, I'm as happy to allow tiny articles here as the next guy - I've voted "KeeP' on enough vfd candidates in my time. But I don't see the point of keeping an article which basically says "Damstredet is a street". I had no idea whether it was worth keeping as part of an article or as a separate article, but the evidence I suggested that it was not. I am very glad to see that I was wrong.

<p>I am the author and read the policies on auto biographies and such. Being a musician would also not categorize this as vanity. However in time my accomplishments in the field of liturgical music incorporating electronic music and MIDI may be notable so I'll leave a biography of myself to someone else if and when that may happen. The article can be deleted. Thank you.</p>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was delete with an option to transwiki somewhere.</p>
<p>After reviewing the article and the associated images, I started to question whether this would fit in the mandate for Wikibooks. I also started to ask if the images are copyrighted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I did a little research. It seems this thing is genuinely being developed/funded/something by the American Cancer Society (see <a href="http://www.cancer.org/c-tools" class="external free" title="http://www.cancer.org/c-tools" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/c-tools</a> ) which is a pretty decent credential IMHO. I'd imagine this article will stay low-key until the software is released, at which point it will be expanded. And it's supposed to be out fairly soon. Not sure whether it's freeware: several sources claim it is, but cancer.org shows a retail-box-type graphic. Either way, notable enough for me. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Starblind</a> 02:09, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I have a question for those voting Keep: How can nonexistant software be notable? According to the article, this software has not even been released yet. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:07, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair question. Several points of rebuttal: It's coming very soon--Q1 2005, which we're in right now--if it had been 2007 or 2008 my vote may have been different. Also, the support of the ACS adds a lot of credibility. This isn't a freeware game made by some kid. Finally, being in development is not a reason for exclusion as far as I can see: we have extensive articles for <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Longhorn_bfdd.html" title="Windows Longhorn">Windows Longhorn</a> and even <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>... hell, there's even a page for <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Blackcomb_0bc3.html" title="Windows Blackcomb">Windows Blackcomb</a>, not due until 2012!! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Starblind</a> 23:24, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that's a good point. Before voting <b>keep</b>, I checked that the software was under Beta test. <a href="http://www.medpda.net/archives/001088.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medpda.net/archives/001088.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://discuss.treocentral.com/archive/index.php/t-54812.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://discuss.treocentral.com/archive/index.php/t-54812.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. By my personal standards, ACS is a reputable organization and if they say they're running betas I take their word for it. Your mileage, as they say, may vary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:54, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Hello I am the author of this entry. I have to admit that as a noob to wikipedia I didn't realize that I should of complete the whole entry at one time. If you visit our Web site you will see that it is a real project and that we just finished the Beta Test today of both the Palm and Pocket PC versions. Anyway if you choose to remove this as not being complete I will understand and post it again when I can site down and make a good go of it. Hopefully I will also be updating the American Cancer Society, Great American Smokeout and other ACS releasted articles soon.

<p>So does this vote open the door for articles on any and all vaporware? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:40, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure I understand why you'd consider this vaporware. Based on every definition I've ever seen, 'vaporware' is software that's been announced or hyped but isn't actually in serious production (usually with the implication that it never will be). This already has a working beta, and therefore isn't vaporware. Even the most cynical among us would have to admit that this has a better chance of being released than <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>, and that has an article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Starblind</a> 18:00, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This software has not been released. Unless you're a fortune teller and can say for certain that it WILL be released, it's vaporware. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:52, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see what the problem is with the software not yet being released, since it's been in beta test, which means some actual ordinary target users are running actual copies of this software on their palmtops as we speak. If I were looking for a precedent for articles on vaporware, I'd go for software packages that are no more than names, such as <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Blackcomb_0bc3.html" title="Windows Blackcomb">Windows Blackcomb</a>.

<p>Given the voting log's presence in this particular section, I will assume that voting has closed for this article - but I would have voted for <b>delete.</b> Is it Wiki policy that all software products deserve an article or is there a defined standard as to which should be included and which should not?

<dd>There are no fixed standards. In general items that are verifiable may tend to be hard to delete, unless they appear to be useless.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm no listophobe, but this is too much. There is no one measure of terms like "liberal" or "conservative," and no way of really determining what city belongs on this list or List of conservative cities (also on VfD). I've talked to people who consider Berkeley a <i>conservative</i> city because it tends to be "business friendly" in many ways.

<dd>I totally fail to understand what your comments are about. The procedure is well documented. "Votes" is well understood to be a misnomer. At the expiration of five days, a sysop, any sysop, may choose to act on the discussion. That sysop eyeballs the discussion and judges whether a rough consensus to delete exists. The sysop may make that judgement in any way, including counting votes, ignoring votes that he or she believes are invalid, or whatever. In addition, there is a well established <i>guideline</i> that in general, under most circumstances, less than a 2/3 vote to delete should not be considered consensus. It's a judgement. It's analogous to the legal system, not to a parliamentary procedure. All sounds "simple" enough to me.

<li>Ok, the policy might not be perfect, but this is hardly the way to improve it. Your theory about requiring a certain percentage of the voting population to validate VfD votes is suspect at best, and this sort of thing isn't likely to win you any supporters.
