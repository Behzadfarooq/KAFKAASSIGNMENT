The editors there made no effort whatsoever to actually cite any sources when asked for them, despite being shown by example what to do, but instead continued to argue in the very same way the you have been here.

If you would like information on the game "to stay online to share it's fun to the world," then I recommend you register for free web hosting and create a website somewhere. In my opinion, it's much easier than going through the trouble you and your friends went through today. No one will argue with you. Do you think that this website provides free webhosting? No, it doesn't. Content here, of course, has to follow the rules here. Consider this, if you had a website and then one day a group of people deface pages and add pages and insert inappropriate information on it, how would you feel, what would you do?

<li><b>keep</b>- What harm is this page causing to you who do not wish to learn about the walking game? Compare that with the benefit it is giving thousands of youth that do wish to learn about this popular game. So why would you erase a page that does not harm you but strongly benefits others? Is wikipedias purpose not to benefit and teach? Well I feel that this page contributes to that goal of Wikipedia and therefore it should be valued and kept.

<li>Excuse me. I have plenty of reasons to keep this page: this is a real game that is played on the streets. It does exist. This is what urban youth does.

<li><b>I sincerely apologize. I was wrong… I was wrong for having faith in the goodness of humanity. I was wrong to think that the organization of Wikipedia would let a few kids who were given nothing trying to make something of themselves succeed. About 10 kids from across the world tried to bring some structure to a relevant and ever-present game and were shunned ruthelessly by you all. Forgive me for thinking that an innocent and genuine article would be allowed to exist in a system that claims to value “free speech” and “equality”. If it satisfies your hunger for power then take our article away from your site, but just know that you have needlessly crushed our innocent dream. This article that failed to meet your superficial standards despite its service and benefit to thousands of kids apparently has no place in our society.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have seen this game being played in Scarborough, a locale within Toronto. It is clearly not very well-known, but I expect it to gain popularity. There are plenty of other games, activities, etc. that are played widely, but have never been mentioned in essay, article, TV broadcast, etc. And mostly, it has a very neat fringe appeal. So while the case for the game's veracity is hard to make, the opposing argument is equally difficult to posit. I say let it ride out. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShagmaestro_d684.html" title="User:Shagmaestro">Stephen Job</a> 17:55, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was pleasantly surprised to hear about this game being on Wikipedia when a friend stumbled across it. An article on the game was published in our school newspaper last month, which is when I originally learned about it. This game does seem to be gaining popularity and the article seems to me to be legitimate. The "Helsinki incident", mentioned in the article, was also mentioned in my school newspaper's report. I'll see if I can get a scan of it to help verify the article. Essentially this is one of those games that flies completely under the radar. I expect that pretty soon we could see some reports on the game on more mainstream media. Watch for it on your local news sometime soon. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.221.81.98.html" title="User:216.221.81.98">216.221.81.98</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.221.81.98.html" title="User talk:216.221.81.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.221.81.98_ea2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.221.81.98">contribs</a>).</small></li>
