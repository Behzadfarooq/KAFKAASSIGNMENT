<li><b>Keep</b> For two reasons. Firstly, as a Eurovision Song Contest entry it has clearly won some form of national contest. Exactly what sort of contest I can't be sure offhand, but some kind at the very least (see the archived debate linked from <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Bist_bd35.html" title="Du Bist">Du Bist</a> for this sort of an argument). Further, as it was the first time the Cypriot ESC entry was not in Greek and the first time that English had been performed, this makes it a significant point in terms of Cypriot ESC participation as well as a point in the progression towards the largely monoglot English Contest of today. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As per BigHaz: it is a song which represented a whole nation in an international competition, and was voted for by a significant section of that population in order to represent them. It went on to be seen by hundreds of millions of viewers in one of the world's longest-running television shows. There are many other articles about "XXX (song)" - so songs clearly have their place on Wikipedia. This is a <i>very</i> notable example of a song. As for a disambig... well there wasn't one already created, so not too many people have been confused. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 15:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if there's fear of confusion, I would be behind it being renamed as "Gimme (song)" or "Gimme (Eurovision song)". It just happened to be a pagename that wasn't taken when the article was created and which covered the subject matter well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would compare this to American Idol, which I would say every contestant isn't notable enough on their own to warrant their own page, but they each do currently. However, the Eurovision has many more contestants, doesn't link to the songs, but does link to the artists. Why wouldn't the artist's page be sufficient? Gimme is not currently linked to by <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2002_6cbb.html" title="Eurovision Song Contest 2002">Eurovision Song Contest 2002</a> nor <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_%28band%29.html" title="One (band)">One (band)</a>. Also, the 2005 Cyprus Eurovision entry by a former member of the band doesn't have an entry. How many songs that were entered into Eurovision have their own entry? Neither of the ties for 3rd place of Eurovision 2002 have their own entry either, and this song placed 6th. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 05:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To address the points in the order in which they were raised: I'm not totally cognisant of the debates regarding the notability or otherwise of Idol contestants, however I'd be tempted to argue that if each contestant does currently have their own page, they're notable enough to warrant same. Regardless, as the ESC is larger than that (broadcast throughout the world for starters), I'm not sure that it's the most useful analogy. The song is not currently linked to from either of the pages you've named due (in the case of the band) to my own laziness in not linking it and (in the case of the Contest page for that year) a conscious decision to link the Contest pages to the songs <i>en masse</i> rather than piecemeal (i.e. once all the songs for the 2002 Contest, or as many as don't get AfD'd, have entries, then the page will be updated to link accordingly). In regard to the number of ESC entries with their own pages, a quick check of the the relevant category tells me that there are 273 (275 entries in the category less one song not performed and one separate entry for the Swedish version of "Waterloo"). In regard to the songs at that particular Contest, there are currently 8 entries with their own article - including this one. One of them (<a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_Away_%28Eurovision_song%29_74d2.html" title="Run Away (Eurovision song)">Run Away</a>, or "Runaway") being a tied-for-third entry. As I said earlier, the lack of links is due to a combination of laziness and it not having seemed like a good idea at the time. I'll happily put the relevant links in if that's what's required here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:12, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Further, in relation to the claims regarding the 2005 entry (which I missed earlier), I would direct the nominator to the article <a href="../../../e/l/a/Ela_Ela_%28Come_Baby%29_ba9b.html" title="Ela Ela (Come Baby)">Ela Ela (Come Baby)</a>. I was unaware (I'm not as well-up on Cypriot pop music as I'd like to be, this isn't a laziness thing) that the singer there was a former member of the band, but will update the relevant articles in accordance with the information. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But it isn't broadcast in America to my knowledge... Dunno about China. What makes you think it is broadcast outside the EU?<a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 20:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm reasonably sure that I've heard about it being broadcast in the States (certainly there are plans afoot for an American version thereof, designed as a competitor to Idol). I know it's broadcast outside the EU because I live in Australia and watch it every year. Further, it's broadcast in countries like Armenia [who compete], Georgia and Azerbaijan (none of whom are EU members). I'm also aware of a broadcast in Canada. That said, even if it's only broadcast in the EU, that's still at least a comparable potential audience to American Idol. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:42, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It has nothing to do with the EU whatsoever. It is broadcast by full and associate members of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Broadcasting_Union_5408.html" title="European Broadcasting Union">European Broadcasting Union</a>. Full members lie within the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Broadcasting_Area_352a.html" title="European Broadcasting Area">European Broadcasting Area</a> (which has <i>nothing</i> to do with the EU, and is only loosely based on geographic Europe), and associate members may be any around the world. The Contest is broadcast in Australia and Japan - and has been shown also in Canada. It is not shown in the USA because no American TV company is an EBU member. Hope that's cleared that up for you&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 02:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It has won a major national song competition that would have been on television, and most likely the song sold a pile of records.
