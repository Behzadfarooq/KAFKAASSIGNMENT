<li><b>Strongly Delete</b>. This article is nothing more than a way to imply notible figures in history were infected with STDs. When information is factually verifiable, write such an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see a bunch of references and medical conditions of famous figures, Napoleon being an example that springs to mind, are frequently discussed by serious historians (see Hayden's book on historical syphilis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465028810/002-8956940-2924812?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465028810/002-8956940-2924812?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Often, there is a fair bit of evidence, which combined with modern techniques (DNA testing), goes well beyond simple speculation. While this list needs more footnoting, there is no reason to remove it. Also, to state that speculation has no place on wikipedia is a bit of a joke given that we have hundreds of articles on conspiracy theories or other oddities such as <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Sightings_82ba.html" title="Elvis Sightings">Elvis Sightings</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> because some of these were known to have been syphilitic, so to describe it as speculation is false; the arbitray selection of syphilis is questionable (why not flu?), the text is self-referential in places.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's statements like this, which make me wonder if people are really familiar with the issues involved and our bigraphical coverage of the individuals on this list. Taking a random selection, I find direct discussions or speculation of possible syphilitic infection in our bios of <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin.html" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idi_Amin_4bbc.html" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capone_36a3.html" title="Al Capone">Al Capone</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hughes_c1be.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Joplin_b29a.html" title="Scott Joplin">Scott Joplin</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , to name just a few. Are people really suggesting that we delete this list, and then excise any discussion of possible causes of death from our bio pages? Are people really suggesting that we eliminate discussion of syphilis as a possible explanation of the irrational behavior of a Van Gogh or Idi Amin, even when major historians openly discuss the historical evidence in biographies and other scholarly works? Are people really arguing that we eliminate any discussion of medical conditions unless medical records have been released into the public domain? If so, I think there is a very serious misreading at work here of how historical scholarship works and the meaning and intent of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:59, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>In each of those articles, there are editors familiar with the subject, who will actively challenge any bogus information. However, bio editors are generally unaware of a person being on a list like this. Lists like this often have editors who like to add as many people as possible, and get little scrutiny. You would help your cause if you explained what the minimum criteria for the list is. Is any published rumor sufficient (how about tabloids)? Also, we do have to consider Wikipedia's history with lists like this. They simply aren't maintained properly, and people will inevitable add inappropriate names (hard to stop, if you don't define what's inappropriate). Only lists with absolutely clear criteria can be maintained properly. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Yes, I see your point, but those seem fairly unconvincing arguments for deletion and relate more to editing problems than the underlying validity of the concept. They also join with what I said above about the list requiring more footnotes, which is how we have dealt with the problem on numerous other lists. However, to a very great extent this list was compiled directly from the bio pages. Your issue with the tabloids is not very applicable in this context, because tabloids do not pick up these types of stories unless someone has just published a book or released new evidence- and even then the coverage would be marginal because Edgar Allen Poe is not Paris Hilton. It seems that you are more concerned with some ill defined risk factor a la Siegenthaler. Considering that everyone on this list is dead, most for a very long time, I think the risk is lessened. I also think that the list at present is fairly well maintained. It is relatively short, despite having been spun out from <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">Syphilis</a> almost two years ago, and while there are a few names I would question, I don't see it spinning out of control in the near future. In my view, it needs a minor rethink and direct sourcing of every component (rather than the general references at present) not deletion.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I should not have said "tabloid". I should have said "tabloid level" writers. The only *true* expert opinion of the article is "<i>Hayden was not competent to make the judgments that she tried to make.</i>" Every name on the list (except Hitler) relies on discredited source (I admit more sources are easily available for some). As you say, the article's been around a long time. So, I doubt this will be fixed soon. I think we both agree proper detailed citations are appropriate. But, where we disagree, is I think they are needed when such information is added, and may be removed when it lacks it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>:Calling Hayden a "tabloid level" writer is way, way too harsh. An enormous amount of research went into her book, the reviews were largely positive and she is a university lecturer on the topic. She has been criticized because she is not a medical Dr, but that by no means makes her a discredited source. Very few historians working on the history of medecine are Doctors. In any case, you should note that many of the bio articles either lack sources or do not source information on medical conditions. However, I don't believe it would be particularly difficult to add references for many of the names on the list without relying on Hayden at all. Despite what most people think, lists often end up far more bulletproof in terms of verification than the standard bio or other articles. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If she got good reviews, from experts, those should have been in article's "Background" section. Better yet, an article should have been made on her and/or the book. In fact such an article would be quite interesting, and could even name of few of the more famous cases (that others have said similiar things on). Such a bio article would be quite useful, as a NPOV discussion of her approach (citing favorable and unfavorable reviews). It would actually be more useful than this list article. Also, you're quite right that many bio articles put medical problems of people without references. The solution is to remove the unsourced information. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:42, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't let me stop you from starting new articles. An article on Hayden would be good, but the list is not about Hayden and she did not invent scholarship in this area. Also if you think that the solution is to remove unsourced information, there are thousands of articles on major figures that you can start blanking. I would suggest, though, that you begin with the unreferenced tag. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is somethig fundamentally broken about an article which gives equal apparent weight to known cases and cases speculated by a single author. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - if we want to be picky, all of history is speculation. However, as long as Wikipedia doesn't do the speculation itself, it's fine.

<li>Yes, seems to be speculation <i>in a single source</i> some of which are proven syphilitics. A mess, in other words. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:42, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, but the article could be improved with better sourcing; here we've got one source and a peer review. There are others out there; more than one historian has wondered about the likes of Henry VIII. In that case, <b>rename</b> it to List of syphilitics, with the "widely thought to be" ones noted instead, and those that can't be better sourced omitted. (BTW, that was a generic "you" in my initial vote, not meant as a reference to your vote, Guy. I don't want to look like I'm finding fault with your reasoning, which was certainly not my intention, so I've changed it to "we".) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 23:18, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> we'll have People speculated to have been Shirley MacLaine in a prior life, People speculated to have voted for George Bush, People speculated to have enjoyed their martinis stirred not shaken, People speculated to be space aliens.. Or more seriously (perhaps)....People speculated to have been gay, People speculated to have been born out of wedlock, People speculated to have had plastic surgery, which are all fair game if this stays and Wikipedia isn't doing the speculating.... <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:26, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
