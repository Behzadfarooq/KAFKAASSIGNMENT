<li><b>Strong keep</b> - <i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources.</i>This band has traveled all over Europe and the United States. They are a very notable <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crust_punk.html" title="Crust punk">crust punk</a> band. This is another case of a Wikipedian trying to delete a topic they have no knowledge of, when it's readily available. Did any of you check to see if the band had an official website? I did, and saw that info from the article was cut-and-paste from it (I removed it).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Article is unbias and is a signed band <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Weak Keep:</b> I've heard of them and I'm not a huge crust fan, so they are at least partially notable. The problem (on wikipedia at least) for them, and many other punk bands is that there is a lot of distrust and scorn for the mainstream music industry, so the vast majority of punk bands (including many that are quite notable within the punk scene) are completely off the radar of major music magazines and comentary. This causes huge problems for verifying notability within articles. Crust punk is especially prone to this, since there is absolutely no mainstream popularity for the genre. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm inclined to think this is worth keeping. The low google result is due to the fact that most articles about him were written in Hindi. Cricket is enormous in India, and when players got injured in the build up to tournaments, he would get quoted frequently. Further, articles about him note that Leipus had a great impact on the team, its fitness, and level of play. Leipus isn't any old phsyio, he's a physio who changed much of the thinking behind the Indian cricket team. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 01:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Getting quoted frequently in the media as an expert would seem to me to pass the more notable than the average college professor test, and 11,400 google hits seems to pass the google test.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Those voting delete may not completely understand the significance of Leipus' tenure as physio, during which time he oversaw acomplete transformation in the degree of fitness expected of a member o the Indian national team. This has in many ways revolutionised the way the team plays, as well as being partly reflected in its changed ranking in the world. Simply put, he's a notable person, was extremely visible for the period when he was with the national team, and emminently encyclopaedic. Note he is <i>no longer with the team, so it does not make sufficient sense to merge</i> him into the team page. In any case, I strongly expect that as more India- and cricket-related articles are created, someone will attempt to recreate this in the not-so distant future. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 18:18, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, the above comment was mine (BertrandJP90)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think a very good point somebody raised on one of the other AFDs is that a separate list of remixes presents little context for the reader. They'd have to visit the song articles to see which of these remixes are significant (and not all of them are), and really only somebody very familiar with Madonna's discography would make immediate sense of it. So it would be more useful to include info on and discuss a song's remixes in an article for the song. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 20:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> states that Wikipedia articles are not "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics". Wikia has wikis on lots of different topics, and they allow a higher level of detail than would be appropriate in an encyclopedia. I think a useful compromise for other readers would be to list and discuss the most notable remixes in the song articles rather than a context-less list. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 14:02, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Whoa! This is tricky stuff. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freecycle_Network_7d17.html" title="Freecycle Network">Freecycle Network</a> has and deserves an article. AFAIK it doesn't have or need much in the way of a central <i>website.</i> It is basically a meme that self-propagates through people setting up Yahoo Groups, using a suggested set of boilerplate rules. I'm completely baffled as to what the relationship is between FreeCycleAmerica/FreeCycleEarth and Freecycle Network. That needs to be clarified. If it's a non-notable little group using a similar name, then it should be deleted. If it's a splinter group from Freecycle Network, it should redirect to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freecycle_Network_7d17.html" title="Freecycle Network">Freecycle Network</a> and a line or two about them should be added to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freecycle_Network_7d17.html" title="Freecycle Network">Freecycle Network</a>.

It's a Good Thing... although I must say it's a little bit freaky to give your name/address/phone to total strangers so they can drive to your house and pick up stuff. P. P. S.

<li><b>Comment</b> - What is the point of having a list of all the record labels if they arent going to have functional links?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, when I search The Warriors + Beyond the Noise I get a few reviews, unfortunatly they are all either negative or neutral. The reviewers believe they have created this music for hardcore kids to start fights at shows. While that may not appeal to many people I still think that band is notable to keep.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - History is something I see on Wikipedia all the time. Why discriminate what kind of history we're looking at? That's ridiculous. Pissy people who don't like the way the page was written simply need to add their own little piece, or talk to the people who DID make it and talk to thema bout it. You people who want to delete it are people who think you matter more than you really do. Just because it's new doesn't mean you have ANY right to try and squash it down.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not a page about webforums, but instead describes the broad collection of sites and other mediums that the Zelda fan community exists in.

I admit the article is rather new and underdeveloped, but that is no reason for deletion, but instead renovation. There is currently some dialogue within the talk page to figure out what needs to be done. If you guys feel the article contains certain violations, such as linkspam, those can be dealt with for sure, but the article itself serves a legitimate purpose. --Major Organ 04:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I never stated it was a <i>list</i> of sites, but rather the history of an expansive community (or will be). As stated elsewhere, we're discussing how to rework the article in order to include notable events and moments in the history of the community instead of giving a summary of large sites to decrease the chance of spam. I also believe it is a notable enough community to pass the "indiscriminate collection of information" test. There are multiple Star Wars fan articles, and Zelda is notable enough for atleast a general overview. We will try and work on making it more encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> Somebody used the Wikipedia is not a keeper of indiscriminate information argument. I read it over, and nowhere does it say "history" is unacceptable. I find that argument rather weak as the own definition does not specifically say "history". Just to point out - a hoax about a fake video game The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga has survived a AfD, and I swear that has less relevance than the history of one of the biggest fan communities on the internet. It is obvious the people voting for deletion are 1) Biased against this article because they are non-fans or 2)Believe fan works have absolutely no merit in the referential realm to warrant an entry in this site. There is an extensive history of Star Wars fan culture page, even more specific down to categories of works. The Legend of Zelda fan community is a phenomenom and a pop-culture icon status, not just a blantant advertising article which has no profound meaning. I concede the current version is not very reflective of that, but if this article was given more time to develop into something better, I believe the article would have better standing on this site. Sometimes I feel Wiki is more of an <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligarchy.html" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> because there seems to be a faction who decides what stays and what goes, especially in the Zelda articles, and it baffles me as to the logic sometimes. Not to be too self-righteous and full of myself, but how the hell did a Zelda hoax The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga remain and the article somebody made for GANNON-BANNED was deleted? The latter has more impact and presence and importance in the realm of Zelda than the hoax. Sorry to go off on a tangent, but I feel part of these AfD are personal grudges against me, whic is totally unprofessional and crap. Again, my argument - I do not get how the history of one of the biggest fan communities, not just any community, does not count as suitable material for this site. We can provide original research without a POV, and we can provide published citations from credible sources if you give us time. You are judging this article on its infancy, when the future version will turn out to meet Wiki's standards. But you are resolving this article to a Catch 22 - there is no way it can start off perfect and totally conforming to Wiki's standards - it needs time to get to that point. I never got the AfD after such a short time. Wiki's guidelines need to be ammended to either have AfSP, or AfD after a timeframe of significance to allow the article suitable time to develop into a proper Wiki article. But I'm sure this will get deleted. Perhaps it will be put at a more deserving place than Wiki. --TSA 17:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> if this does get deleted, perhaps <a href="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Zeldawiki</a> would welcome your contributions TSA. You could always transwiki this over there before the close of AfD if you are concerned this is going to be deleted from Wikipedia. As for The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga, I'm not familiar enough with this particular case, but I know in some instances, hoaxes have been kept because they were so pervasive that they become notable simply for being a hoax. Again, I don't know enough about the specifics of The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga to say if this was the reasoing for keep opinions on that particular AfD. That article could use a rewrite though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, and <b>move</b> to a better title. A well-documented and detailed discussion of Zelda fan sites on the web is a notable topic worthy of inclusion, as quite a few of them have been notable in their own right, pulling in millions of hits, as well as their interaction. They were more important and centralized in the earlier days and are an interesting aspect of the early web. Finally, no one around is more qualified to document this stuff than TSA. I don't agree with everything TSA says, here or elsewhere, but I think this is an important topic. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 17:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Amending my comments: TSA didn't actually do most of the writing in this article, didn't mean to convey that, but he does review it regularly. Also, I think this article is a great place to merge articles about Zelda websites that aren't notable enough on their own. I'd suggest "merge into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">The Legend of Zelda series</a>", but it's just too large a topic for adequate coverage in the space of that page. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 17:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Just because an article needs to be cleaned up is no reason to delete it. I may be the minority here, but if we have such an expansive Wiki section on trivial Star Wars characters and Warcraft slogans, it seems we can include state capitol journalists. If the article needs to be cleaned up, then please instruct the article's originator, CountVonBob, on how best to do so.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> ---Has anyone here, other than myself, read the book? I found it on Google Books (is that a credible source?). The book seems to be garnering alot of attention since it's release only a month ago. Do all IUniverse books make it on to Google Books? Don't know the answer. Maybe some time should pass before this deletion decision is made. To me, Wikipedia is a forward-looking dictionary, antcipating new ideas/books/events. It seems logical to keep something garnering interest (the book is all over the internet and Google Books and other sites, not too mention the 10-15 members who created this site). At the least, delay deletion until more facts can be gathered. The ISBN # is accurate. I don't know about LOC #. Also, the poorly attributed material (Amazon ban, who knows if it's true but there is a link on Google Books that no longer works) and the Craigslist Review (have been removed). Now that I think about it, change my vote from "Strong keep" to "Keep until more details are developed". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Reader5372 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Reader5372_f4e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Reader5372">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Who are these fact-checkers?</b> - Just ran the Google Books search (put in IUniverse to GOOGLE BOOKS), 219,000 pages came up BUT only the first 9 pages (about 90+ books) were IUniverse. The rest had the words "Universe" and "I" in the same sentence (not the publisher). Also some just had the word "Universe". Not published by IUniverse. So if there's 10,000+ books on IUniverse and only 90 are in Google Books, maybe that is notable.

<li><b>Criteria (as per WP guideline):"Nonetheless there is no dictum against any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable. Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to on-line or press-published reviews of the book. Usually, books with an ISBN-number and/or availability in a couple dozen of libraries and/or a Project Gutenberg type website, and with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify."</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Does this book satisfy said criteria?</p>
<p>1st test - 'reasonably spread' - (Satisfied) Put it in Google and found over 10 pages (100+ sites mentioning it)</p>
<p>2nd test - 'several libraries or bookshops or no-subscription website' - (Satisfied) We already have a website (IUniverse - free previews), Google Books (free chapter previews) and Library of Congress (and more in google search).</p>
<p>3rd test - 'easily consult book' - (Satisfied) Again, chapter available on Iuniverse (free site), and Google Books (free site).</p>
<p>4th test - 'on-line reviews' - (Satisfied) as stated earlier in Svhoong and on other sites.</p>
<p>5th test - 'must have ISBN #' - (satisfied) No debate here.</p>
<p>6th test - 'availability' - See above on all sites listed.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The evidence being used in support of this book having an article is very weak, and the guideline being cited by the supporters probably needs to be tightened. Having an ISBN is not a sign of notability for a book, just that the author/publisher paid the small fee to secure such a number. (I don't blame the supporters for citing that, but it should be irrelevant.) The fact that the author/publisher have chosen to make free previews available on the publisher's web site and Google Books does not indicate notability. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> doesn't have a preview on Google Books, and America Deceived does, but that has everything to do with the permissions granted by the respective author/publishers and nothing to do with their relative notability. Nor is having a copyright registration a sign of notability, and no evidence has yet been provided that any library keeps this book in its collection. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 14:13, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the above claim that criteria are met is, to say the least, unconvincing. The first test seems to be the number of ghits. I'm not sure this is not a typo but saying that 10 ghits is a sign of notability is, ahem, weak. The 2nd and 3rd point claim that the book is in several libraries and easy to consult which is <b>factually wrong</b>: the IUniverse and Google Books only have excerpts available and the Library of Congress does not have the book as several people have already explained. The 4th and 6th test concerns reviews but there is no indication that any of these reviews have appeared in any source of a reasonnable credibility. Schvoong? Come on... The 5th test is indeed passed but this simply should not be a criterion as Metropolitan90 has pointed out. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 15:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<ol>
<li>No, I have not read the book, but the discussion should be about the assertion that Homeland Security is violating the 1st Amendment by caging protestors and forcing book outlets to stop stocking ("America Deceived" by E.A. Blayre III).</li>
<li>Iuniverse is a subsidiary of Barnes and Noble.</li>
<li>The very fact that a discussion of this nature is a recordable piece of contemporary American history should be posted.</li>
<li>It does not take a crystal ball to see where jailing dissenters, false flag scenaria and the erosion of civil liberties lead to - book banning for starters. History tells us quite clearly that there are progressive steps on the path America seems to be taking.</li>

<dd>I just cleaned up about two dozen vandalisms associated with this fellow (see my edit history as of now); these were the ones that others had missed. Very curious sockpuppetry: identical text added on same day by a large number of IP addresses, no IP address editing more than two articles. These were primarily to articles in physics, but also a few biographies and national parks. No, not trying to make a point, but if you look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Physics_a4a8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics</a>, both the current discusions and the archives, you will note that instead of talking about physics, this project spends most of its energy beating away pseudoscientific cranks. There's something wrong about that. WP is a magnet for cranks. I'd like to see some less labor-intensive process for keeping this stuff out. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 13:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I'll bite. Some may find her current notability enough while others won't. That's up to you. There certainly are differences between the two presently; a movie is being made about him, etc. But you want us to compare in the past. Without studying that article's past history, and going with the idea that there was a point in time when he was at the same point in his notability status as she is now, <i>at that point in time</i> I would have voted similarly. We can't look at a person's future for notability in the present, nor should we base our decisions on conjecture, and it is of no moment if 20/20 hindsight shows that if a deleted article was kept, if only we had had our prognostication hats on, it would have been the "correct" action. This is why we have a policy against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" class="extiw" title="wikipediawikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not">crystalballism</a>. If, in the future, she becomes more notable, then that future article will get a keep vote from me. Or if someone points out more <i>current</i> bases of notability here, I might change my decision. This is by no means an easy delete decision.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 07:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In this case, "award winning" is not a synonym for "dubious notability." It simply means what it says: award winning.

A number of other programmers have also elected to program my games over the years of their own volition and at their own expense including Richard Rognlie of Gamerz.net, and Mark Okun of SetupGroup.com. All of their work can be easily located and verified. Innumerable articles, commentaries, and reviews on my games have been written in a number of languages including English, German, and Italian. The slightest investigative effort will produce prodigious evidence that I am in fact a world renowned game inventor.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Mark Steere article promotes my notoriety. Every sentence in the article is a simple statement of a well known fact. There are hundreds of relevant links relating to “Mark Steere” and all of my games in every search engine. There are no links in the Mark Steere article whatsoever. Every effort was made on the part of Pearl McPurry, the author of the Mark Steere article, to comply with the standards of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I understand the detractors’ desire to protect the integrity of Wikipedia. But in my case I am clearly notable (with regard to game inventing), verifiable, and non-self promoting. If the Mark Steere article does actually violate any of the Wikipedia standards, please let me know, and I will make an immediate correction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MarkSteere (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSteere_3e33.html" title="User talk:MarkSteere">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MarkSteere_c547.html" title="Special:Contributions/MarkSteere">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>All of the sources cited in the Mark Steere article as well as here in the deletion article are credible, neutral, and independent. I have read the entire Vain article very carefully and cannot find any indication of even the slightest infraction of any Wikipedia policies therein. Likewise the Mark Steere article satisfies the very first listed requirement in the Bio/Notability article - “a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.” I am also a “published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work.”</p>
<p>There have been two citings of “Bio” and three citings of “Vain” by four enthusiastic members of the Wikipedia police club, yet none of them offers specific suggestions of how the Mark Steere article violates either the Bio or the Vain policies. A very thorough review of both the Bio and Vain policies only confirms that the Mark Steere article goes beyond the call of duty in complying with both.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> can you source the statement "published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work..."? You make a stronger case if you provide evidence. Also, what exactly in the article constitutes "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..."? The awards from Mensa and Parent's Choice? Beyond that, calling editors who have rendered opinions you disagree with "four enthusiastic members of the Wikipedia police club" is rather un-<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and personally speaking it doesn't really make me want to go out of my way to reconsider my opinion.

<li><b>A Comment from Europe</b> Mark Steere is a very important game inventor. The reviews of his games at BoardGameGeek were viewed hundred, if not thousands of times, thus mirroring his reputation in the gaming community. Most of his games can be played online. I would, however, recommend to make the article a little bit more neutral (the photo should be much smaller) and to add some information such as his date of birth, his profession, links &amp; references and so on. BTW, I'm not a "sockpuppet", but Ralf Gering, the author of many articles published in the Canadian Abstract Games Magazine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Rebuttal</b> First, thank you Ralf for your kind support. Isotope23, by “Wikipedia police” I was referring to the knee jerk group pounce on the latest biographical article, accompanied by rallying cries of “Vain” and “Bio.” Sure, I’d be happy to provide sources. But don’t you think that as the wielder of accusations that you bear some responsibility for citing specific instances of exactly *how* the rules were violated? Don’t you think you should research your own allegations and provide some sort of foundation? I combed the Vain and Bio articles three times in search of any remote basis for your rejection of the Mark Steere article and found absolutely nothing. On the contrary, the more I studied the articles the more they tended to justify and even call for such articles as the Mark Steere article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources: Rule sheets for all of my games, authored by me, are published on BoardGameGeek.com, the definitive resource for board games. All submissions to Board Game Geek go through an approval process and are published at the discretion of the proprietors. Here is a link: <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321" class="external free" title="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/designer/2321</a>. Here are a couple of reviews for you: First a link to an Italian magazine with a description and review of my game Byte which appears in the last section: <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf" class="external free" title="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/boardgamevariant/fda/FdA30.pdf</a>. Here is a recent review of my game Cephalopod: <a href="http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod" class="external free" title="http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedicetower.com/thedicetower/index.php?page=Cephalopod</a>. Another article you might find interesting is a description of my game Tanbo, published here on Wikipedia by Steve Bordelon in June 2003: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanbo</a>. I have no connection with Steve Bordelon and in fact had never heard of him before seeing his Wikipedia article on Tanbo. I think this goes to the “widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record” since I invented Tanbo back in 1993. Besides Mensa and Parents’ Choice I also received the Games Magazine Games 100 award for Quadrature in 1993.</p>
<p>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. I can provide many more game review sources, if called upon to do so. My games have earned a huge amount of recognition in the games community over the years. I have unequivocally met the Wikipedia requirement of being a “published author, [who has] received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [my] work.” Many times over.</p>
<p>Now back to your part, Isotope23. Show me where the Mark Steere article falls short of *any* of the Wikipedia standards.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> first off, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> &amp; <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> are guidelines, not rules. I can only speak for myself, but authoring rules sheets doesn't really meet my definition of "published author", though you are free to disagree. The other guideline you referenced from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..." is very open to interpretation. I'm not trying to be personally offensive to you, but I don't see anything that meets that definition. None of your games have been around long enough to have achieved the status of "enduring historical record" in my opinion. Concerning <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>... I've struck that above because the guideline I meant to reference was <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, citing <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> was a mistake on my part. Regardless, the only real claim I see towards <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is if "author" is carried over to the authorship of the game as a whole. I can't think of any similar case off the top of my head, then again I've never seen a board game creator article here before. I'm still mulling over if that meets the author definition.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 23:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Authorship</b> Authorship here refers to my authoring the original rule sheets. The games were invented. The rules were authored. Tanbo never won any awards but it is my most famous game now, 13 years after I invented it. If you ask any connoisseur of abstract games about Tanbo, he will definitely be familiar with it and will most likely have played it a couple of times. I don't see how Tanbo could be viewed as not being "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field...". There are many much more famous game designers than me. Their work is instantly lauded upon release. Then, in many cases, a few months later you see the complaints about the aimless gameplay and the increasing frequency of draws. These games won't be around forever. Tanbo will.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> based on your statements above I don't see you meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because I do not consider you to meet the criteria as an author based on the authorship of rules sheet. As for Tanbo, trying to construe the future status of the game as meeting "...part of the enduring historical record in their specific field..." violates the Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<li><b>I'm not construing.</b> The field of modern abstract game invention has barely existed until recently. There was Reversi a couple hundred years ago, and there were Hex and Y in the 1950's. The field has only become highly active in the past couple of decades to the point where there are now hundreds if not thousands of abstract games. The vast majority of them are unheard of and never played. For a game like Tanbo to steadily grow in popularity with virtually no promotion over a period of 13 years indicates an outstanding game with endurance. I don't know what your criteria for endurance is, but I personally don't know of any abstract games older than 55 years with known inventors. Part of Tanbo's success, and what I believe will be continued success, is due to its use of generic equipment: a Go board and Go stones. Every game store has Go sets. It's the most popular game in China and Japan. As long as the very simple concept of Tanbo continues to spread by word of mouth, and as long as Go sets are available, Tanbo will be played.</li>

<li><b>How long</b> does it generally take for the real editors to get around to reviewing the article in question? This is all growing rather tiresome. To be honest, I no longer care if the article makes the cut. It won't have a significant impact on my life either way.</li>
<li><b>Observations.</b> I've learned a few things about Wikipedia through this "Articles for deletion" process. There is a subset of the community that monitors and attempts to weed out articles of questionable importance. Even though it's directed at me in this case, I view this process as a good thing. It keeps Wikipedia from being overrun with junk which would make it difficult to access the useful information. I also like the group response against personal attacks. It tends to squelch the escalation of counter attacks and flame wars which can essentially sabotage a forum. What I don't like about the process is that it seems to foster a small percentage of "bad apples" who are so horribly inadequate that they've made a career out of hunting down and attempting to minimize the accomplishments of others. There's probably a word for them here, like "wikitaliban" or something. I don't know what can be done about them. Maybe place a limit on how frequently one can recommend articles for deletion.</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm including the amazon.com book and as many links as I can until launch dates for upcoming sites are in. I'm not trying to 'fight' you personally, I'm trying to get an understanding on how to make this a valid entry, which it is due to the accomplishments of Gallant. Also, please understand that an entire website under gallantnyc.com featuring the entire collection of his works and photography and published materials is launching. I'm not sure what else is required. FYI, there is an Alexa ranking. {{Tronus 07:06, 28 June 2006 (UTC)|Tronus}}
<ul>
<li>Simply being included in amazon.com does not always merit notability, since amazon.com includes basically <i>all</i> books, regardless of notability, sales, or publisher. Also, I've just checked gallantnyc.com and it doesn't have an Alexa ranking as well<a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallantnyc.com%2F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallantnyc.com%2F" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. Either way, note that I am not trying to "fight" you personally either, though please remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and that entries on people with little or no notability should not be included. If you really want a web page about yourself, I suggest you go to myspace or geocities. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 07:16, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You've still not defined 'little' notability per the deletion guidelines. There are many up-and-coming authors with wiki entries. Myspace and geocities for a software engineer with a personal site launch? The dry humor is noted, but the validity for deletion is not. GallantNyc.com is a newly launching site under development, how does an Alexa ranking for a newly developed site have anything to do with notable references to the history of an author living in New York City with details going back 9 years? It doesn't. There is still no clear definition on how you describe what is notable 'enough' for acceptance. It is understood this is an encyclopedia and due the oustanding accomplishments of this author it is a valid entry for this encyclopedia. --Tronus 07:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Articles on "up-and-coming authors" not only violate <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> as well. Also, I mentioned the Alexa ranking of GallantNyc.com since you noted above that "there is an Alexa ranking" when there clearly wasn't.

<ul>
<li>I'm not taking it personal, I'm actually learning as we converse, I just need to understand why this would not be a valid entry for this wiki considering it was just entered with bio pertinent to the author's information and career. Also the Alexa entry was in reference to skratchpad.com, not to gallantnyc.com which is in launching stage. The main point was not to just get WP:BIO and have at that, but to get an understanding on why exactly this would not be considered a viable entry for an entity with multiple notable references, especially when there's been no chance for the author's fanbase or anybody to update the information themselves.
<ul>
<li>Overall, basically it does not seem to be a notable entry because: <b>1.</b> No google results <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Greg+Alan+Gallant+%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Greg+Alan+Gallant+%22" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <b>2.</b> The websites he created have no Alexa ranking <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=Skratch+Pad+Network&amp;url=http://www.skratchpad.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=Skratch+Pad+Network&amp;url=http://www.skratchpad.com/" rel="nofollow">[47]</a><a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallantnyc.com%2F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallantnyc.com%2F" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and are not mentioned in any major media sources thus not notable (note that Alexa shows the site's traffic ranking). <b>3.</b> Being a self-published author violates <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <b>4.</b> Being listed on amazon.com does not merit notability <b>5.</b> Books not yet published, thus violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> <b>6.</b> No citations to verify that Gallant has had his photos published in any major media sources--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 08:00, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because this type of comparation is well established in the religionistics and philosophy since 19th century at least (e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> wrote whole books about this theme, but he had of course many predecessors). So it is not original research, it is only unsourced. Regarding the POV - it can be corrected by citing the appropriate sources a making exact citations. In my opinion, the article is not unsalvable and the theme is reasonably well rooted in the scholarly tradition of Comparative Religion. It should be perhaps marked by NPOV and Unsourced, but not deleted.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 08:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The material may be the same, but the organization will vary. The article about "similarities" tends to be a comparative table, organized around small topics, while the article about Abrahamic religions is narrative and the scope of its chapters is rather broader. There are "table" articles here, e.g. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II_7f65.html" title="Comparative military ranks of World War II">Comparative military ranks of World War II</a>, and they are IMHO not bad - so why not to do the same in the religionistics?--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 12:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. There is extensive information on this article that would be difficult to recover, and furthermore the show is being worked for a more public broadcast in the near future.

<li>Main reason to vote <b>Don't Delete</b>: Online broadcasts have been shown to be sufficient. This is evident in entries for Homestar Runner and hundreds of others (even webcomics). The only difference here is the size of the fan base, which hasn't been shown to be a reason for deletion with the numerous "cult classic" and independent films chronicled on Wikipedia. Also, in terms of depth of information (which may or may not be a factor), there is much more here (and the show is more accessible to view) than most cancelled shows. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.43.41.199 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.43.41.199_860a.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.43.41.199">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> per above; Actually, such cult classics are considered for inclusion because of celebrities being involved. As soon as it concerns an independant film, awards and audience are generally taken into account. If you see articles with which that didn't happen, let us know. They should be deleted and don't warrant more articles of the same type. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

This page is obviously well trafficed and edited, and of use to many people. WP states that deletion of information which does not improve WP is vandalism.

<p>This article fails WP:NPOV and WP:NOR in every possible way. The group of songs listed seems very random, and there are several listed that I would definitely not consider the worst ever.

There are many pages like this listing articles and objects that are most or least of something, and routinely done by journals such as Car and Driver for automobiles. I would much rather have a WP inclusive of these sort of pages than invoke a ban. Surely WP would not object to a list of most famous authors, top grossing movies, or most important events in the 1970s. Many entries show successes that were intially failures. If you kill the science success / failure pages, you'll also have to eliminate the similar list of computer flops, movie flops, governemnt flops, education flops, and sports flops. I don't think you can delete this page unless you can show a WP category ban for this sort of thing. If there is a ban, you'll have to enforce it across all topics, say so in the Wiki documentation in the appropriate list of what not and not to include in WP, and WP will be much poorer for it. I was about to nominate the J79 engine as a success, but you folks are going to take it all way. PlEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ don't kill it.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 10:37, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Things like top-grossing movies and the like are objectively verifiable based on takings and profits. This is a big list of unencyclopaedic personal opinions and depend inherently on the viewpoint of the reader or editor. I am sure we would object to lists of the most important 1970's events and dicsussions of who is the most 'famous author' as these labelling exercises depend on no objective basis and are not informative. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 11:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Using words like <i>success</i> or <i>failure</i> if you haven't noticed involves a necessary normative judgment that is largely a matter of personal position, opinion or taste. I don't know exactly what your above comment means, but I assume you are saying that a list of achievements is needed. One like this is not for my stated reason. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 11:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand your point re "finding" <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. Any user can type in e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_travel.html" title="Space travel">space travel</a> and find Apollo pretty much immediately. They can then decide for themselves whether it was a "success" or "failure". The list includes several entries that say "no replacement in sight" as sole validation for inclusion. This is simply not good enough for an encyclopedia. There is no consistent rationale for inclusion in this list, so it boils down to an editor's whim, and that's what makes it deletable as a NPOV/NOR failure. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 12:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But notice how the Google results aren't from relevant, scholarly sources, but mostly some random sites. If you further narrow down the search to site:.yu, you'll only get 154 hits. For site:.hr, there's just 26 hits, and absolutely no hits for the same search on site:.bs. It's simply not a commonly used word, it's not used among the linguists, and it's pointless for us to promote it by having the article.

<dd>The 38,000-odd results strike me as fairly significant: the word <i>is</i> used by some people, even if they aren't scholars. The purpose of a disambiguation page is to point people to where the information they seek can be found.
<dl>
<dd>Well, given the disparity between 38,000 and the 154+26+0, I can't quite wrap my head around it. Who are the relevant people using this word, if the native speakers aren't doing so on their sites, and English dictionaries don't do so, either? I also tried to check the latter part of those 38K hits, but for example <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Latinic&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;start=550&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Latinic&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;start=550&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this link to the results starting at #550</a> says "we have omitted some entries very similar to the 501 already displayed".

<dd>I do get weary when various unfamiliar nationalisms are exported to the English language Wikipedia. Let's face it, this seems to be a classic case for a disambiguation; "Latinic" does get some use --- maybe just a little, but some --- as the name for the adaptations of the Latin alphabet for several south Slavic languages, which within living memory were counted as one language. Because the word <i>is</i> used by somebody, we need to point people who come looking for it to the sources of current information, and if "Latinic" is thought wrong or inappropriate now, the reasons should also be explained. What we should not do is fear that such an entry "promotes" a word because it's the "wrong" word. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:09, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there is merit to your argument, but I still contend that it's too hard to work at articles where the title is a badly done direct translation of a local term into English and whose main content already exists elsewhere.

<li><b>Note</b> I should have worded my "google" remark more carefully. While I do feel that having few google hits is a reliable indicator for a group that aspires to be a popular band, my reference was to what the hits were saying. As was noted elsewhere, a very few local reviews. Local band in a local paper is not notable in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 16:41, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Looking at the Google hits from this band, it is obvious to me that they are just a small-time local band. They have had a couple of write-ups in local newspapers but local newspapers are often charitable to local bands. A few local gigs, a local festival. Nothing outside their immediate area that I can find at all. No more notable than any other band that has had a few gigs. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 18:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> - Touring is NOT the ONLY criteria for notability. They have received notable press coverage, are playing a major event (Athens Music Festival) which is NOT a "local gig," and to dust off the dreaded Google count... 817 hits. Wiki guidelines say a few hundred are probably good enough. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 18:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I waded through quite a few of the google hits. Nashville, like Austin down here in TX, has quite good media coverage of the local music scene. If you play any local gigs, it is going to be covered in quite a few local publications and no small number of "local scene" blogs. While this gives a large number of hits, if you read the hits, they tend to read like #5 on the How I Became the Bomb google hit list "did a photo shoot yesterday for the local band How I Became the Bomb." The words local band seem to run through the vast majority of the write ups. Since they (local media and blogs) cover pretty much all bands that get local gigs, this is not even an indicator of local notability. And, if you mean by "Athens Music Festival" you mean the Athens Popfest, this festival is specifically designed to be "all about the little guy" (from the website "<a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/36760/Deerhoof_Mountain_Goats_OhOk_Head_Athens_Popfes" class="external text" title="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/36760/Deerhoof_Mountain_Goats_OhOk_Head_Athens_Popfes" rel="nofollow">Deerhoof, Mountain Goats, Oh-Ok Head Athens Popfest</a>", <i>Pitchfork</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">31 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.

The school was one of only three in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> and 13 in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> to be so recognised. Morley High School is a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">Specialist Technology College</a>.</i> I would also point out out that the nom did not complain about the writing style. If the issue is cleaning up the article, rather than "notability", it would be far easier to start with tags and the talk page, rather than AfD. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:25, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment from Nominator</b> - The reason I did not complain about the writing style was that it wasn't the writing style that bothered me. It was the fact that the school appears to have nothing more notable than an "Artsmark". The school my adopted son goes to is a Business and Enterprise College. Does that mean that <b>it</b> qualifies for an entry here too??? I think not... <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 22:20, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I never said anything about deleting this based on the fact that it is poorly written <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>... I never said it should be deleted at all. I'm merely saying that calling this a good article is a stretch and in fact it is a pretty poor example of what a school article should be. For the record, I did tag it &amp; post on the talk page since <b>I</b> am the one complaining about how it was written, not the nominator.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 22:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: (i) I said "nice article". I see six good lines of text, therefore I stand by that comment. We need more articles that start that way. Anything objectionable, perhaps the line you singled out, probably took 5 seconds to remove. I hardly think it worth talking about, because our only concern should be the validity of the topic. Furthermore, as a rule, I do not enjoy criticizing other people's contributions, nor do I view AfD as the right forum for content complaints - at the very least, the article talk page should be used first. For all I know, fatty foods may have been an issue that received media attention in connection with this school; (ii) nominator should submit an article on son's school. Even better, get son to write it. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't feel it should be this hard to find reliable sources. I have only read about this tank on assorted tank fansites, and I've heard that it's mentioned in a couple of 50-80 page picture books of "crazy stuff the Nazis nearly built." I've also heard that it's described in some German texts, but the article does not cite those. The article in question only cites two amateur web sites as sources, and unless reliable sources can be cited the article should be deleted.

<p><b>Neutral</b> I listed the article on behalf of User Feed, who gave the following reason&#160;: This article is written out of hate and resentment because of the author of this article refuse to accept that people do not agree with him that X-MEN movie are pro-gay propaganda. The arguement took place in an online forum and it is obvious that the article author is resentful and childish. Most of the information contained in this article, including name of people and movies are fabricated. Wikipedia ought to implement a mechanism to prevent people from abusing its site to spread lies and hate. The author of the article has also maliciously edited the article on the list of political parties in Malaysia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Malaysia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Malaysia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Malaysia</a>) to include a Homosexual Party with the nick feedmaster.

<dd>Not that here is the place to debate it, but AfD is not a vote. Using the word "vote", however you mean it to be taken, is counterproductive and weakens the AfD process. I'm also guilty of this in the past, until I discovered that the word "opinion" was both more accurate and more powerful in every context one would use it in on AfD. <i>AfD is not a vote.</i> <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:16, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - unnoteworthy, unencyclopaedic guy, as far as I can tell. Byron Smith (baseball player) and Byron Smith (judge) would both be more encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Maybe an old encyclopedia? When I do a search on Google for "Byron Smith" I get 71,000 links, "Byron Smith"+baseball I get 516 links, "Byron Smith"+Judge I get 621 links, "Byron Smith"+everest 1460. Is a person's occupational stature (judge or baseball player) what makes or breaks them on wikipedia? The guy was live on Canadian national news for three months!

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - in fact, news is a far better indicator of noteworthiness than google hits - hence my preference for the other two Byron Smiths, who are way more reported on. Their occupation is irrelevent. The guy was certainly not featured prominantly in the news - google news says <b>zero</b> hits for Byron Smith Everett - and he has never appeared in a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a> article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The map is just as notable as the other featured in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Counter-Strike_maps_8845.html" title="List of Counter-Strike maps">List of Counter-Strike maps</a>.

This map has an equal amount of content as the others, but could be tagged as a stub, if lack of content is your concern. I was the person who removed the prod tag after spending an hour adding content, because as the tag reads "You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason." As far as I know, I followed protocol to the letter of the law, and yet we're served up for AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see any reason to pick on this article in particular; in fact, it's more common than some of the other maps in the category.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not advocate the keeping of all computer game maps, as can be seen in some of my nominations such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Vampirism_Revolution_%282_nomination%29_0577.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vampirism Revolution (2 nomination)">Vampirism Revolution</a> and I would vote to delete seperate <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a> maps such as Great Wall (Battlefield 2 map), which doesn't even appear in the main game. I do however believe that official counter-strike maps should be kept due to their popularity, for the same reason why I think that Simpsons' episodes are notable, but episodes of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thick_of_It_c394.html" title="The Thick of It">The Thick of It</a> isn't. Here's a comment from the first nomination that I made, "I believe that there are currently more players on de_nuke alone, than there are readers of Concerned or people interested in <a href="../../../s/k/_/SK_Gaming_8f02.html" title="SK Gaming">SK Gaming</a>. However, I think anyone interested in SK Gaming or esports, would definitely find the maps on which these events are held to be interesting and encyclopedic." And I stand by that. More people know this map inside out than read a webcomic such as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a> (another Half-Life universe byproduct) and that was easily kept. And it's not like I would just keep everything Counter-strike related either, things like Surfing (Counter-Strike) and Kreedz Climbing, I'd probably side on delete. A good indication of how popular Counter-Strike is can be seen <a href="http://steampowered.com/status/game_stats.html" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/status/game_stats.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, right now, there are just shy of 200,000 players which is more than <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empires.html" title="Empires">Empires</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystopia_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Dystopia (computer game)">Dystopia (computer game)</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/GoldenEye%7E_Source_2544.html" title="GoldenEye: Source">GoldenEye: Source</a> combined and multiplied by around 50.

<li><b>Comment</b> why <i>semi</i>-protect? Is there any reason for Jedi Order to redirect <i>anywhere</i> other than <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a>? If so, make it semi-protected, but if there isn't, then there's nothing to stop one of the clan members from registering and doing all this again (I realize I'm opting for reality over <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, I know, but I think its a valid concern).

<li><b>Comment</b>: The most obvious possibility I see is that <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> gets big and split into two pages. As for why semi-protection, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Protected_pages_considered_harmful" class="extiw" title="meta:Protected_pages_considered_harmful">meta:Protected pages considered harmful</a>; semi-protection is less bad than full protection. Also, semi-protection will give us a four-day (or whatever the lag time is), and logged in accounts can be blocked much more readily than anon IPs, especially as some of the clan members involved in this little stunt were on AOL IPs.

<p><i>Please oh please can we delete this</i>? I prodded a bit ago, and it was de-prodded. As the lead itself states, this article is completely subjective, has no good definition of what it really means (it seems to mean that "the man on the street" would only know one piece by these people), and is completely unsourced (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). It was put up for deletion under slightly different title <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_One-hit_wonders_in_classical_music_db5f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/One-hit wonders in classical music">here</a>, the end result of which was to redirect to <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_hit_wonder.html" title="One hit wonder">One hit wonder</a>. I hate to say it, but this article is one of the reasons experts make fun of us.

<li><b>Delete</b>. One man's one-hit wonder is another man's loved composer. It lists Offenbach, for crying out loud! I'm quite fond of a number of Offenbach pieces.

<p>No indication of notability, vanity/self promotion, crystal ballish. Quote from the article: "<i>the Devil360 website has not been updated since 2006-06-07 and most pages are "Coming soon..". This chip may not exist or never surface.</i>" Doesn't really deserve an article until it actually exists. Also I'd just like to mention that I found a news article on a games related website about it<a href="http://www.fragland.be/news.php?id=14366" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fragland.be/news.php?id=14366" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>.

It may be notable but the fact that it's purely speculative/crystal ballish and that this article is linked to from the main page of their website is evidence of vanity, thus making it a candidate for deletion. The page creator has 7 edits, 6 of which are to Devil360.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypandy.UK_6e9d.html" title="User:Andypandy.UK"><font style="background:white">Andeh</font></a> 16:52, 28 June 2006 (UTC) I am also nominating the following related pages because it's a redirect:</p>

<p>RESPONSE: I thought about this some more, and I'd like to say that there are articles on Wikipedia about other 3rd party candidates on here that haven't won office either. I think that there should be MORE articles on here about such candidates (not less). I can understand if Wikipedia staff doesn't want to write up an article about a particular individual, but I didn't have a problem in writing one up. I think that there should be more articles on here about candidates running for major office. I have found some great ones on here about some candidates, and then frustrated when I couldn't find articles about others. Well, that's my two cents. Thanks for listening.

<p>I could be wrong about this..Wikipedia is renowned for its vast knowledge of seamlessly internet data. That is a huge compliment. To delete something such as Gaming...from your wikipedia articles, is like tearing words out of the dictionary. You want to be renowned for having information on everything, then do just that. If you want to take it a step further maybe make a whole subject area to gaming. You could pioneer the way for the worlds first Gaming Database...or, you can be nazi's and delete the 3 KB file taking up all that space on your servers in hopes of making more room for pointless articles such as woman's implants. I think this paragraph says what I want it to, so in conclusion. WE like you. I like you. My term paper and my college research papers liked you. Don't make me turn to www.questia.com. Adieu.</p>

<p>One of many articles (5 in total, also nominated here) all redirecting to Russia as a major power. The titles of these articles are all variations on the theme of Russia becoming a superpower. None of them have any content and none are significantly linked to. The Russia as a major power article is itself fairly dubious (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), although I don't propose to deal with that here. But the Russia (note, Russia - not USSR) as a superpower thesis seems to be entirely OR.</p>
<p>Given this, the fact that they are all redirects (some are multiple redirects), and the fact that they are not linked to from other articles, I suggest their removal.</p>
<p>For the above reasons I am also including the following pages in this nomination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging Superpowers—Russia</li>
<li>Russia as a re-emerging superpower</li>
<li>Potential Superpowers—Russia</li>
<li>Russia as an emerging superpower</li>

You thought a school board member in Florida (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Parks_a5c8.html" title="Robert D. Parks">Robert D.

<li><b>Srong Keep</b> - Nominator lacks perspective on the topic. Myrtle Avenue is by no means a minor street, obvious by the fact that it spans many neighborhoods in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a> (CrazyRussian so nonchalantly calls "outer boroughs"). If we erase this article then we set up an even more dangerous precedent: one that concerns itself only with the surface phenomenon (that the article isn't developed yet) and blindly fails to see the potential down the road. In other words, just because the article is a stub now, doesn't prove that a New Jersey resident can fairly say "nothing is going on" there. This should've been discussed before nominating here, after I de-PRODed.

I realize that's a factor in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but it really doesn't apply in this case. If this was true, someone whom taught a notable person in grade school could merit an article. Also, another basis for keeping is based on the potentional for notability. This is so <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">a crystal ballism</a>, Wikipedia takes record of notability that has occured, not notability that will not or has yet to occur. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="blue">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">sox</font></a> 22:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Myrtle is particularly important in <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridgewood%2C_Queens_16b3.html" title="Ridgewood, Queens">Ridgewood, Queens</a>; one of two main commercial shopping districts in Ridgewood (other is Fresh Pond Road).

The Q55 bus that runs along the street can be standing-room only during rush hours to and from its terminus at <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrtle-Wyckoff_Avenues_%28BMT_Canarsie_Line%29_32af.html" title="Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues (BMT Canarsie Line)">Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station</a>, and that station is one of the busier <a href="../../../l/_/%28/L_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29_081d.html" title="L (New York City Subway service)">L</a> line stations in Brooklyn. How do I know? I live in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushwick%2C_Brooklyn_72c0.html" title="Bushwick, Brooklyn">Bushwick</a>/Ridgewood on the Brooklyn side, not too far from Myrtle. I am also familiar with the road through Queens and Brooklyn. It's the main thoroughfare in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_Queens_febb.html" title="Glendale, Queens">Glendale, Queens</a> - see that article. It runs through <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetroTech_Center_cfc1.html" title="MetroTech Center">MetroTech Center</a>. Historically, the street's notable: the Jamaica Plank Road (as it was known) existed before the communities were built. As for expanding the article, I can't think of anything else other than what I said above. I will try to improve on the article, but only after further discussion.</li>
<li>Crzrussian (and others), if I may ask, what are your <i>minimum</i> requirements for a "major avenue"? And what does the Wikipedia community say about what is a "major street" (other than state routes, county routes, etc.)? <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 12:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I cannot speak for others, but I think numbered state routes are always OK, but individual streets require a showing of notability. Generally, only the most famous streets in the biggest cities get included. Thus, Manhattan has 100, and Brooklyn has 10. I think that's about right. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 13:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you Tinlinkin for adding another perspective. I instinctually started with information on the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill side of Mytrle, because that is what I am most familiar with. Your information about the Queens side, I think demonstrates that Myrtle is longer and more influential in communities than most other mundane streets in Brooklyn.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Myrtle Avenue may not be much today, but it does follow the path of the Myrtle Avenue and Jamaica Plank Road (also called the Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank Road, or just the Jamaica Plank Road) which was created in 1853/1854. There is information available on this historic road, and if this article had more on its history it would be greatly improved. Is it a great article as is? No. Will it be a Featured article one day? I doubt it. Does it deserve to be deleted? NO. We need to develop clearer criteria for inclusion of roads that goes beyond can anyone sing a few bars of "I Left My Heart On Myrtle Avenue." <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - If the largest roads in certain cities are allowed to exist, then Myrtle Avenue certainly deserves to stay. It is a very prominent avenue crossing and influencing many neighborhoods including my own, Ridgewood. It is one of the most significant places to us I know from experience. Sorry if this is more anecdotal than anything, but we refer to it as "The Avenue", like we refer to New York City as "the city". It also has a very rich and detailed histroy, that unfortunately has not been elaborated on this page.</li>

<p>This article fails WP:NPOV and WP:NOR in every possible way. The group of songs listed seems very random, and there are several listed that I would definitely not consider the worst ever. At the end of the day, there is no way this article can be NPOV. Many of the songs follow with explanations of why the user PERSONALLY feels the song is one of the worst ever. This article is mostly original research. I don't see it being useful in any way, as it will always be filled with personal opinions and views. --Musicpvm 01:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC) This article was nominated for deletion on 21 November, 2005.

<li><s>Strong Keep</s> Are you guys nuts? This was created by me as a success mirror to the failure page. POV is not judged by the article, only that a large number of people have judged a project or product to be a spectacular success. There are many pages like this listing articles and objects that are most or least of something, and routinely done by journals such as Car and Driver for automobiles. I would much rather have a WP inclusive of these sort of pages than invoke a ban. Surely WP would not object to a list of most famous authors, top grossing movies, or most important events in the 1970s. Many entries show successes that were intially failures. If you kill the science success / failure pages, you'll also have to eliminate the similar list of computer flops, movie flops, governemnt flops, education flops, and sports flops. I don't think you can delete this page unless you can show a WP category ban for this sort of thing. If there is a ban, you'll have to enforce it across all topics, say so in the Wiki documentation in the appropriate list of what not and not to include in WP, and WP will be much poorer for it. I was about to nominate the J79 engine as a success, but you folks are going to take it all way. PlEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ don't kill it.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 10:37, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Things like top-grossing movies and the like are objectively verifiable based on takings and profits. This is a big list of unencyclopaedic personal opinions and depend inherently on the viewpoint of the reader or editor. I am sure we would object to lists of the most important 1970's events and dicsussions of who is the most 'famous author' as these labelling exercises depend on no objective basis and are not informative. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 11:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Using words like <i>success</i> or <i>failure</i> if you haven't noticed involves a necessary normative judgment that is largely a matter of personal position, opinion or taste. I don't know exactly what your above comment means, but I assume you are saying that a list of achievements is needed.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand your point re "finding" <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. Any user can type in e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_travel.html" title="Space travel">space travel</a> and find Apollo pretty much immediately. They can then decide for themselves whether it was a "success" or "failure". The list includes several entries that say "no replacement in sight" as sole validation for inclusion. This is simply not good enough for an encyclopedia. There is no consistent rationale for inclusion in this list, so it boils down to an editor's whim, and that's what makes it deletable as a NPOV/NOR failure. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 12:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was as follows:</p>
<p>Premature closing due to Speedy Delete criteria G7 (author requests deletion). As this is information based on a fanfiction without verifiability (and no direct google hits outside of Wikipedia itself), and the author of the material discussed is demanding deltion, I believe this falls under speedy deletion easily. Moreover, the clear concensus is delete. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 06:01, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is extensive discussion on the talk page which outlines the problems with this article. In a nutshell, it is all based on an article (published ten years ago) by one person. In the past decade absolutely nobody else has ever backed this theory. There have been no scholarly analysis of this theory.

The article is based on a paper published in a <s>peer reviewed</s> journal, there is no evidence that that paper is wrong, but there is little other work done on ethnic variation in relative toe lengths. There is a fair amount of scientific interest in relative finger lengths as indicators of prenatal hormone exposure, a topic this ought to be related to. There is some recently published work on relative big to second toe lengths as a function of the individual's sex, but none on variation between groups (at least not in humans). The term "Celtic toe" appears to be something of a neologism, and at least one other peer reviewed publication has documented this so-called Celtic toe in another ethnic group (in India). There is no data presented to support the claim that only Celtic descended individuals have this foot shape (and such a claim is not made in the primary source for the article). Likewise, the claim of a dominant Mendelian genetic basis is totally unsupported (and contradicted by other published research). This article could be the basis of an interesting article, or subsection of an article, on ethnic variation in foot morphology, but it doesn't really cut the mustard in it's present form. Much of the material is of real scientific worth, but it's presented on a slant that makes it very OR and subject to verifiability problems. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 22:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Author cited in both Discover Magazine, and Current Archaeology has made the claim that the foot and toe bones of the celts can be distinguished from the Anglo Saxons in the United Kingdom. She has clearly identified the remains at many ancient archealogical bruial sites. Her work is published on the web and in Discover Magazine as well as Current Archaeology. Her work even includes photos of the foot bones where you can clearly see what she is talking about. How can this not be relevant? How can this not be sufficient? Its good enough for Discover Magazine and Current Archaeology, but not Wiki-Pedia, where content is generated by random people on the internet? Please. There is more than enough citations (5) Infact it should have kept with the rather brief article and single citation that it started with. Its more than sufficent. She is both a podiatrist and an archeologist and a far better expert on this matter than any one posting here.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">Britton LaRoche</a> 23:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the number of people believeing in a theory is all you care about and everyone shared your views then Einstein would never have made his theory known, and it would have never been undertsood. Neither would have Gallileo. Besides, I already gave you two, how about Raymond E. Hunter? If he is not good enough, then perhaps he can site the other Archaeologists and podiatrists that worked with Dr. Jackson. I can dig up a third and a fourth, but I'm not going to, there is no need.

They are out there, but their credentials will be no better than the credentials of Phillis Jackson. In fact, I doubt any one could touch her. How many English podiatrists turned archaeologist / anthropologist currently digging through English cemetaries are there in the world? I'm betting she's the top of the field if not the only subject matter expert.</dd>

The Saxon/Briton question warranted further investigation. Chiropodist Phyllis Jackson's expert examination of the foot bone clarified the mystery - this was a native Briton. Radio carbon dating analysis revealed he died between 340 and 550 AD.</dd>

<dd>Phyllis Jackson has continued her work on foot bones from sites throughout the city. She has now studied over sixty burials, from excavations at Gambier Parry Gardens, London Road, St Oswald's Priory, Blackfriars and Southgate Street. Her research, which looks at the structure of the foot, provides evidence for ethnic and tribal origins, deformity, disease and way of life (for an introduction to Miss Jackson's work see Current Archaeology 144, pp466-70). As always, volunteers and work experience students have provided invaluable assistance with improving the documentation and storage of archaeological material held at the unit. RA</dd>

<dd>I think that there has been no evidence that this phenomenon is specific to non-English British people. One cannot make a definitive statement that English people have different feet to non-English people just through a generalised observation. The archaeological references are irrelevant, as these <i>assume</i> that this is a <i>real</i> phenomenon. Where is the evidence that this is indeed the case? You need an accademic article stating that there is a higher incidence of <i>Celtic toe</i> in the non-English British population than in the English one. This seems to be nothing more than someone making a claim and then applying it to archaeology, with no evidence that the claim is in fact correct. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Merge</b> with Morton’s toe. The problem with this article is that it over cooks the information and tries to make out that there is more to the evidence than their actually is. Because of the way it is worded, when I first stumbled across it I thought this was a recognised medical condition when only closer examination it is an interpretation of anecdotal evidence with one small study. I don’t think that this is an intentional distortion of the data by the author as has been suggested here, just the result of somebody getting to ‘into’ their subject, and not seeing the wood for the trees. We should <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">give them the benefit of the doubt</a>. I should also like to gently remind some of the people on this page of Wikipedia’s policy of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civility.html" title="Civility">civility</a>. You don’t have to agree, but please refrain from verbal attacks and abuse – it spoils it for everyone. Although the article can’t remain in its current state, (there are too many unfounded statements and weasel words) it can’t be denied that a) Celtic toe exists as a concept (even if it is an old wife’s tale) and that b) Somebody has tried to prove it scientifically and published it (regardless of how flawed the study is). I think therefore that this should be moved to a paragraph on Morton’s toe. Ideally I think this should contain a description of the myth, maybe taking a couple of the illustrations and then a couple of lines explaining what the study attempted to show, with the reservations clearly explained <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 12:28, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After what I percieved as a not so nice initiation process to Wiki-Pedia, I stitched my wounds and took some time to reflect on the experience. I'm a firm believer that human nature is basically good. We as people do not tend to misbehave unless we feel we have been mistreated. In genral, it is my opinion that ill will and bad feelings toward another is based on frustration and mis-understanding. It is hard not to let your emotions overide your sense of <b><a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a></b> when you are frustrated and feel you have been mis-treated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>What Happened?</b> I believe that my bad experience was not due to either my nature or to the nature of the other people working here on Wiki-Pedia. Wiki-Pedia is a great concept and produces a lot of good. I think the reason why I had a bad newbie experience is because the Wiki-Pedia initial submission process could be improved. If we look at the process, Wiki-Pedia's current process is a <b>process of exclusion</b>, not a process of inclusion. Any one can submit, and then another must remove it if its not good enough. This causes pain and strife between those who submit and those who review. A minor change in the Wiki-Pedia process, can save the newbies from what appears to them as a severe bite. On the surface it may seem only a minor change in policy, but underneath it is a major change to the Wiki-Pedia psyche that will affect the well being of all those involved.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Wiki-Pedia, provider of light and wisdom to all for free. How does it work?</b> The concept of Wiki-Pedia is to let anyone contribute. Something is better than nothing. On the whole it works, because on the whole human nature is good. That being said, human nature is not always good. The problem with allowing any one to contribute is that it allows the lesser side, the dark side of human nature to rise and voice its opinion too. This leads to garbage contribution: lies, malicious rumors, untuths, vanity and self glorification posts which have nothing to do with the purpose of Wiki-Pedia. We as contributors, and <b>especially as editors</b> must be vigiliant and constantly clean up these things.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Ouch, Bad newbie! Bad!</b> The problem is that we newbies, good people new to the process, are basically ignorant of how it works. We are bound to make mistakes, and we are sometimes lumped in with the rest of the garabage. Feelings are hurt, and those who have great potential to contribute may leave and never return.</li>

<li><b>Don't Bite, Lick.</b> A suggestion and Possible Solution. Instead of tagging someones article as unverified after someone has spent time working on it, the suggestion is that all articles must start out with an unverified tag, and a note that it can or will be deleted. <b>(This can be accomplished through code or perhaps a default template setting for new users)</b> The editors job is now to remove the tags once they feel it is worthy of being part of Wiki-Pedia. We all mean well. We are all here for the dissemination of the truth, and basically put hard work in for free. We do this because we feel this is right, and because we believe in it. This kind of person should not be abused, either because they are doing their job as an editor, or doing their job as a newbie contributer learning the ropes.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Little things add up.</b> A minor change in the process can make a major difference. When the article is first posted it is automatically marked with a tag that it is unverified and subject to deletion, until it has passed editorial review. The newbie has been educated. No ones feelings will be hurt by this. And... the best part is the editors are now viewed as the good guys by the newbies. They newbie hopes that an editor will come along and help him or her remove the tag. The Editors remove the unverified tag... or they submit it for deletion. The editor's main task now is to include the work. <b>The whole of Wiki-Pedia changes from a process of exclusion to a process of inclusion.</b>--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 17:28, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - OK that does not link to articles but rather a 68 pg document called "Current and Recent Research in Osteoarchaeology: Proceedings of the Third Meeting of the Osteoarchaeological Research Group (The Osteoarchaeological Research Group) (Paperback)" published in 1998 about their meeting in 1995. The ORG seems to be a hobbist organization - "The Osteoarchaeological Research Group (ORG) was set up in 1993 with the intention of bringing together anyone who works with or has an interest in human and/or animal remains. The core function of the group is to provide a forum for the exchange of news and ideas through quarterly newsletters and regular meetings. We are also interested in promoting the provision of careers advice and training in this field, providing information on services for specialists and considering standards for recording/reporting." - I can find no evidence that this organization has been notable in any way or has made any significant contribution to this area of endeavour. A cursory examination also suggests that none of it members are notable (again happy to be corrected and please do). So what we appear to have is a mention of a non-notable person in a non-notable book by a non-notable organization. I still find the evidence of notablity for this person and their claims to be lacking. Those who wish to keep need to provide something more solid than we have seen before. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 17:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, this is pretty near to my research interests, and I havn't heard of it. I've looked hard and can find zero evidence of it beyond the references originally provided by the editor. I do have one paper in my bibliography collection that deals with an ethnic group in India that has about 7 to 10% of the population with the second toe longer than the big toe, other than that I know of one other published study that finds sex differences in the relative lengths of these two toes in undergraduate students in Texas.

<li><b>Comment</b> I looked at the article charitably at first. Then I re-read it. It said then "Ultimately the band is relitively unknown, but its hard not to wonder when there music is going to fall into the right hands and before you know it will be heard on every radio station and seen and heard on every music TV show. These guys offer catchy tunes but at the heart of it all the songs are a bunch of random string of words, but they do it so well that it works for them." That was sufficient to say "non notable". The article screamed it at me. I do see that this is changing (this para has been removed, and POV is becoming neutral) and I will revisit the page in a couple of days. I don't "nominate and run. I have a strong preference for AfD being solved by a much enhanced article. In so many ways that is what it is for. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i><b>Comment</b></i> The article states that there are multiple schools by the same name by the same founder. Presumably, there could also be others by the name with different founders. The college source Yamaguchi found doesn't say where the Adarsh College is. The first link Yamaguchi found matches this article as to name and location, shows it as still a secondary school, but has a page info date in 2000. Has it turned into a college, or is that a different school that used to have this name?

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete as copyvio</b>. I'm sorry guys, but copyright violations take precedence over any Non-delete votes in this AfD. However, per the consensus on this AfD, this article can certainly be created and kept as long as there is no copyrighted content. I checked this article, and it is essentially the same as the links that Bishonen gave. "there's only so many ways to phrase the information" is a common argument for copyright violations, but it's not a valid argument. There are many ways of writing something without breaking copyright. Teachers and professors will certainly agree with me. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:36, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b>, yes, I started <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_Matutina_bab8.html" title="Stella Matutina">Stella Matutina</a>, but as a <i>redirect</i> to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_7912.html" title="Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> and then as a place to put info about the historic Stella Matutina that didn't belong here. I then realized the material was included in the main article and made it a redirect again. It was then revived by <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">User:SynergeticMaggot</a>. On the other topic, I don't think this is a copyvio. The only source of information is the website, which is an acceptable source in an article about the org itself. There's only so many ways basic info can be phrased, and only the quotes are exact wording. Whatever, I have since decided that the org is non-notable. -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 22:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, there's always room for disagreement about notability, and others may decide differently, so I'd like to avoid discussing a copyvio on the basis of non-notability. Only so many ways basic info can be phrased?

<li>That's hilarious. The only piece of infomation I took from that site was the date&#160;:-) The rest was already in the article before I discovered that site. Check the history.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since deletion is based on the soundness of arguments rather than a majority vote, it seems to me that since this article has not been expanded, it is still alltogether non-notable per Wikipedia's notability policy on organizations. Sure, the historical Stella Matutina is notable enough by published references, but there is no evidence indicating that this group is a descendent to or related to that historical organization. I say keep the historical Stella Matutina page and delete this one given that it is a stub with only a website to support it's existence. It is basically nothing more than a vanity page. <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKephera975_d7c4.html" title="User:Kephera975">Kephera975</a> 19:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This list is not encyclopaedic. If this list is taken to its furthest extreme---i.e., if it becomes what it truly claims to be, a literal list of people who have identified themselves as "American," or "French," or "French-Canadian," etc., it would be completely unwieldy. My suspicion, though, is that it will not amount to much of anything. In any case, how is such a list useful? If the individuals listed are in any way notable or important, mention can (and, one assumes, <i>will</i>) be made in each individual's article as to the "anthropological category" with which they identify.

<p>Crufty, unsourced list with the nebulous criteria of "famous" and "failure". Famous is a vague criteria - many of the examples in this list are not famous. <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_7J7_fbb8.html" title="Boeing 7J7">Boeing 7J7</a>? Unnamed VSTOL aircraft? <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summerland.html" title="Summerland">Summerland</a>? Failure, actually, is the more problematic criteria. Is the M-16 a failure because it was initially deployed wrong (though it is now a resounding success). Is ALGOL a failure because it declined in popularity? In many cases this has turned into a condemnation of unsuccesful technologies. The criteria is subjective and ultimately ,unencyclopedic. I have also separately nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_famous_successes_in_science_and_engineering_aaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous successes in science and engineering">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of famous successes in science and engineering</a> <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 22:18, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Disaster has a tighter definition in terms of loss of human life (apparently the list defn is broader). And as the link indicates...it's getting very vague. Every airline crash is apparently considered a "disaster". I would call that list a "disaster." What constitutes a "failure". Is wikipedia a "failure"? Can I list individual wiki pages I consider bad on the list of technological failures? If you can offer a definition we can live with, great. Since I doubt you can, I voted delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ditto. I was interested to read in this list about (e.g.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> that, "after much hype, claims of success proved false". Simply a glib POV pronouncement. Success/failure (see my above comments) are too vague to provide a workable article topic. There are several <i>commercial</i> failure lists in WP, since commercial failures can be verified. Several prototypes are listed here as failures. Prototypes are a normal step in a design process, they are not "failures" if they do not reach production stage. <a href="../../../v/2F/s/V_STOL_5145.html" title="V/STOL">V/STOL</a> a failure? Seriously? The list - literally - goes on. This is just POV original research, with inclusion ungrounded in WP policies relating to verifiability and reliable sources. The criteria are so broad that anything can be crowbarred into the category, so cleanup will not help. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 13:14, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>Strong Keep</s> Isn't it WP policy that deletion of information without improving WP is vandalism? Mmx1 has shown bad faith in revert many edits on the F-14 page without justification, even with cited. He has refused to accept any citation up to the VP of Grumman nd Janes Defence. Deleting tnis page removes significant information not contained in other articles, and removing this on the basis that declaring something a failure would logically also neccesitate the removal of all the flop pages, computers, movies, education, and the like. Stop this madness now. It just ticks me off how many wiki people simply run around kicking down other peoples sandcastle. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 14:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe it's an interesting page, and I really don't see the POV problem. Cleanup might be appropriate, but the concept is fine.

<li><b>Comment</b> My issue is with the content, not the title. A change of title will not save this article from deletion for POV/NOR failure IMO. Please assume my comments apply to the new page(s).

<li><b>Keep</b>: In my (admittedly brief) time with Wikipedia I have become progressively more frustrated with the phenomenon of premature and/or frivolous AfDs. Apart from the time and effort they consume, and the lack of respect that they show towards the originating editors, where is the virtue of strangling articles at birth? The nominated article violates no policy and addresses a subject of legitimate interest, on which many books and articles, both popular and specialist, have been published. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Moore_309_be9c.html" title="User:John Moore 309">John Moore 309</a> 12:36, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> It should be noted this is evidence that this request for deletion is merely the extension of the edit war from the F-14 / F-111 page. I am the editor in question, I am responsible only for the SST and F-111 sections, both are easily verifiable as having been identifed or called failures. All of these mentions are based on verifiable sources, and I have already revised many of them to include sources of the mention of people who thought they were failures. It is a WP principle that no article of value which can be revised should be deleted. It should also be noted that Mmx1 has shown very poor judgement in retaining his POV that the F-14 was never designed to be an air superiority fighter, I have presented many sources, up to and including the VP and F-14 test pilot of Grumman and Janes Defence, and since he has no acceptable citations, he is free to revert any edit, since all edits are therefore unveriable except by him. It would be tragic if these articles were deleted merely as a tactic by an editor who is not qualified to revert or delete any material from the WP without detracting from its value. And Mmx1, go deface and destroy somebody else's pages. The majority of this article was created by hundreds of other editors who may see their work vanish without a trace because you believe the F-14 wasn't a dogfighter. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 15:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The current disclaimer in the article stating "Inclusion in this article can not be used as an objective judgment of whether a project was or was not actually a failure by any particular criterion" pretty much sums up the case for deletion. An admission of the intrinsic unencyclopedic POV nature of the list. I personally don't think this list can ignore WP policy simply by stating "this list ignores WP policy". --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 14:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whether a project failed or not is or can be objectively determined and is thus not POV. What makes it famous is its size or importance, which can be POV, but not any more so than any other article on WP. This is a very useful article which has been here for well over a year, and has been nominated AFD as a result of a content dispute. This is no reason for an article of long standing to be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 15:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, take that Mmx1. Let that be a lesson to you tha AFD is not simply another tool to revert an editor you do not agree with. It's simply mind boggling that Mmx1 believes that if I had a hand in the F-111, and SST, and and had citations for both, that would be grounds for throwing out the entire page and work of hundreds of other editors that built it. He would simply toss this article and its newly created opposite twin to the delete happy wiki-wolves. If Wikipedia had ebay feedback, you'd have so many negatives your nose would be bleeding by now. WP will create policies to protect against editors like you, and there will be justice in the end. Jesus is watching you. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 17:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I hope I am not speaking only for myself when I say, I could not care less about Wiarthurhu/matador300's dispute with the nominator of this AfD, and certainly do not see any reason for that editor to bring this issue up three times in this discussion, when there are clearly problems with the article that are not being addressed, and when on-topic comments made here have basically been ignored. I object to the user Wiarthurhu posting on <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlainster_af05.html#They.27ve_killed_the_List_of_famous_failures_in_science_and_engineering.21_You_Bastards.21.21" title="User talk:Blainster">Blainster's discussion page</a> that "The wiki-thugs are all voting to delete the page", then using that editor's vote to yet again waffle on about the nominator. I would prefer comments to be restricted to the issue of this article's obvious deficiencies. I have seen absolutely nothing of any substance that can save this fatally flawed piece of POV-riddled original research from deletion. I woulda thought user Wiarthurhu/matador300 would at least have made some vague effort to address the concerns voiced here. The silence is deafening. Have the balls to call us "wiki-thugs" to our faces at the very least, but please don't cower beneath the skirts of buddies to prop up this POV/NOR nightmare.

<dd>For those of us who are not knowledgeable Wikipedia users, can you use basic non-acronym English?

<dd><b>Comment</b> My apologies for including so much unnecessary jargon in the nomination. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is the guideline for judging whether a corperation is sufficiently notable to have an article written about it in Wikipedia; I believe that this mall doesn't meet those criteria. When I wrote that I 'prod'd' the article, I menat that I had <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed it for deletion</a>. As is any editors right, <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> had challenged this proposed deletion by removing the tag - s/he de-prod'd the article. The discusssion surrounding Greengate Mall (linked to above) suggested to me that just because a 'dead mall' could be defined, unless they were is some way notable they should not have an article, I used n-n to abbreviate non-notable. I hope that is a slightly more coherent explaination than my previous attempt! <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInner_Earth_8c4b.html" title="User:Inner Earth">Inner Earth</a> 09:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having lived in the WV-KY-OH Tri-State region for some time, I relize the importance of this mall to local development. Not only that, but the mall is an interesting study into the do's and dont's of economic development. A combination of bad management, tenants with corporate financial issues (K-mart and Phar-Mor), and local liquor licensing issues (dry county in which the mall is located vs a wet city nearby with competing mall). While this mall is still having many problems, essentially defunct, many new developments have taken place that may bring the mall back from the brink. New owners, ideas, and business models (including a new theater) are being put into place to turn things around. Deleting this article will not only undermine the "Defunct Malls Project," but also cause Wikipedia to turn a blind eye to an interesting study of economic redevelopment in an ecomically stressed area. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECampaigner444_3192.html" title="User:Campaigner444">Campaigner444</a> 18:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>WP:CORP states that "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." There have been several independent news organizations report on information about the mall, including one listed in the article. Also, the mall has an interesting history and is currently undergoing many changes that could be very important the local area. There are many malls within Wikipedia with much less of a storied history, yet they are allowed to remain without question. In Wikipedia there is a list of defunct malls, which for all practical purposes, this mall falls into. I admit, it needs to be cleaned up to meet the standards of the project, but that can ba accomplished. Here are a couple of links to indpendent articles about the mall if there are any questions. <a href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/2005/May/24/LNtop1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/2005/May/24/LNtop1.htm" rel="nofollow">[92]</a><a href="http://www.huntingtonnews.net/local/060511-staff-theatre.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huntingtonnews.net/local/060511-staff-theatre.html" rel="nofollow">[93]</a><a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECampaigner444_3192.html" title="User:Campaigner444">Campaigner444</a> 19:20, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As indicated on the Talk page, Virtuoso Universal Server is a product name. This page is supposed to be a simple product description page since "Virtuoso Universal Server" can only imply a product name. As for universal server. What would you call a product that implements NNTP, HTTP, WebDAV, various SQL CLIs, SQL Data Storage, XML Data Storage, SOAP, <a href="../../../s/p/a/SPARQL_50b1.html" title="SPARQL">SPARQL</a> (recently), GData (recently) etc.. When a single TCP/IP Server process implements an array of TCP/IP application level protocols it can only be called something along the lines of a "Universal Server".

If you fact check a little, you will discover that the Informix Universal Server was named in line with the fact that it supported primitive and complex user defined data types (Data Blades). Wikipedia is supposed to be a knowledgebase (ultimately). Thus, lets no loose valuable knowledge by trying to rewrite history etc.. It isn't criminal to be new or innovative, or am I missing something here? --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingsleyIdehen_d97e.html" title="User:KingsleyIdehen">Kingsley_Idehen</a> 17:46, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On further research: <b>Keep</b> <s>(tentative)</s>: I think the relevant standard to apply here (in addition to NPOV which can be fixed) is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)</a>, and not <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. BarCamp is the name of a conference (or network of conferences), not a neologism. It <i>is</i>, though, connected with an emerging meme, a protocol for organizing conferences (see <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconference.html" title="Unconference">Unconference</a>). The notability of BarCamp seems to be, in part, its function as an examplar of this new type of conference-event, in media coverage and for those in other fields wishing to organize a similar event. <a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatrippi_c679.html" title="User:Latrippi">Latrippi</a> 17:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a popular world-wide phenomenon. It is not a organization.
