<p>If you go back to the article you will see a link. In addition, if you google up "anglo/saxon celt" you will see thousands of hits. The condensing of the term to anglosaxoncelt serves only to eliminate the slash and space.

<p>Huon, to correct you; I just googled your designation and got over 400 hits, and from all around the world, especially from former colonies of the UK, and many on reputable sites. The exponential growth of the use of the term on the Internet warrants its placement on Wikipedia. Furthermore, if you delete this term you must most certainly delete the designation of "English people" as an ethnic group. Worldwide the word "English" is used increasingly to denote a linguistic term, especially since English is the global language of the world. I travel the world as an ESL teacher, and believe me, since English has now reached global status, it would be in the best interests of the descendants of the UK to use more appropriate terms to denote their cultural heritage than "English".</p>
<p>I see you deleted my link from the article. So here it is again, another source which suggests mixing of anglo/saxon and celts involving DNA research. I have found other research alluding to similar discussions online, but can't locate it right now.</p>
<p>"At one time it was widely believed that the Anglo-Saxons mostly supplanted the Celtic populations. Recent genetic studies disagree, suggesting the Anglo-Saxons established political and cultural dominance over the Celts and intermarried with them. In particular, analyses performed upon the mitochondrial DNA of modern day English suggest that any continental admixture from the period of Germanic invasions would have been almost exclusively derived from the male line, suggesting a process of intermarriage between male invaders and female indigenous Celts." experts.about.com/e/e/en/English_people.htm</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, it appears that someone might have hacked into the about.com website and made a redirect of the above link to wikipedia's website on "English people" sometime within the past 12 hours- a rather shocking development. Which means that as an educated professional, I am now going to copy and paste all of the submissions on this topic, until this little matter can be cleared up, and until the link to about.com is working properly again. I am starting to wonder whether there is some political and/or racial motivation behind one or more of the people who want this submission deleted.</p>
<p><br />
You seem be be willing to designate "English people" as an ethnic group. I don't know how you can rationalize "English people" as an ethnic group, while at the same time dismissing anglo/saxon celts, or anglosaxoncelts as an ethnic group when there are millions of us all over the world. I am merely changing the spelling from Anglo/saxon celt, a term which is showing exponential growth, largely as a result of DNA research, Furthermore, the reduction of the term into one single word "anglosaxoncelt" is starting to see growth on the Internet. This ethnic designation applies to millions of the descendants of former colonists of the UK and Ireland. It is a good solid term which, by the way, is also 'unifying' and not divisive and full of controversy like the term "English", which is more of a linguistic term, "English" seems to separate the 'celts' from the rest of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and furthermore, leaves the descendants of the colonists worldwide forever referring to ourselves as "Heinz fifty-sevens".</p>
<p>You need cultural experts, DNA experts, linguistic experts, anthropologists etc, on this topic. Submissions by bioligists and computer programmers, etc. to delete anglosaxoncelt or, if you prefer, anglo/saxon celt, from wikipedia, although important, I am afraid, are not adequate. The terms, anglo/saxon celt or anglosaxoncelt, should no be dismissed so lightly.</p>
<p>To quote Websters:</p>
<p>anglo-saxon: a person of English descent in any country</p>
<p>celtic: a branch of Indo-European languages spoken by the CELTS: Cornish, Breton and Welsh and Irish, Scottish, Gaelic and Manx.</p>
<p>So why not anglosaxoncelt or if you wish, the more traditional anglo/saxon celt?</p>
<p>I have read the page on wikipedia discussing 'anglo-celt'. I suppose the reason I am passionate about the addition of 'saxon' is because anglo/saxon is more commonly used in DNA research as well as celt. I don't see much of anglo-celt in DNA research papers. There should at least be a cross referencing of anglosaxoncelt and/or anglo/saxon celt to 'anglo-celt' until the matter can be settled. In Canada, an anglo-celt would be a person of celtic descent who speaks English, to be distinguished from a franco-celt, a person of celtic descent who speaks French.

<dd>Anglo-Saxon is used in DNA research papers only when they are investigating the possibility of invasions during the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-Roman_Britain_2ac1.html" title="Sub-Roman Britain">Sub-Roman Britain</a> period. Recently genetic markers assumed to be Anglo-Saxon have been shown to be indistinguishable from those of Danish-Viking origin. A more correct term for your meaning, that would cover the English (who are not exclusively descended from Brythonic and Anglo-Saxon people (see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danelaw.html" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>) as well as the non-English inhabitants of the British and Irish Isles would be something like <i>British and Irish people</i>. You are exclusively describing <i>descent</i> from ancient times, modern English people are not <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, and the ancient pre-Roman peoples of the islands would not have thought of themselves collectively as <i>Celts</i>. Your search on Google seems to be faulty, did you use quotes around your search words? I get 145 hits, one of which is to <i>Stormfront</i>, a <i>nazi</i> organisation, many of these do not use <i>anglo/saxon celt</i> as a single term, but simply have the two terms <i>anglo/saxon</i> and <i>celt</i> adjacent to each other in the text. The fact that English people seem to be descendants of both the indigenous Brythonic populations of Britain and immigrating Germanic peoples, does not detract from their status as an ethnic group. Not only is ethnicity not the same as descent, but what makes English people an ethnic group and nation has everything to do with their shared identity/history/culture/politics/language/religion in the millenium or so since the <i>Anglo-Saxons</i> ceased to exist. DNA studies can tell us a lot about our biological origins, they can tell us nothing about our ethnic/national identitues. Anyway surely the correct way to write it would be <i>Anglo-Saxon-Celt</i>. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 16:11, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete,</b> Word doesn't exist and certainly isn't in usage, and the user is POV pushing.

<p>I need to make a wee clarification. The Anglo-Celt as it refers to Australians is discussed here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons</a> Ldjenks 22:50, 31 August 2006 (UTC) 22:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_6222.html" title="Anglo-Celtic">Anglo-Celtic</a>, and in this case the prefix <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a> refers to English (English people/English language and sometimes British people, as in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">Anglophobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophilia.html" title="Anglophilia">Anglophilia</a>, Anglocentric, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophone.html" title="Anglophone">Anglophone</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a>) and not to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angles.html" title="Angles">Angles</a> as it does in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>. The words English and England come from Anglo, as in Angle Land (land of the Angles). So use of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a> in this term is not synonymous with it's use in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_4220.html" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>. Anglo-Celtic is a well known term in Australia and is not a neologism. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 09:33, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> So, to be clear, you're arguing against the deletion of one article based on the fact that a similar term, which does not have an article of its own, is mentioned in some other article on Wikipedia? Arguing that one bad article justifies another bad article is one thing, but arguing that a reference to a questionable term in a perfectly good article justifies a bat article borders on the absurd. -<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 13:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are truly not being clear enough about why you are so hostile to anglo/saxon. It seems to me that your views have a political base; I WANT to hear them, because I am also interested in the anglo-celtic term, but I would prefer anglo-celt. You have to understand that anglo/saxon is a very well known term in Canada. What's wrong with it...and give me a well thought out, researched response along with your political views. I would like to hear both. I am probably going to start up a web page in Canada, and I need to coin a good term that works for us, but that also won't start a war of words throughout the former colonies and the UK and Ireland....As an aside, Germanics also massively settled in North America. At one time the USA debated adopting German as the official language. So perhaps that move in the USA to designate 'anglo-celts' was a response to the huge influence of Germanic populations in North American. But to tell you the truth, there has been so much intermarriage that anglo/saxon/celt seems most appropriate for North American descendents of the UK and Ireland these days.Ldjenks 14:49, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I can't speak for anyone else's motivations, but I can assure you I have no objection whatsoever to you referring to yourself as an Anglo-Saxon Celt, Anglosaxoncelt, or any other label you wish to apply to yourself.

<dd><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_6222.html" title="Anglo-Celtic">Anglo-Celtic</a> has an article. It seems to have the same general meaning as the neologism <i>anglosaxoncelt</i>, given that this seems to be a well accepted term, and given that it uses the word <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a> in it's proper context (as in English), rather than using the term <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_4220.html" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> (which has a completelly different meaning), I cannot understand why Ldjenks doesn't just use this term insted. <b>Anglo-Celtic Isles</b> is also sometimes used to describe the <b>British and Irish Isles</b> (search for both of these terms in wikipedia and you will be redirected to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, a term many Irish people object too) and to refer to the peoples living on those Islands <a href="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Anglo-Celtic.org.uk</a>. So to summarise there are at least two terms that are more commonly used and more accurate than <i>Anglo-Saxon/Celt</i>, these are <i>British and Irish</i> or <i>Anglo-Celtic</i>. Ldjenks has failed to produce any verifiability for their term, I find it somewhat hypocritical that Ld then accuses others of not showing evidence of research. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 15:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alun, I went to anglo-celtic.org.uk, and I would like to speak with the people who created the site, but they list no contact. How do I get in touch with them? I do wish you would truthfully tell me why you don't like the "saxon" word. Hopefully they will. I don't want to start up a web page until the name issues are settled. And you have to admit that anglo/saxon/celt is seeing growth on the Internet.</p>
<p>I'm relieved to see this anglo-celtic.org.uk page. I'ts time for reconciliation in the UK and Ireland, because the strife has hurt the descendents of the former colonists as well. But why anglo-celtic.org.uk and not anglo-celt.org.uk....why the "ic" on celtic?Ldjenks 16:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a completelly different issue, but the vast majority of people from Great Britain already consider themselves British, usually British and Welsh, British and Scots, British and English.

<p>Alun, if you give me an email address I can send you a file that will give you information about Canada that will likely rock your world. The file is circulating all over in Canada. It`s a pdf and takes about 900 k of space. Then maybe you will understand better the kinds of grassroots movements that are taking place in Canada, and maybe better understand why, worlwide, the descendents of the colonists are seeking unity. You can send me an email contact for you to lyjinx@hotmail.com. LDJenks</p>
