<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. I've discounted a few votes based on mistaken reasons (for example, CSD A2) or which had no reasons at all.

<p>This is article total junk. The periodic table in chinese?!? We can't have articles about how everything looks in diffrent languages, especialy when there isn't much diffrence. I suppose if we keep this we should have the periodic table in German, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and every other language too. And if we start making articles about how things look in Chinese then this would be the tip of the iceberg. Come on. This version of wikipedia is in English. This article should go on the chinese wikipedia. (and probably already is.) <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 00:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a well written article, aimed at the english reader; it's interesting (at least, I found it so). The chinese PT is unique in using single characters for elements, setting it apart fron the EN, DE, ES, HE, AR and every other language too.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If Wikipedia had articles on how <i>anything</i> looks in Chinese, we'd melt their servers. The bit about the fact that they use single characters is interesting, but I don't think the periodic table in itself holds any attraction for the average bored reader. If they are looking for the periodic table, in Chinese, they must be able to read Chinese, and hence they are better off at the Chinese Wikipedia, where the information is, no doubt, more complete. Perhaps <b>merge</b> the historical information with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_technology_in_China_4995.html" title="Science and technology in China">Science and technology in China</a>, which, on another note, is an article that could do with some work. <sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">T</a></sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">C</a></sub> 01:19, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep/Conditional Keep</b> "Well-written" and "interesting" and "wikipedia is big enough" are not really relevant arguments for an afd discussion, but there seems to be a marginal degree of notability here if it indeed is the only modern periodic table to not use the standard symbols <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I originally voted delete, but now that I've chewed on it for a while, it really is pretty interesting (read:notable) how they represent chemical symbols in Chinese characters. No, this doesn't mean we have to have an article for everything translated into Chinese, because this translation is particularly difficult. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 01:42, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> as per riana. If it was a pure periodic table I would have voted for delete, but as it holds mild interest because of the use of characters instead of two letter abbrevations it should be kept.

<li>The supporters of this article recognize that it is about a translation, but they also contend that the translation is valuable in itself. In essence, it is not a translation, but an article <i>about</i> the translation and the difficulties arising from it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: that only addresses more articles on periodic tables. A lot of things are likely to be difficult to translate, such as Macbeth into Navajo or the translation of rhyming poetry into an unrelated language while keeping the rhymes. Also, some editors don't make those kinds of distinctions. They will just say that the Chinese periodic table exists, so one in their language should exist. They may leave out the part about the Chinese periodic table being unusual through ignorance or to help their case.

<li>What if each symbol was an image as suggested, but in the image description (on its image page) the text form of the symbol was there?

<li><b>Comment</b> I am rather dismayed by the several comments here calling for a deletion/speedy deletion based on this article being not written in English. It most clearly is, and it makes me wonder whether some of the users even looked at the page before deciding. This isn't all the delete comments, there are several with valid points, but this article is no more "non-english" than any article we have about other languages that include any words/symbols. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 12:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The order and arrangement of the elements in the Chinese periodic table is the same as that in any other language. The only difference is that they use different symbols for the elements rather than the element abbreviations used in Roman characters. And seeing what those symbols are doesn't help me too much as an English-language user of the English Wikipedia, since I can't read Chinese. Maybe a very slight merge into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a> would be appropriate to incorporate the following sentence: "All languages use the same Roman-alphabet symbols for the elements except for Chinese." <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. You can't read Chinese, but you can still see the different representations of it. It is not merely "different symbols", as if you see in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_character.html" title="Chinese character">Chinese character</a> article it is not merely just allocating a different symbol for each character - many elements share many of the same radicals with other elements, ie. for properties such as solid, gas or liquid, or even energy level. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 19:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - I'd like to re-emphasize that this article is not just about the Chinese periodic table, but about the process and challenges of translating it. I really think this article contains interesting and useful information that is worth saving. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> 22:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just a thought. Is this article about the periodic table, or the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_elements.html" title="Chemical elements">elements</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 22:30, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is not a translation, it's <i>about</i> the translation. Notability: "Chinese is the only language that uses characters [...] for elements"; "characters specially-invented for the periodic table". --<a href="../../../z/o/z/User%7EZoz_d0ff.html" title="User:Zoz">Zoz</a> <i><a href="../../../z/o/z/User_talk%7EZoz_2d49.html" title="User talk:Zoz">(t)</a></i> 11:36, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Reading through the votes here, I think the issue is not with the <i>information</i>, but with the <i>format</i>. The first part of the article is interesting information, and should probably be in either <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_technology_in_China_4995.html" title="Science and technology in China">Science and technology in China</a>, like riana suggested. The <i>information</i> in the table (the chinese character used for each element) is good information, but it is also true that Wikipedia is not a translation service. However, what about the Wiktionary? That sort of information should be in their listings, and I know that at least some of it is already. However, the <i>format</i> of the table isn't really useful to an English speaker. Think in terms of usage: an English speaker might run across an element written in Chinese, and want to know what it is in English. Or, the reverse: they may simply want to know what the Chinese character is for an element. In either case, looking at that table probably isn't going to help them, unless they also happen to know the atomic number of the element they want to look up. If they want to figure this information out, they're going to search for the element or the character on the Wikipedia, or hopefully the Wiktionary. The only use I see for the table is if they have a image of the character (rather than text they can copy and paste), don't know how to type it, and feel like looking through rows and rows of similar characters for an exact match. So, save the information, scrap the table. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's interesting to have the table there. It adds significantly to the feeling of completeness to the article from an aesthetic standpoint. Furthermore, I realize that Wikipedia is not a translation service, but the table is not hurting anything. This is a case where a little bit of leniency in terms of policy application is necessary. From a perfectly legalistic standpoint, should we get rid of the table? yes. But what is best for Wikipedia? Keep it. Now as far as your proposal to merge, I simply cannot imagine this large, cumbersome article fitting into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>. Perhaps, though, what we could do is write a blurb about translations of elements into Chinese and other languages and have one of these:</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> It is interesting reading in my opinion (about unicode, the chinese language/coulture, and also as reference), but it might also be considered as fancruft if it were kept in the English wikipedia.

<li><small>Intangible standards are a new idea and I had hoped that Wikipedia could provide a way in which to create discussion and advancement on the topic. How this advancement occurs is uncontrollable by any specific person or organization - it is more about sharing and interaction. Was this a fair position for me to assume?</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A few comments. 1. If Cohen does belong to a special unit in the IDF it should not be posted on Wiki. 2. Do not understand <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> obcessive personal attacks against userIsraelbeach who is no longer on Wiki and thus cannot defend himself. I, too, am a "suspected" sockpuppet of Israelbeach, (as anyone who supports Israelbeach has been labeled a sockpuppet without any evidence.)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am Dr. Mike Cohen. I am a PR spinmaster by trade and a scholar by night. I am not notable in the encyclopedic sense and I am all for the deletion of the reference that was posted by someone other than myself. I am not a Wiki user and really prefer to stay out of this fray. As has been said here by others there are thousands upon thousands of reserve majors in the Israel Defense Forces - I am only one of the guys.

Their first two cd's WERE on an indie record label but they sold very well, they are going to be releasing their next record on a swedish label 'kitty litter records'. There are lots of bands signed to indie labels on wikipedia 'From Bubblegum To Sky' being a prime example of this, so is musician 'Tess Wiley' her albums have also been onyl released on indie record labels and on her wikipedia site (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_Wiley" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_Wiley" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_Wiley</a>) there isnt even a list of her discography please consider leaving this up.</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Actually Tess Wiley was only a member of Sixpence None The Richer for one year, and she only released one CD with them 'This Beautiful Mess', and that was on a small indie record label called 'Rex Music', they did not acieve major success until many years later, also my other example 'From Bubblegum To Sky' is a good example, he has only released two cd's on an indie label, also 'Freezepop' is a good example, they are also on an indie label, heck, the members of the band 'Freezepop' still sell cd's on their website and post them out themselves. Baskervilles, while they are not the most popular band (they are one of my favourites), they have lots of listeners and fans, and i think they deserve a wikipedia article. also sorry about my edits on this page, i'm not very good at this coding stufffrombubblegumtosky</li>

<li><b>comment</b> that's my point Tony Fox, both 'From Bubblegum To Sky' and 'Baskervilles', although on indie labels, are very popular bands, information should be available on here about them, banning bands on indie labels from the wikipedia site is like banning movie info for films that were straight to dvd, Baskervilles have been mentioned in the london metro (the free newspaper you get on trains and buses) also the band have played out of new york city "The group made one trip outside of New York City in the summer of 2002 to perform at a museum opening at the Migros Museum in Zurich, Switzerland featuring the artwork of Yayoi Kusama and Michel Auder" they have lots of fans and their label, have got their music available in so many places, you can pick up their cd's in regular stores and in most popular onlien stores, heres a list of notable stores that sell baskervilles cds/mp3s... Emusic, ITunes, Amazon.com, AOL Music Now, Buy.com, Tower Records (and towerrecords.com), i mean, if the label they were signed to was really small, the baskervilles CD's wouldn;t have such a large distribution.Frombubblegumtosky</li>

<p><b>comment</b> well firstly, if it's not a vote then why does it matter if i put KEEP at the beggining of my sentence? i just put it there so people know my text is about keeping the article on Baskervilles on the site, i've never done this before and i know little about the technicalities, i put together the Baskervilles article mostly by copying and pasting codes, i'm just trying to get my point across on why i think it should stay here. Frombubblegumtosky</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the initial term of 'delete' or 'keep' (and others) expresses the general idea of comment the post is about to make reguarding the article. Repeatedly posting multiple comments where you intend your summary to be a 'keep' is misleeding to the administrator who has to review this. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 00:05, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Let me put it this way: it's not a vote in the sense that if X% of people say "keep" or "delete", that will determine the outcome of the discussion. However, the closing administrator does look for some sort of consensus, and repeated bolded use of the word "keep" by one contributor could confuse the administrator into thinking one side had more support than it did. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 00:49, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>comment</b> sigh... yes, but if this is not a vote, then it doesn't matter how many times <b>keep</b> is written, because it's not like the administrator is counting them, and as you can clearly see i do not oppose this anyway, i already changed all my <b>keep</b>s to <b>comment</b>s before you even wrote your message, anyway, i don;t think theres any point in arguing when i already did as asked, just please read the POINTS i am making on why this should be kept, as they are very good and a lot of the <b>delete</b> comments made here are pretty lame Frombubblegumtosky</p>
<p><b>comment</b> wait a second, it says at the top "This is a discussion among Wikipedia editors " does that mean that only what you lot think counts to whether this gets deleted or not? Frombubblegumtosky</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't be offended. However, often new users are unfamiliar with our deletion policies, and occasionally someone tells their friends about a deletion, who come and could make it appear that one side had more support. Thus, the closing administrators (who decide the outcome of the debate) often ignore the opinions of new or unregistered users. However, you are encouraged to express your views, and may convince other users in your favor. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 00:44, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>comment</b> so it is true then? unless i convince the majority of the editors, it'll get deleted? it's not like wikipedia is getting published to a book, i think the rules of wikipedia mean its hugely limiting itsself on how much information it can contain, when i first found wikipedia, i thought "heres a site where you can find everything" i guess i was wrong, i mean, blocking posting of information that is pointless and unknown is one thing, but to not allow an article on a band that are popular and that have two cd's released that are widely available in music stores in the usa and in dozens of popular online stores, thats not a good idea.Frombubblegumtosky</p>

<li><b>comment</b> i've paragraphd the text and removed the cd shop link, i really have no idea what else you meant, i am only just learning how to edit wikipedia and am unfamiliar with most of the terms, do you mean put a # at the beggining of the track names instead of numbers? and what do you mean by "Kill the non-NPOV"?

<li>You might find <a href="../../../h/o/w/WP%7EHOW_8408.html" title="WP:HOW">how to edit a page</a> helpful. NPOV means "Neutral point of view", so "non-NPOV" means biased.

<li>Another reccomendation: put links that are were actually used to write the article or check facts in a "References" section, instead of a "External links" section, per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#What_should_be_linked_to" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<p>Facts in the article are verifiable when looked at closely with an open mind. Webcity Resources, Ltd that Wachuku is Chairman of is also verifiable in Lagos, Nigeria - except that the Web site of the company is currently being upgraded and is not available for the moment. If that company is a problem, then as the contributor of the article, I can remove that sentence.

Also, after searching on Google, the only connection to the Nigerian UN delegation that I can find is that Mr. Wachuku is the webmaster of the delegation's website, a non-notable position. Being a nephew of a notable figure does not automatically make someone notable. Finally, the UNESCO Manifesto 2000 is a noteworthy document/event, but Mr. Wachuku did not achieve any renown by signing it. Therefore, the article fails both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> With every due respect and honour to <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a>, as Wikipedia policy states, the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOG_53bf.html" title="WP:GOOG">Google test</a> that he used is not conclusive evidence. A commendation letter Kofi Annan wrote to the author should not be verified by searching on google. Mr. Wachuku's work with the Nigerian UNESCO Delegation is also verifiable and is not about being webmaster. It's not Nigerian UN delegation as <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a> wrote above. There is a difference between the Nigerian Representative at the UN in New York - and the Nigerian Permanent Delegation to UNESCO in Paris, France. I've already explained Mr. Wachuku's company. And have also removed it from the article to avoid further unwarranted wrangling.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said earlier, objectivity counts here. And all the points <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a> makes above are not notable indeed too.

<p>The author spent years of research and toil writing The Great Place.

This article should not be deleted. I therefore humbly call for the removal of deletion notices on both the Ugonna Wachuku article and The Great Place article. Please, let us not just nominate articles for deletion without being objective and realistic in our views. Thank you and GOD bless you all abundantly with wisdom.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm going to address notability rather than the article's content or tone, which should (and must) be cleaned up if the article survives this AfD. This book described by this article does not seem to be sufficiently notable, per the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Note_on_notability_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">note on notability criteria in the book guidelines</a>. It was published through PublishAmerica, a vanity-press-style publisher; unfortunately, PublishAmerica does not seem to give out sales figures for its books; however, its single all-time-best-seller only sold 5,200 copies <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, indicating a much smaller figure for this book. Books from this publisher are printed only on-demand and are "sold" to libraries or bookstores (ie, as consignment model) by the authors themselves, apparently without upfront printing of any kind. This virtually ensures only the most minimal sort of distribution for books from this publisher. Certainly, libraries retain many new books they are given, and many authors from vanity presses donate their books to libraries, particularly those which the author feels the book has a particular connection to (say, the library of the US Diplomatic Mission to South Africa). However, you would have an extremely difficult time finding this book on a shelf in a physical bookstore, or being purchased by a major library for addition to its collection. The basic rule for a book's notability, as cited <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Note_on_notability_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">here</a>, is "reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable". This book has no Amazon.com sales ranking , and I can't find a single major periodical's review of this book. Considering these factors in conjunction with its vanity-press status, I am forced to say that it's almost certainly neither "reasonably spread" nor "well-known". When it is published by a major publisher with a distribution system that is not "on-demand," and when several reviews of it appear in major periodicals, then it may be notable. I recommend deletion without prejudice on the grounds of nonnotability. Best, <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 18:42, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Yes, many people survive serious gunshot wounds... but very very few survive what amounts to a traumatic hemispherectomy and make such an (almost) complete recovery. And he is well known... so well known in fact that I've said "Have you heard about Ahad can't-remember-his-other-name" to people and they know who I mean straight away, and I'm hardly local to Dayton, Ohio, coming from South West England.

<li>I personally don't like requirements for notability such as "notable alumni", if for no other reason than it would confuse new editors who want to know why their school article is being deleted if those other ones can stay.

After all, there are notable -authors- who should (and do) have articles, but we delete the nonnotable ones all the time, etc. etc. Anyway, the only suggestion of notability that occurs in this article is in reference to the school's size (student population of ~2,100). OK, my local McDonalds gets more than 2,100 customers a day -- does that mean it should have a page, too? Of course not. Anyway, if this school actually becomes notable (and the article makes the case for it), I'll be the first to change my vote.

<dd>Well I subscribe to the punk and indie mp3 newgroups and their album is requested periodically. I won't say I have seen it a lot, but I have seen it requested maybe four times in the past year, which is more than quite a few other request numbers - their song War To The Rhythm of W.H.Auden is the only one I have ever seen requested as a single song, so there may be SOME truth to the claim of popularity, I don't know<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">loveandearth</a></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had already tagged two albums from this group with "speedy delete" but then was unsure if I should do that with the band itself, or whether I should tag it for an AfD discussion. The albums were Will We Always Be Blind Idiots? and...hmm, I can't find the 2nd album. Neither album gave any indication of "importance or significane", which seemed to merit a Speedy Delete. The article for the band, however, comes closer to asserting such importance, so I hestitated about how to tag it.

<dd>This person's comment can't be possible - the Chicago band Christ! has only ever had one album, a live album that came out some months ago (can't be sure - maybe January or February).

<dd>Well I agree with the earlier opinion. From a musical standpoint, Christ! is probably not a groundbreaking band, though as it turns up for almost every political demonstration in Chicago and hands out cool flyers with socialist messages written like poems it has certainly been a felt presence in Chicago culture. I think Christ! is better known for its unusual way of distributing music by handing out its CDs to people for free on the streets. Who in Chicago hasn't seen them handing out CDs in Wicker Park or at music festivals or outside the Chicago Metro when fans are lining up to see a punk band especially? So this band should not be listed if musical merit is a consideration, but for its influence alone upon the Chicago music scene it should surely merit some listing, no? Not sure I know the Wikipedia procedures enough on that matter to make a further opinion <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">loveandearth</a></dd>

<dd>Well I don't think a cursory viewing of their myspace is a good way to judge their popularity as it appears to be a brand-new site. So far they seem to have two very well-known musicians as friends, though, Crass and Patrik Fitzgerald! So they certainly seem to be starting on a good footing! The prior statement that their own website doesn't mention the song does not appear true. When I last visited the site their entire album was available for free, which is their policy. They are an official non-profit organization in Illinois, I believe, or used to be, though I did not verify that recently (but I did half a year ago when I first heard their CD). <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">User:loveandearth</a></dd>

<p>Well I'll stay out of this debate. But I was sure happy to see Christ! mentioned in this encyclopedia when I visited it this morning and was sad to see it was going to be deleted! This band is so mysterious and tries so hard to maintain secrecy, that seeing it listed was a nice surprise. They turn up at political demonstrations wearing colorful and weird clothes and passing out hopeful messages to the public, as they do with their music. I think they do deserve at least a mention, especially as the CD is such a good one. It is probably one of the best punk CDs I have ever heard, easily as good as Crass or the Buzzcocks or the Clash. So visionary and catchy. It certainly deserves at least a mention in my view. But I'll leave the vote to the rest of you, as I simply wanted to leave my opinion. I am not an official voter, not sure how this wikipedia thing works... good luck!! <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">User:loveandearth</a></p>
<p>Just found this article on Christ! that said it might be deleted. That would be a shame, in light of the contributions Christ! has made to punk music on the southside of Chicago (e.g., the birth of Discorporate Records, other free releases by bands such as Tras De Nada, and their inspiring politics). dannybyrd</p>

<p>I am following this debate, but it seems sad that Christ! can't have its own entry, given its musically brilliant CD. I am wondering if the name is turning people off, given voters' possible religious orientations. I think this entry is getting short shrift (e.g., one voter claming he can't find the music when it is patently there on their website, or one person describing their opening cartoon on their website as "drivel" - his bias clearly, nothing to do with the merits of whether or not Christ! should have an entry in the encyclopedia!). This band is admittedly a band that only locals in Chicago or those downloading their anti-Iraq War song (or listening to it at anti-war demos) know about, but given the significant artistic merits of their album Will We Always Be Blind Idiots? why does that matter? They obviously exist, they obviously produce excellent music, so why shouldn't those listening to the songs online and wondering about them not have the opportunity to find out a little more about them and their tradition and politics in the encyclopedia? I have seen far lesser bands on Wikipedia (though I won't argue they shouldn't be there - if the entires inform the public about their music, that seems to me one valid purpose of a modern online encyclopedia).

The article therefore, for me, failed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> too. The only thing that caused my Delete vote was lack of any verifiable evidence. I do not have all day to look for evidence of one band's claimed notability I'm afraid. I certainly don't get rattled by a band's name.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And there is no reason Christ! could not rise again. But it would have to be with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> content. Then no one will have to dredge the net for reasons to keep the article. It will all be there, right on the page. I even suggested a starting-point - build something on the scene as a whole, and spin off individual band articles as they grow and gain their own identity. That's generally how things work round here, from what I've observed. I hope you choose to work on it, and I wish you good luck. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 18:24, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a quick note on finding no songs. Yes there is a long cartoon but after that, songs. To bypass the cartoon, just go to</p>

<p>and then click Back to Christ! on the bottom left. I suppose the band is not deemed notable, as you stated. Besides the local papers, some punk websites and punk station DJs reviewing the album very favorably, I cannot think of anything else that would make the band notable in light of their refusal to be signed or sold. Anyway, interesting following this discussion. I like the band but am not a follower, exactly.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia does not ignore the porn industry. The industry and its more conspicuous performers are, by long-established precedent, considered notable. This particular performer has ample screen credits. Moreover, her physical attributes perhaps count as two arguments&#160;:) in favor of notability, in the same way that a List of the world's tallest people would be notable. Community members should be careful not to label things as nonnotable just because they personally find them of interest.

<li>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia-"After a point, splitting an article into separate articles and leaving adequate summaries is a natural part of growth for a topic" The fact that some airlines have restrictions on ferrets , and some countries have laws about travelling with ferrets is every bit as encyclopedic as the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> article's listing of which states outlaw ferrets. The length of the ferret article justifies the split. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a>
<ul>
<li>Also from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>, I don't think this deserves an article on its own. Why not add a section to the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> page which states that transporting ferrets between countries may be restricted. Wiki doesnt need to list which of the worlds airlines allow ferrets and which dont. Let anyone who wants to know contact the customs of the country they wish to go to and the airline with which they want to travel.

<ul>
<li>The fact that someone planning a trip would have to call customs and ALL the major airlines and spend hours on hold just to find out this information means that it is useful information to some people, and it is information that people would have an interest in looking up. As such it is neither "cruft" nor "indiscriminate". Your argument is that it does not belong here because someone can get the same information by spending a day on the telephone to various agencies. By the same argument NO ARTICLE would belong in Wikipedia because someone could get the same information by spending a day in a library. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a> 20:52, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The problem with that is that Wikitravel is not part of Wikimedia, and as the two have different licenses it is not appropriate to cut and paste or to move articles bstween the two. This article was originally a subsection of the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> article, and within the context of that article it made perfect sense. While I agree that the ferret article is long enough to warrant this being split off of it, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia" states that splitting articles is completely appropriate, it appears that this article is going to be shot down. If it is going to be deleted, then the contents could at least be moved back into the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> article, as this information would make sense and be useful within the context of that article. But honestly, most of the "delete" voters appear to be merely jumping on the bandwagon without having even bothered to read this article or the related <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> article.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a> 20:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On what basis do you make that claim? Again, as stated above, the Ferret article is <i>not</i> to long to accomodate what little salvageable material there is in this article. Featured articles are often substantially longer. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 22:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first comment appeared one minute after you had nominated the article for deletion. The "rodentcruft" comment showed absolutely no knowledge of ferrets which demonstrates that that person did not read the articles. The <a href="../../../d/a/f/WP%7EDAFT_7d33.html" title="WP:DAFT">WP:DAFT</a> vote showed that that person missed the point entirely. Even the person who was on my side but suggested a "ferrets as pets" article missed the point because the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> article is primarily about "ferrets as pets" (as a fully domesticated animal they are kept primarily as pets). None of these people got here from looking up information on ferrets. They saw the listing on "articles for deletion", took a quick glance at the article, and voted before bothering to find out what the article was about or the context in which it was written. <s>Your nomination and your comments on the other hand were in good faith.</s> The essential argument was that it should have remained a subsection of that article rather than being branched out into its own. My opinioon on that issue is that that would have worked either way. Wikipedia's policy is that branching out articles is completely acceptable. A personal style preference as to how long you feel an article should be, does not justify taking such a drastic step as calling in administrators to erase someone's article. As to the "cruft" and "not encyclopedic" arguments, I would say that this has a niche interest. Not everyone is interested in knowing this information, but some people-namely ferret owners- are. To those people it is useful information that they would have an interest in looking up. I have no interest in the characters of <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_SquarePants_f415.html" title="SpongeBob SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>, but that does not give me the right to try to have the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_SpongeBob_SquarePants_characters_acd9.html" title="List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters">List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters</a> erased. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a> 01:05, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I lined out the comment that this article was nominated in good faith.

<li><b>Comment</b> I made the suggestion to rename. The very title of this article does, I'm afraid, make it seem a silly topic, and that doesn't help its survival chances. It also seems to fail the guideline that advises against articles about "extremely specific details which only a dedicated few care about" (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_bad_article_ideas_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas">Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas</a>). Reading the article, it became clear to me that this article has very limited growth prospects and should probably just be merged back to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a>. Contrary to what you are suggesting, I did indeed read the both this and the Ferret article, and I assumed this article had been split from the main because the main one was becoming too large. I therefore looked for precedents in other animal/pet articles on Wikipedia that may help this article's case, because as a choice for splitting from a main article, this one is a bad one IMO. I felt the pets part of the Ferret article could very well gain its own article (there is precedent with <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouse.html" title="Mouse">Mouse</a>/<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancy_mouse.html" title="Fancy mouse">Fancy mouse</a>), leaving behind details of "ferret the animal". I personally doubt that such an article would ever end up on AfD. I don't think this article has such a survival chance. You appear to hint that my suggestion was made in bad faith. Certainly is not the case. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 04:40, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The name of this article has changed, as well as the topic matter. This is no longer a discussion about an article which itself debates the credibility of claims about its author, but instead about the history of some book. Since the name of the article has changed, I advise that you also change the name of this AfD since it looks rather confusing. Thanks.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The name of the article has been altered, with the words "Jesus Christ as Source" being replaced with "Authorship", though the topic matter has remained the same. Wikipedia allows for the changing of the names of articles, though the articles are recognized as sharing continuity with their previous names; this is why the article history lists all edits made while the article had a previous title. This is a discussion about the source of <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a>, a book that has sold over one million copies, been translated into over a dozen languages, and has generated many best selling books of interpretation. Whether the name of this deletion nomination request is changed or not does not change the fact that the article with its present title is the same article as it was when it had the previous title, and therefore this article has been nominated twice for deletion, a situation found by most editors on this page to be very unusual indeed (note the suggestions for "speedy keep"). While the article has certainly grown, it remains the same article and remains concerned with the same topic. You see, Wikipedia allows for editing, which often involves expansion and growth. In fact, expansion and growth is actually <i>encouraged</i> on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 10:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> Isn't this article baffling? It's continually being attacked from EVERY DIRECTION. It's a bit surreal. Obviously, it's struck quite a nerve with a lot of people. In my opinion, the most interesting case has been Ste4k, who suggested that the article is not notable, and when contacted he himself referred to this as simply being "some article" about "some book". After slapping just about every sentence with a "verify credibility" tag, he's off to the main <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> page, slapping every sentence there with a "citation needed" tag. It's really quite astonishing. Just when one person is done going on a rant about this article, someone else comes along. This deletion attempt is a perfect example.... Anyway, yes, more neutral people here would be wonderful. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 07:00, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Addendum</b> The user by the name of Ste4k <i>really</i> doesn't like A Course In Miracles. After refusing to listen to reason on this "authorship" page, after slapping just about every other sentence of the main page with a "citation needed" tag, he/she is off to the page about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Foundation_for_Inner_Peace_34f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Foundation for Inner Peace">Foundation for Inner Peace</a> and trying to get it deleted by saying it is not notable. Ste4k has said that none of this is personal and he/she doesn't have an attachment to any of this; just doing his/her "job". But obviously he/she has a real investment here in saying that ACIM isn't notable, despite loads of evidence that it is. Fascinating. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> After editing each and every citation in this article and checking each reference including name and address of owner, reading each article, and etc., as the logs will bear out, I made appropriate and factual edits with comments. I prefer 0RR as a philosphy and haven't much concern or time to play revert games. I asked what was the importance of this book and instead of giving me a simple answer, I was left to perform that investigation for myself. I have a NPOV on this topic matter, but I have a strong POV about the presentation of original research when it comes to this encyclopedia. It doesn't matter to me whether the book, or it's stories, or the claims of several insignificant web sites are true or not. But whatever is used as a citation and reference must be used as the material in the article. Anything less, should simply be deleted if for no other reason than to allow an opportunity for authors to do more research on their topics. Ste4k 08:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I wonder, why is it only <i>you</i> who continually accuse these ACIM-related articles of being "original research" and not being "verifiable." It doesn't seem to me that anyone else makes these claims. And, by the way, I'm not the only one who has made this comment about you. These pages you are attempting to destroy are not "original research." Rather, they are about a topic you do not like and are apparently obsessed with getting rid of. Well, have at it, but you're going to fail. ACIM has sold too many copies, has too many followers, too many critics, and has too strong of a presence on the Internet for you to claim that it is not notable and not verifiable. Basides, aren't you late for the local <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie.html" title="Trekkie">Trekkie</a> convention? -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 08:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Curiosity</b> Perhaps if you would take some time to show the verifiability in the article I might change my vote. Whether this article remains alive or not matters little to me. What matters is a well rounded high quality encyclopedia. I was not the one that nominated this article for deletion. I was the one that put the facts from the cites which were quoted into the article. And this would actually be a good place for you to explain your edit summary. Such as the reason why the court case mentioned had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;offset=20060625194312&amp;limit=7&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;offset=20060625194312&amp;limit=7&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">plaintiff confused with the defendant</a>, or why you insisted on using the word "widely" when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60459899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60459899" rel="nofollow">first three sources only exist in Texas</a>, or why was it you don't feel I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60594722" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=60594722" rel="nofollow">important enough to speak with in Discussion</a>, or why you delteted that contradiction tag without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60530702" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60530702" rel="nofollow">explaining it in the article</a>, or why most of the cites you listed hadn't their actual titles, or why you had listed them with without any mention who wrote them. Did you not, here, in this very conversation scream at me that you had <b>TEN OUTSIDE SOURCES and is not "original research"</b>? Why were they all in only three books? Please stop harassing me now, I have better things to do than answer your questions. Thanks. Ste4k 10:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This person is without a doubt the strangest and most annoying person I've ever met on the Internet. After he/she paid a great deal of attention to many ACIM articles (which means slapping just about every sentence with a "citation needed" tag), I contacted him/her on his/her talk page. The response I got was that he/she hardly remembers his/her comments about "some article". Later, I was told to "stop harassing" him/her, when in fact all I had done was attempt to understand why he/she will not trust any source offered. (Sources that he/she has not found acceptable have been found acceptable by many others.) I'm really at a loss with this person. Hopefully, others will keep an eye on him/her as well. For some unknown reason, he/she wants to destroy all ACIM-related articles. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In addition to supporting the deletion of this page and attempting to get the page about Foundation for Inner Peace deleted, this person is also behind deletion attempts of the article about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>. I'd like to know what it is about ACIM that this person finds so unappealing. Oh, and on this person's talk page they are whining to someone that I am part of "some advocacy group" or something (fascinating how on one hand this person whines about the need for verifiable facts, and then turns around and makes such unverified statements; I'm a part of NO advocacy group), and then says I am harassing him/her. And apparently someone is "collecting information" on me and my "harassment" of this person. In reality, it isn't harassment but an attempt to understand why he/she will not be reasonable and accept perfectly decent citations. But I suppose that's a futile attempt, because this person, apparently, doesn't like to explain his/her real motives. His/her own personal Wikipedia page contains the weird self-description: "Explaining anything about myself personally would violate my neutrality", as though his/her own talk page is an actual Wikipedia article that would be debated by others. Weird. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Incidentally, the sister article <b>Infoterm</b> is similarly a word-for-word dump of the company's promotional PDF <a href="http://www.infoterm.info/about_us/history_of_infoterm.php" class="external text" title="http://www.infoterm.info/about_us/history_of_infoterm.php" rel="nofollow">available for download here</a>. Infoterm has been a candidate for deletion before, but I don't know how to find the log (am just going to have a look), nor do I know exact WP policy on unadulterated text dumps of promo material like this.

So I guess this one's "contested" too. I'm not sure how to do these AfDs, so if anyone wants to help out, that would be great.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This seems to be a single hotel, which do not usually merit their own articles (unless this is a chain?). Anyways, the "this was kept so this should be kept" argument is one of my least favorite things to read on AFD and the case he mentions is a year old anyway. Imo, CalJW's arguments don't really work either - we don't keep articles based on how "interesting" the subject could potentially be. Also, there have been no sources presented claiming anything, so thusfar this is all original research. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 18:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't think anyone has given a reason to believe that it is notable, yet you all vote "keep" because of its supposed notability. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:02, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What gave you that idea? I didn't say anything about "notability". Please define "notable" and explain why a Belgrade hotel should be "notable" to someone who lives in my country. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which bit of the 'per above' were you referring to then? <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInner_Earth_8c4b.html" title="User:Inner Earth">Inner Earth</a> 10:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The two keep comments that don't use meaningless terms such as "notable". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 11:05, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now I'm totally confused. You (JJay) vote "Keep per above". The "above" is the Keep by Vegaswikian, which uses as its argument to keep that it appears to be notable. If you feel that it is a meaningless term and you feel that I have the need to define notability, then why did you vote like you did? As for the other Keep comments, being a 5star hotel is no reason for inclusion (there are at least four of those in Belgrade, so that's not very unique), and "most likely having an interesting history"... until someone can give us resources on that interesting history, this is idle speculation, and thus not verifiable. As far as I can see, the hotel was built in 1979, closed during the Yugo wars, and will reopen in december 2006 (yes, it isn't even opened now). <a href="http://www.leisuretracker.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.leisuretracker.com/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, for your confusion. To be perfectly clear, I disagree with you, but agree with <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKrytan_aaa6.html" title="User:Krytan">Krytan</a>. They gave perfectly satisfactory reasons for keeping this article. You have given a few more- i.e. closed during war. What you haven't given is a definition that we can all live with - meaning for people in every country where wikipedia is accessible - for "notability" regarding hotels. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In which case I encourage you to participate in the discussion of a proposed notability guidelines for hotels at <a href="../../../h/o/t/WP%7EHOTELS_989b.html" title="WP:HOTELS">WP:HOTELS</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 19:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>When it becomes a guideline I'll take it into consideration. When it becomes policy I will abide by it. Until such time, I will continue to view "notability" as a non-existant concept not worth discussing. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:13, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like the community opinion on this one. The article appears to be a vanity one relating to the Wachuku family generally - see AfD on Ugonna Wachuku above. While she has made positive contributions to education in Nigeria, I feel there is inadequate notability for an encyclopedia article. I am unable to verify (but don't actually doubt) some teaching awards in secondary schools and a religious knowledge workbook. If the subject had been European, I would just have put a prod tag on the article so there may be some reverse systemic bias at work here.</p>

<p>Self-promotion of group that does not seem to have much recognition outside their own circle.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Screening at the Philadelphia Film Festival which, by a rough estimation, ran about 250 films this year, does not constitute notability in any way. This film has 1 review and 8 ratings on the Festival's website. (It currently has a 3, by the way, with 3 5s, 3 1s, a two, and a four.) The runnning time of the film is two minutes, and there is no claim that its content is particular original or groundbreaking. Simply being from a city "which is not known for its sketch comedy" -- whatever that means -- is not enough to make this group notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> We live in a society today where things are constantly created and destroyed, and if something is not up to the public's socially constructed standards of quality, it is destroyed. Therefore, from a psychological point of view it seems natural that there would be an urge to destroy this article as its notability does not seem to match up with those standards. But before deleting this, please think of the children. Think of little Johnny from Laramie, Wyoming who comes from a lower middle class family and doesn't have internet access at home but is very bright and has a yearning for obscure trivia knowledge so he sneaks out to the public library just so he can access Wikipedia. If you delete this article, little Johnny and all the other children just like him will be deprived of ever knowing about Shabadelphia, and if that happens, let it be on the heads of the people who voted "Delete".

<dd>I'm actually responsible for nominating two of the Belgrade hotels because I just happened to look there and it so happens that a few of those articles simply include travel info like number of rooms, location and services to guests. That's content for WikiTravel as stated in the guidelines. Interestingly, the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chateau_Frontenac_9396.html" title="Chateau Frontenac">Chateau Frontenac</a> that you proposed for deletion is a perfect example of a hotel that deserves an article.

<dd>You have nothing to worry about, the Chateau Frontenac won't even get deleted in the end. Instead of nominating an article for deletion, you could have requested a re-write maybe. However, you go along nominating for deletion instead, because apparently it reads like an ad. Well, how else would you describe the hotel without listing the number of rooms and location? By the way, yes, I've removed the afd from the Frontenac.

Furthermore the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">precedents</a> specifically mention that as a general rule information about hotels belongs in WikiTravel.

They also went on several self-funded local and broad tour of the middle U.S. in their five year existence. The Connie Dungs did not achieve widespread fame in their brief existence, but they did acheive a foothold in the underground (as evidenced by their 20+ releases on multiple popular underground labels). Even now, six years after their breakup, they continue thrive in the underground pop punk world (as evidenced, in part, by the apparent high # of Ghits). Additionally, there were several red links leading to the blank "Connie Dungs" wikipedia page (I was inspired to create the page after reading up on Connie Chung and noticing the red link there) <a href="../../../c/d/a/User%7ECDaniel_7b46.html" title="User:CDaniel">CDaniel</a> Friday, 2006-06-23 T 17:20 UTC</li>

The web site itself hasn't any notability and it is self serving financially to be providing any data about whom it has hired. Therefore if the <b>subject</b> of the article is the actress then we haven't any reliable source. Also per verifiability that source is the only source available. The ambiguity of the matter itself serves to show that regardless of how many hits or ratings are performed, nobody can determine if it is the site or the actress that is being counted. Certainly one might say here, the <b>people</b> are supplying <b>hits</b> for both together. But if that is the case, then there is no source for the article at all. And in the final analysis, the actress is not quotable as a <b>source</b> for herself, or for the site. Logically and reasonably here, then, notability is key in understanding the basis for deletion. Hope you had a cup of coffee before you decided to read all of that. Thanks Eagle_101!</li>

When you can tell me what her name is and prove it by notable cited resources, then at least we will have a single fact. This is also not about a web site. This is about ambiguity as well as policy. Here is the exact reason that the article was nominated: Information on Wikipedia must be reliable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles may not contain any previously unpublished data. The web page itself must therefore be a reliable source. If you cannot argue against that, then you have missed the point.

<li>Here's my argument, why does Tiffany Teen have such a long article. Why is she notable? Its because she was immensely popular, just like Nikki.Letsgomets1212 11:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Whether or not some other non-related article is or is not notable is clearly a different matter. If you believe however, as you point out, that there is doubt to that other person's notability, then per the written policy at this time you <b>should</b> nominate that article for deletion on the same grounds. You mention the reason for the answer to notability as "immensely popular". The question then becomes simple. Is there a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reptutible source</a> that states this? Because if we here use Google and Alexa, then we are ourselves in this discussion committing acts of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li>You people have no lives. Who cares?! She is obviously popular. Alexa and Google are not original research, they are places that show a site is popular based on ranking. What source could I find? So what your telling me is if i can find a source that states she popular, that would be credible? I don't think so. This website is an encyclopedia. It is meant to give people information on as many topics as possible. Are you going to lose sleep knowing that ONE article is on Wikipedia that you believe shouldn't be? Instead of deleting the article, someone with a knowledge of her should come in and write something decent. Let's face it, there is no credible source that can tell you if someone is popular or not. In my opinion, Alexa is a great resource for popularity. The #3,025 website in the world is not to shabby for a internet NN model, hmmm, maybe she is notable? Besides, there are few articles on here for teen models, a few notable ones should be kept.-Letsgomets1212 15:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Seems somewhat obsolete software to me, completely restricted to Windows 95 (which is no longer supported by Microsoft).

<li><b>Comment</b> Further research seems to suggest that this software may well work with later operating systems, but cannot handle Word files beyond Windows 95 vintage. The problem with merging with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wordpad.html" title="Wordpad">Wordpad</a> is that Wordpad is a long-standing and current product that now incorporates many of the "advanced features" of this software itself, and handles all Word formats out of the box too. Merging this somewhat inconsequential software product into Wordpad properly would simply result in a screenshot and explanation that, above and beyond Wordpad, this product has spell checking and thesaurus, but cannot handle most Word files on the planet. Also the two download links on the article are now defunct. This article simply contains such limited useful information about such a limitedly useful product of no notability that the best course IMO is deletion. I feel proponents of merging are not fully appreciating the fact that this article's text is totally out-of-date, as are its external links. There's nothing useful to merge. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 04:55, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - and elucidate compatibility concerns - AFAIK, Wordpad itself is nowhere near fully compliant with current Word files either, at least I recall some pretty major formatting screwups when trying to use the MS Wordpad as a viewer. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Risk_7eea.html" title="User:Ace of Risk">Ace of Risk</a> 14:20, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suspect that the original author chose the article's title from the nickname given to this posture at the South Carolina military school that xe attends. (Read the first version of the article.) A more formal and widely recognized name is "<a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brace.html" title="Military brace">military brace</a>", which is of course where this article belongs. There are yet more formal names still, as the article explains. It is a recognized posture, that is amply covered, under several names, in medical literature. The article cites sources that can be checked to confirm this. A modicum of research will turn up hundreds more. This is an encyclopaedia article about a concept, a particular posture of the human body, not a dictionary article about a word or a phrase. The argument that this is a "dicdef" is fallacious. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm convinced it's more than just a dicdef. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 19:02, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep main, redirect confederations.</b> With all of these pages, the question is not <i>if</i> they should exist but <i>when</i> they should exist. I think it is a little premature to be doing detailed pages on each confederation's qualifying results; once games begin, that's when they'll be appropriate. Accordingly, <i>redirect the UEFA, OFC and CONMEBOL pages</i> listed above to the main page (per ZZyzx11). However, the main page can serve as a gathering point for that information as it becomes available. The fact that there are confederations changes, for example, is worthy of inclusion there (Australia going from OFC to AFC). As slot allocations become known, they can be gathered on this page. Therefore, <i>keep the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_3cf2.html" title="2010 FIFA World Cup qualification">2010 FIFA World Cup qualification</a> main page</i>. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 21:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep main, redirect confederations</b> as per above.

<li><b>Keep</b> (obviously, as I created the article). It is a new award (created in September 2005) and that is why there are not many Google hits for it. Looking at other Rivaly Awards, the Michigan MAC Trophy article has more information than some.

<dd>Stubbiness was not given as a reason for the deletion, so to dismiss it on trhat grounds is a strawman. As for thre being already many on Wikipedia, that's a pity, but again no reason to keep this one. If the other ones fail the notability prerequisites, they should be deleted as well. If they, on the other hand, have more notability (say, like the Oxford - Cambridge boat race, to take an extreme example), then they can be kept. College rivalty trophies as such can hardly be considered notable.

<dd><b>comment</b>: Hey guys - sorry to have caused a problem here. Honestly didn't know exactly what a site needed to be considered notable! If you want to take it down, I'm more than happy for you to - if you can give me some idea of what might be considered notable (in your personal opinions - i've now read the somewhat unclear guidelines) then that would be even more useful! I'm very busy this weekend (and indeed at the moment), so I'm happy to leave it to you for now, but if you can somehow leave comments, that would be great. Again, apologies. PS If you hadn't guessed, I'm new to this. Ahmedbadrnestoria

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It's all a matter of how you define notability. A search in Google for 'nestoria' reveals a number of mentions in geocoding and realestate blogs across the world. The main reason is that they support open source software and people consider them a relatively good blend of Web 2.0 technology and user exprience.

<dd>You do realize that all terms are neologisms when they are new? Right? Are you aware of that? Any technical term used in a specific field, say, that is under (let's say) a year old could be called a neologism.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure there is lots of idiocy you have to sift through in keeping an eye on the wikipedia .. but ..</dd>

<p><br />
Note, you guys can and should do absolutely whatever you want.</p>
<p>For what it's worth:</p>
<p>(1) it is an actual term, used commonly in the specific field. I can't be more clear than that. It has nothing to do with "original research," I'm just reporting on an (arcane, if you will) term. (As mentioned, note that there is no other term for, well, hyplish, than hyplish. What else do you call it when someone is deliberately trying to pretend thy speak English badly? "pseudo-Engrish" maybe?)</p>
<p>(2) comments like "made up in school" are really embarassing.</p>
<p>The exact impression such comments convey is that:</p>
<p>(*) Wiki owners are jokers who have no substance or experience in life, and their only pwer and glory is deleting lamer wiki articles. I'm assuming you DON'T WANT TO give that impression.</p>
<p>I encourage you to simply refrain from such expressions, if you want to appear more adult. A good trick if you want ot appear more adult is to, generally, refrain and act "above" things. That will help you appear more adult.</p>
<p>(3) I can ABSOLUTELY understand that you poor guys have to delete idiocy about nazis and the like day in and day out. But it's worth bearing in mind that a light touch is needed. In the current situation you are deleting a term, farily obscure and specialized, that is nervetheless real, because (not unreasonably) I imagine you get idiots trying to fake up wiki entries all day!</p>
<p>Definitely delete it altogether thought, it is YOUR wiki with YOUR standards</p>

<p>"Bioregional State" as a term seems to be almost exclusively used by Mark Whitaker's book/webpages "Towards a Bioregional State". The "Bioregional State" info on the website is <i>not</i> his published or peer-reviewed work, or his doctoral dissertation, and appears to be a collection of essay-type material, email conversations, etc. The book (which apparently is based on this) is self-published (iUniverse), ranked something like #1,500,000 at Amazon, and almost certainly would be nowhere near the 5000-copy test. I can find little or no other usage of the phrase "Bioregional State" aside from the expected "hall of mirrors" link effect from the website, Amazon, etc. I originally reconverted this entry from a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioregional_democracy.html" title="Bioregional democracy">bioregional democracy</a> (a very problematic article in itself), but even the two sections I tagged there appear to have existed before the "Bioregional State" phrasing was added, and in any case if "Bioregional State" <i>is</i> a non-notable term the point is moot either way. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 17:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Power level (Dragon Ball Z) per Ben Standeven. The other article is more complete about what a power level is, and thus about what the "power" in Dragon Ball is, how it's used, etc. This article is redundant, and merely a list without much explanations, which goes against "<a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>". Also the main aim of this article seems to be listing only power level from the manga and discarding any other source (which are nonetheless in the canon). This doesn't seem very neutral to me.<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 12:46, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The other article doesn't include any extrapolation (except unsourced bit of interviews) and every number given is indeed canon.

<li><b>Comment</b> It does have extrapolations. Vegeta is never stated as having a powerlevel of 180,000 as an Oozaru, and yet it is stated there. And it's common sense. I'm not debating the validity of the other article. I am discussing the deletion, and have already voted. I am not "avenging" anything, or arguing. If you wish to make personal commentary again, then use my talk page, please.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The anime stated that the Ōzaru is base power x 10. But if we are to talk about that, maybe it would be better to do it in the discussion of that precise article <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 22:24, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep them all.</b> School districts are notable because they spend a lot of money and employ a lot of people. Many of the school district articles should be flagged as {{US-school-stub}}, but if the district articles exist, it's a lot easier to add information about lawsuits, strikes, criminal prosecutions and other news related to a specific school district. I added an introductory paragraph to Englewood Schools, but couldn't find out other details (number of students, number of staff, names of members of the school board) from the district's web site.) <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> 20:51, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep All</b>. I have my doubts about the inherent notability of <i>schools</i>, but I've got no aversion to articles for <i>school districts</i>. Most schools (not all) really ought to be mentioned on nothing more than a list of schools in an article on the school district. School districts are a form of a political division within a state or province (or other similar unit). They usually require elections and have significance in that regard and in regard to education policy as a whole. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:52, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm really amused some people would think I'm some "adherent" to Suntola or even Suntola himself. For some reason, the professional or more involved contributors I expected haven't appeared, and the current version is essentially what I - not a physicist - read from the author's site. So, it can't be very good, and I agree, would deserve deletion citing quality alone if it were a full article, but as a stub I doubt it's exceptionally bad. Nevertheless, notability is a problem, since the application (satellite embedded computing) is highly specialized. --<a href="../../../v/u/o/User%7EVuo_9d94.html" title="User:Vuo">Vuo</a> 21:05, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If not a vanity or OR issue the article is not notable and also misleading. It is not notable: there are a lot of 'crackpot' theories on the net, as this theory claims to be an alternative to GR and QM it would only become notable and differentiated from 'crackpot theory' if published in accepted peer reviewed journals (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> ) at the very least. This theory has not been. Furthermore the article title could be misleading as the phrase "dynamic universe" is used in cosmology to refer either to the standard Friedmann expanding, non-static universe ('dynamic' as opposed to 'static') or, more recently, in brane theory, to refer to the dynamical motion of 'branes', or individual universes. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarthbarber_31b1.html" title="User:Garthbarber">Garthbarber</a> 11:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the better of the <i>RuneScape</i> articles. Although the vandals keep trying to put the game guide information back in, it is watched constantly and kept to a NPOV and non-game guide level most of the time. Mining is a very significant skill in the game. There are several <i>RuneScape</i> articles that may be redundant or unnecessary (i.e. the articles on specific monsters), but this one deserves to be kept, IMO. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 08:51, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "only of interest / use to 'X'" - the same can be said of articles on almost any topic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The designation "vanity regulations" that are allegedly "violated" is made up by nominator. These are guidelines that are meant to help us determine when something is a vanity article. In this case, even though written by the originator of the theory, I don't think it qualifies as such. Editors are strongly discouraged from writing about their own work, but there is no <i>rule</i> forbidding this, and it does not <i>automatically</i> disqualify the article. The search term ["self creation cosmology" OR "self creation cosmologies" -wikipedia -answers.com] gets 131 unique Google hits, and 59 Google scholar citations. The article is referenced and written from a reasonably neutral point of view, and might have been written by anyone sufficiently familiar with this work. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't see the issue here as vanity. It is true that WP <i>does not absolutely forbid</i> an author writing or contributing to an article about himself or his own work, but the only exclusion that I would see for that is when the work is notable, has been widely reviewed and accepted by neutral parties elsewhere and the author, say, wants to make corrections in the article (since obviously he would know the subject matter best). In this case, however, I cannot find any objective reviews, wide acceptance or even awareness in the published literature of this work. If the article is kept, it would be a clear case of WP itself promoting a non-notable subject that was not properly reviewed by neutral 3rd parties, which I believe goes against the basic principles of WP's mission. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you wrote <i>per nom</i>, which suggested that you agreed with nominator's deletion rationale: "violation" of "vanity regulations" and "essentially original research". No reference there to notability. To start with the OR issue: if someone else had written the article, just reporting on this theory, it would not have qualified as OR. Why should it become OR when the reporter happens to be the originator of the theory? Then, why should the work "have been accepted by neutral parties elsewhere"? We have plenty of articles on theories for which this does not hold. As long as <i>our</i> reporting is neutral, it is fine. The present article does not attempt to suggest that the theory is widely accepted. On the contrary, it is pretty obvious, just from the text of the article, that the theory has <i>not</i> been widely accepted. In that sense, the reporting is quite neutral. The text also makes clear that the theory has unsolved problems. When the publications were peer reviewed, the reviewers (if they did their job) at least made sure that this was scientifically respectable, which includes distinguishing speculation as fact, not glossing over contrary evidence, and acknowledging other relevenat work. I did not try to trace the 60 or so scientific citations, but expect that among those some contain a critical review. It's not our business as Wikipedia to distinguish "good" theories and filter out the "bad" ones. If <i>others</i> claim a theory is bad, we report on that, within reason. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding my 'per nom' statement, I guess I was relying on this aspect of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>: "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created.

<dd>In my subsequent comment, I continued the argument that even if we ignore the vanity aspects, we still have the issue of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original work</a> and lack or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party evaluation</a>. I agree with you fully that WP should not judge technical merit of the actual subject, but we should judge the merit of the <i>evaluators</i> of the subject, since we can only accept <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and we must be able to judge <i>reliability</i>. In this case, I don't see any reliable, objective, neutral source that has evaluated this subject. If no such source can be found, then this article becomes <i>primary</i> or <i>secondary</i> at best, not the required <i>tertiary</i> level article that is needed for WP encyclopedic inclusion. Are there other articles in WP that don't pass these tests? More than likely, but it's our collective job to find them and either fix them up or delete them. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

If there is a reliable, objective, neutral source that has "evaluated" this theory (or, rather, family of theories), our article does not mention it. I won't recommend deleting it, though; I'm confident the article could be "fixed up" by someone who has access to a good physics library and the requisite background to understand what they're reading. I think that the same holds for the subject of this article, what with sixty-odd citations. And I think that "evaluation" is not really necessary, at least not as I understand the term: how would one evaluate <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>?

<dd>If we have <i>any</i> neutral reviewers, who are generally knowledgeable in the field of the the subject, who read and critique the subject paper (like typical peer reviewers) and the publisher of a reputable journal (in the scientific case) publishes the paper after that review, I would consider it properly reviewed by a reliable source. The reviewers do not necessarily have to <i>agree</i> with the author's position or results - they can provide a counter-position if they feel necessary. But if the publisher goes ahead after that peer review, and takes a chance on the reputation of the publishing house, then it becomes a legitimate secondary source. Then, assuming the journal has sufficient circulation to be notable, we as WP can pick up the article at the tertiary level. If we shortcut that process by accepting an article that did not undergo the peer review, then WP would stop being an encyclopedia IMO. Again, the issue is not merit per se, it is the need for WP to see some reputable publisher with neutral and capable reviewers review and publish the article before we do. In the case of String Theory, if hypothetically it just came out yesterday, WP would not and should not be the first to publish it, as tempting as it may seem. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:51, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think your interpretation of "original research" is too wide. "Original research" as anathema on Wikipedia means that Wikipedia is used as the medium to introduce and publish a new theory. But here we have a report on a theory that other sources have published before. These sources are "reliable" according to the criteria used on Wikipedia. Although the <i>subject</i> of the article is research that is arguably original, the article <i>itself</i> is not "original research".</dd>
<dd>As to the reliability of the peer review system, the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Hendrik_Sch%C3%B6n_46a7.html" title="Jan Hendrik Schön">Schön scandal</a> involved fraud in experimental physics, which is an entirely different matter. Here we have theoretical physics, where there is the <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_affair.html" title="Bogdanov affair">Bogdanov affair</a>. A published paper in this area might be a hoax, but it can hardly be fraud, since there are no lab reports or anything: all is in the open. But reviewers may fail to notice unbridged gaps or improper appeals to theorems. In any case, we as Wikipedians should not attempt to correct or outguess the experts who do the peer review. Everyone knows or should know that the fact that a statement is published in a peer-reviewed medium does not make it true. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree in general with all your points. My main concern is that with pure theory, based on math and assumptions that are not manifestly self evident (I would assume to most people), it is quite possible that there are errors in the derivation and hence the results could be quite flawed. Of course this is always true, but more so when it seems that less eyes and brains have digested and seriously critiqued the contents. I think an encycopedia, as a tertiary source, should steer clear of these scenarios and should strive as much as possible to have a neutral person (ideally persons) <i>presenting</i> the article. In this specific case we have the original author/inventor presenting, which is fraught with risks, even if we assume (as I do by default) best intentions, integrity and honesty. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> to Garthbarber: You seem to have a misunderstanding about WP inclusion criteria. You say we should "wait until the result of the Gravity Probe B geodetic precession is published (April 2007) until deciding". This is totally immaterial. Nowhere in WP policies are we to judge technical merit or base inclusion directly on results of experiments. Your 3rd party reference does seem OK, and seems to establish both notability and secondary sourcing. My main concern is with the fact that by you presenting the work here essentially exclusively, it constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original work</a>, and to some extent <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>, which are frowned upon, though are not absolute barriers to acceptability. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a> also becomes an issue, in principle, when the inventor is the sole author of the article. It would have been so much better from WP's perspective if a colleague could have presented the work, with you providing critique and correcting errors. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Ambivalent keep</b>. While I agree in principle with most of the above delete remarks, in practice on Wikipedia it is really hard to delete articles about non-notable crackpot theories. So why delete an article about a non-crackpot but fringe theory with a real publication record? I think instead the article ideally ought to be cleaned up by someone to conform with NPOV. Although I am realistic about the chances of that actually happening, I still can't support its outright deletion. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 14:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have been aware of this for some time and have expressed concern about the "conflict of interest" inherent in Garth writing about his own research. I haven't mustered interest/time/energy to get hold of original sources and study them so I can form my own opinion about whether his description violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, but I do have the superficial impression that he has been well-behaved (e.g. not spamming other articles) and don't recall noticing anything which suggested to me that he is editing in bad faith or anything like that. Still, I'd be a lot happier of someone was willing to take the time to look more carefully than I have into this. I also wish I had the sense that Garth is going to declare the article complete at some point. FWIW, I think the outcome should of this AfD should probably be reported as <i>inconclusive</i>, reserving the right to nominate it again without prejudice if problems should develop (which I hope won't happen since we have enough trouble from other quarters in the physics/cosmology categories).---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 09:52, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>PS: the article, as it is right now, in its early form (only a couple of days old), has references to other articles, has proper headings and wikification, has lots of paragraphs which are going to be well-written and larger in the future, has screenshots that show interesting facts about both route planning and the usage of tools to run through a game (as noted in <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrun</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedrun.html" title="Speedrun">speedrun</a>), has references, has notes... how could one possible suggest that it is a non-notable article when it has so many ties already, even in its early days of development?

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: As far my word as the author of the run can be trusted, there are no verifiability problems. The page is also beyond a stub. It is the embodiment of many tool-assisted speedrun -related concepts, which is why it makes a good article in my opinion, and provides informative content to those who read about the concepts. I do agree that it is not noteworthy on its own as a speedrun. There are no articles of other speedruns, that I know. As for "reliable source", the tool-assisted speedrun community, a member of which is maintaining the article, is as reliable source for tool-assisted speedrun related information as there can be. —<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBisqwit_6c3d.html" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> 12:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

As for things like "a bot was used", those things are reference to the movie author's (my) words, and do you really need to prove somehow that the author said so?

<li>I cannot argue against that it's only in the interest of the posters on that site. Tool-assisted speedrunning happens to be quite centralized -- there is very little duplicate effort.

<li>It is actually the absolute best example of tool-assistance and, as was mentioned, it anchors many of the different concepts of tool-assistance together. If tool-assisted speedrunning is a notable subject, then this could be seen as an explanation of tool-assisted speedrunning; an extension of an article due to it being in just a slightly other scope.

<li><b>Explanation:</b> The name Bangladesh and featuring the first Bangladeshi pornstar in the female lead is already an event notable enough. The female lead of the film is the first ever Bangladeshi women to willingly perform sexual acts in front of camera with commercial purposes. The exotic Bangaldesh connection has already earned success enough to encourage a sequel, and much debate among Bangladeshis at home and abroad. There is every possibility that it will go into a cult status fast. (<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 22:50, 23 June 2006 (UTC))

<li><b>Refutation:</b> This was somewhere between her third and tenth film, her sixtieth film came out early this year. I am still trying to determine the exact order of her films. But, since the DVD distributors all quote different dates according totheir own release, it is difficult. (202.74.244.12 23:18, 23 June 2006 (UTC))

<li><b>Question:</b> What kind of verification would be appropriate? For the authenticity of the pioneering nature of the film I can post DVD distributors' lists. For the debate that is circulating in Bangladesh I can quote Bangaldesh newspapers. And, for the socia-cultural realities of Bangladesh I can indicate research references. But, then I'd need help to structurally intigrate all that into one coherent article.

<ul>
<li><b>Dissapointment:</b> I really hoped for better quality help from wikipaedians discussing a deletion. For one, porn remains a pseudo underground industry in most places the world, and is highly hush-hush in Bangladesh. Thus, industry promotionals has to do as a source of information, which should not be unacceptable in the light of major studio releases. Much information available on those films are from promotionals as well. On the other hand a lengthy socio-cultural analysis incoprporated right away may not be a good idea for a tiny entry on a porn film. Better directions, please, I'm pretty new here.

<li><b>More dissapointment:</b> As for my "groundbreaking" claims, all that is claimed are - (1) this is the first officially recognized (as opposed to candidly shot sexual acts of unaware and non-consenting female Bangladeshis circulating in the underground) porn movie with a Bangladeshi as the female lead (as opposed to taking part in a minor role in a scene depicting an orgy), and (2) this means a lot to the Bangladeshi porn-lovers and liberal Bangladeshi youth in general, since they are stuck under a gloss of mythical appropriate behavior facing realities that present more opportunities than obstacles.

<li><b>Comment</b> I tried to offer some help and advice above, sorry if it wasn't enough. Unfortunately, porn is not my specialist subject (honestly), so I can't be a great practical help. I don't think you should worry about producing an epic article that covers all bases - right now, you just need to cover <i>some</i> bases. At the moment, the article makes claims that cannot be verified, and that's not good news for the fate of the article.</li>
<li>If you found reliable sources to back up the two "claims" you make above, I personally think that would go a long way to establishing some kind of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> for his particular film. Other users, of course, may well disagree. But if you think you have found them, I encourage you to put them in the article, and then tell us here to go have a look. Unfortunately, the links above may well provide circumstantial evidence, but they are not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> in WP terms. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 03:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Thanks:</b> Thanks Dave. I know I have a long way to go on the way of writing perfect encyclopaedic entries. But, not writing at all may not be good way to achieve that. All the help is appreciated, and significantly useful as well. The huge articles on the way of wikipaedia with all the little details included are still painful labyrinths to me. I wish someone explained them in simpler terms. (<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 05:38, 24 June 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Question:</b> As far as I understood, the original deletion propostion was made on the ground that this film isn't notable enough to feature as an article. But, since that proposal was made I have gone through almost all of the articles on wikipaedia. Now my wondering questions are - What really makes a porn film notable, and by whose standards? Are those standards the same for Bangaldesh and the US? Does the same standards apply to Christina Aguilera albums or 1970s TV comedy?

<ul>
<li><b>Announcement:</b> I have made enormous changes to the article - Bangladesh Booty, and I hope the notability issues have been addressed at length (thanks to snug and DaveG12345 I have found some good directions on that), though it still needs some development in articulation. I am working on the verifiability part now (I got some directions on that as well, thanks to you guys). Keep me posted for directions, an I wish some of you will get your hands dirty in tidying up the article as well. (202.74.244.12 12:23, 25 June 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Apologies:</b> Not having a better familiarity with wikipaedia I may have reacted too quick to use of words like "groundbreaking", "claims" and more. They are, in fact, generally words too strong to be used in most discussions. But, as I have found, not so here. I have just gone through <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28erotic_actors%29_17a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (erotic actors)">pornstar entry criterions</a> and found that every comment on this page makes eminent sense.

<li><b>Still Delete</b> Although some steps have been made in the right direction, it still seems to me that the main claims... first Bangladeshi etc, are not the focus of the secondary sources. The sources quoted focus on the status of women (good reference, but not applicable to the main claim), and the pornos made of unwitting women. Lots of spelling errors remain. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">snug</a> 15:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Acceptance:</b> Well, I guess, that settles the "notability" issue, which was the original cause for the AfD proposition. Now I have a newer issues to deal with - verification - and that too of just one of the "claims". <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> covered, and I guess - a lot of improvement.

<li><b>Question:</b> Though I am not as wikipaedia savvy as snug is, I wonder if spelling errors (I rather would call them typing errors) can be a ground for deletion. What I have seen here tells me these errors rather call for a cleanup. Is that not the case?

<li><b>Thanks:</b> I already had a much help in cleaning up the article to amke it free of spelling errors. Can someone help me to quote a source of reference that seconds the claim that Bangladesh Booty is the first leading role for the first Bangladeshi pornstar? Or does that imply two different claims on two related but different firsts?

<li><b>Comment</b> I cleanup and improved the article. It is in decent shape. Most importantly I linked to the author's page which is well established. I am, however, concerned that the it is largely redundant with <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joaquim_Maria_Machado_de_Assis_c0b3.html#Dom_Casmurro" title="Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis">Joaquim_Maria_Machado_de_Assis#Dom_Casmurro</a> since after cleaning the article up I found this whole section and copied and pasted it into the new article. Obviously this may be his most importnat work though and probably deserves its own page.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:29, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

"Spare the Air" alone gets 36 hits on Google <b>News</b> right now, meaning that the supposed "non-notability" will come as a complete surprise to Bay Area media -- and to anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area who listens to traffic reports on the radio or check traffic reporting sites like <a href="http://www.511.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.511.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.511.org</a> -- hmmm, there's a "Spare the Air" web banner on that site right now.

<li><b>Keep</b> This program affects 10's of millions of people on a regular basis and is a model of enviromental policy that has been adopted by other states and even in other countries <a href="http://www.airqualityontario.com/science/spareair.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airqualityontario.com/science/spareair.cfm" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. Ask any one of the 30 million people in california alone if they can explain what a "spare the air day" is and you will get a correct answer. Its almost a catch phrase. It's on the news constantly. They probably don't exactly know who issues the order but they know how it affects their lives. Earlier today I was considering the notablility of a cartoon character used by a local supermarket in the UK and agreed that the set of cartoon characters as a whole that were used in the advertising campaign was notable. I would say that "spare the air" is significantly more notable that even the local supermarket chain. California environmental inititives have a long history of affecting national and global policy. For example from <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_emissions_control.html" title="Automobile emissions control">Automobile emissions control</a> "Since 1966, the first emission test cycle was enacted in the State of California measuring tailpipe emissions in PPM (parts per million)." --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 01:02, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it is significant to a large geographical entity (San Francisco). Just today the Bay Area announced that rapid transit would be free in order to combat air pollultion. Spare the Air was a major mover-and-shaker for this novel news item. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 01:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I created the article because I kept hearing the phrase in the media but there was nothing about it in Wikipedia; the article should probably be generalized to cover other locations with similar programs. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPretzelpaws_934f.html" title="User:Pretzelpaws">Pretzelpaws</a> 04:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Dingus is a level 50 Hunter on Maple Story. Dispite another character's constant begging for meso, (the maple story currency) Dingus remains persistent on keeping the 4 million meso he gained by acquiring random thief weapon scrolls.. His damage on werewolfs in very stable (averaging in the 2000 area w/ double shot). He won the piano award, but only because his only other opponent (Vorteckz) did not perform well.</i></p>
