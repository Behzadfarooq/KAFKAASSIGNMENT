But if Lostpedia were not even worthy about being mentioned as a link in an article about the subject it relates to, how could that justify making it a separate Wikipedia article of its own? There should be a compromise in which Lostpedia gets mentioned in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a>, because the Lostpedia wiki would mainly be of interest or use to people who are looking for more information and/or speculation about the series. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

The "controversy" about a link at the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> article is that the long-standing consensus of that article's editors has held that links listed would be to those <i>official</i> sources (such as <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost" class="external text" title="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost" rel="nofollow">ABC.com</a> and <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/" rel="nofollow">Channel 4</a> sites) and producer-sponsored sites, such as The Fuselage. We follow the established <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">External Links</a> guidelines in order that the article does not become a magnet for fanlinkage. As noted under <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">Links normally to be avoided</a>: "<i>Certain kinds of pages should not be linked from Wikipedia articles....</i>" the top two of which (noted below) are applicable to Lostpedia. Further, as also recommended on WP:EL, "<i>If there are many fansites for the topic covered by the article, then providing a link to <b>one major fansite</b> (and marking the link as such) may be appropriate.</i>" We already provide that -- the Fuselage.</li>

<dd>It's nothing against Lostpedia, which is a growing and popular wiki; but there are numerous excellent Lost fan sites, any one of which can make better claim to being "major".

<dd>How could comparing registered users on a wiki and registered users on a forum be even remotely valid as a comparison of their relative popularity? Wikis get a huge amount of use from people who just come and read, I can't imagine a participant of wikipedia arguing otherwise. Also, I'm a bit surprised <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> hasn't been cited yet in this discussion. <b>"Linking to one or two (at the most) major fansites is allowed, but keep it limited to those that really do matter. Things like forums or blogs should not be linked to."</b> Right now, the Lost page doesn't link to a single fansite - is there any other TV show (or movie, or pop culture item) of similar popularity to Lost that has no links to fansites? Seems unprecedented, and out of touch with Wikipedia policies and prevailing attitudes. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's nice to see someone finally talking about the merits of one site vs. another, for listing in the Lost external links section. These are just the sort of issues that might have been perfect for the Lost article's <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html#Unanswered_arguments" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">fansite discussion</a>. Unfortunately, that's not the topic under discussion here. I mentioned the Lost article's spooky ABC-only rule only to illustrate that Lostpedia was being excluded from the Lost article by some criteria other than worthiness (to use Metro's word). If your reading of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> means that ABC's corporate fan sites get a free pass in crowding out competitors at the Lost article, then I suppose we disagree about that. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 01:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps you might take note that WP:EL says, "<i>An article about any organization, person, web site, or other entity should link to that <b>entity's official site</b>, if there is one.</i>" ABC.com is the official Web site for <i>Lost</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a "competition" about whose sites get listed -- in fact that's precisely why the consensus holds that the criteria for inclusion is "officialness": to prevent favoritism and fansite self-promotion, ala <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, which notes, "<i>Wikipedia is not a space for personal promotion or the promotion of products, services, <b>Web sites, fandoms</b>, ideologies, or other memes.</i> ". To bring it back to this AfD: none of the other Lost fan sites have Wikipedia articles, even though they have substantially more users and recognition. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 04:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Of course it's a competition, and we are the judges. Wikipedia has value to the world because the best facts are all grouped together in one place, using our collective human judgment about what belongs in the "good stuff" pile. A link to Lostpedia is "good stuff", in my estimation. If official websites can supplant all useful websites, then Wikipedia would have less value. For example, the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> article contains a link to the Microsoft corporate website. It also contains links to websites that criticize Microsoft. If Bill Gates had his way, only links controlled by Microsoft could be listed, and Wikipedia would lose value. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 05:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Thank you for demonstrating why Lostpedia does not belong here. Comparing inclusion of ABC's official site and exclusion of Lostpedia with some sort of conspiratorial manipulation by Microsoft is a rather outlandish <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_argument.html" title="Strawman argument">strawman argument</a>. See: <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links</a>, and <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.---<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 06:44, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>Regardless of whether it's a competition, <i>we</i> as wikipedia do not act as judges for anything. If something is notable enough to be recognised by other reliable sources, then we should recognise it. If not, then we don't. Having an article in wikipedia should not become a trophy to groups/websites/companies/individuals. Having an article in wikipedia should be a natural step from when a group/website/company/individual becomes notable enough to be recognised by reliable sources (books, newspapers...etc). --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 06:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I see no strawmen here. This discussion is about whether an article about Lostpedia is appropriate on Wikipedia. However, one confounding factor has been the bizarre interpretation of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> by some editors of the Lost article. My position is that a separate Lostpedia article is probably excessive, but a link to Lostpedia in the Lost article is a good idea. That's why I'm recommending "merge or else keep." I didn't mean that Bill Gates is skulking around trying to suppress expression on Wikipedia. I meant that if we, <i>we,</i> only permit "official" websites to be listed, we are doing our readers a disservice. It's up to us to determine which sentences, commas, and links belong in our articles. The editors of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> article seem to be able to keep their external links reasonably balanced and tidy, why not at Lost too? --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 08:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Since this is an AfD, isn't WP:WEB the guiding principle here and not WP:EL (especially since the WP:EL discussion keeps coming back to the issue of official sites versus fansites and the number of external fansite links allowed, neither of which is relevant in the discussion of an article and whether it should be deleted)? Whether Lostpedia is suitable for linking from a Lost webpage is a discussion that should be had, but it belongs elsewhere. If wiki policy cites WP:EL as a factor in decisions about deletions, could someone please link to that information? Thanks. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 12:35, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b> Sorry, but I don't see why Lostpedia should be deleted and Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha, for examples, shouldn't be kept. Besides, the extensive attempts to find problem with Lostpedia seem more like reaching than genuine concerns. Really, these kinds of frivolous complaints do not improve your arguments. CSS incompatible?? Where? What pages? Copyrights of others? Are you kidding? Lostpedia isn't a site about software piracy (<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astalavista.html" title="Astalavista">Astalavista</a>) or movies (<a href="../../../i/s/o/IsoHunt_1aa2.html" title="IsoHunt">IsoHunt</a>). 3 Advertisements objectionable? CNN.com has just as many. The nytimes.com page has even more. I don't know about the behavior of the sysops there, but there is certainly plenty of verifiable information on the site, and even if there is fan speculation, it is often identified as such, so it's not a problem. Besides, it's not like there isn't published works on Lost(Amazon for example, has at least 3 Unofficial Guides that I could find without looking hard), and it's not a no-name unknown show. So, there are sources for it as well. But seriously, it seems to me that there is some serious personal animus here. That's a concern that tends to make me doubt the fairness of this proposal. Seems to me that this is a conflic that needs to be resolved more than this article needs to be deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Star Wars and Star Trek are multi-decade global cross-media phenomenona with very large fan followings . Lost is popular but is not comparable in size and scope or popularity to SW/ST.... likewise then for Lostpedia. If it was up to me, I'd probably delete all the fan site articles (if only because the sound of a million fanboys howling is like a sweet lullaby to me), but that's my attempt at "the consensus explanation". <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are around 20 million people a week who watch Lost in the US alone. How many worldwide? A hundred million? That's enough for me to say that any arguments about fan followings are without weight to me. Or more correctly, they weigh against the person using that argument. In 30-40 years, sure, maybe Lost may be forgotten, but so what? So might Star Trek, Star Wars, and Tolkien. That it's as popular as it is today is enough that Wikipedia should include it, and if it one day becomes as unimportant as a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Buggy_whip.html" title="Buggy whip">buggy whip</a>, well, it's still history. You can find Lost articles in the papers, and books in the stores. And Lostpedia is even mentioned in some of them. Thus the comparison becomes site on site. As such, I'm afraid I don't see that much of a difference. One's about Trek. The other's about Star Wars. This one is about Lost. It's all fine with me. And that's not even getting into the frivolous nature of the other objections. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>it's not like there isn't published works on Lost</i> ... <i>That it's as popular as it is today is enough that Wikipedia should include it</i> — You appear to be (dare I say it) lost, or at least confused about which article is listed in the nomination here. This isn't a deletion discussion for an article on a television series. This is a deletion discussion for an article on a web site. The published works, the articles and the books, have to be about the web site, not about the series. Mere <i>mention</i> in a book is not enough, moreover. Mere inclusion in a book's "list of interesting web sites to visit" appendix isn't enough to hang an encyclopaedia article from. If the only published documentation for a web site is mere <i>mention</i> of it in a book about a television series, then Wikipedia should reflect that, and certainly should not exceed it. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> specifically mentions <i>non-trivial</i> published works for a reason. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:47, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, you are confused, as the lines you quoted were responding to the implication that Lostpedia was unsourced and pure fancruft speculation which Matthew Felton brought up. That those sources exist means that they could be using them. So, thus I find his complaint to be unsupported on its face, and thus he would need to confirm it. But since I find that most of his objections were petty and frivolous, I doubt he'll be able to do so.

<li>So, he didn't say either <i>“Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes a Wikipedia:Featured article.” – Site provides nothing unique, except of course unverifiable fan cruft.</i> or <i>Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research, as detailed in Wikipedia:Reliable sources.” – Blatant fail.</i>&#160;? Because I see it right there, and so do other people.

<li>Come again? Are you saying that MatthewFenton wasn't talking about Lostpedia when he wrote what he did? What was he talking about then? He claimed Lostpedia was nothing but fancruft. I pointed out that they can quite easily get information from various sources that go beyond mere fan discussion, so I felt his complaints about the nature of the site were overblown because of that. It seems to me that you're objecting to my pointing that out, and while I'm trying to give you a fair chance, and clarify what I said, I'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your objections. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:13, 23 October 2006
<ul>
<li>I assume he objects to your post starting "There are around 20 million people a week..." on the grounds that it sounds like you are citing the popularity of the show as an argument for the Lostpedia article (especially when it's in response to a comment arguing that it's somehow relevant that Star Trek and Star Wars have been around longer and may be more popular). I guess what you intended was just to point out that there are additional sources available that Lostpedia editors may be using, not that those books are about Lospedia? I don't think the point is that relevant to the discussion, especially since there have been sources cited that demonstrate notability, and since Lostpedia doesn't really need sources beyond the show itself (that's the main source of wikipedia's lost pages as well). "Cruft" simply means that information is obscure and only of interest to fans, not that it's incorrect or unsourced - wikipedia policy doesn't seem to have any objection to linking to sites that contain cruft and it seems like a certain degree of cruft is even acceptable on wikipedia itself (just look at wiki's Lost pages). --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:32, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, while he did bring up something from my second reply, Uncle G's initial response to me included a quote of my first post to this thread, ergo, he must have been responding to that as well. Besides, that part which you're talking about was a response to user Starblind's comment about the various fan populations of Star Trek and Star Wars versus those of Lost, which only come up because articles on Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha were kept, despite their great similarity to Lostpedia, which creates an obvious consistency problem. The point in that is related to this discussion, certainly, but distinct from why I made the comment about books in the first place, and I don't think I would have brought it up, had not Starblind made the comment he did. I disagree with his claims about the relative nature of the fan following, and I said why. Anyway, while I don't disagree that many people's uses of cruft are only to minor, if true things, and that that is no reason for Wikipedia not to link to it, a full reading of his statements (both here, and elsewhere) indicate that in this case he believed the whole site was full of nothing but unverifiable speculation. That's why I brought it up, and because these things exist, and could be used by Lostpedia editors, I don't see the problem being quite as extensive as he thinks. It's certainly not a grounds for deletion here. It might be a cause of concern for Lostpedai, but that's their business. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that Star Wars and Star Trek are old and Lost is new should not be at issue here. After all, we're talking about websites here, not movies and television shows. One of the points raised in support of a Lostpedia article is that their lame news appearances are at least as good as Memory Alpha's and Wookipedia's lame news appearances. If we're to use such citations as the principal metric of notability, we then either need to acknowledge that Lostpedia meets this low standard, or explicitly raise the standard. I'm not one who requires total consistency. Times change. Every situation is unique. Human judgment should be an asset, not a liability, to the healthy functioning of any wiki. Therefore, it's okay with me if there's inconsistency here. But let's try to stick with justification we can support in such a way that it doesn't look like there's personal prejudice at play here. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 18:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is incredibly misstated.

<ol>
<li>PKtm is misleading for saying I quoted Angela on that point. I did not. I suggest he read the text and attribution more carefully. Out-of-focus was cited.</li>

<li>Third try: Reiterating the opening of this special "second" afd by Xoloz, <i>voting editors should refer to the DRV URL.</i> I would hazard a guess that some have not referred to it. Any remaining ambiguities are easily addressed by the interested editor by reading the original DRV, which I mentioned.

<dd>Yes but you must notice the first comment right at the top of this page by the administrator who began this discussion, who says speedy deletion was overturned by consensus.

<ul>
<li><small><b>Strong keep</b> - i somehow get an overwhelming impression just from reading the upper part of this AfD that some users seem to be simply holding some kind of grudge against it. I don't see Lostpedia as obviously failing either <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and i especially don't see how lostpedia fails them any worse than Wookiepedia or Memory Alpha. Talking about which, i don't see how "unverified fancruft" has anything to do with this. Do people even realize what fancruft means? The opening line of <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> explains it quite well "<i>Fancruft is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question.</i>". There's nothing wrong with Fancruft, it's not bad. It's just not fit for an encyclopedia. But fansites by definition exist to serve the 'small population of enthusiastic fans'. So-called "Fancruft" is exactly the kind of external sites are supposed to provide, since it's information that's not appropriate on our own encyclopedia. Arguments like this "<i>Blatant fail; their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?</i>" is circular. Because even if someone independant added links to lostpedia in wikipedia articles, there is no way to prove who is adding links because they think it's a good idea, and who is adding links because they're affiliated with lostpedia. At the end, it just comes down to the bad faith assumption of "you're adding links to lostpedia, you must be from lospedia and trying to advertise". --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>No, i've never edited a Lost article because i don't watch lost. But in case you haven't noticed, this entire spat between lost editors on wikipedia and lostpedia is becoming quite widely known. After seeing and responding to <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#a_clearer_policy_regarding_linking_to_fansites" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#a clearer policy regarding linking to fansites</a>, i got curious to see what the huge fuss was about. So i read a few of the links people over there provided to old discussions regarding Lostpedia, and frankly speaking i'm surprised such a fuss has lasted this long. As for all the 4400 articles, they're all the same one nomination. "Submitting 30+ AfD nominations" is blowing things way out of proportion. The 39 4400 articles were articles in a series (one for each episode) and were all submitted as one single AfD all for the same reasons. Seriously, attack arguments all you like. But don't waste your time attacking people when you can't even be bothered to do the research. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 02:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, equally, attack arguments all <i>you</i> like, but do <i>not</i> (in what is essentially a personal attack) accuse me of failing to do research. Let's turn, once again, to <i>facts</i>. Your contribution history, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=200&amp;target=Yaksha" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=200&amp;target=Yaksha" rel="nofollow">here</a>, shows that you edited each and every one of those 39 articles, putting an AfD notice on each one, taking about half an hour for the effort. It's disingenuous for you now to claim that you didn't submit 39 AfDs, because it's tantamount to the same thing. Single AfD or not, you are clearly out to delete all 39 articles, all of which were spawned by the individual who created this Lostpedia AfD here. And I still haven't heard you explain or address just why you would have jumped in to do that, about three and a half hours later on the same day that you voted for a Strong Keep here. Just coincidence? Is it really that surprising that someone might look on your action as retaliation? -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 04:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tagged for the <i>same</i> AfD. What i mean is saying "i've nominated 40 of his articles for AfD" misleading implies i've gone and tracked down 40 different articles of his and put up nominations for each of them. Where as in fact, the 40 articles were apart of a single group. And have all been dumped into one AfD for the same reason. As for why, maybe you should actually read the opening paragraph of the AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_New_and_Improved_Carl_Morrissey_%28The_4400_episode%29_84fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The New and Improved Carl Morrissey (The 4400 episode)">here</a>, which explains exactly why i nominated the whole lot. And i should point out 4400 isn't the only TV series either. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Here_Comes_the_Squirtle_Squad_5925.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Here Comes the Squirtle Squad">here</a> is the nomination for equally short/indescriminate-information-dump pokemon episode articles. This is hardly a matter of "nom because the article is crap and needs deletion".

<li><b>Comment</b> You might consider reviewing the lengthy history of this (e.g., at <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites</a>, where you should search on "credible contributor") before you jump to that conclusion, Isotope23. A number of the Lostpedia proponents here participate on WP almost solely for the purpose of advocating a link to Lostpedia. Some have been known to make several dozen edits in a single day on that one issue. Since this debate has been recurring in various forms for months as they try various different approaches to accomplish their stated goal (a direct quote: "this debate won't be over until LostPedia has gotten its link on WP"), it's harder to see how SPA some of their accounts actually are. Moreover, since this monomania was pointed out to them, they have made a few token other edits elsewhere, to the effect of being able to deflect this criticism. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 15:39, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>C'mon, guys, let's try to stay focused on the topic under discussion, and not descend into ad hominem attacks on suspected puppets. If there are indeed meat puppets present, they are unclear on the concept of this forum. In particular, <i>"The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments."</i> If huge swaths of the Zombie Hordes can't be taken down with our ATL guns (air-tight logic), then it might be time to begin asking ourselves some tough questions about our own positions. Please, let's try to focus more on what is said, and less on who is saying it. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 16:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>: i've specifically stayed away from editing the LOST article due to this very debate. i added one fact concerning five of the six 'LOST numbers' being drawn in the irish national lottery <a href="http://www.lottery.ie/prizes_results/prizes.asp?date=20/11/05&amp;draw_date=Nov+19+2005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lottery.ie/prizes_results/prizes.asp?date=20/11/05&amp;draw_date=Nov+19+2005" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to the lost article on one occasion, but it was quickly reverted because i cited lostpedia as a reference. i wouldn't like to be lumped in with the 'registered at wiki as a result of the lostpedia controversy' set, and i'd like to make this explicit here. my primary concern, whether here or at lostpedia, is to help make the wiki in question as good as it can be. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaini_03ad.html" title="User:Kaini">Kaini</a> 04:32, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>PKtm, those comments were made in the context of an abusive thread that began with this personal attack on Yaksha, launched by you: <i>"... The user above, Yaksha, has never edited a Lost article or even a Lost-related talk page aside from here. On the very same day that he voted for a Strong Keep here, he submitted 30+ AfD nominations, all of which, coincidentally, were for articles initiated by MatthewFenton. Clearly retaliatory, not to mention an example of WP:POINT. ..."</i> It seems to me that that statement is a public assumption of bad faith on someone who you apparently never encountered before. I would also point out that that passage is precisely the sort of ad hominem attack I deplore. Yesterday, you directed me to WP:NPA, and now I'm directing you to the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html#Alternatives" title="WP:NPA">alternatives</a> section of that page, <i>"Never suggest a view is invalid simply because of who its proponent is."</i> I'm sorry, but I don't agree that harshly pointing out someone's offensive language is always a personal attack. My statement of opinion about your tone was not written as a personal attack, and I'm sorry if you read it that way. In any case I've re-read it today, and I stand by it today. Do please stop criticizing people's edit histories as a substitute for rational discussion. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 19:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, I won't "own" that. Loqi, if you don't see the difference between my citing <i>facts</i>, and your use of personal, inflammatory words like "shrill", belittling", "berating", and "petty", there's probably nothing anyone can do to convince you. I'd point out, however, that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> includes the remark that <i>Disagreements about content such as "Your statement about X is wrong" or "Your statement is a point of view, not fact" are not personal attacks.</i> And yes, people's edit histories are certainly germane here (you'll note that the facts went undisputed by Yaksha), and I'm not the only one to bring them up, because they matter when assessing good faith. I regret that you consider citing unpleasant facts as somehow being what you label "abusive". In any case, all the rational discussion on this topic, if any, occurred long ago, and we're just retreading the same old ground.-- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 01:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This side spat is already far too long, but I feel I must further dissect your words for you. You said Yaksha's actions somewhere else on Wikipedia were <i>"clearly retaliatory,"</i> and a disruption of Wikipedia <i>to make a point.</i> Aside from your very thin line of reasoning to arrive at such an inflammatory conclusion, it amounts to ascribing motivation to someone else's actions. My statement was about how your language irritates me; yours was abusive speculation masquerading as fact. Please don't hide behind "facts," when the core of that spat between the two of you was your mischaracterization of the <i>meaning</i> of those facts. And now you're mischaracterizing that mischaracterization for all the world to see. I'm not going to bicker about yesterday's unseemly display any further. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 03:52, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

A review of the <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Special:Listusers/sysop" class="external text" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Special:Listusers/sysop" rel="nofollow">list of Lostpedia administrators</a> also is useful, of which I count at least six appearing here. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 07:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see how that is sockpupptery. It's just asking people who are already wikipedia editors to log into their accounts and "voice their opinion". It's no different to when one wikipedia sends an IM or drops by the talk pages of a bunch of other wikipedians asking them to "drop by and voice their opinion" on an AfD. So what if their administrator's show up here? It's not sockpupptery. Sockpupptery is when one person uses many accounts to pretend to be many people, and make it seem like many people are supporting their cause. Actually asking for <i>other people</i> to join in a discussion is not sockpupptery. Especially when those other people openly admit why they're here (as in i see quite a few of them openingly discloseing the fact that they're involved with Lost).</li>
<li>You also seem to fail to take into consideration that a lot of lost fans who are from lostpedia may also be in wikipedia to genuinely help our lost articles. Someone who's a fan a lost could well (and legitimately) be apart of both communities. Heck, it seems like Jimbo Whales himself edits over there too just because he's a fan of lost. Just because someone also exists on lostpedia, it doesn't mean they are here to sockpuppet. It also doesn't nessasarily mean they will vote supports without listening to reason. It also doesn't mean they have any malicious intentions. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 11:02, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Generally when there's blatant "vote stuffing" there's a public call for mass support followed by many keep "votes", usually mostly from IP accounts. If there are six admins from lostpedia here that's hardly a get out the vote campaign. The first link above on Lostpedia is months old. And being an admin on the site in question doesn't disqualify people from giving their opinion (don't forget, it's not a vote), their status just needs to be taken into consideration when consensus is decided. Even if the responses from LP admins was to be completely ignored (which it shouldn't be), there are still quite a few established wiki editors who favor keeping the article. But that's for the closing admin to decide - that should happen any day now, right? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:47, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have not been asking for inclusion of Lostpedia <i>"in any way shape or form"</i>. I have been asking for a simple Lostpedia link in the Lost article. All these months, I have been <b>explicitly not</b> asking for a Lostpedia page, until a few days ago, when the primary initiator of deletion proceedings changed <i>his</i> mind on the issue.</p>
<p>I was perfectly happy anonymously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.181.124.59" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.181.124.59" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=24.7.64.239" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=24.7.64.239" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Wikipedia, until the trouble at the Lost article motivated me to create an account. So naturally, my first edit was on the topic. What Leflyman probably didn't notice was that my next significant contribution was to drastically improve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060810060807&amp;limit=20&amp;target=Loqi_T." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060810060807&amp;limit=20&amp;target=Loqi_T." rel="nofollow">[4]</a> the Ruben Cantu article.

<dd>this is almost becoming a parody of an AfD discussion! <s>how in the <i>world</i> can a change of vote by a vehemently <b>anti-inclusion of lostpedia user</b> with a history of productive edits be construed as meatpuppetry by someone who has been <i>pro-inclusion</i> throughout the debate, bar by l33t h4x0r1ng? this whole discussion has somewhat descended into bathos. also, how can a compliment on a user's talk page for their passion in enforcing their interpretation of a wiki policy be interpreted as being underhanded in some way?</s> the fact that loqi t hasn't participated in any other AfDs is moot; wiki users should not be accused of underhanded behaviour because they feel passionately about something. this whole branch of the debate is utterly ridiculous imo. i see <i>no</i> meatpuppetry here. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaini_03ad.html" title="User:Kaini">Kaini</a> 03:27, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
