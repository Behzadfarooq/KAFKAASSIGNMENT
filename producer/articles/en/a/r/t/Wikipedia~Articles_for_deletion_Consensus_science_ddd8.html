You do not do science by asking what people think as a whole, you do it by setting up experiments that prove or disprove a hypothesis. Then other people repeat those experiments and show that you're methods and results were valid or not. This is not a consensus, it is experimental proof, and until a hypothesis is tested in this way, it is not thought to be valid, no matter how many people "believe" it to be true (unless you are talking about "creation science" with is an oxymoron.</li>

<li><b>Author's Rebuttal</b> I believe this subject is appropriate for inclusion in the wikipedia for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The concept of "consensus science" is well-establised; a Google search turned up "about 5,800" results for the phrase.</li>
<li>The term is in mainstrem usage and has a specific meaning.</li>
<li>The term and concept are referred to in other articles on wikipedia.</li>
<li>While the term may cause a certain amount of controverty, there are arguably more controversial topics under discussion here. For example, the term <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_birth_abortion.html" title="Partial birth abortion">partial birth abortion</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, I'll point out that WMC has failed to list the criteria he feels the article has violated according to wikipedia policies for vfd and ask they either he do so or else retract his request for deletion.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I request that WMC either quantify the following allegations or retract them.
<ul>
<li>"This page is a POV disaster area" - what does that mean exactly? It may be a controversial topic (in his opinion) but the concept of "consensus science" does exist and therefore warrants a page on wikipedia. If WMC finds the contents objectionable or troubling, he is certain free to either modify the page in an appropriate manner or, as an alternative, not visit the page.</li>
<li>"little more than an attempt to provoke an edit war" - I'd like WMC to explain exactly how he is able to divine my intent in creating this page. Is this purely his personal opinion or does he have some factual basis for this claim? If this is his personal opinion, I would dispute its relevance with regard to his request that this page be deleted.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Consensus science" is a term in theories of the philosophy of science which question and analyze the magnitude of the role consensus should play in science. Development in the philosophy of science helps keep the progress of science productive. This term is different from "scientific consensus", which simply refers to majority opinion among scientists, while "consensus science" instead refers to the usage of consensus to form assessments of truth (thus placing it at a different level of usage). The term is widely enough used that it's certainly worth addressing in a Wikipedia article.

<li>The idea is that you can dismiss a new theory as "consensus science" by claiming it hasn't actually been "proved", but instead scientists have been somehow manipulated to give the appearance of consensus. Of course, I'm not aware of any real forms of non-consensus science, so it's kind of a useless concept.

<dd>A quote from the article reads, "Most scientific theories which are supported by a scientific consensus are supported because there is conclusive evidence supporting those theories. Such theories would not be consensus science, because a supporting argument can be easily formulated using the existing conclusive evidence." So a field which supports its tenets primarilly by evidence is not consensus science. The term "consensus science" does not refer to "fields which have a consensus", it refers to fields which "primarilly use" consensus as supporting evidence. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 03:09, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Repeat vote for Delete</b> Having read the revised version I now know why I didn't agree with the article. Scientific Facts are not established by voting which appears to be the implication of "Consencus Science".

Us supplying a definition of something apparently in flux would constitute primary research. --<a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDtcdthingy_8e94.html" title="User:Dtcdthingy">Dtcdthingy</a> 19:18, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Calling for the deletion of an article because your edits were modified is not within the Wikipedia deletion policy. In fact, it's well outside of the Wikipedia deletion policy. How about instead we try to work together to make the article into something which contains good quality and good NPOV through the gradual Wikipedia editing process, just like every other article. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 20:22, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. No, it isn't a neologisn. It is a widely-used term - as I established in my rebuttal to the delete claim. 2. It means something specific. As I also estblished in the "author's rebuttal". If you have questions, ask them and I, for one, will be happy to answer. Just because you don't understand the term doesn't mean it is meaningless. 3. It not only exists in certain people's heads, it is also in mainstream use. 4. Provide examples of NPOV that have been removed. Until and unless you do, your complaints carry no weight. They're like WMC's baseless complaints; a waste of bandwidth. While we're on the subject of proper wikipedia conduct, is "stupid" really a word that contriubutes to progressive communication?--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 22:08, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I no longer think it has any meaning outside <b>science by consensus</b>. Common sense combinations of words don't get wikipedia articles.

<dd>That's fair and you are absolutely entitled to your opinion. But with all respect, I'll ask to you consider the possibility that your opinion isn't necessarily the core of the issue here. The fact remains that the term "consensus science" exists and it is in general use to describe a specific thing. As a result, it surely warrants an article here. I'm perfectly willing to admit that my original article wasn't the best thing I ever wrote and with the much appreciated help of others, the article is now much better than it originally was. I think that's probably how this whole wikipedia deal is supposed to work. Wouldn't you agree? Leaving aside our opinions of "consensus science" as well as what may or may not be thus labelled, can we agree that there should be an article discussing it? It isn't just two random words after all.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonGwynne_1879.html" title="User:JonGwynne">JonGwynne</a> 23:47, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If it weren't for the fact that the term "consensus science" is sometimes used against topics like <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, which a lot of people are rather religiously emotional about, then this VfD never would have arisen in the first place. It would be nice if people could see the existence of the term without considering it through the lense of how it affects their favorite topics. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 07:31, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete. See <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolmogorov%27s_zero-one_law.html" title="Kolmogorov's zero-one law">Kolmogorov's zero-one law</a> for examples of statements which cannot be proven by consensus. In these <i>zero-one law</i> statements, one side or the other has to be wrong, and one side cannot claim victory by majority vote, or consensus, because the statements are <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imponderables.html" title="Imponderables">imponderables</a>, but not undecidables. Thus, the consensus science article's premise is ill-founded. Just like an early King of England, who commanded the sea to retreat, to show that even a King's power has limits. In other words, labelling something as <i>science</i> does not automatically produce <i>truth</i>. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 11:21, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Useful content from this page can easily be added to the scientific consensus article, where it fits quite nicely. As other users have noted above, the present article basically deals with the pitfalls of taking the consensus of scientists as scientific fact without explicit appeal to empirical evidence. Although the term seems to be gaining some currency ('only' about two fifths of google hits also mention Crichton), it would still fit better within the aforementioned article on scientific consensus. Crichton's new book and crusade bring to mind a number of colourful colloquialisms, but the pitfalls of so-called 'consensus science' are real, well-documented... and belong in the article, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_consensus.html" title="Scientific consensus">scientific consensus</a>. <a href="../../../b/j/c/User%7EBjcairns_871c.html" title="User:Bjcairns">Ben Cairns</a> 12:34, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>
