Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It certainly is not massive; don't be disingenuous. Moreover you are conflating keep with no consensus, which is the principal outcome of many of those debates. It was massively agreed that the bitter disputes and name calling was getting out of hand in school AfDs (or VfDs as they were). But as you know, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> compromise is not much liked by anyone - neither those who feel schools are notable sui generis, nor those (like myself) who feel they are simply not notable in and of themselves. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 19:09, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I always love it when people say we should keep a school because there is a consensus to keep them (which is both clearly incorrect and circular reasoning), and because being a stub is no reason to delete (which is a strawman, since none of the supporters of deletion did so because it is a stub, but because the school is non notable). If this was an article about a band instead of a school, it would be speedyable... No assertion of notability whatsoever, just like all other articles on schools in Yuba (like <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Elementary_School_%28Yuba_City%29_07f3.html" title="Lincoln Elementary School (Yuba City)">Lincoln Elementary School (Yuba City)</a>). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 22:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Consensus does not exist, as the previous posters point out; rather, many afd's on schools result in 'no consensus' which is an automatic keep. Many of us do not understand why schools are supposedly inherently notable while hospitals, for instance, are not. Furthermore, while I'll admit precedent seems to indicate that <i>high schools</i> should typically be kept (no matter how much I disagree), there does not seem to be a similar precedent for middle schools or elementary schools; indeed, if my memory serves me, most middle and elementary schools do get deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh hi again FW. Welcome back. You will note by the way the responses above to Kurt's claim of consensus. Finally, the claim that "people love school articles" is both unfounded and irrelevant. It isn't clear what poeple you mean other than the general school inclusionists. Wow, I'm shocked, shocked that people who like to keep schools love the articles. If you mean some other group it might be nice to specify. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even a quick search on google will show that there is lots of verifiable information on this school. As per the points you made on my talk page, school pages are not <i>the</i> most important ones, they are significant and add to Wikipedia's value and help attract new editors. I think that these points are underappreciated by people who are quick to delete. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 20:31, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know what the google search showed. I did a google search before making my above comment. Very little of it was both verifiable and not just the number of students or similar stats.
