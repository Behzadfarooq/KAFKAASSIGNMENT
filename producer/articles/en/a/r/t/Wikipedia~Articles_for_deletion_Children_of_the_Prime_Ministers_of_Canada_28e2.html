<p>Seems like a completely useless and unencyclopedic list: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Doubtless completely true, but that doesn't mean this list should exist. I suppose there might be some justification for existence if all of these children were notable in their own right, but the vast majority of them aren't. There is no reason to create lists of non-notable people. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 10:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems we have tons of lists about US presidents, but when it comes to lists about Canadian Prime Ministers we must delete? Give me a break. There's nothing wrong with having a list of children of Canadian Prime Ministers. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 18:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unencyclopǣdic. However Earl Andrew does have a perfectly valid point.....p'raps we should start sorting the garbage out as far as US presidents are concerned. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 19:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I see nothing wrong with either list. There are people out there who have an interest in Presidents and Prime Ministers and would like lists of Prime Ministers based on these things. For instance, we have tons of articles on members of the royal family and its lineage, because there is a tremendous interest in the royal family. For instance, the World Almanac has a many sorts of lists of Presidents, including one that lists the spouses and number of children. Surely we can include a similar list on Wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is not paper, while the Almanac is! -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 19:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>And just because some people would find it useful is no rationale for keeping, see <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. The basic question is whether we should have a list of non-notable people like this. List of members of the Moreschi family would be equally worthy of deletion because most of us aren't notable, just like this, even though my grandfather is/was notable and has his Wikipedia biography. But just because he's notable doesn't mean there should be a list of us who aren't. And yes, if there's US President garbage like this it should go as well. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 19:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Families of heads of state by their nature attract significant attention and are in normal practice featured in various non-trivial published journalistic and historic works. Therefore children of Prime Ministers automatically inherit some degree of notability;</li>
<li>The list also provides an at-a-glance view of the families, which would otherwise have to be tediously researched by hitting every PM's article on the WP server;</li>
<li>The list is less prone to cruft than most - Prime Ministers and their families don't change extremely often;</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I suppose the issue is whether the list is useful or not. Insofar as it compiles a list of the children of a highly notable category of people - the heads of government of Canada - it saves time and effort scrolling through all twenty-two names to retrieve this specific item. There are thirteen lists related to the persons of the Prime Minister of Canada. There is no reason to suppose one is any more (or less) notable than another. Such lists are ubiquitous for heads of government for various countries. My question is whether or not the criteria for retention or deletion is random. Are the children of Canadian PM's any more or less notable than those of the United States? Is the category of children any more or less notable than the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_Prime_Ministers_by_place_of_birth_be2d.html" title="List of Canadian Prime Ministers by place of birth">birthplace</a> of the PMs? My concern is that deleting this article creates a slippery slope for a mass deletion of lists that many people who are, for instance, compiling bibliographal anthologies, find useful. In the absence of clear criteria, deleting this article is random and gratuitous. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 04:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, per <a href="../../../9/w/_/WP%7E9W_f7f8.html" title="WP:9W">WP:9W</a>: "Compilation. Wikipedia is not a simple collection or list of facts." I see nothing in WP:9W that states just because something is useful means it should get an article.

<dd><b>Response</b>: I agree - cruft like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_First_Ladies_of_the_United_States_by_longevity_1435.html" title="List of First Ladies of the United States by longevity">List of First Ladies of the United States by longevity</a> is perfectly useless in all respects, but you have discounted arguments that lists of children of PMs would be helpful for comparative purposes or in research concerning, for instance, biographical anthologies. And yet you defend lists of spouses of heads of government, which seems inconsistent (another one of my complaints for nominating this list in particular). Why, there even exist lists of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Lady_of_the_United_States_cf64.html" title="Second Lady of the United States">spouses of deputy government leaders</a>.

<dd>Also, good luck trying to delete the list of children of US Presidents. The reason why there is no AfD is because it would have no chance of actually being deleted. There are enough American Presidential trivia-buffs to vote to keep it. Now you may put it on AfD, but I warn you now it would be a colossal waste of time. Not to mention the fact that is actually highly encyclopedic in content. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 04:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The casual user who is looking things up about political biographies. For instance, a 12 year old trying to find out information for a report about political families. "Compare and contrast" is one of the things kids are taught; this list would be helpful for them. Or for example, someone in college doing a paper in sociology about political families, power, and democracy; could easily work through the list of children of PMs / presidents, note the ones who are notable &amp; the ones who are not; find out a bit of info on the ones who are not. These are "casual researchers". These people are disproportionately notable, in some part because they often are part of political families or with inherited wealth; and the fact that some of them end up being not notable is what makes a list useful -- because it will gather the folks who have wp pages and the folks who don't. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

BTW, as an educator, I must say that someone who needs to make a report about "political families" would do best to research each family independently rather than rely on a "list", in the same way that someone doing a report on a character in a book should not rely on a "list of chracters in book X". Being the child of a politician doesn't make one any more notable than the child of a notable scientist or a notable author. Neither does inheriting wealth make one notable.

<li>I have read WP:USEFUL, thank you. You asked for some examples of what "casual research" might look like, and I provided them. Pointing me to WP:USEFUL is conclusory; you're saying that this is merely useful rather than encyclopedic, but you're not giving an explanation of why it's not encyclopedic. I've pointed out (below) that this very topic is a subject of academic research; hence a potential topic for casual research. ... As for how a kid might write a report, the list is an <i>index</i>; it serves as a sorting &amp; collecting function. A kid trying to decide which families to write about could look through the list (repeat: it's an <i>index</i>), make some basic assessments about which families look interesting, and then move onto the individual president, first lady, and children articles as appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b>. In many countries, "first lady" is a official/semi-official position. "First ladies" usually have done significant things that make them notable by themselves, regardless of their relation to their husbands (that they got to do those things by being related to their husbands is irrelevant, what they did usually makes them notable by themselves). "First children" on the other hand, do not warrant their own articles just by being "first children". George W. Bush is notable because of his time as a president/governor, not because he is the son of George H. W. Bush. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 13:46, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Most (if not all) First Ladies are notable because of actions they themselves performed, and not just because they were related to heads of state.

It has not been esablished that most of these people are indeed notable; most do not have their own articles. However, even if they were, that doesn't necessarily support collecting them in a list. I <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">never said I don't like the topic</a> and as for my reference to <i>Six Degrees of Separation</i>, you may want to review the article on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humour.html" title="Humour">humour</a>. You might also want to look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTCRUFT_7e76.html" title="WP:LISTCRUFT">WP:LISTCRUFT</a>, which offers a good rule of thumb: Lists should only be created if the subject of the list is itself encyclopedic. Or, to put it another way, <i>Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada</i> is not a valid encyclopedic topic, so a list of all the children of Canadian prime ministers is not a good topic for a list. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The collection of this information into a single article is indiscriminate. -- <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_McBeth_6e63.html" title="User:Alan McBeth">Alan McBeth</a> 00:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I believe that every article on a US President (or Canadian Prime Minister) should list that person's family (spouse and children). If the children are notable in their own right, then they should get an article. However, this list has no justification for existence. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 02:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Incorporating by reference all my comments on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Children_of_the_Presidents_of_the_United_States_99a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Children of the Presidents of the United States">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Children of the Presidents of the United States</a>, excepting only the cites to US-specific articles. Suggest that where US-specific cites exist, Canadian-specific work is also a likely study of subject, but would be less likely to actually have published work. I append the last proposal for convenience. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Article creation comment</b> - A couple of people have now suggested that the (US) list is appropriate if an existing article is there to support it. I initially preferred a single article, with text and an incorporated list, and I wrote two paragraphs at the top of the current list that could serve as a stub. But now I see perhaps the virtues of a separate article: One article could explain the sociological aspects of being a child of a political leader, placing it into context with inherited nobility, economic class, personal life outcomes, and so on; and there could be short sections that discuss any specific national effects, national political history, or other specific national research that have been done, which would link to the relevant supported lists (children of Canadian PMs, children of US presidents, and so on). (Heck, we could probably cannibalize some of the arguments on this page to flesh out the text.) --lquilter 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
