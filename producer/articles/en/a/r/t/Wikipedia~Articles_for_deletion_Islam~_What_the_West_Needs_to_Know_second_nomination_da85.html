<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm getting the impression from looking at the edit history that this article is listed for deletion because of "personal" reasons rather than "non-notable" reasons (especially since it's been listed for deletion by the same user twice - I do find it odd that after the first time it was listed for deletion the same user added a significant chunk of text about the synopsis two days later. Why would you add to an article you're proposing to delete?). It's certainly not an Internet hoax or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a> of <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad_Watch_de98.html" title="Jihad Watch">Jihad Watch</a> was duped into, not only providing commentary for the film, but also placing an article on his website <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/009607.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/009607.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/d/User%7EWadems_9e2a.html" title="User:Wadems">♫ Bitch and Complain Sooner ♫</a> 13:49, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I followed the links and watched the premiere video, and it seems like a smear job by the Religious Reich, for the Religious Reich. That alone doesn't disqualify it from inclusion on WP however. But I'm not sure what the notability criteria for film is? It did, verifiably, have a film festival showing. However, it doesn't appear to be scheduled for further showings or release, and the official site hasn't been updated since January, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa Internet</a>'s traffic ranking for the official site is: <i>No Data.</i> I'm in the middle on this one, and need a pointer to film notability policies. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 13:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Note that the "film festival" at which this video had its first and last showing is not in itself notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I used to think that this film should be considered notable, however, the fact that it only had one showing and there appears to be no way for anyone to ever see it again makes it non-notable. The film festival it was shown at appears to just be some right-wing event that is so out of the main-stream that it hardly qualifies as a real film festival. There are no truly critical reviews of this film because it was only seen by a few conservatives. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 23:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Isn't it a bit POV to throw around adjectives like <i>non-notable</i> in a discussion like this? Is it <i>non notable</i> because you say so? Maybe it's <i>notable</i> because I say so. Maybe what matters and what underpinned my vote is that it was verifiably shown at a film festival.

<dd>There's nothing wrong with POV on AfD, thank you. It is non-notable because there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that discuss the film, and therefore any commentary on it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. The only <i>borderline</i> source is the worldnetdaily.com website, which mentions the film only in passing and provides no analysis. Finally, the phrase "film festival" means nothing to me. For all I know, in Hollywood all you need to do is play a few tapes in your parents' basement, and it's a film festival. The only way we can decide whether these things are worth covering is if other sources have already covered them, and they haven't. Now, let me ask: if we assume that the film is never screened again, and never mentioned again even on the Internet, would you still want to keep the article? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 00:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well considering they were just showing a few tapes in my parents' basement (not that my parents live in Hollywood but why quibble) they sure put a lot of money into the festival website. <a href="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> And they do of course prominently list the film in the screening schedule <a href="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/hollywoodsynopsis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afrfilmfestival.com/hollywoodsynopsis.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Since you have already pointed to other sources I'll not search further. I will say I didn't know our role was to analyze films, in that case there are 195 flicks at <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_films_bb46.html" title="Category:Television films">Category:Television films</a> that could use some attention, perhaps we should start with <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_in_Arabian_Nights_1ddb.html" title="Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights">Scooby-Doo_in_Arabian_Nights</a>. However, to answer your question that I previously answered (i.e. <i>Once is good enough for me</i>): Yes, if the film is never shown again, if all prints are burned in a giant <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto-da-fe.html" title="Auto-da-fe">auto-da-fe</a> on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Boulevard_d612.html" title="Hollywood Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>, I would still want to keep the article. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:23, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
