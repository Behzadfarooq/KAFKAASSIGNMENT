<li><b>No Delete</b>, notability is established by having won a 2006 RIBA design award (link added in article), being the only NI architecture practice to achieve this. Furthermore, the article is a stub, and requires expansion rather than deletion. However, as the subject is a young man, it is difficult to expand the article significantly. The article provides a similar level of detail to any of those on currently-practising architects in the UK or Ireland. The question is, does this architect fail to warrant such an article? My feeling is that he does, as his firm is incresingly coming to dominate NI architectural design. For the record, I am not the subject, nor do I work for his firm, nor am I connected to architectural practice in Northern Ireland. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_bones_a375.html" title="User:Adam bones">Adam bones</a> 13:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC) Adam bones

<dd><b>Comment</b>: While he may indeed have won that award, I can see no evidence on that site that leads me to believe that that makes him either notable within the architecture world or meeting the Wikipedia notability standards. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 13:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It makes him one of only 62 people on earth to have won such an award this year. Apart from that, the notability guideline requires one to speculate as to whether the architect will become "part of the enduring historical record". I am aware that the subject is preparing a book for publication (not verifiable, my deepest apologies), but apart from that, he is the most likely current, practising NI architect to contribute to that record. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_bones_a375.html" title="User:Adam bones">Adam bones</a> 13:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC) Adam bones

<dd><b>Comment</b>:Scarcity does not imply notability. I may be the only person on the earth with a certain name, but that does not make me notable for having that name. Additionally, the award having been given to his organization or cooperation-company with another architect, if the award does indeed imply notability (and I by no means am claiming that it does), would mean the <i>company</i> might have a claim to notability. And as has been demonstrated with the Cue Ball group or other business organizations deleted on grounds of a shaky claim to notability, notability within a notable organization is not a claim to notability. If Google returned more than 82 results on this architect, I would be more at-ease with the reasons for keeping this article. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 13:45, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_personal_names" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_personal_names" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] is a precedent for just such an example as listed by yourself. And, as a point of pedantry, Google returned 93 results when I searched. I am not implying that scarcity confers notability. I am trying to imply that, if the world's foremost professional body for architects considers this architect/practice worthy of an award, it is a point of notability. The award confers notability; the scarcity of the awards shows the calibre of building. For an architect to win such an award is an achievement; for him to be under 40 is unusual; for the same to be practising in Northern Ireland is unheard of. There is no doubt that, in the context of architecture in Northern Ireland, in 2006, this is a notable individual: he is a writer, editor, award-winning architect and policymaker for the professional body. This may not make him a global figure - he will never be as famous as Saddam Hussein; but it does, in my opinion, render the article worthwhile. The deletion or inclusion of this article sets a precedent that will impact the creation (or not) of an expandible body of articles for (minor) architects across the UK, Ireland and Europe. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_bones_a375.html" title="User:Adam bones">Adam bones</a> 14:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC) Adam bones

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The work is the work of a partnership of Mark Hackett and Alastair Hall. However, this is a company of approximately four staff. It isn't an anonymous coproration, but a partnership, and as such the partners are entitled to recognition. Mugabe 14:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Because a subject does not score a lot of hits on Google, does not mean he does not exist, or that he has not achieved some level of notability. If this is the yardstick by which notability is measured, the internet will self-propagate into an information source for internet-people about internet-people. The subject is a significant architect in northern Ireland and the article should stand. Simmarian 16:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Anti-deletion</b>: The subject does not seem as notable as many on the British architects list. He is undoubtedly a minor, regional architect. The question is, whether this makes him of no interest, or whether his achievements are such to give rise to an article. He clearly exists, the article is researched and referenced (if scant on detail), and therefore verifiable. Verifiability is a semi-criterion for inclusion, and on this basis the subject could be given the benefit of the doubt and left as a stub. 83.70.182.44 14:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b>: It's patently obvious that <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">User:ForbiddenWord</a> has a history of confrontation in editing of articles. What isn't so obvious is whether (s)he has any expertise or knowledge of the subject matter at hand, that is regional architecture in the United Kingdom. Even were one to make the assumption that this article has been scheduled for deletion in good faith (which I am not suggesting to be the case), it remains the fact that the only reason for which the deletion is proposed is, that the user cannot find any further information on the subject. If this isn't a <i>reason</i> to have an article on this individual, I don't know what is. Suffice to say that if this article is deemed to be unnecessary, the remaining Northern Ireland architect stubs are equally so - eg Ciaran Mackel 73 Google results; Mervyn Black 32; Aileen Hull 15.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_bones_a375.html" title="User:Adam bones">Adam bones</a> 20:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: As one of the comments above indicates, he is a <i>young man.</i> That's a problem, as a biography covers a life that is set apart from others. It is not a sign of recognition, nor a validation. It is a summary of a significant and notable life that is <i>referred to by other media.</i> There is little to no indication that this architect has achieved the sort of stand alone fame as to require explanation for a curious world.

<li><b>Delete</b> The general criteria is that there must be enough note of this person to establish NPOV, and it's just not out there. This page is basically just the person's website copied into Wikipedia, and that is obviously not acceptable. If you can't at least find a few sources that say something about him, he's not notable enough. Flagging as a stub would be fine if we had any reason to think the lack of info was due to lack of effort, but as others have pointed out, there's just nothing else to say about this person. A relevent quote from WP:BIO, "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field" Widely recognized may be subjective, but 'enduring historical record' is not. 100 years from now, no one, even in his field, will remember one of 62 people to win some award some year. He's not Frank Gehry. If people want to know about him, they'll go to his website, not an encylopedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainManacles_caf8.html" title="User:CaptainManacles">captainManacles</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The initial entry is basic but (hopefully) informative. The term may be an amalgam of two terms but is used to describe a particular sub-genre of music.

<dd>Neither article is at all useful, though. Compare them to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionism.html" title="Impressionism">impressionism</a> article, for instance. I can read that article and have a good enough idea about what the style means that I could go to a museum, see some paintings, and recognize them as impressionist work. After reading either the "dubtronica" or "folktronica" articles, I'd be hard pressed to pick out a song of either genre. The articles don't offer a clue about the history of the genres, where they originated, or their identifying characteristics; they provide no information about the technique, other than describing them as an arbitrary almalgam of other genres.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's why I brought up the Conference as a comparison. For the most part, no one outside the local area these teams call home even know these semi-pro teams exist. Unless it's a human-interest story, you'll never see these teams on ESPN. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 12:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> One way to establish notability for a semipro or amateur team is to search for famous people who may have come in contact with the team. Did a former college star end up there? Did any alums matriculate to the NFL? The answer for both these questions is no. They don't seem to have a large fan base (most Falcons links lead to the YMCA team) and, most importantly, the team is defunct. It seems to me that in smaller leagues the more successful teams are town institutions with long histories. This team lasted less than 20 years. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 01:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This seems more a complaint about the colloquial nature of blogs than the topic at hand. If somebody says in a blog, "Lisp is fricken cool and runs circles around other languages!", that is NOT a reason to delete Lisp topics. The above cited page is not even directly linked to by "collection oriented programming", and thus appears more of a complaint about the author's personal blog or blog style than of the wikipedia topic content itself.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that the name is not in common-enough usage to justify an article, that is another matter. As the case is stated above, <b>I question the objectivity of the complaint.</b></p>
<p>Protologism complaints may not apply to computer-related topics because print publications are not where ideas are formed and shaped about software anymore. The web has largely replaced formal software journals, for good or bad.</p>
<p>"Collection oriented programming" is simply a name that encompasses a wide variety of tools and languages. It was not coined by the author of the above page. --Tablizer (7/20/2006)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That the term is "not common enough usage to justify an article" is <i><b>precisely</b></i> the issue I stated above. I'm sorry if that wasn't clear, but read the first sentence. I'm not sure why you think I have an issue with colloquial language outside of Wikipedia since I didn't write that, and, like you, I don't think it's a reason to delete. I brought up the page I linked because it's one of the few places which use the term at all and it explicitly says it's a protologism. I'll restate what I wrote above in more verbose terms in case my wording was confusing:
<ul>
<li>There are only 27 unique Google hits for the term.</li>
<li>One of them states that it is not an established methodology or term.</li>
<li>Some of the hits are more or less abandoned pages. For example, <a href="http://tunes.org/wiki/APL" class="external text" title="http://tunes.org/wiki/APL" rel="nofollow">this page</a> was imported from another Wiki, and it's been removed from the original source.</li>
<li>Some of the hits (like <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mail-www/haskell/msg01396.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mail-www/haskell/msg01396.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.etoile-project.org/etoile/mediawiki/index.php?title=TrackerKit" class="external text" title="http://www.etoile-project.org/etoile/mediawiki/index.php?title=TrackerKit" rel="nofollow">this</a>)use it in a very generic, descriptive sense rather than as the name of a methodology.</li>
<li>The article itself gives no citations for the term.</li>
<li>The document which appears to be the most legitimate potential citation, a paper by James Brakefield, appears to be unreferenced by anyone other than the author. I searched the ACM's guide to computing literature, a comprehensive index of nearly all computing research ever published, and found only one citation, by Brakefield.</li>
<li>Note that there is no exception to the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">avoid neologisms guideline</a> for computer-related topics. The issue of usage of a term on the web vs. in print is a red herring here since this phrase isn't frequently used in either place.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In short, I see no reason to believe that this is a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> methodology, and quite a few reasons to believe that it is not. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 13:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> on grounds of notability and original research unless references are provided. Heck, I myself could cook up a few "programming metholodogies" if I tried.... --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 11:13, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I deny originating the term. How about a compromise: a stub at the very top that questions the commonality of the term rather than outright deletion. It can serve as topic to tie together languages and tools with similar features. There is <b>no alternative</b> currently that I can find to describe the similarities of focusing on operations that operate on entire collections/data-structures. It is a concept found in linear algebra ("matrix math"), but arrays are not the only collections that can be treated this way. -Tablizer</p>
<dl>
<dd>Subjects which are not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> do not belong on Wikipedia at all. It is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> regardless of whether you personally created the term (and please note that nobody here ever asserted you did). If you don't understand why this is true, read the definition of "original research" on the page I just linked. There is no "question" regarding the commonality of the term. It is almost totally unused in the field of computing. A search of <a href="http://portal.acm.org/" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/" rel="nofollow">750000+ citations from 3000+ publishers</a> yields two results, one of which is the Brakefield citation I discussed above, and the second of which describes an algorithm rather than something like what is in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that even if this article wasn't OR — and I assert that it is, per the Wikipedia definition — it would still be inappropriate since it's an un-cited, un-verifiable protologism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of areas of research, in programming and other fields, where there is no good alternative to existing technologies which solves a certain problem, or nothing published on a certain area of the field. That's fine — it's a great area in which to do research. But Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> the place to publish it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In closing I should add that I do welcome your contributions on established, verifiable methodologies such as relational databases, so please don't take this AfD personally. This is not a discussion of the <b>merit</b> of what you term "collection oriented programming," only its <b>suitability</b> for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 19:38, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Question</i>: Folks keep saying "notable" and "notable enough" and the like. Since these same people argue that "notability is not a requirement," what I want to know is <i>what sets this school apart from other schools?</i> If this is the sort of school that you would say, "Ooooh, I'm going to take note of that one; it's not like every other one at all," I would like to know what it is that would draw that. I ask because I can't see where the article gives anything, and we are supposed to be talking about the article, and not the article type, not former arguments, not the nominator, and not our general views of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, bringing up the nominator in a sense answers your question. This school was singled out because a newly registered editor listed it for deletion. There are plenty of other schools whose articles are in worse shape or are less than stubs that are not marked for deletion, partly because experienced editors know that it is very unlikely that a legitimate high school article will ever get deleted (even if they wish they would be). This same editor tried to speedy delete <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Horn_2d8d.html" title="Golden Horn">Golden Horn</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Elizabeth_Catholic_High_School_6f2f.html" title="St. Elizabeth Catholic High School">St. Elizabeth Catholic High School</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/g/User%7EUsgnus_fc47.html" title="User:Usgnus">Usgnus</a> 12:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again, other articles needing deletion really doesn't answer why this should be kept. I can agree that the nominator is suspicious, but I don't think that there would be delete votes possible if the article in question weren't failing the guidelines. The people voting to delete aren't trolls, aren't "deletionists," aren't haters of education, America, and apple pie, and the people voting "keep" have been the first to bring in personalities and to label other voters with some imagined opprobrium. If we remain focused on the article and whether or not it violates the deletion policy, it's fair to ask what, about this article, gives us a singular quality to the subject. (I vote to keep schools some of the time, delete some of the time; it depends on the article, not its subject.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If an article on a real country says, "Russia is a big country to the east of me," I'd vote to delete the article (not "clean it up"). Further, micronations claim to be countries and are routinely cast out. Further, schools are not like nations in any manner except occupying space.

<ul>
<li>It's a part of the common law of WP:AfD - not sure if it's codified anywhere. To delete an article titled Russia rather than clean it up is pure madness. If an article about a country is just a stub, it's still worthwhile It's a stub is not a good criterion for deletion. Micronations claiming to be countries in general fails WP:HORSE and thus the position All countries are inherently worthy of articles is a true one. FWIW, I'm not saying that I believe that all high schools are worthy of articles, just that it is a part of the common law that they are. WilyD 14:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Despite your apparently relish for citing your own contributions, these comments exactly categorize the problem with your position on these issues. AfD is <b>not</b> cleanup, and yet you think it is just fine to ignore the stated <b>policies</b> at <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> in order to effectively use AfD as a tool for cleaning up articles that are worthwhile. An article about Russia is so obviously not a candidate for deletion as to beg the question, irrespective of its condition.

<li>I think you need to check your syntax a bit. If you mean that I have a relish for citing my own articles, it is no relish, but rather a refutation to the common thuggery of "you deletionist you," which is an absurdity when applied to <i>any</i> editor. Secondly, "policy" for AfD is the deletion guideline. An article on Russia that is "Russia is a country to the east of me" is <i>not an article.</i> It is not a stub. It is not a substub. It is, instead, a speedy deletion candidate. Please look at the speedy delete guidelines and come to understand them. Also, if you believe that single sentences are articles, I suspect that you may be thinking of HiLites and not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No syntax check required. They are not "your" articles. I assume you are referring to your <b>contributions</b>. I don't care if you initiated ten thousand articles on wikipedia, it doesn't change the fact that you "routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school-related articles", and that you do so on the basis that you don't consider individual schools to be a worthwhile subject matter for individual articles. You're entitled to do so, but the rest of us are equally entitled vote to keep such articles on the basis that we DO consider individual schools to be a worthwhile subject matter for individual articles. You continually (for years now) to insist that we ought to somehow leave the opinion that schools are inherently noteworthy "at the door", as it were - but at the same time you and the rest of those "who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school-related articles" are free to cart your opinion right on into the AfD discussions. Add a dose of heaping condescencion, then brag a little about your own <b>contributions</b> and guess what - despite all that, not a single verifiable high school article has been excised from wikipedia through the deletion processes in almost 2 years.

<dd>Ahem. I vote to keep some schools, delete some schools, and redirect others, as I actually read the article and decide whether it follows policy. You, however, prejudge that all of something fits. As for whether I "routinely" vote to delete, I do not <b>routinely</b> vote any way. I actually <i>consider</i> the article. On the other hand, you vote and encourage others to vote by rote, by routine, to vote universally, without consideration of the individual at hand. This is combined with an absolute error of fact, as several school articles have been deleted just in the last two weeks, much less in the last two years. I assume you watchlist every one of them and watch New Pages obsessively to make sure that every single school is preserved, no matter what the nature of hte "article?" That kind of obsession is unhealthy. As for whether my contributions are my articles, I will leave that absurdity alone. However, what is at stake is much, much more pernicious than a single case of your playing "gotcha": You and others voting <b>by routine</b> rather than by <b>consideration</b> have <i>routinely</i> attacked the character, intelligence, and motives of every person voting contrary to your opinion. You, collectively, have tried to make each consideration personal rather than intellectual and a matter of passion rather than judgment. This is corrosive. While I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble, I am interested in stopping this habit of people attacking nominators and voters. It is absolutely disgusting to observe.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure there is a "conspiracy", but there is a concerted effort underway (for some time) to excise school articles from wikipedia and find a way to overturn the overwhelming precedent that school articles are simply not deleted (as a general rule) through the deletion processes. Why do I say there is a concerted effort? Mass-nominations of related schools all on the same day (both this month and last month). Sock-puppet nominations to AfD (such as this one). Refusual by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" to recognize that there even <b>is</b> a precedent (which there obviously is). (Yes, I recognize that the precedent is not binding upon future AfD discussions, but "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" ought to take that precedent into account before nominating school articles and before engaging in these "discussions"). Repeated assertions and claims that there is "no consensus to keep high schools", when well over 95% of AfD disucssions on high school articles have ended in overwhelming consensus to <b>keep</b>. After over 2 years of wrangling, it really is time for "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" to find a new hobby horse and accept that school articles have become a standard part of wikipedia. With there being over ten thousand articles about schools included in the project to date, average readers will have certainly come to expect to find school articles in the encyclopedia when referencing them. On many days, scores of new school articles are created and the inevitability of the nature of this project ensures that the vast majority of these will reamin in the project and be organically expanded. Those who do not believe that schools are worthwhile, or notable, or encyclopedic have every right to that opinion and to express it, but I think we can all agree that these debates (at least on high school articles) are largely fruitless and irrespective of what side of the debate you fall on, in light of the overwhelming precedent, these "discussions" in and of themselves add precious little to wikipedia.

<p>This article has been going through a pointless revert war due to aggressive editing from certain editors, the fact that it is now only 3 lines serves no purpose, nor is it useful to anyone trying to find out more information relating to the subject or phenomenon of "The Frosties Kid", basically there is no reason to have this article when all the content pertaining to the subject matter is not present. The discussions in the talk page have resulted to no consensus so now I am putting it up for deletion to see what the redeeming qualities are to keep such a pointless installment to WP. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 00:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, please do not try to make this personal. I couldn't care less about the article as it stands. I put it up for nom. because as it stands (as I have explained) it is not notable, nor bears purpose as a decent WP article therefore it should be deleted in my opinion. There is insufficient information relating to this subject, being an article relating to the protagonist <b>The Frosties Kid</b> when there isn't even a full name for the actor or any other information and evidence given other than <b>3 lines of text</b> which hardly inform of anything. It should be deleted because it is not a worthy article, the three sentences are very vague and do not possess any possible information that contribute to the article or subject. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 02:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, once again I will state the facts as they stand. It's true that the Frosties Kid is an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a> but this is not present in the article. And regardless what mboverload or any other editor who has been associated to the ongoing mess that is a discussion about this article says, the proposed substitution articles are hardly useful or according to the title. If you want to make an article relating to the commercial than do it by all means, but this one is NOT about the commercial. Let's try again <b>THE FROSTIES KID</b> should be an article relating to the character, perhaps the phenomenon relating or not relating to him and anything between. It is not an excuse to write three lines where, the first describes the ad and the last describes the jingle and there is no purpose for it. When there is no purpose for the content relating to an article it is void of being useful or having a point, and in this case I continue to say this article is pointless. I would agree to either <b>MERGE</b> with <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frosted_Flakes_fc2c.html" title="Frosted Flakes">Frosted Flakes/Frosties</a> article - seeing as it would fit into a "popular culture" or "trivia" section.

<dd>To the best of my knowledge the lyrics have not appeared in the article for over 14 days. Afd is not a "vote" and yes it is an invitation for comment. The idea of an Encylopedia is not cut and dry, all encyclopedias have many contributors, and many styles of writing. Until 2 hours ago, I had no idea that <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Dude_0940.html" title="Dell Dude">Dell Dude</a> existed. On our side of the pond <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Dude_0940.html" title="Dell Dude">Dell Dude</a> isn't well known - should I raise that as AfD? All articles have a place on <b>Wikipedia</b> as long as they are not crass, self purpetuating, or breach formally agreed rules <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Esse est percipi (To be is to be perceived)</dd>
<dd>Comment can create changes in perception. I am all in favour of that. My decision that I agree with the originator of this AfD was that the article was replaced by an idea I posted in a sandbox, that the article should be steered in another direction. It was never decided upon, despite constant discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b> This AfD was raised about a content dispute and the direction/steering of the article.

<dd>That's exactly the problem. AFD is not the place to resolve content disputes. AFD is an invitation for comments on whether or not an article should be deleted, yes, but it is not a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request For Comment</a>, which is, I think, what Toffile meant in his comment above. If issues relating to this article could not be resolved on the article's talk page, it's time to go to the next step in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a>. But Picraft's nom, combined with some of his comments on the article's talk page immediately before he nominated the page, suggest that, as Mboverload said, he nominated the page because he was displeased with the way the discussion was going. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=66258379&amp;oldid=66257615" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=66258379&amp;oldid=66257615" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66259230" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66259230" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Abuse_of_deletion_process</a>.

<dd>Editors are always free to suggest deletion for concerns other than those raised in the nomination. The most common deletion vote is 'per nom,' but that doesn't mean that every deletion vote must agree with the nominator's reasoning. If the article is deleted, it won't matter who supported what course of action and why, so if you think the article should be deleted, and so does Toffile, why does it matter if you don't agree on the reason? -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 00:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I feel a little foolish now. User:Piecraft:Piecraft and <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJum4_3697.html" title="User:Jum4">Jum4</a> had disputes with several admins about RV to the point where 5 admins were involved and the article was locked for a week. it sat as 3 lines, which could have sat on any article and nobody would have noticed them. The last frosties kid article was a speedy delete on july 7th. (i was not involved with that and neither was Jum4, who started this present article on july 8th) My only involvement with the article has been on the talk page or RV when spurious unsourced comments and sections have been added. Prior to the locking, the article was constantly vandalised like <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frosted_Flakes_fc2c.html" title="Frosted Flakes">Frosted Flakes</a>, some guy even posted me with a test3 on my user page. AfD is probably not the right way to have dealt with the matter. But if the article were to be deleted because I voted because I agreed <b>Per nom</b> then it would greatly matter to me if it was deleted as a matter of copyvio or notability, which haven't been largely discussed. But thanks <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">User Talk VARY</a> for the explanation about how AfD works. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 02:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I repeat, the article has been put up for deletion <b>not</b> for content dispute, but for the fact that at the time I put it up for deletion the article no longer referred to the <b>subject</b> of <b>title</b> that the article should have been discussing. It's all very well to go on about how we should have discussed it on the talk page or resolved it on <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a>, but bear in mind I was the one who had already requested admins to lock this article down when the article was being carelessly reverted and "vandalised" to the extent of going <i>nowhere</i>. And when the article was once again changed to the revisions of 14:01, 28 July 2006 which if anything were already considered to be acceptable by other users. If such an article was to be acceptable it would need to be more than a pointless stub relating information about an ad and the jingle when it is supposed to be relating to <b>THE FROSTIES KID</b>. Wikipedia is not a repository for pointless articles to take up space, now if I need to once again repeat my reasons for nom then you seriously need to check up on the regulatins yourself. This nomination is <b>not</b> about notability but the fact that the article is pointless and of no use. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 09:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep, Move and Stub</b> . "Useless article" is no excuse for blasting the article straight. Then, all stubs would be gone. How about this: move it to <i><b>They're Gonna Taste Great!

<p>The fine people of Wakefield, Massachusetts chose him as their selectman, but his only other claim to fame is that he is one of the Republicans vying for the honor of being trounced by Ted Kennedy this fall. He is not even the nominee yet and, as a mere candidate whose only prior service was on a smallish city's board of selectmen, fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Article is clearly promotional in tone. A selectman is not notable. A <i>candidacy</i> is not notable. Especially not a candidacy for a primary. Especially not the <i>Republican</i> primary in Massachusetts. If the article is kept it needs a radical POV-ectomy and careful watching, since there is at least a possibility of campaign staff involvement in the editing of the article. I note too that the article cites no sources inline, and the only sources mentioned, external links, are Scott's campaign site, and a site which merely presents politician's stated views (i.e. essentially self-authored); in the case of an intrinsically controversial topic, this kind of site can't be considered to meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>That's funny, last I heard this was America and anyone was allowed to run for office. I didn't realize one had to have a "claim to fame" to run. Also, I believe the original Wikipedia article was very much "stating the facts" in a non-promotional way. Then, certain individuals from the Chase campaign made their way onto this site and altered the article to show Kevin in a negative light.

That is a matter of opinion, YOUR opinion. Also, please site your sources for saying that he is likely to lose the primary in September "according to state GOP insiders". Your information is highly partisan and opinionated, and appears to be written in an effort to form a "smear campaign" against Kevin.

<li><b>Comment</b> by the nominator. I'm starting to find this quite amusing: I as the nominator didn't mention anything about the notability of the school and neither did anyone of the people who suggested delete. However, most of the people in support of keeping the article do so on the basis that the school is notable. I cannot conclude anything other than that they haven't read what was written before they stated their suggestion of what to do with this article, which goes explicitly against the instructions that accompany AfDs. Hence, for this reason and also for the reason that notability isn't part of the set criteria for articles about schools, I strongly urge the closing nominator the disregard all the "keeps" based solely on notability. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 01:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Koffieyahoo, may I request you to elaborate on the reason for your nomination then. You had written a reason about it being a primary school, which you have since struck. You point to WP:NOT which is very generic. There are many other school articles here. Can you explain how this one fits into WP:NOT and the others dont? -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You provide a non-argument for inclusion, every article should be evaluated for its own merit. However, all the other almost empty school articles which basically only provide the location of the school plus some info on former head masters/teachers and the curriculum shouldn't be here either for exactly the same reason, but it is "not done" in this community to nominate them all at once. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 04:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I understand this correctly, the article is up on AFD because its a stub? Weren't most featured articles started as stubs at one point of time? If having very little info is the reason for afd, I would still recommend <b>keeping</b> the article to allow time for organic growth. -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:56, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a directory entry, and, yes, currently also a stub. Moreover, at the moment it also lacks any references to any non-trivial published works, which is extemely important in the context of any encyclopedia. Also, AfDs are about the current merits of articles, not about what they can potentially be in the future. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not worried at all about the existence of the school, what I am worried about is getting the article above the level of a directory entry. Personally, I don't see that this will happen by the simple lack of reliable, verifiable sources on any other information added. That's also why I sent it to AfD and have not just tagged it appropriately.

<li><b>Delete</b> I say go ahead and delete it. The article itself was written by somebody who worked for his campaign (I heard it was a volunteer who tried his hardest to become a paid staffer...) Hiram Lewis is dead politically in the state of West Virginia, and I do not believe he can re-invent himself. I do know a few of his staffers that did work on the campaign and he still owes them money, and they don't think very highly of Mr. Lewis. Why do I think this article should be deleted? Simple; he lost his race to take on Robert C Byrd, and is no longer relevant to this race.</li>

<li><b>Further Comment</b>. Hermetism and Hermeticism refer to two different eras. The original followers were called Hermetists, following Hermetism, the philosophy or religion or movement of Hermes. After the Corpus Hermeticum was rediscovered by the West in the 15th century, the new followers were called Hermeticists, because they followed not directly the teachings of Hermes, but of what was Hermetic. Hermetism is the precursor to Hermeticism, according to scholars. People call this junk history, but whereas I have added verifiable citations from several sources, the attackers are attempting to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and actually performing OR by deciding that they know off hand more about the subject, and lacking citations, they attack citations from reputable sources!<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Vegita_7857.html" title="User talk:King Vegita">Talk</a>) 13:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is an odd article. Who coined the word "Hermetism" instead of Hermeticism? The writer of Kybalion? The sources are not scholarly. hscrocker is not an academic publisher (compare with Brill and university presses). Manly P. Hall is an important and interesting figure in the history of occultism in the twentieth century, but his work is not referenced as authoritative by scholars. Do a search in a university library journal and book database on ancient Hermetic scholarship - you will find names like Walter Scott, Festiguiere, and Garth Fowden instead. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 02:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> Let's look at just the first two sentences. "Hermetism was the religion of the philosophical elite of Ancient Egypt. In the ancient days, every pagan nation (i.e. those of the classical pantheons: Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Nordic, Druidic, etc) had two religions." We have two outrageous claims there, neither of which are referenced, nor do they accord with generally accepted knowledge or scholarly understanding of historical facts. If not a pure <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, it seems to simply be an outlet for an "alternative" understanding of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a> based on the work of an oft-read but low "scholarly integrity" author: Hall seems to be after the ultimate "synthesis" of all "mystery teachings".</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think hermeticism is bunk in its entirety (after all, it was comprehensively and conclusively <i>de</i>bunked by Casaubon during the Renaissance). However, I accept that it is an important part of Western tradition and hence merits a neutral article. The junk historical findings of a <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foucault%27s_Pendulum_317c.html" title="Foucault's Pendulum">Diabolical</a>, on the other hand, don't merit an entire, originally researched article which puts his slanted viewpoint across as fact.</dd>
<dd>That's just my personal, skeptically slanted reading of it, of course. But I hope it at least answered your question! <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually Causabon's debunking has been debunked in the 1940's, and that only has to do with the age of the Corpus Hermeticum. And to reply to the first user, no Hermetism refers to the precursor of Hermeticism, and it is well documented. I have done more research and this article does need to be tended to, sure, but it needs to be tended to, not deleted. Hermetism is documented outside of Manly P. Hall, and I have done extensive research and there are other viewpoints which I have now found verification of and can add in. The proposor of this AfD decided not to find that same evidence, but rather remove what was already there in order to support his POV.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Vegita_7857.html" title="User talk:King Vegita">Talk</a>) 17:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, Casaubon's research was not "debunked"; it was criticised, but as far as I can make out, the criticism were not valid. Moreover, if the Corpus Hermeticum was made up in the early centuries AD, then it cannot reflect the teachings of some ancient figure.</dd>
<dd>Casaubon notwithstanding, there is absolutely no evidence that I am aware of with regards to there being "dual" religions in the Nordic tradition; admittedly I am an amateur when it comes to Germanic <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philology.html" title="Philology">philology</a>, though. Also, the Egyptian pantheon (and Hell, the Egyptian theology)does not fit into the same group as the Indo-European ones. That's a simple historical fact.</dd>
<dd>Those are just a few of the concerns to do with the first two sentences. I could carry on about the whole article, but have no desire to do so. The bottom line is that there is no reason for it to stay, unless some pretty convincing, <i>scholarly</i> (read: reputable, serious) evidence comes up that says that Hermetism is different to Hermeticism. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 18:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Causabon had his theory based upon the fact that the Greek text would date back to the 1st or 2nd century, the Greek used. However, in the Nag Hammadi find, an older version of one of the books of the Corpus Hermeticum was found, written in Coptic, showing that the idea that the book had to originate in Greek even was flawed. It's similar to looking up the New King James Version of the Bible and decide that Genesis was written about 1950. The removal of this article is nothing more than a POV push.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Vegita_7857.html" title="User talk:King Vegita">Talk</a>) 11:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The content of the Coptic Hermetic text bares similarity in form (question/answer) but not in content. The material in the Greek Hermetica contains some Middle Platonic and Stoic elements. The fact that the Coptic is not pre-Hellenistic means there is little way of determining that this is indigenous pre-Hellenistic Egyptian. It may have been an Egyptian's competitive attempt to take back Thoth from the Greeks. See my comments below.

<li>I have more sources now that I could add, if I had the actual opportunity to work with people one article at a time.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't matter if Hall did extensive research. I have read Hall's work which generally receives little or no attention from scholars of antiquity and renaissance studies. He makes unsubstantiated connections and generalizations about antiquity. Most scholars up into the 1980's thought that Hermeticism was a Late Hellenistic (Greek and not indigenous Egyptian) that saw its revival with Ficino in the Renaissance. Garth Fowden, however, in the Egyptian Hermes, has shown that there are two types of Hermeticism that he defined as technical and philosophical, the philosophical forming a little bit later around the second century CE. The technical Hermetica includes alchemy, some bare-bones astrology (Sun/Moon stuff) and magic, and dates as early as the third or second century BCE. Works were attributed to the fictional character/god Thrice-great Hermes to give them some weight and respectability. This was a common practice. Fowden's research has contributed to changing the scope and antiquity of Hermeticism by making such distinctions and by covering far more material than the Corpus (which was the late philosophical Hermetica). Today, the question scholars debate is whether or not there is some indigenous non-Greek Egyptian Hermetic tradition. The recent research on Demotic texts shows that there is in fact another thread that may be indigenous, but the content has very few connections to the Greek philsophical Hermetica. What I mean by indigenous is that it is Egyptian, but Egypt was Hellenistic during the time these texts were written, so it can't escape syncreticism. Please see <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-05-19.html" class="external free" title="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-05-19.html" rel="nofollow">http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-05-19.html</a> for an example of the type of scholarship that should be used for these articles.

<dd><small><b>Comment</b> Regarding the news articles in the non-Australian and non-New Zealand press (the subject was NZ-born) - all these articles appear to be reprints or rewrites of international newswire articles and NOT original journalism by foreign journalists. The CNN article is sourced to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>. The Manila Times article is sourced to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France_Presse_1cfa.html" title="Agence France Presse">Agence France Presse</a>. The South Africa article seems very much like a cut-down version of the AFP story. The Washington Times link appears to be broken, but its likely that its a wire story too. Newswire stories (which by the nature of their platform, carry many more minor stories than newspaper) are simply lifted from a online computer feed and required minimal effort by a newspaper editor. If it was a really substantial story, international journalists would not just be doing copying wire stores. (oh and the Anchorage article is a brief paragraph in a just-for-fun "News of the Weird" column). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li><small><b>Delete</b> Not encyclopedically notable as a criminal ("drug-crazed person kills animals" is not particularly unique or remarkable). There are many, many stories that get coverage in multiple places in international news media but which are not encyclopedically notable (this one is a "news of the weird" article which has shock value for journalists, and seems to have disseminated internationally through newswires, not original foreign journalism). (And incidentally, the current article content has various inaccuracies. (The sentence was 16 months, up for parole in 12. The single bestiality charge was dropped for lack of evidence. The article also fails to mention the subject's psychosis from a heavy drug habit)).

Companies that have been in business for a while are likely to have a ton of ex-CEOs. Also, people running for office are rarely notable for doing so. Again, there is just a huge number of such individuals. For the U.S. House of Representatives, there are probably 700 to 1,500 failed candidates every two years, more if you do not count those who do not get past the primaries (the large range is due to the fact that smaller parties do not have a candidate for every seat). Also, we have had elections for the House for over two hundred years, although there were fewer Representatives in the past. Now, think about all of the failed candidates in other countries and countries that no longer exist, from the founding of the country to the current day or to the country's demise. Finally, some people want to include failed state, county and even mayoral candidates, which would be an even bigger number of people. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

For someone who "hates to sound populist", you sure are good at it. McGavick is notable by any objective standard.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>: With due respect to my fellow Wikipedians, are y'all on drugs? It's a single sentence, a predicate nominative. "The sky is that thing up there." That's not an article. It's not a stub. It's a <i>fact,</i> and this particular fact is a dictionary definition. One of the oldest principles of the deletion policy is that Wikipedia is the encyclopedia, while Wiktionary is the dictionary: do not eat disk space with duplication. This thing could be deleted under G1 as a speedy delete, and it must be deleted as a dictionary definition in the regular AfD sense. If people want an article on veterinary surgery, they should write one. Until then, a dictionary definition violates policy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In its current state it is a one sentence "dicdef" but this subject matter clearly has the potential to move beyond anything that is suitable for a dictionary, which is why the stub should stay here in the encyclopedia. I, personally, do not feel comfortable expanding the stub due to my utter and complete lack of knowledge in this area but looking at Google, I found a number of sites with encyclopedic content that shows me the potential of this article in the right editors hands. Like <a href="http://animalpetdoctor.homestead.com/History1.html" class="external text" title="http://animalpetdoctor.homestead.com/History1.html" rel="nofollow">History of Veterinary Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow">Cornell University's history as a leading educator in Veterinary surgery</a>, <a href="http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2003/july/Clewlow/Vet-History-Review.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2003/july/Clewlow/Vet-History-Review.html" rel="nofollow">Veterinary wound management with items relating to surgical care</a>, and this doesn't include all the articles that popped up recently due to interest in Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro's injury and surgery.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It needs authors <i>to begin it, as there is nothing there now that is allowable by our policies.</i> That's the problem. The amount of work the imagined and invited authors will put in is <i>total,</i> and yet the history will hold onto this inadequate insult of a fact as the origins? Why? What is the difference between what is there and nothing at all? What, <i>functionally,</i> is gained by this dictionary definition? If I were going to write on it, I would use my sneaky speedy delete super powers and then just start from scratch, as I think this kind of thing just gets in the way of an article, and it surely doesn't <i>invite</i> one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Geogre, this is a case mark example of a <i>stub</i>. Yes, it is a humble begining but it's not insulting nor is it useless. The very purpose and benefits of stubs is that it <i>invites authors to expand it</i>. We have these stub categories so that someone who is knowledgeable in that field can look at the current stubs and work on expanding those within their realm of knowledge. I am an active watcher of the "Wine stub" category and I know I'm not alone. I would encourage the humble beginning of any wine related article because if it's taged with a "wine stub", eventually someone will get to it to make it into a great article. I am sure that there are those with Veterinary background who will come across this Veterinary related stub (which there needs to be a template for) and help expand the article. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 17:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the nominator and others would be willing to work on this, the article can be improved, and even in the worst case scenario of what one views it as now, would be salvagable. The claims of OR were not explained and included claiming that cited facts were OR. The article deals with similarities and interactions between these systems, how one may have influenced the other or where they have similar beliefs, with no claim that one gave the other that belief. This is not OR, this is cited. Some is uncited, in what I considered to be uncontroversial. I can still offer citations for this, and work with the other editors to make this a good article. But there has been no attempt to work with me on this, only false accusations (where there may be actual "OR" is not what they claimed was OR) and an attempt to attack other articles to prevent me from spending time to fix this one. These are bad faith measures, and there needs to be work on this, not a simple deletion. They are taking a strong immediatist stance and I'm taking only a very moderate eventualist stance, it will be fixed eventually through work and discussion to be done immediately. I was planning on this weekend.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a>(<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_Vegita_7857.html" title="User talk:King Vegita">Talk</a>) 13:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Citations do not preclude something from being OR. For example, a PhD thesis has to be filled to the brim with both citations and original research in order to be worth a degree: citing facts from books but stringing them together in a fashion not found in those books counts as original research; indeed, that's why it's <i>research</i> and not "original <i>fantasy</i>". It's quite fine, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a> if you want to work on it this weekend: this AfD will last five days.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't even tell what the article's thesis is. Is it that religions interact and cover some of the same topics? Well, duh, they are religions, of course they cover religious topics, and it is nearly inevitable that they will interact if spacial-temporally colocated and highly likely that any two comprehensive or near-comprehensive world views will have some degree of similarity. I'm way outside my fields of expertise and reliable knowledge on this specific religion, but I see <i>no reason to believe that it is original research</i> and <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">User:RJHall</a> who removed the prod tags is also unclear whether this really is OR. The article appears to have originated as a fork from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, in which it is properly treated as a subarticle. If you go into edit mode there you get the message "This page is 32 kilobytes long. This may be longer than is preferable; see article size."

How can the article be good if it <i>tells us the least about Hermeticism</i>? Shouldnt it go into depth about Hermeticism, since this is the whole point of the article?

<li>'<i>Synopsis</i> I've had a reasonably extensive discussion with <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a>, primarily on my talk page, partially on his. He clarified for me that he believes "The point of the article is trying to make it appear that Hermeticism is related to all of those religions via the name 'thought systems'." I read the article both as an RFC responder and again for this AFD and came to the conclusion that there is no significant relationship, hence I disagree with him as to whether the article is trying to make that point. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 06:41, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>. Thats why you disagree? The lead intro is only one line and says: <i>This article outlines both <b>similarities</b> between Hermetism, Hermeticism, and other thought systems as well as their interactions between one another.</i> We both agree here that there are no simularities/significant relationship! Yet the article claims it.&#160;:p <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 06:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Sigh, I thought we'd reached mutual understanding. I guess not. I believe that there is no significant relationship, not that there are no similarities. In some of the cases there may be significant similarities (I haven't probed that deeply into all the cases), in some there are no significant similarities. Similarities and relationships are different. There can be high degrees of similarity with insignificant relationships. For two biological ways such situations can arise, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convergent_evolution.html" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_relay.html" title="Evolutionary relay">evolutionary relay</a>.

<li><b>Send to cleanup</b>: The article is a mess. At the same time, the duration of his time on television, and, most particularly, when he began with the "Commander Tom" show, has passed him from local phenomenon to a minor cultural touchstone. Additionally, the area served (which was pretty large before frequency crowding and the reduction of signal range) has meant a pretty large umbra.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> ~Per nomination. If we include every two-bit personality who has appeared on local TV then Wikipedia will become an indiscriminate repository of information, vulnerable to the adding unverified information faster than we are able to verify it, cluttering the encyclopedia and pulling down its general quality. If the guy ever lands a job at a national network, then maybe we can have an article, but that is unlikely. Just because someonw is notable in Buffalo or has languished on some local TV station for a few decades doesn't make you notable. Yes he is just as notable as Irv Weinstein - something that means that he is not since they both fail the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidlines. There are a lot of parochial intrests here obviously and as someone not from Buffalo I can tell you that this guy is not notable. You need to vote with your head and not your heart, since some people tend to bond with people they see on TV, regardless of how non-notable they are. Voting because you saw the guy on TV in Buffalo for years is a biased vote.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think the assumption (especially as it is laid out in the nomination) that because a news personality didn't do network then they don't have talent is uncivil and unfair to the subject. There are many reasons for declining a national network job (relocating family, change in lifestyle, etc) that keep alot of very talented broadcasters in their local market. In regards to Bozo, yes there were several local Bozos but that still doesn't decline the notability of that particular local Bozos. Many, many children who grew up in Baltimore area (and DC too) who want to look up info on their Bozo are not going to want to read about Willard Scott. They're going to want to read about Stu Kerr. I also think we're not giving enough credit for his service to children's television including his role in shaping Kevin Clash's career--without whom we would have never had the Elmo phenomenon. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep" - Not sure if my last edit went through. Stu Kerr was an integral part of early television in Baltimore. I had the honor of meeting Stu while a broadcasting student and he shared that "The Early Riser" (where he did his janitor character) was a staple of early television because a good part of the show was improvised. Stu was also the host of the popular "Dialing for Dollars" for several years on WMAR TV. Deleting Stu's contributions would be a major loss because media students would be unable to read about one of the pioneers of childrens' shows and the days of early television.

<li><b>Keep</b>, or <b>Move</b> (as per Chris). I don't agree with <b>Merge</b> on the grounds that this page is not an official Phoenix Wright page, nor is not a feature or easter egg of the game. The page, as it stands as of this moment, is factually correct. The defense cedes that the notability of Objection! cannot be proved by conventional means. However, I propose, based on the fact that this article is well written and accurate, that the prosecution take it upon themselves to attempt to prove this article is not notable. My analysis of the article is, of course, subjective. I naturally invite you to contradict, or support my claim. Although, it might be more productive for Wikipedia if, instead of pointing out factual inaccuracies in this article, you instead take it upon yourself to investigate and rewrite parts which are not to your satisfaction. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 13:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I believe we've come to the crux of the matter, which is this: I believe that this article should never have been VfD'd. If you check the history, it was nominated originally for deletion only eight minutes after it was first made. I believe that such an article should at not be outed almost instantly just because it is classed as an 'internet phenomenon', but given 'stub' status until such time as it's notability can be determined <i>without any doubt</i> one way or the other. Is there any Wikipedia statistics that can be used to determine the popularity of the <i>article</i>? Ignoring the website for the time being: until statistics which are considered to be Wiki-kosher are gleaned (refer to my comments about asking the author for any more real stats), this is the only real data that can be analysed in any form. The only other fact around which we can base any real argument is that <b>Objection! exists</b>. Obvious, yes, but I believe that this alone may be the reason why it's been added to Wikipedia: Somebody figured that Objection! was popular enough to write about. Others, including myself, found it useful enough to refer to, and worthy enough to add to. It's a good article as it stands, and it should remain because of this. Basically, it's popularity is shown by its presence on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 10:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I think it's far more productive to AfD the article right away - <i>if</i> the subject fails to get popular, it means there's less wasted effort, if the subject becomes a sneaky hit, it's a matter of DRVing the thing and restoring the history (if needed). If, on the other hand, the (early) AfD finds the material keepable, that strengthens the article's reason of existence and is less likely to get AfD'd later, as you can refer to the earlier decision. Also remember, we don't make articles about stuff that's <i>about to become</i> popular, we're making articles about stuff that <i>is</i> popular. You can only start an "about to become popular" article if a country goes to war with another (apologies for using a current-events example) or something of <i>that</i> magnitude happens. Plus, we're absolutely not shy of deleting articles that are "popular" by Wikipedia standards (ie, have a ton of revisions) - the <i>notability</i> of the <i>subject</i> is all that matters. If Wikipedia <i>article</i> popularity mattered, we'd <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">create articles</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Wikipedia_6dad.html" title="English Wikipedia">about the articles</a>. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:46, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Apologies for taking up so much room, but he deserves to be heard out. I also recieved <a href="http://www.4camp.net:8081/sensortable.htm?id={DB323DAE-4CD7-44AC-82EF-3FDA9596D2D0}&amp;subid=3&amp;index=0" class="external text" title="http://www.4camp.net:8081/sensortable.htm?id={DB323DAE-4CD7-44AC-82EF-3FDA9596D2D0}&amp;subid=3&amp;index=0" rel="nofollow">this</a> page, which shows the site's current bandwidth usage for Objection!.

<p><i>I linked to Objection on Wikipedia because I like Wikipedia, and I think that it's become a useful reference for information such as this. That's all," he said.</i></p>
<p>"<i>To tell you the truth, my host was absolutely livid about Objection. They thought it would be something that would pass in a day or two... when they saw the bandwidth per day, they just cut me like -that-. It was stretching it to convince them to change the message from 'This site has used too much bandwidth and is temporarily offline' (or something like that) to that single spartan HTML page. I wasn't at my home computer at the time of the cut, so I didn't have the Objection source stuff handy. I couldn't FTP the FAQ out of the website, they wouldn't let me. I had to contact the host directly to get them to upload that page instead of the standard bandwidth error. Wikipedia was the only site I could link to that had the correct information so they could find out what all these weird numbered links they were seeing on forums were.</i>"</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Explain what "small community" you are referring to. Listed on the Objection! wiki, it claims 3 rather LARGE "communities" are involved with the use and knowledge of Objection!. Various friends I know online and offline, who aren't involved or aware of those 3 communities know of Objection! and have directed my attention to it. A rather large portion of people who browse the internet on a daily basis know of this, in such a short time. Also, various people have been stating that it gets a high voltage of traffic, and the proof is in it's stats. Each "Objection!" page is rather small in filesize, for a site that hosts it's main content as a small, singlefile page, sure is using a large amount of bandwidth and gets a large amount of hits. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceSage_8a63.html" title="User:IceSage">IceSage</a> 04:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Why? Very simple. It's an amusing internet phenomenon that is developing the kind of fanbase that makes Snakes On A Plane already a smash hit before even coming out in theaters. It's the kind of driving force that has a life of its own because it was so simple, yet so clever. A device that generates comments in a court scene for fun and games? Sure, why not? People have adored more for less. It's the simple things in life that get to you. I don't think you should bother blotting out "Objection!", though I will say that it's good to see it gets a fair trial. And if anyone has any...objections...well, so be it. Personally, I like it. Let's keep it around for our simple enjoyment. 204.215.207.106 02:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)The Lord Massacre</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Simple enough. I saw 'Objection!' being repeatedly linked to on a forum, I was curious, I looked it up on Wikipedia and the article told me exactly what I wanted to know. That is, after all, why I use this site. Regardless of whatever standards of 'notability' are considered necessary for an internet meme to warrant a serious encyclopedia article (laugh), I found the article useful, so I say let it stand. S.

<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate source of information.

<li><b>Comment</b> I like Wikipedia primarily <i>because</i> of its indiscriminate nature. To me, the fact that it archives information even on minor things that only a handful of people would want to look up is what seperates it from other encyclopedias. I'm aware that any point I could make has probably been hammered into the ground already, but you'd be hard-pressed to convince me that an article containing information I found personally useful is not noteworthy enough to exist. 59.167.180.72 04:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah, but there are more people who will turn to Wikipedia for information about this popular site than for information about your friend, and the information about the Iceberg level can be placed into the main <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_3_505f.html" title="Kirby's Dream Land 3">Kirby's Dream Land 3</a> article. Granted, you could argue that this information be merged into the main <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Wright_815c.html" title="Phoenix Wright">Phoenix Wright</a> article, but I disagree with that merger on the grounds that it's not an official Phoenix Wright spinoff or advertisement.

<li>There is, in fact, a number of articles on types of blogs and even a Types of blogs article that ties them together. Comparing it with some other type-of-blog articles, it looks like this is in line with them. I do think (as did the first-contact editor) that this is a good-faith new-editor's attempt.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. My reason is in two parts. First, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>-a-links-directory is not a reason to delete an article: only if the subject is unencyclopedic does an article deserve deletion.

<ul>
<li>Changed vote to weak keep per reasoning below. A move and expansion to hobby blog might be warranted, along with a merger with some of the other types-of-blog articles. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 19:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this should really be generalized as hobby blog. There are hobby blogs for gardening, woodworking, house remodeling, car restoration ... you name it. They don't all need Wikipedia articles, I can't imagine how useful beyond dicdefs any could get. "It's a blog. About gardens/cars/cabinets/chia pets.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The article nearly qualifies as a speedy delete, since it merely restates its title. A gardening blog is a blog on gardening. People might keep gardens, and they might write about their gardens, and they might do that with a blog. There is nothing given here to indicate that this type of blog is different from any other, that this type of blog is especially common, that this type of blog is fundamentally more than <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> plus the adjective of "gardening." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>'s excellent reasoning. I'm not sure what (if any) guideline or policy this would fall under, but simple common sense dictates that this sort of article has little to no value.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. This discussion seems really pointless. The best suggestion here seems to be "Delete all of the masts, except for ones that are at least somewhat notable." Great idea, but you can't seriously expect any closing admin to read through every article on the list and make a judgement call on the notability of all of them.</p>
<p>"Delete all the stubs" isn't a very good idea in my opinion either. A stub tag doesn't make an article non-notable, and the lack of one doesn't make a subject notable. And what about the short articles that just don't happen to have a stub tag on them? Does the fact that an article isn't tagged properly mean it's somehow better than one that has a stub tag?</p>
<p>Please take the time to figure out the articles that actually warrant deletion based on their own merit (you don't need to read through them all at once, nominate a bunch if you see fit). However, I don't see much point to that since the articles would be better as redirects than nothing anyway, so that they wouldn't be instantly recreated with little content. Anyone who thinks a mast isn't notable can still merge the article to list of masts and change it to a redirect. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 10:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>This a special deletion request:</b> The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">list of masts</a> page has had one stub article created for every mast it lists. Instead of trying to delete each stub individually, I thought it would be more efficient to simply point to the page where they are all present. This deletion request is for these <b>mast stub articles <i>only</i></b> and not the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">list of masts</a> article. I hope this sitution warrants my bending the AfD process in this manner.</p>
<p>The reason for deletion of the mast stub articles is that all of the data in the stub articles is already present in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">list of masts</a> article, and very few, if any, are notable enough to be expanded or warrant a complete article.

<li><b>Delete</b> all of the masts, except for ones that are at least somewhat notable. They may be notable for extreme height, extreme height for the time it was built, extreme height for its type (guyed or freestanding), age, being an unusual type of mast, unusual usage or for being significant in some other way. I don't think that being the tallest or almost the tallest mast at the state level or lower should count, though. I'm not even sure if the country level should count, since there are so many countries. It would be even worse if we had articles on the top masts by country and by type, like the tallest freestanding and guyed masts in each country. The continent level would probably be fine, and it might help the problem described in the next sentence. In regards to keeping the masts over 600 meters tall, I have noticed that all 58 of them are in the United States and so are the 500 to 600 meter tall masts. There are only 5 non-U.S. masts in the 400 to 500 list. The 300 to 400 list is dominated by the U.S. at the top, but non-U.S. masts show up with increasing frequency at the bottom. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Create a huge table</b>. - Make a huge table of all the mast with the following columns: name of mast, country, place, geographical coordinates (not for all available), use (VLF, long wave, medium wave, FM, TV or other) and remarks.

<li><b>NO!!!</b> The problem is that virtually EVERY article here is officially a "stub". Even the <a href="../../../k/a/t/KATV_Tower_c452.html" title="KATV Tower">KATV Tower</a> article, which is probably among the ones NOT to be deleted (it's over 600 meters and is among the most-edited in the big list), is still labeled as a stub. I think the best solution to the problem is to mutually link the tower articles with those of the radio and TV stations that use them, which I did (before I registered) with the various stations of the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Educational_Television_Network_a549.html" title="Arkansas Educational Television Network">Arkansas Educational Television Network</a> and their towers (one of which is the KATV Tower). I also call your attention to the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Education_Television_Tower_Fox_2acc.html" title="Arkansas Education Television Tower Fox">Arkansas Education Television Tower Fox</a> article, which has a considerable amount of text even though the small Arkansas town it's named after doesn't even have an article! --RBBrittain 01:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Why delete?</b> - are there no people of the USA, which can give further information of the masts in the USA?</li>
</ul>
<p>And the stubs of masts from Europe, Afrique and other parts of the world, which make only a small part of them, should not be deleted at all, because there it is not always good to get information of them! Other idea: merge this table with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towers.html" title="List of towers">List of towers</a> and add at this table a column with "construction type". This would be therefore sensitive, since there are borderline constructions as <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerbrandy_Tower_fcc7.html" title="Gerbrandy Tower">Gerbrandy Tower</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towers.html" title="List of towers">List of towers</a>!</b> - this would give a very long list, but it would be a very interesting and very flexible online database of nearly all towertype constructions of the world!</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no space for databases in Wikipedia, then put the list, which is formed from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towers.html" title="List of towers">List of towers</a> in <b>Wikisource</b>!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I say keep them all. Many will probably only be recreated at some point in the future, so why go to all the (rediculous amount of) effort to delete something because it appears to have nothing worth notable about it other than it's size (to people like us who are unfamiliar with the subject), when people out there will know more and could make decnet articles. Hvaing the articles already in existence will encourage more people to add to them, rather than if we were now to delete them first. Also, the articles appear to include details such as coordinates, which isn't in the main list and would again be a very time cosuming and pointless job to merge into the list. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 14:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not saying that this FAQ is a great source. It is, however, very popular FAQ and updated often. And ANUS, well, they are highly popular when it comes to all things black metal, and very well-known outside this subgenre. It should also be noted that an article in a certain genre should use sources that specialize in that genre. By that I mean that when it comes to black metal, Metal-Archives is more reliable than, say, All Music Guide, who often list all extreme metal bands as "death metal". <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 09:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> but would like to edit... I am the <b>AUTHOR</b> of this article, and I would prefer to disclose that I also have a vested interest in this topic. I do think I see what was missing from this article that made it appear as branding, or advertising/vanity. What's odd is that my goal was to subdue any information that wasn't directly germane to the topic (i.e. too much company info)....</li>
</ul>
<p>A tour label - even though it is this company that frame-worked the business model and first applied it - is a business model/structure unique to anything else in the industry, and one that is proving itself as a viable contender as the structural mechanism that supports this kind of art in this culture. That being said, I do believe that there is a growing reference base for this topic that can be the basis for proper cites on this article.</p>
<p>I believe that if I edited in the missing data that shows the precise dynamics of this structure, most would agree this entry is not simple brandizing or an issue of vanity or advertising. As a matter of fact, I opted to leave the company website out just to avoid such an appearance. I would even be happy to see any information related to the company edited out until such time someone other than myself edits it back in with references.</p>
<p>I also see how the article, as is, would appear on the surface as protologism (love the irony behind that word, btw). However, I am confident the word is now being used by outside sources to describe this business model. On the surface, it is such a random hybrid of structural elements, that there is literally no other way of conveying this concept without using this term - unless you want to spend thirty minutes describing the internal/external dynamics involved. You can say, "like this" or "like that" all day long, but what people seem to be calling this is "tour label," despite the fact that the original term coined by the founder of the company was "touring label." AGAIN, I would love to have the chance to work on my cites and edit in content that meets wikipedia standards for its entries.</p>
<p>In a research forum such as this, it’s a fine line we walk… between sharing information related to things we know and are a part of, and using such discussion as a platform for self aggrandizement. I was hoping to stay on the right side of that line. Please accept my apologies for any appearance that I had not, or was not intending to. I’m currently kicking myself for not using better cites on this all around... that would have likely avoided the extra process.</p>
<p>I admit that I may have had a shaky understanding at first of the cite requirements before the nominee brought this to my attention, but I would like to work more on this article as I believe that when it meets specs it will be quite valuable as part of this online reference – definitely not just some vanity piece.69.235.39.40 08:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was pretty clear that the author was self-interested, with a username incorporating the company identity. What we are looking for is evidence of, as you say, outside sources who are also using the business model, called by this term or any other, as documented in reliable third-party sources such as trade industry magazines or even better general-interest publications including newspapers. Otherwise we have no proof that what you're saying about your own company's business model has any application to anybody else. Citations have another purpose in that they demonstrate the notability of a topic, by having been written about.</dd>
<dd>That said, we do thank you for your constructive attitude toward this situation. It isn't our intent to discourage anyone from editing Wikipedia, only to maintain the overall quality of the project and enforce legal guidelines. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:31, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete?</b> Yea, fine, delete it. I didn't realise wikipedia was so damn stingy about this stuff. I thought it was just a place to share information. The film has been submitted to festivals and we're awaiting results, but, I guess it doesn't live up to this "code of conduct" stuff yet. So, delete it. I personally don't see how it hurts anybody just sitting there, but hey, guess I didn't read the fine print. Thanks for keeping it up for the two weeks. IAmJack600 10:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you think the hairs on your head have influenced enough lives that anyone would ever bother looking up the topic on Wikipedia, go ahead and try. Personally, I think schools typically have had students in the past and/or present, and it isn't too farfetched to think that any of those people might look up a school. Your example with a wikiproject on the hairs on your head is simply a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, and as such, doesn't stand to compare well against any well-established project. --<a href="../../../s/_/c/User%7ES_charette_cc35.html" title="User:S charette">Stephane Charette</a> 21:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: What I said in reference to the nomination today by <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewspaper98_e465.html" title="User:Newspaper98">Newspaper98</a> applies to the articles nominated by <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix_Hacker_d488.html" title="User:Phoenix Hacker">Phoenix Hacker</a> as well. For less controversial topics, I have no problem with "non notable" as shorthand for why an article is being nominated for deletion. However, given the sharp divide on whether or not school articles are inherently encyclopedic and by what standards we determine whether a school article is encyclopedic, I would hope to see a much more substantive reason for the nomination of a school than simply "non notable". Given the lack of a firm policy on schools, it would be helpful to know why the nominator thinks the school is non-notable. I do believe that the nominations by Phoenix Hacker were made in <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">good faith</a>; however, all these nominations without a more detailed explanation of why they are being nominated verges on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. This editor is helping no one by the large number of nominations (s)/he has posted for AfDs on schools with the only reason being "nn" and the large number of {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}s (s)/he has placed on other school articles. I don't care if someone thinks keep or delete. It just seems that it would serve everyone better if the nomination set forth some reasoning for what should be expected to attract a lot of strong opinions. A more substantive reason for nomination would be particularly helpful for those editors who judge each school article on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article constitutes a directory entry. (It has grown a little during the discussion, but not enough to make it useful content. When nominated, the content was "Bridge Elementary School is a school in Richmond, British Columbia." plus the template for Richmond, British Columbia. All that has been added is directory information.) Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy, directory entries are explicitly forbidden; see subsection "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", item 7 "Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guide or a resource for conducting business.". Additionally, one of the expectations that Wikipedia has of every wikipedia project is that the project help build an encyclopedia, which means helping decide where to draw the boundary line between topics to cover and topics to exclude. Despite the assertion above that the article passes the <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> test, I see no test at that project; the word test doesn't appear on the page and I see nothing else on the page or its current talk page that amounts to a test of material worthy of inclusion. As to why Phoenix Hacker made so many of these nominations, a single user was mass creating these entries with nothing more than a single line of text. Mass creation of useless articles leads to multiple deletion discussions. As explained in the intro to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, it is the opinion of "<i>some [and by evidence at AFD, a large number of] editors that this is what is meant by</i> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information <i>(which is a formal policy).

<li><b>Keep</b> There appears to be an underlying agrument that there are so many schools that only notable ones should be included. Notability (or lack there of) is not a reason for, by itself, for deletion - <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is not a policy nor is anyone elses acroynm that may be applied to test an article. The vastness of a subject is also not a reason to exclude articles, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> makes the contrary arguement: "<i>This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page.</i>" The only valid argument is the shortness of the current articles, which I agree with. There is an active project to create and edit these pages and I believe that we should be able to ask the indulgence of our fellow wikepedians until we can get all the information into these articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even if <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not official policy, it justifies itself on its page via existing policy.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are many considerations but it was sounding to me like notability (or not) was being used as the measuring stick to keep or delete. My assertion was that notablility is not a criteria in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and it continues to be used as if it were a offical 'rule'. If that is true, regardless of the effort we put into making it a better article it could still be the subject of a AfD request. That certainly puts a chill on anyone that might consider contributing. Wakemp 20:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It's being used as a measuring stick because it is a valid enough concern in evaluating the potential for an encyclopedic article to be written about the subject for it to have made it into official community guidelines. People are not citing notability as a concern just because they don't think that the subject is popular enough to have an article (indeed, popularity has nothing to do with notability), they are doing so because these subjects individually (this one, as well) do not have enough importance to be the primary focus of a single independant verifiable case study, report, or what have you. They are all taken in broad sweeps and wide-ranging reports that include thousands of schools that have no claim at all to any importance outside of the community that they are in. This is the reason people are expressing these complex ideas by explaining (in far fewer words) these sorts of concerns with the possibility of an encyclopedic article about the school in question. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As an example of why the above reasoning does not necessarily give you a subject about which it is appropriate to write, take for example if you had an information database of a major veterinary health-care provider that had gobs and gobs of information about individual pets, including detailed health histories, biological information, ownership, etc. While this information can give you the workings of a Wikipedia article that meets many of the technical standards required by policy (Not original research, verifiability, reliable sourcing, citations, etc.), that does not mean that an article for each individual pet would make for appropriately encyclopedic topics. By this logic that is not be appropriate, and it is fairly plain to see that it would be a glaring error on the grounds (I would say of notability, but) that Wikipedia is not for arbitrary collection of information. The standard is something that has come out through consensus, and the fact that the WP:N essay itself is not policy is only evidence that people think notability standards should be addressed in proprietary categories, as I mentioned earlier. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 13:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either not provide links to other then high schools or delete it. By building a template that is linked to over 1,000 times, it serves to fuel AfD discussions on schools. Why create a template, {{<a href="../../../r/i/c/Template%7ERichmondBCSchools_47c7.html" title="Template:RichmondBCSchools">RichmondBCSchools</a>}}, that allows editors to blindly walk into this ongoing consensus issue battle? Why do these schools need to be listed in 1,000 articles?

<li><b>Comment</b>: As I have said above, I would have no problem including the article if it could be shown that the school has been the subject of multiple reliable sources of independant coverage. So far it has not been shown to have been the subject of more than an entry in a census. Failing that, however, I think that the multiple substub entries on each individual elementary school would be better placed in the school district instead of spread out to an unacceptably sparse level over dozens of almost-contentless articles. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 15:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article will benefit from improvement, and is clearly identified as a stub.

<dd>I was referred to <b><a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">this page</a></b> by Danny as a likely reason for this page being deleted:</dd>
<dd><i>"If the rules are unhelpful, ignore them and do your best to improve or maintain Wikipedia's quality."</i>
<dl>
<dd>So if i understand, if the wikipedia rules don't allow you to delete an article about a game you have never played, then just break wikipedia written rules and destroy it for improving Wikipedia's quality. This remind me something... Perhaps a country declaring war to another for improving the world even if it's against all rules made by ONU. Graal unixmad 17:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to ignore that last statement as nothing more than a distracting red herring. While I do believe there are enough reviews of graal floating around on the web to base an article off of, your edits are obviously acting in bad faith. You claim that negative comments are deleted by your corporation because of being unreferenced (which is correct in general, although bad form in a long standing dispute without discussion) - HOWEVER, take this statement currently on the page. "Perhaps Graal's greatest strength is its customizability. An intuitive editor allows even the most technically-inept players to build levels of their own, complete with custom graphics and interactive NPCs. The latter are developed using a simple - yet surprisingly powerful - language named GScript, the syntax of which was loosely inspired by Java and which lately has adapted some semantics of the scripting language of the Torque Game Engine. The target audience of the game has not yet used these features to their fullest extent. [citation needed]". That entire paragraph, consisting of weasel words such as "greatest strength", "intuitive editor", and "simple-yet surprisingly powerful", was made without a single reference, independent or otherwise, to back it up. You're acting like an interest group lobbying for your article, obeying the rules only when it suits your position. That is blatantly abusing Wikipedia policy. JoshWook 18:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The GraalOnline team have not written the wikipedia Graalonline article (and the part you are talking about), the article has been written by someone called Loriel, this graalonline player is the creator of '<a href="http://wiki.graal.us/'" class="external free" title="http://wiki.graal.us/'" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.graal.us/'</a> that has no relationship with us. You should compare '<a href="http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'" class="external free" title="http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'</a> and you will see the actual article has not been written by GraalOnline Staff. Also have a look at other game article like <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> and tell me if you don't see weasel words, the article is full of make "RuneScape one of the top online games", "Unlike many similar game", "RuneScape places a lot of emphasis on ... allowing players ", ... Graal unixmad 18:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Runescape page is heavily referenced, notice the footnote after "Runescape is one of the top online games." Also, I did not accuse GraalOnline of writing the paragraph in question - I only question why you are so intent on removing unreferenced negative information while ignoring the same standards on unreferenced positive information. JoshWook 18:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you watch what we have deleted? It's nothing about removing negative information about the game but defamatory and false content against Me, the GraalOnline Staff and the Game. Perhaps you have not followed the story but the section has been written a few weeks ago by 2 players because they have been banned from GraalOnline for not respecting rules ( <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">User:Warcaptain</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/4/User%7EDi4gram_0c4f.html" title="User:Di4gram">User:Di4gram</a>. Have a look who have modified the article and made this war... Graal unixmad 19:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're ignoring the crux of my argument - if the reason for deleting what you refer to as "defamatory and false content" was that it fell under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, then why have you allowed the other unreferenced information to stand? User:JoshWook 19:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We were not the creator of this article (article created long time ago) so we prefered to discuss on the talk page (What have done Stefan Knorr and Me). We have deleted the defamatory and false content because it was new content and it was also not discussed with anyone before being added. Also we are not experienced Wikipedia User and we have learned the hard way. Graal unixmad 19:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To throw in my other 2 cents: Almost whenever I heard of Graal, I also heard about Unixmad's and the forum administration's unfairness towards the players. So if you like it or not, this issue also concerns users of your game. But then, as your actions were only announced in your private forum that is not immune to later modificiation or private conversations that are not at all quotable, there is probably no way to state this in a "verificable" way. Forum posts of banned persons were altered, and players critising the action of Graal's administration were silenced by threatening them with bans. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipp_Kern_0be1.html" title="User:Philipp Kern">Philipp Kern</a> 20:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the User:Loriel who unixmad attributed the aforequoted weasel-words to. However, they originated in <a href="http://wiki.graal.us/index.php?title=Graal&amp;diff=18&amp;oldid=17" class="external text" title="http://wiki.graal.us/index.php?title=Graal&amp;diff=18&amp;oldid=17" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> of the Graal article on our <a href="http://wiki.graal.us" class="external text" title="http://wiki.graal.us" rel="nofollow">Graal wiki</a>. While I hosted the wiki at that time, it was not entirely written by me and this edit was not my doing. Also, while I am not currently associated with Graal and was not when that edit was made, I used to be a game master/administrator and involved in or managing some of Graal's projects. While I suppose that the wording used was not entirely NPOV considering my past enjoyment of the customisability of Graal, it still does not appear particularly glamourising or advertising to me. Having a "greatest strength" does not imply any notable strongness compared to other things, and "surprisingly powerful" only served to relativate "simple" which I believe is entirely justified considering most of the game's content, outside of the actual engine, is written in this language.</dd>
<dd>However I would like to point out that I also made plenty of "negative" comments regarding Graal, the volunteer administration and so on, which were partially lost by vandalism (that went unnoticed by me until the recent edit-war when I did not dare to interfere anymore) and by the administrative intervention after the mediation. While pf course it was entirely unsourced (apart from a link to our wiki) as I was blissfully oblivious of Wikipedia policies at the time, but hey, nobody complained, and it appeared way more balanced and less "dramatic" than the current version.</dd>

<dd>"Anti-GraalOnline" is a very funny phrase to use, whether or not it preceeds the word "management". You seem to be dangerously close to following that game's management in that you are defining critics as "anti". I'll still let good faith guide me away from saying that you are speaking under their direction, but please don't suggest otherwise by using rather black-and-white terminology.
<dl>
<dd>Huh? I certainly wouldn't classify too many in there as pro-GraalOnline, would you? You prefer another phrase, throw it out there. Pro-GraalOnline-criticism seems a little unwieldy to me but that's fine too.

<dd>I entirely agree with di4gram in the "anti-Graal" thing. If you are so eager to condemn contributors as anti-GraalOnline, I just have to consider you biased or heavily influenced by the GraalOnline management. Loriel 17:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, just trying to keep count of people who wanted the criticism section vs. those that didn't. It felt like the ratio was weighed heavily in favor of the former and, if you consider that two of the users in the latter group were blocked indefinitely, the ratio approaches infinity I think. Maybe I'm wrong and it was just the same pro-criticism-section (is that better?) users posting over and over but it seemed like it was becoming quite a hive mentality. Whichever, take a look at how many of my 12,000+ edits here have been related to online gaming at all and reconsider how affiliated I am with the GraalOnline management. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've gone through and read a lot of the information on wikipedia about this particular dispute, and while I'm sympathetic to the "I give up" position, I think we all need to step back and breathe for a second. I've never played Graal before but I've heard about it before this mess - surely it's been notable enough to get a mention independently <i>somewhere</i> before. As far as the criticism, "positive", and "negative" information is concerned, I could care less as long as there are reliable sources listed. If not, tag and eventually delete, as per the mediation dispute. The corporate website is fine for information on game mechanics, publication date and history (as long as the information cited avoids advertisement and blatant self-praise), etc. - that stuff is NPOV and their website is nothing more than a convenient source. If it is later vandalized, temp. protect the page. Don't let wikipedia be bullied by a couple of minor online communities. In short, I'm sure this can all be worked out before the publication deadline. 129.61.46.16 16:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't known if this is common on wikipedia that someone introducing a request for deletion try to influence the vote saying that everyone agree to delete the article. But the team managing the game and the creators of the game (Me and Stefan Knorr) are completly against having the article deleted. Could be also interesting to ask the &gt; 300000 players that have downloaded the game and open an account if the game is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or not.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The preceeding comment by unixmad was originally placed in the header of the AFD with the nomination. I'm going to assume good faith in that they meant to add it to the bottom of the page as a new comment and were not trying to interfere with the nomination itself, so I moved it down appropriately as a new comment. I think they're right about the reviews though - they do at least attest to the notability of the game. Would it be possible to use those as a basis for a rewrite? 129.61.46.16 19:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh
<ul>
<li>Those reviews appear pretty onesided, so you might as well replace the article with an advertisement copy&amp;pasted from the game's website. Though I am laughing pretty hard at "modified version of C, know as Graal Script.". Loriel 21:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did not mean to suggest that the reviews are balanced in coverage, only that they qualify as sources independent of graal online and therefore testify to the notability of the game. I guess the main issue I have with this AFD is that it was nominated for deletion because it was not notable enough, when the real problem is the content dispute. Unfortunately, content disputes generally do not fall under any deletion guideline that I'm aware of. Of course, they also usually don't result in Wikimedia's lawyers stepping in...so this may be a highly unusual case all around. 68.106.198.28 00:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh

<li><b>Comment</b> While I hate to pass the buck here, you have to understand that even if the entirety of the internet and print world has been purged of negative information on a subject, it is simply not Wikipedia's job to publish that negative information first. That's original research, and goes against one of wikipedia's foundation policies. You may have the right to get the word out about Graal, but basically, you don't have the right to do it here until it's done in a reliable, peer-reviewed source elsewhere. 68.106.198.28 11:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh

<li><b>Comment</b> No, Wikipedia does not condone advertisements - many articles about non-notable games or websites, usually written by the owners of the product, are deleted on a regular basis. The websites listed above, however, confirm in my mind that Graal is not something invented last week. It has a fairly long history for an online game, and is notable enough for an article. Most of those reviews do not appear to be affiliated with the site, and even if they don't mention the personality conflicts that seem to be the issue here, their impressions of the game aren't overwhelmingly positive either. I guess the thing is, that while a game or website may be notable enough for a wikipedia article, not all of its components (in this case, its forums and spin-off forums, I guess) are necessarily worthy of the same treatment.

<li><b>Comment</b> Honestly this is getting old. This wikipedia war is not going to end. I can see perfectly why it's nominated for deletion as it is one-sided and more advertisement friendly. Everything put in it is simply on Graal Online's side and as much as I love the game, this wiki is not part of Graal Online and is control by the community. I don't see why both sides can't come to a conclusion and by allowing the article to go back up just means the war will start again. Deletion seems to be the easiest method, this whole situation has gotten so complicated and has become such a big issue that it disserves itself to be on the wiki as it's an issue. It just seems like a bunch of accounts are being made to say "Keep" now as if it truly matters... just let it go and forget it for a while and if it is deleted just wait a while to make a new one. Even when you make a new one, people are going to alter it because that's how wiki works. Once someone alters it then more arguments will happen on Graal Onlines side. It's more likely in the future that there will be citable information for critism for the game... even those reviews of the game are not very good but in no way reveal any critizism. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Mitchell_4970.html" title="User:Brandon Mitchell">Brandon Mitchell</a> 5:23, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are right, which is why I did not attempt to directly post it on the article, but rather put it in for consideration here. The standards for verified information in relation to the nature of this article makes the whole situation difficult to be fair either way. All of the information is going to come from some person or another from the internet, you are not going to get verified pictures of over 300,000 people, or even 30 people to stand and pose in a picture with todays newspaper and a sign saying "I PLAYED GRAALONLINE, or that GRAAL IS COMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING AND IN C++" and even if they did exist I do not think they would organize in such a fashion, make the cardboard signs and do such a thing. This whole situation is not an easy one, no matter who you are, if you are to make the GraalOnline wikipedia article more relevant, factual, and verified, it is simply not the nature of non-mainstream lesser popular online games. <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipercat_c28e.html" title="User:Vipercat">Vipercat</a> 13:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a longtime player of GraalOnline I'd hate to see the article go, but that being said after seeing the CyberJoueurs staff conduct on the page I can't put myself to give this a Keep vote. But since when did we start deleting things because non-wikipedians asssociated with that article vandalised repeatedly in an attempt to ruin the NPOV...isn't it usually just protected? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadian-Bacon_27f4.html" title="User:Canadian-Bacon">Canadian-Bacon</a> 16:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm willing to help rewrite this article NPOV. I am sorry that things have descended to this, people have gotten sucked in from both sides and reputations have been ruined/put on the line on both sides. I think that this article should stay, and that both sides can work together to make a decently informative and NPOV article. I'm pretty much eliminating my previous comments; they were based on false pretenses. This thing has spiralled out of control, and I think that civility has pretty much been shot in the face by people on both sides (including me). I think that deleting this article would be for the wrong reasons. <a href="../../../d/i/4/User%7EDi4gram_0c4f.html" title="User:Di4gram">Di4gram</a> 16:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a lost process, some people having lot of time to loose and some wikimedia staff have decided that the article must be deleted, so i will not loose any more time fighting a system that is corrupted. Thanks to all of you that have spent lot of time trying to get this article published and to wknight94 that have been neutral and given lot of good argument since day 1 of this story.

<li>Just because you cannot control everything on the internet does not make it a "Bananas Republic" Wikipedia staff was far more reasonable, and gave you far more chances than I would have given you if I had control over this situation, you signed a mediation then broke the mediation agreement by threatening people over the phone with lies.

<li>Unix, for a second I was sort of miffed, because I thought someone high up in wikimedia had contacted you and decided to over-rule the discussion taking place here. The fact is that a number of people who frankly find your behavior deplorable in these debates have voted "keep", including myself. The most likely result right now, especially since you posted a number of reviews, is a "no consensus" result, which will result in the article staying. The nomination to delete was not brought up by wikimedia, so stop with these conspiracy theories. There's no reason to cry foul - it's childish and distracts from the points of the debate itself. On another note, I do not believe wikipedia should cover your dispute with your members until a reliable source can be found to document it - but on a personal level, I very much hope that a well known gaming website does a story on how you treat your customers.

<li>I did not make either of those articles, Unixmad himself published that in his own forums, and the other on PetitionOnline was made by someone who I thought was the most pro-graal person in the world, the former GraalOnline admin MagicalTux who was once very close and big time in the GraalOnline staff until he was clearly betrayed and threatened at some point by Unixmad. So I am trying to get revenge by using magical mind control fairies to make them both write things that makes unixmad look bad?

<li>Hold up - you're missing the point. From everything I've read, I'm fully on your side on a personal level...however, I honestly don't think Wikipedia is the right media to vent your complaints. Wikipedia is, above all, an encyclopedia. I would not expect the Encyclopedia Brittanica to cover a non-notable dispute, using only forums and personal emails as evidence - Wikipedia is not constrained by the limits of paper, but it still strives for the same quality standards. An encyclopedia is, in general, a compendium of the research of others - and by research, I mean of the intensive, peer-reviewed kind. That happens in a newspaper and even more in sources like scientific journals, and there are simply no controls or authority behind an individual, or even a group of individuals, posting semi-anonomyously to an online forum. It amounts to original research, and is not appropriate subject matter for an encyclopedia.

<li>This is where the problem lies. Nobody has written a documentary or scholarly artice, or published book in print that has been extensively peer reviewed on this matter. You are also correct this is an encyclopedia, but if it is not a relevant subject such as Elephants then how can it fit into an encyclopedia in the first place? How can any game? <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipercat_c28e.html" title="User:Vipercat">Vipercat</a> 13:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Easy - there are lots of print magazines dedicated to games, and even more online. The business as a whole is undeniably massive, on the same order of magnitude as film, and receives a good deal of media coverage. It doesn't have to necessarily be scholarly, it only has to meet wikipedia's internal standards for verifiability and reliability. And verifiable is not the same as truth - just because something is true doesn't mean it warrants coverage on wikipedia. Actually, see the big discussion I had up above in this AFD that now looks like I had it with myself under 129.61.46.16 and 68.106.198.28 because the other guy deleted his comments when he changed his opinion&#160;;) JoshWook 13:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So basically I just need to talk some random gaming website with arbitrary standards of verificating content into publishing my rantings, and suddenly my opinion becomes more important than that of a dozen people arguing the same topic on several forums and wiki discussions?

<ul>
<li>Well...don't take this the wrong way, but that's just how Wikipedia works. Wikipedia is not a forum - it's an encyclopedia. Go to your local decent-sized library and check out the reference section. Ignore the Brittanica and find a more obscure, specialized encyclopedia, such as an encyclopedia on Occult phenomena (yes, they do exist). And then look at how the articles are written and, more importantly, the references. You'll find that the encyclopedia, no matter how obscure, has not gone out and conducted its own study and interviewed people about their experiences with alien abductions - it relies on the published "research" of others. There might be other wikis out there with different standards, but as an encyclopedia, wikipedia is not the place to *conduct* research, it's a place to *report* on it.

<dd>Looks like it flew over the both of you completely. What Daniel Bryant is attempting to make, as far as I can tell, is a sandbox for a criticism section with notable citation. I don't find it "sad work", rather, I find it as an attempt to give the Criticism section a chance, which was unfairly removed before the 7 days after mediation, due to Unixmad's bickering over the phone, which in turn blew off Daniel's faith in the Wikipedia system. That's just an analysis on my part.

<dl>
<dd>I the Author, should like to say that Wikipedia is not as though it seems, while it seems that Wikipedia is a collaboration of the greatest mind, designed to distribute knowledge to the world, this presumption is sadly, false. Wikipedia is a collaboration of the Tightest Wads in the history of the world. this article is proposed for deletion because it is "NonNotable, and Unverified". I would like to address these seperatly.</dd>
<dd>NonNotable:</dd>
<dd>This is an opinion, what is considered notable for some is not notable for others. take for instance my opinion involving the article on "Pratt County, Kansas" while I particularly do not find it interesting or even mildly neccesary, I would never propose it for deletion just because I can't think of anybody who would want to read it. because I realize that I might be wrong. of the 6 billion people in the world, even if only one person was prevented from reading it, I would never delete it, simply because I could not rest knowing I but a price on human knowledge.</dd>
<dd>UnVerified:</dd>
<dd>This is the same thing they told Columbus when he claimed the world was round. how may I rally people to my cause, how may I find witnesses to "verify" my findings if the article is deleted, moreoever hypothesize that it is wrongly accused of being unverified, the article is then deleted. thus information on this topic is even less verified. it leads to a vicous cycle in which the only important knowledge is, in the end, that which an elite group of WikiJunkies (such as the man who proposed this article for deletion) says is in important. I will never stand for that kind of Aristocracy.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia is not verification. Wikipedia <i>requires</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> from other sources. It's one of the few official WP policies. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 22:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment on Comment</b> Wikipedia is not verification to wikipedia. it is however considered a reputable source by third parties, thus a third party would have a harder time finding the info if it can't be found on wikipedia. information on the topic refers to global information, not just wikipedia.--Misery507 01:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> Verification can be simply faked, since other reputable sources include the article subject itself. such as the source for the article on penny arcade, the information is pulled from penny-arcade.com If I really wanted this to fly, nothing is stopping me from making www.goldsquirrel.com and citing it as a source. --Misery507 01:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In Conclusion, I would like to say, that should WikiPedia decide to delete this article. it would be a direct violation in open information sharing policy, and not at all like the world of limitless knowledge I hoped we lived in.--Misery507 21:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. The source of the squirrel is in fact classified in the sense that it is limited to "Certian classes of people" mostly senior members of the cross and track team. your mistake again is a matter of opinion. the Federal government isn't the only group of people that can "classify" information.</dd>

<p>The story of the golden squirrel has happened to reach the teachers at Columbus East and the freshman english teachers have created an assignment for the freshmen to try to learn more about their school by doing a research project. One of the topics to be researched is the Golden Squirrel. If the teachers of Columbus East High School find the topic credible and verifiable i believe it has what it takes to make it on wikipedia.--User:veritas32914:07, 01 august 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>CELEBRITIES WORLDWIDE DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide is in fact an industry recognised standard, held in as much regard as a reference point as organisations such as the Press Association and the Internet Movie database. Their clients include major news organisations such as the BBC and ITN. Their website is www.celebritiesworldwide.com - I am talking from experience, as i once worked/am working in the entertainment industry. Please let me know if you still feel they are not genuine - I feel they are an invaluable source to professional industry people, not third rate hacks, who they most certainly wouldn't do business with</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<li>The article is written in such a way as to present itself as nothing more than an advertisement for the contact service. See <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> for more information. If you can rewrite the article so that it does not come across as a promotional piece, and provide some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> that establish <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">importance</a>, I'll be happy to reconsider my position.

However, if the tag is removed with the article in its current state, it will likely be brought to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for Deletion</a> discussion, where other editors will likely hold the same position as I do. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">Speak</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">Spoken</a></small> 14:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Thank you for your concise, swift reply – much appreciated. First of all, let me say I fully appreciate your concerns, however, I believe you have misunderstood what Celebrities Worldwide and its sister company UPFRONT TV actually does. I've just discovered how useful these services are and it would be a real shame to deny Wikipedia visitors the chance to hear about them.</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide offers official contact information for celebrities. It's an amazing resource for anyone in the media or entertainment industry to make contact within seconds with the most direct point of contact for over 20,000 celebrities worldwide.</p>
<p>It's sister company UPFRONT TV is the celebrity booking service and the vast range of celebrities booked by UPFRONT is, I notice, detailed on www.celebritiesworldwide.com.</p>
<p>Both companies have had a key role in creating some of the most high profile events which have been extensively covered by the media and consequently have had a significant impact on popular culture, trend and style over many years. This has been and continues to be a major source of entertainment and fascination to the general public as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, I notice you have listings for “Nike”, “MacDonald’s” and “Wal-Mart” on Wikipedia whose content does not seem to differ greatly from the information I have provided on the above 2 services.</p>
<p>I trust you will reconsider.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<li>As I detailed in my previous response, the primary issue that I have with the article is its promotional tone. The point I was making regarding the use of the names of Tom Cruise and David Beckham is that I believe that the names were used in order to associate their names with the company, when in fact there is no evidence provided that either of them are actually associated with the company. The article should be written in with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> in order to avoid sounding like an advertisement. The comparison of this article to articles about <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> doesn't really help much. The articles are definitely not written in a promotional fashion. In fact, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike.html" title="Nike">Nike</a> articles contain quite a bit of information which is negative. These are giant companies that are clearly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. It would be very difficult to argue that the articles on these companies should be deleted due to the fact that articles such as Celebrities Worldwide have been proposed for deletion. Once again, you are perfectly welcome to remove the {{PROD}} tag if you feel that I am wrong on this issue (I am just another editor like yourself, not an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">admin</a>), but I don't believe that the article would survive in its current state if it were to go to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a>.

<li><b>UPFRONT DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide is in fact an industry recognised standard, held in as much regard as a reference point as organisations such as the Press Association and the Internet Movie database. Their clients include major news organisations such as the BBC and ITN. Their website is www.celebritiesworldwide.com - I am talking from experience, as i once worked/am working in the entertainment industry. Please let me know if you still feel they are not genuine - I feel they are an invaluable source to professional industry people, not third rate hacks, who they most certainly wouldn't do business with</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<li><b>DELETION PROTEST</b>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Thank you for your concise, swift reply – much appreciated. First of all, let me say I fully appreciate your concerns, however, I believe you have misunderstood what Celebrities Worldwide and its sister company UPFRONT TV actually does. I've just discovered how useful these services are and it would be a real shame to deny Wikipedia visitors the chance to hear about them.</p>
<p>Celebrities Worldwide offers official contact information for celebrities. It's an amazing resource for anyone in the media or entertainment industry to make contact within seconds with the most direct point of contact for over 20,000 celebrities worldwide.</p>
<p>It's sister company UPFRONT TV is the celebrity booking service and the vast range of celebrities booked by UPFRONT is, I notice, detailed on www.celebritiesworldwide.com.</p>
<p>Both companies have had a key role in creating some of the most high profile events which have been extensively covered by the media and consequently have had a significant impact on popular culture, trend and style over many years. This has been and continues to be a major source of entertainment and fascination to the general public as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, I notice you have listings for “Nike”, “MacDonald’s” and “Wal-Mart” on Wikipedia whose content does not seem to differ greatly from the information I have provided on the above 2 services.</p>
<p>I trust you will reconsider.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Characters who only appeared <i>only once</i> in a TV series (in other words, 99 percent of all characters on all TV shows) are inherently non-notable.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Its hard to say. <i>The Simpsons</i> is a long-running, highly notable series, which is <i>why</i> it has so many one-time minor characters.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Simpsons is a long running series and by that very nature will generate a large number of one-time characters. This article is a useful way to keep this information together.

<p>This article is currently undergoing a POV dispute and I don't see any prospect of the issue ever being one which doesn't contain POV. The subject matter is not one for which there is likely to be much historical evidence, so, although there have been efforts to improve the article, I think the nature of the subject means a list of <i>proven beyond all reasonable doubt</i> virgins will be virtually impossible to create. As I see it, the article will always have POV entries<a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:black; background-color:lightblue; font-weight:bold">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>your words</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lurker_543e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lurker"><font color="red"><i>my deeds</i></font></a></sub> 14:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The criteria for the list, for "historical and legendary" virgins, is quite valid, and can be verified, especially for deities and those who have claimed to be virgins til their deathbed.

<li><b>Keep</b> but define and enforce limits. I basically agree with Uncle G's comment just above Hateless's vote, but don't see why these would have to be separate lists rather than separate sections within one list. It might benefit from a move to something like "List of people notable for remaining virgins", but either way it needs a very clearly worded explanation at the top of what is and is not to be included, and editors willing to strictly enforce it. The talk page can be used to discuss any controversial ones before they're re-added. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 19:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In general, I agree that categories are better than lists. The specific categories might work (and for controversial ones like Jesus and Mary, there could be a special category for religious figures). My one concern here, however, would be the over-arching Category:Virgin. It would be harder to keep a close eye on, however. It would be easy for people to not see the standards of inclusion and start listing, for example, the articles for every child actor or otherwise famous child they can think of. With a list, people can't just add a person to it without going to the list itself and seeing any criteria for inclusion listed at the top. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but anyone adding a category has to do it where people <b>who have the most knowledge about that person</b> are likely to be concentrated: their article! You're right, though, that Category:Religious virgins would be better than mythological, as it covers both cases. Good catch. Caetgory:Virgin should probably include folks who were notable for being virgin <i>at some point</i> (Elizabeth, Donna Edmondson, etc), and most spurious additions will be removed in their article. I think it's an inherently more maintainable system, and any <i>truly</i> spectacular cases can be mentioned in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">virginity</a> (as they already are, in fact). -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 02:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> a list of people real or mythical, reputed for being virgins, or widely known for being virgins would be good. They don't actually have to be virgins until death. For instance, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_I_d23c.html" title="Queen Elizabeth I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, is called the <i>Virgin Queen</i> but she was not a "virgin". And <i>the Virgin Mary</i> is only known to be a Virgin through the birth of Jesus. After the birth, there is no attestation she remained virginal until death. Mythology is replete with <i>virgin births</i>, so those virgin mothers should be on such a list. Several big-name scientists are famous for being virgins. (and some for debauchery as well). There's also the <i>Virgin Playmate</i> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Edmondson_2ed7.html" title="Donna Edmondson">Donna Edmondson</a>, who is famous for being a virgin when she posed for Playboy. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 00:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it's hopelessly POV and unverifiable. Without independent medical evidence, then it's <i>claims</i> of virginity (and, of course, there's the social pressure to claim virginity). In addition, it isn't clear what definition of virginity is used. And, looking at the talk page, the <i>inclusion</i> of Mary mother of Jesus will amount to endorsing a Catholic POV, while leaving her out will amount to endorsing an anti-Catholic POV. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The name could be changed to "List of people believed to be virgins" or "List of people claimed to have been virgins" or something similar. As for Mary, the easiest solution would be to list her, but put a note right after her name stating that some denominations believe this, and some don't. That covers all bases without supporting any one in particular. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 21:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>What's the point of a list of people who are "probably" virgins? Again, looking at the page history, there's some discussion of Britney Spears. She originally claimed to be "waiting for marriage" (despite the Fred Durst allegations, etc.) and then eventually said she wasn't. So when do you remove someone - when they stop talking about it, when they stop proclaiming their virginity? Is it really any of our business? We shouldn't be a gossip rag. As for "List of people claimed to have been virgins" - wasn't <i>everyone</i> a virgin at some point in time? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 04:31, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if this would actually work, I just thought it should be put out as a suggestion. I, for one, would probably support a proposal to not list contemporary figures like Britney Spears because their status can change so quickly. I'd support keeping it for historical (or at lease deceased) figures whose virginity was deemed notable enough to be included in some sort of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a>, such as a biography. (And, as for everyone having been one, the list would be for people who died as virgins or were otherwise <i>notable</i> for having been virgins.)
<ul>
<li>Nae'blis is right to point out the risk of weasel words. In individual entries, it would therefore be important to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite sources</a> as the bullet points at the beginning of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a> encourage. For the proposed change in the name of the article, I think that this would be a case where it's not weasely, just honest to acknowledge that we can't really <i>know</i> who has or hasn't lost their virginity. Like I said, there may be no good way to fix the problems with this list, but I think it best to at least try. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 10:17, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not just have this as a list of people famous for reputedly being virginal? Mythological instances are easy, since the claim is in the myth (This would include Mary, mother of Jesus - as this is <i>Christian mythology</i>). While Queen Elizabeth I, is attested to not be a virgin, but is famous for being the <i>Virgin Queen</i>. This would also cover <i>Donna Edmondson</i> as she's famous for being the <i>Virgin Playmate</i>, though she is now a mother and thusly no longer a virgin. The reputation for being virginal is a better and more verifiable fact than the actuality of it. Though I would not consider that any young person be placed on the list (ie. Britney Spears) as most young people are virgins for a large portion of their youth. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dhalia_6de1.html" title="Black Dhalia">Black Dhalia</a> is a famous virgin because she was medically incapable of having sex... so there is the question about what to do with those medically incapable of sex... (and the definition of sex to use for virgin). 132.205.93.88 23:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because "famous" is a tricky criterion; because "reputedly" lowers the bar to anyone, living or dead, who has ever had a rumour published about them that xe is a virgin; and because this doesn't address the problem of living people. The three lists that I gave, in contrast, do not rely upon fame and rumour; and exclude living people. A list of virgins in religious mythology is verifiable by citing analyses of the mythology; and such virgins are not living people. A list of virgins in works of fiction is verifiable by citing analyses of the literature; and by definition such virgins are not living people. A list of historical figures who were virgins at the times of their deaths is verifiable by citing historical analyses; and again by definition such virgins are not living people. In all three cases, if there's a reliable source that is cited, the person is on the list. In no case do we worry about Hillary Duff or Britney Spears, and in no case do we have to argue about who is "famous" and what "reputedly" means. If you want to list <i>non-virgins</i> such as <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, then you are into the territory that should be covered by list of historical figures nicknamed "virgin", <i>not</i> by any sort of "list of virgins" at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> this encyclopedia is written in mixed British-, Irish-, Austrialian-, Canadian- and American-English. That's a given and won't change. It is a useful guide to understand both articles and source material to have a list such as this. Most encyclopedias have some detailed preface explaining what is meant by certain terminology, but WP is not paper and no page precedes any other. Having a resource available (not so much as a usage guide but as a usefulness tool) is important, not that different from having lots of articles like <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_customary_units_40bb.html" title="United States customary units">United_States_customary_units</a>, Metrified_English_unit, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_unit.html" title="Imperial unit">Imperial_unit</a>, etc. whose chief contents are their equivalents tables so that <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> users aren't stumped if they want to know the height in <i>metric</i> units of a horse measuring so-many hands high, how long a race measured in furlongs is, just how much is 20,000 leagues under the sea, the whole nine yards, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mr. Proto and the guys who voted delete most likely didn't even bother reading the article. There's a whole Category named <i>American and British English differences</i>, check it out if you have the time. Somebody mentioned <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">American and British English differences</a>. Well, that's only the main article. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States_481c.html" title="List of British words not widely used in the United States">List of British words not widely used in the United States</a> is a frigging spinoff of the main article—should this article be deleted, the main article would be incomplete. Lexical differences between AmE and BrE are extraordinarily complex; they are NOT dealt with in the main article, they couldn't be dealt with in one single article: indeed, they span three different spinoffs, which are complementary to each other; the page the guys want to get rid of is one of these. Additionally, these guys don't seem to know much about linguistics. OK, I allow that the article could use some cleanup (nothing on that page can be traced to that "fart slang," btw) but deleting it sure would be a gigantic, unprecedented mistake. The article IS well-sourced. And it ain't no list of definitions, why don't you *read* that cottonpicking article, it ain't no list of definitions any. "...<i>Too subject to determine what qualifies as "widely used" and cite each example...</i>" Come on, we have books on British and American English, we have papers, we have style guides, we have corpus data, we have dictionaries. Delete that frigging article, and I'll quit. You can't do this to me. Shame on you.

Your tone and language are unacceptable. I should also remind you to <b><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a></b>. I can't speak for others, but I <i>did</i> read the article. As a result, and for the reasons given, my opinion is <i>delete</i>. I see no notice on the article page that it is part of any "project" (a <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikiproject_8329.html" title="WP:Wikiproject">wikiproject</a> or otherwise), hence my question. A "to-do" list on the talk-page didn't strike me as a "project", other than maybe your own personal project. The article might be "old", but that's no hallmark of encyclopedic value in and of itself. Some matters raised here have not yet been addressed, such as the subjective nature of the article. For example, the nature of "widely used" has no clear meaning, being left entirely up to each person's perception. You refer on the talk page to words "deserving" to be in the article, but how is an editor to know how a word is "deserving" when the criteria are subjective? I stand by my opinion to delete. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe not a "project" in the wiki sense—I meant *the whole category*. We are just trying to provide a thorough, comprehensive, in-depth study of the differences between the two main dialects of the English language. As for that "clear meaning" thing, we have books on British and American English, we have papers, we have style guides, we have corpus data, we have dictionaries, we have papers about word frequencies in British and American corpora and databases, we know whether a word is widely used or not and we know what that means. Stand your ground, I don't care. You're gonna lose.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - frankly, I'm at a loss to understand why somebody would want to delete this article. Some of the most useful parts of encyclopædiæ are the tables or lists usually incorporated or added as appendices.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, RedState does have a Beltway audience, but as its companion site, Confirm Them!, demonstrated during the debate over the confirmation of John Roberts, the abortive Harriet Miers nomination, and subsequent nomination and confirmation of Justice Alito, it also exercises an outsized impact in terms of shaping public opinion on Capitol Hill, the White House, and within the Washington D.C. press corps. At least, with respect to nominations for the federal judiciary.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Finally, this entire debate illustrates the utter subjectivity of what constitutes a "notable" weblog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The DailyKos is the most popular political weblog in existence at this time-and has garnered an enormous amount of media attention for its owner's success in drawing a Web audience-however it has been a miserable failure in achieving its purported objective, i.e. electing stridently left wing Democrats to office, both in general elections and in primaries.</dd>

<dd>What is this "accepted definition" you speak of? And who accepted it?

The article tells us that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> criticized Bush at a dinner and that people on the internet talked about it for "several days afterward".

<dd>The "accepted definition" is in Wikipedia's own notability policy: once a phenomenon is covered by a secondary news source, it becomes verifiable and thus notable. Thus deleting the whole list is silly: it would be much more effective to do individual AfD nominations for the articles linked from the list that aren't verifiable or notable, and then to remove them. Removing the list removes a valid source of information <i>without</i> dealing with the problem of non-notable "phenomena" being on Wikipedia in the form of articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

And you're telling me that if this incident involving Colbert is non-notable, then so is his linked article?? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is an exception. Most of the articles on that page are of the form "Hamsterdance: Blah blah blah summary of hamsterdance article" or also "Person who got most of his fame from the internet phenomena: blah blah blah summary." If such a claim about Stephen Colbert is uncited, you can delete it: you don't need an AfD to delete a single line on the page of an article, or even 50 lines on the page of an article. The other claims rely directly on the notability of the article they link to. To be more precise, if every single listing on the page was as you described (like Stephen Colbert) and had no citation, I would support deletion of the list because there would be no verifiable content on the list. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Also, for the information of the nominator, an internet phenomenon is also known as a "fad." Beanie babies, for example, were a notable fad. Notable web fads (also known as internet phenomena) have articles about them, such as this one by CNET: <a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you google both terms in quotes, you will find "internet phenoma/phenomenon" is more widely used, and thus under Wikipedia guidelines should be the title. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that's the case (and I'm not sure I agree that it is), then the term needs to be defined for the article in a manner that's free of POV and OR, and I don't think that's possible. Earlier in this thread, you couldn't define it without using POV/OR terms like "unusual" and "great". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then I suggest you delete <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">Skyscraper</a> under that logic, because a skyscraper cannot be defined without POV terms either, such as "very tall" (what does that mean?) or "unusually high". Or what about a mansion versus a house? A mansion can only be described as "unusually large" or "very large." Do you suggest we delete the article on mansions also? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Dark Shikari. I don't see the POV claim here. The language in the article appears neutral with no glaring weasel words. Yes it is a large article but the wide range of topics invites a large number of editors to view it and help maintain it. I agree with Dark Shikari that the number one criteria here should be verification from a secondary source and you already see the editors on the Talk Page moving towards this consensus. That gives me great confidence that this article can be maintained. The list is inherently notable in the subject matter with anyone who has been on the internet for even a small amount of time being able to scan through and go "OMG! I remember that!" on numerous occassions. The very fact that Wikipedia is web based strongly gears this article towards our most common audience. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 17:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, no, you're making a false assumption about what I said.

<dd>There is an 'Internet Memes' category, but it might be a good idea to change its definition to include what is described here as 'Internet Phenomenon'.

As this discussion demonstrates, she has often first sided with the "<b>Cleanup</b>" people (which I would support) and then suddenly taken it here without bothering to build a consensus for such action on the article's talk page. She is also not above insulting people in discussions (I am beginning to suspect some of her deletions are motivated by a desire to remove evidence of her tart keyboard in anticipation of the RFC she has to know is coming) and edit summaries, and has refused to respond to reasonable efforts to resolve disputes. Apparently it's her way or the highway.<br />
This indicates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> to me and, due to the background of these nominations I would, were I to be the closing admin, immediately suspend the debate as a bad faith nomination (We have done this in the past, I think).<br />

<dd>Keep in mind this article gets <i>daily</i> additions (mainly from anonymous IPs), and it is very difficult to keep track of what are legitimate entries and what are not.

Can this entry be deleted, since this is already covered in the "Numa Numa" entry? Probably. And Colin Mochrie <i>is</i> an example of an Internet phenomenon.

<dd>Animutations, whatever those may be, could very well be Internet phenomena. Colin Mochrie may be associated with Animutations. That does not make him an Internet phenomenon. In the same way, Vin Diesel Facts were an Internet phenomenon - Vin Diesel is not. GassyGuy 04:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct. Article could use a reconstruction/paring down from its current state. Like you said, "Vin Diesel facts" is a phenom, but not "Vin Diesel" himself. Same could be said for animutations and Colin Mochrie. A lot of it probably stems from the "which category here should this go under?" question, which I'm sure arises whenever someone makes an addition. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Internet phenomenon is an accepted term by scholars of the internet. Chabane Djeraba, Richard Kahn, Souiza de Silva have all used the term in published papers. The only <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem here is deciding what is and isn't a phenomenon since so few have been treated academically.

<li>If they weren't worthy of inclusion in their own article, and they failed to improve this article, perhaps they're not worth including in this particular resource. However, it's impossible to generalize - that would have to be assessed on a case by case basis if there's an article to which they might contribute something.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - The concept that "anything on the Internet" is automatically an Internet phenomenon is a specious claim. If the problem is with the word "phenomenon," then change the name of the article to Internet "fad" or Internet "memes," but don't delete. Article exists for a purpose. Also, article is not original research, as many of the entries <i>have</i> been cited by second party sources (not everything is cited yet, no, but you can't expect that to happen overnight). Needs a lot of work, but I think it can easily meet the criteria. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:09, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Addressing the question of the articles purpose) a category is for articles. Not everything should have an article. It's that simple. Some items on the list are not important enough to have their own articles, but they can be "listed" here. If the entry has its own article, by all means, link to it. But not everything that is an "Internet phenomenon" deserves an article. I can't think of any examples except for something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids_dcc6.html" title="List of minor Star Wars droids">List of minor Star Wars droids</a>. Not all of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> "droids" need their own articles, but should probably be mentioned <i>somewhere</i>, so why not put them here? <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've pretty much said all I have to say, but because you and many others have made this point, I will add - I am not of the mind that they "have to be mentioned somewhere" if somewhere means "somewhere on Wikipedia." Not everything needs to be mentioned. It's a pointless fight to attempt to delete the minor droid list, but minor droids sure seem more like Memory Alpha material than encyclopaedic stuff to me. Anyway, my point is, Wikipedia is a good resource, but it's not a one-stop shopping center. It can always include links to relevant offsite sources of information - it does not have to host every little thing. GassyGuy 05:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd like to point out that the article does <b>not</b> contain "personal/promotion websites" of any kind.

I've been watching the article for some time and I have seen a lot of entries come and go, and although self-promotion additions are quite often attempted, they are almost always deleted immediately (there are many users who keep a watchful eye on the article). The only entry on the page that you could actually argue this point for would be "<a href="../../../t/r/o/Tron_Guy_aa54.html" title="Tron Guy">Tron Guy</a>" (aka Jay Maynard) who did write his own article/entry, although, as he admits, it was done before he read Wikipedia's policy on autobiographies (<a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>).

But It does offer a good synopsis of various fads and things circulating on the internet. It just needs a huge amount of clean up, wikifying, and patroling by knowledgable people. I recognized about 60% of the list which means that at least that much is accurate. Perhaps there should be some sort of quantitative criteria for inclusion on the list, like number of downloads, reference in mainstream media, or the fad jumping from the internet into popular culture.

<ul>
<li>My reading of how "Wikipedia is not a dictionary" is applied is that we don't (shouldn't) have articles about single words. The policy article doesn't appear to address word lists, so based on how the policy is applied <i>at this point in time</i>, I don't think these articles actually do violate policy, hence my Keep vote. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. As pointed out, there are several such articles on varieties of regional English. The reason is simple: articles on regional English can quickly grow to quite a size, and having a list of slang and dialect words within these articles makes them longer and also unbalanced. For that reason it seems quite reasonable to have such lists as separate articles. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:38, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Dictionaries are anglo-centric repositories of 'traditional', 'proper' or 'common' words. The list of Trinidadian English terms is NOT 'merely a collection of definitions suitable for a dictionary. Indeed, this is a very and euro-centric view. Trinidadian slang, is just as much a part of its culture, as Carnival or Politics is. Sociologically, and anthropologically this list of Trinidad English terms provides a valuable insight into Trinidad culture, history, priorities, eccentricities, and biases. If Wikipedia is not a dictionary, then this List of Trinidad English terms is not a mere collection of definitions.User:Emirmohammed 15:03, 28July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Expanding is always a good idea (and websites for subjects which have them is always recommended), but I doubt you could expand it enough to prove that the temple is notable enough to deserve an entry in the 'pedia. There are millions of churches/temples/mospques around the world—we're not going to create articles for every one of them. If you can include information on why this one temple is very notable (e.g. First temple to be included in the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_World_Records_df77.html" title="Guinness World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>, First temple to be completely constructed by blind masonists, etc.), it is less likely to be deleted.

<li>Not sure, but my instinct tells me "probably", assuming one weeds out the people who only did a film or two in the 1980s and haven't worked since.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please, please, wikipediatrix, find something else to say. I would love to find something interesting, unique, notable that couldn't be written about the next 100 porn stars. (By the way, as Fan-1967 writes, "porn star" is just the accepted term, and does not connote fame; it's a job description. Some are notable, most aren't. Using "actress" has similar issues implying acting. See <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taija_Rae_2344.html" title="Taija Rae">Taija Rae</a>'s famous quote.)

<p>Dubious, most likely OR. The proof relies on properties of the logarithm which are not valid for arbitrary (i.e., which are not positive real) arguments. There are different possibilities extending the logarithm, one common being leaving the logarithm for non-positive reals undefined (so that the domain is an open part of <b>C</b>). <i>If</i> one uses this branch of the logarithm, the formula is on one hand trivial, but on the other hand pretty useless. I strongly doubt it is mentioned like this in any renowned textbook. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwaihir_9451.html" title="User talk:Gwaihir">gwaihir</a> 16:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, your links convinced me that the term does exist and was used historically by mathematical greats such as Johann Bernoulli and William Rowan Hamilton (cf Hamilton's report from link#1 and Stillwell's book from link #2). In fact, even Euler used it in at least two papers <a href="http://www.mathsym.org/euler/e807.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mathsym.org/euler/e807.pdf" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <a href="http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/archim/dict/hw?lemma=LOGARITHM&amp;step=entry&amp;id=d006" class="external autonumber" title="http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/archim/dict/hw?lemma=LOGARITHM&amp;step=entry&amp;id=d006" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>.

<dd>I guess it depends how you define "actress." In any event, she is more notable than other Big Brother participants who have their own pages. In addition, she has participated in another major reality show, <i>The Amazing Race</i> and has won several local pageants. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 21:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All such BB-7-USA character pages should be deleted and they can and should be added to this deletion proposal. This is not an effort to single her out as the most non-notable, on the contrary. They all are non-notable. An merely participation in a few television shows makes one not notable, see: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 21:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, she gets 24,000 hits for "Alison Irwin" and 283 for "Irwin Alison". Note however that a google test is a controversial tool and is rarely used to give conclusive evidence for notability. For instance: notable people from ancient history can get little or no hits, while a non-notable character from a contemporary television show can get a few thousands. Note also that she is already included on the BB-7-USA page, which is already more than enough. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 22:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- as Orangehead points out, there are plenty of articles on so-called insignificant people on Wikipedia; athletes, actors, politicians, authors, and so on. Who is insignificant to one user, who may not be a sports fan, may be significant to another. Anyone who appears on a reality program, especially making the final two of one series, probably more than passes the <i>professor test</i>, for example. Alternatively, a merge-and-redirect could be a compromise. I just don't think it's warranted in this case. --Kat0211 04:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>-this article is doing no one any harm. Why remove it? Plus, several other previous Big Brother contestants have their own pages.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> In fact, the very thing that brought me across this page in the first place was, a friend of mine mentioned, "Hey, remember that cat with a lemon on its head or whatever" and I thought, "Oh yeah! Limecat!". I went to the original site (limecat.net) only to find it in the clutches of an advertising sqautter. So I came to Wikipedia, which I expect to be a repository of our history, even the relatively insignificant. "Why do you assume we've all heard of it" is a terrible arguement; of course you've heard of it - <i><b>you're debating whether or not to delete it from Wikipedia</b></i>. That's the other thing I expect from Wikipedia -- if there's a meme I'm not familiar with, I will come here to find out about it.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Notability Defense</b> In the State of Indiana Secretary of State race. Gaining 2% of the public vote maintains ballot access for all candidates of that party (last election Mike Kole took 6% of the Vote). Which makes him notable for being the first Libertarian in the State of Indiana to maintain ballot access. Coming in second place per county makes that party one of the two major parties of that county and places that party on all County Boards (non-partisan rules). Displacing either the Republican or Democratic party. Indiana Code Title 3. Ancasta</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> Which counties has Mr. Kole come in second in? Has he actually displaced either the Democrats or Republicans in any county?</li>

<li><b>Search Engine Defense</b> In the Month of June, 2006 'Kole' was searched 3003 times. Determined by Keyword tool by overture.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I humbly appologize for the candidate inclusion. All references have been removed and no links to web sites suggesting such is in the article. That said: I would think that anyone on a ballot of the 3rd largest political party in the U.S.A and subject to many newspaper articles in regard to his life and comments would be notable.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I stand (actually sit) corrected. I think that the best solution here would be a redirect to the as-yet-unwritten article on the S.O.S. election in Indiana. As per <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, elections first, then candidates. And, while I know nothing about this specific election and am a Libertarian myself, I strongly suspect that Mr. Kole will poll in the low-to-mid single digits.

<p><b>Delete</b>. Vanity page. Admittedly the guy has published some books, but his use of Wikipedia is pure self-promotion. He's not a good citizen either -- he reverted the effort to size down his page (remove his myspace link, etc). If he won't follow the rules, we don't need his personal page cluttering up wikipedia.

<p><s>Sorry, I didnt quite understand what happened when some of my links were gone. I thought something had gone wrong and I restored them. I have asked my webguy to decrease the page dramatically. If the page still looks like vanity, please help me to edit it down. As for actual contrbutions to the world at large, Monk from Brooklyn is still the only book ever written by a foreigner who studied at Shaolin Temple. In fact, as far as I know, only two first hand books have been written about training in China. The first was Mark Salzman, Iron and Silk. My Taklamakan Desert book is one of only a very few, I have been able to find only two others, about a modern crossing of the Taklamakan Desert. My articles about hill tribes and ethnic minorities in Thailand and Cambodia are some of the only ones that exist on these subjects. (The books have definitely been published, which you could verify by checking with amazon or by googling the titles.)</s></p>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> - There's kind of an unofficial rule of thumb in regards to notability: If you aren't notable enough that someone is willing to create an article about you <i>entirely on their own initiative</i>, then you're probably not notable enough to be on Wikipedia. You mentioned that your "webguy" (i.e. publicist) put up the article. That's a big no-no on Wikipedia. Articles should be created by disinterested parties. I could make a case of notability for myself ("Created first live broadcast audio system for the internet! Created first live broadcast video system for the internet! Developed some of the critical engineering protocols to allow video games to play smoothly on the general internet!"), but there's no page for me. If someone's inspired, they'll do it.

<p>None of these cite any sources except the films themselves, a blatant violation of our prohibitions on original research, and they're essentially huge collections of whatever editors happen to think are cliches, making them fundamentally unverifiable.</p>
<p>Film lists:</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The horror movie cliches have certainly been written about by movie critics such as Roger Ebert, although I certainly don't have a citation handy. Ebert also wrote about romantic movie cliches, using "SEMIOLI" to refer to the "semi-obligatory lyrical interlude" such as a couple running through the park in slow motion, or the "cute meet." Some of these articles may be devoid of references, but certainly the references are there to be found. Hollywood's lifeblood was the movie cliche. Westerns? Gimme a break. Thre should be referenced articles for Western( a man walks into a room where someone has been shot. He picks up the gun just in time for the sheriff to walk in and arrest him), Horror movies, and Romantic movies, as well as the Evil Overlord movie cliches which have been collected in various places.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:46, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As much as I like these articles, and as much hard work I personally put into cleaning them up, I just don't see any way to possibly verify something like "movie cliches." And there's no way to keep up with them--the edits seem endless. I cleaned them up to the best of my ability, and two weeks later they were completely filled with crap again. Ohh, all those hours wasted that could have been spent searching for Internet porn. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 22:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think that we can all agree that a new account nominating 23 articles for either AfD or WP:PROD all on the same day is not in any way helpful or done in a spirit of trying to build consensus. The fact is, that 23 school articles on the same day by the same editor is by definition a "mass nomination". The fact that each got it's own nomination, just makes it worse because they are all nominated on the same basis. There is a clearly stated mechanism and procedure for nominations of this sort.

<dd>Chess certainly is a nice game. I am not proposing to delete the main article <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>. This article seems to be unsalvageable trivia though.

<p>Completely non notable suburban high school. I have attended this school for 4 years and it offends me that it is included in this encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> (nominator's vote) Of all American high schools, less than a third are probably notable. These are suburban schools. The performance of their students in PSAT results is less than notable (about 2 NMS finalists per year), and everything in the article could be guessed without reading it. Other high schools in washington are notable, such as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield_High_School_%28Seattle%29_e883.html" title="Garfield High School (Seattle)">Garfield High School (Seattle)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_High_School_%28Seattle%29_5053.html" title="Roosevelt High School (Seattle)">Roosevelt High School (Seattle)</a>, for the performance of their students and social significance. The obviousness of this article as a target of vandalism for students is also an issue because, to be frank, Shorewood students hate their school. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 21:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article does need alot of work, but the song is notable--as most Radiohead songs are--and should be kept. Also, if only singles were allowed articles than such famous songs as Stairway to Heaven and A Day in the Life would not have articles. I recommend removing the redirect to Hail to the Theif.<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhawk1964_3427.html" title="User:Dhawk1964">Dhawk1964</a> 06:18, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per above statement. Lots of songs have their own article. Orangehead 16:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Are you suggesting this song is of equal status to Stairway To Heaven or A Day In The Life? <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not at all, I was just saying that a song doesn't need to be a single to be notable enough to have an article and often songs that aren't singles are more notable than single songs. I did give that impression though, sorry for the misunderstanding. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhawk1964_3427.html" title="User:Dhawk1964">Dhawk1964</a> 01:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't really see what makes this song notable. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacarion_3e0e.html" title="User:Macarion">Macarion</a> 01:39, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a fan favorite and is one of the most popular non-single tracks on <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_to_the_Theif_da84.html" title="Hail to the Theif">Hail to the Theif</a> in the album reviewing community. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhawk1964_3427.html" title="User:Dhawk1964">Dhawk1964</a> 01:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> Not a single and the article does not provide any assertion of its notability. The (unverified) claim that the song is a favorite in the "album-reviewing community" can be made in the main <i><a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_to_the_Thief_7598.html" title="Hail to the Thief">Hail to the Thief</a></i> article. I love Radiohead, but the song does not scream notability. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 16:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about I Will? That song isn't the most famous song, but it has an article that's devloped well. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhawk1964_3427.html" title="User:Dhawk1964">Dhawk1964</a> 16:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, if a song is not notable, per the proposed <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28songs%29_1a0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (songs)">Wikipedia:Notability (songs)</a> guidelines, then it should not be included in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 17:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"First, create an article on the artist. Second, create articles on each album released by the artist. Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual songs, spin the information from songs out into their own articles." I think it's fair to say that the Radiohead album articles have devolped enough and now articles for individual songs can be written. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhawk1964_3427.html" title="User:Dhawk1964">Dhawk1964</a> 17:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Again review the guidelines. Even if song articles are spun-off from an album article, they still need to meet the criteria stated. I was the one who wrote expanded the "Street Spirit" and "Karma Police" articles in the first place, since they warranted notability as commercial singles. "Sail to the Moon" doesn't meet any of these general criteria in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28songs%29_1a0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (songs)">proposed guidelines</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 17:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article was previously deleted via prod, recreated (so contested). Second prod concern was "article is about a non-notable conjecture, and the fact that it was subsequently proven false". See also <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/nintendo-n-game" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/nintendo-n-game" rel="nofollow">answers.com's copy of previous version</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Smash_Bros._Online_82db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Smash Bros.

<li><b>Weak Keep pending rewrite</b>. I voted delete the last time this was up. However, recent events in India in which this site was blocked officially for hate speech were covered in national newspapers, which increases notability, and in my opinion causes it to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>strong keep</b> His activities are newsworthy and his name regularly appears in the papers, and is the object of considerable public discussion among those interested in politics in Delaware. I would say he could be considered a "Major local political figure who receives (or received) significant press coverage," see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and certainly passes the "Google" test. I think a person that draws 5,000 votes in a major party contest, and is likely to draw as many or more in the near future, is notable enough for a short article, and the Delaware political scene is certainly affected because of his activities. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilltim_7d55.html" title="User:Stilltim">stilltim</a> 02:08, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> None of that is listed here. Candidacy alone does not warrant inclusion. 'Significant press coverage' means out-of-state and national press. That hasn't happened here. 5,000 votes in a 'major party contest' usually means a pretty substantial defeat. The tally for the governor's primary on the article page attests to that. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 02:14, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> He is already notable because he's a serious candidate, regardless of how well he does. Also keep in mind that 10,000 votes (total) can win a statewide election in Delaware. Finally, how many congressmen from anywhere in the country get "out-of-state and national press" coverage? Not many...but surely they are notable. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilltim_7d55.html" title="User:Stilltim">stilltim</a> 02:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are several problems with your argument. First, there is no citation in the article that stipulates he is a "serious" candidate (whatever that is). Second, he is <b>not</b> a congressperson as you state. If he were already a Senator, then I wouldn't have supported his nomination for deletion. Lastly, he's not even his party's nominee for the race. He is a candidate to be a candidate. The matter at hand is should we delete him at least until he wins his party's nomination. The argument I made against the "weak keep" was that we don't keep bios to see if the person will become notable, we add bios only <i>after</i> the person becomes notable. If this guy doesn't get the nomination for office, then his bio is going to read "... was an "also ran" for the nomination for Senator - and I highly recommend we don't start including those folks in this encyclopedia. Otherwise, we're going to be add a lot (more) nutcases to this project. If we try to sort out who is "serious" and who isn't - that's going to be tough to verify. It'll be far easier to let the parties sort out who is a serious contender by allowing them to nominate the person to run. It's verifiable, and it won't be subject to debate. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 02:46, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> once again I must remind folks the standard for keeping is VERIFIABILTY, not NOTABILITY.

As <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> explains, non-notablity, while not a core policy like verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), it is the basis for a number of guidelines for article inclusion which represent consensus opinions on Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), and can be arguably associated with official policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> also explains that notablity is a controversial issue, but is frequently used as arguments for afd. Ignavus is perfectly justified to nominated these articles for deletion. While every Wikipedia user should take time to read up on policies and guidelines, its totally unnecessary and unjustified for ALIKIVAR to scold a new user like that - and on the basis of ALIKIVAR's own opinionated reading of Wikipedia guidelines as well.

Also, if you'd like to nominate the other articles you've listed, you should do so. As of now, the AfD template for them links to this AfD; they're separate articles, they deserve separate discussions (which will likely mirror this and every other AfD discussion).

<li><b>Keep</b>, Initially, when I created the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_artscene_groups.html" title="Minor artscene groups">minor artscene groups</a> article, I included Trank ASCII. That was until I discovered someone had already created a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trank.html" title="Trank">Trank</a> article. It is notable by being closely related to ascii scene legends <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remorse_ASCII_75f6.html" title="Remorse ASCII">Remorse ASCII</a>. I could live with the Trank article being merged into the Remorse article, but honestly, adding the Afd for ACiD, Mistigris, Remorse, SAC, is just ignorant, and this opinion doesn't stem from the fact that I regularly edit these articles. --<a href="../../../s/o/d/User%7ESodium_N4_c8b8.html" title="User:Sodium N4">Sodium N4</a> 15:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
