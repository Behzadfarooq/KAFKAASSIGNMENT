<p>Raised in the quiet town of Glasgow in the North Eastern corner of Montana,with three younger sisters, Kenythâs creativity was able to run wild. Broadway musicals, wonderland, the land of Oz, and even the world of Rainbow Brite contributed to an overactive imagination an unwillingness to compromise his view of the world. At fifteen Kenyth made the decision to come out of the closet as a homosexual. Aâme Lorainâs single Follow My Heartbeat helped him to realize that he needed to follow his own dreams and ambitions and not just do what everyone else thought he should. The song is still an inspiration to him to this day. His best friend growing up is an amazing young woman named Echo Sampson, and through out their lives the two have traveled on many fabulous adventures together, including a year long internship at the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando Florida and an impromptu trip to New York City. It is his time in Florida that Kenyth says gave him the self confidence to find out just how far his creativity could take him. Currently, Kenyth is a senior at the University of Montana, Missoula majoring in Theatre.</p>

<p>Kenyth has always immersed himself in writing, his Mother would buy him notebooks for school in August, but by October they would be desecrated by stories, ideas, and songs. His first series The Phoenix Chronicles is a six graphic novel long series following the adventures of a young woman named Anastasya as she realizes she has magickal powers, is from another world, has not only fight, but lead an army to save this other world, and all while trying to hold on to some scrap of a normal teenage life.</p>
<p>At the age of 18 Kenyth was cast as a report in the Polish Brotherâs film <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northfork.html" title="Northfork">Northfork</a>. In August 2006 Kenyth filmed his second movie, Strung, written and directed by Steven Vasquez, and produced by In The Pink Productions.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2006 Kenyth had his musical debut at Club Blender at the Palms in West Hollywood California, performing the song Billy B. The song was co written (and produced by) Devin Tait of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shitting_Glitter_d84f.html" title="Shitting Glitter">Shitting_Glitter</a>. Kenyth wrote the song after receiving a photograph of porn star <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Brandt_c20a.html" title="Billy Brandt">Billy Brandt</a> and his cousin jokingly saying how funny it would be if he actually dated the porn star.</p>

J.<i>F.</i>A.</p>
<p>Jace Angell was born in San Antonio Texas on August 8, 1989. He is the Battalion Executive Officer at Texas Military Institute. Angell was nicknamed Jace Fucking Angell by his friends because of all the things Jace Has been able to do. Jace is a very outspoken individual with substantiated beliefs. He disagrees with current education and is sickened by the fact that students now go to school for a grade and a piece of paper and not to truly learn. Here are two of many papers Jace has written on various beliefs.</p>
<p><br />
âPatrick just asked God, in his prayer, to open our ears and help you hear the words I am about to say. That concept, the concept to open your-self up to the vast knowledge that is out there, is one of the greatest opportunities and privileges we all so casually neglect. We neglect this concept, neglect the spirit of learning, everyday. It is overlooked individually when we pass up that good book we heard about and it is overlooked when we seek the current education system.</p>
<p>Aristotle said, âAll men, by nature, desire to know.â If this is so, which I believe it is, then the problem in education is not in our desire, but rather in our pursuit to quench our thirst for information and the quest for knowledge. We look to be taught rather than to learn. And we look to know instead of how to know. The dilemma, consequently, is us. It is in our acceptance of superficial learning. It is in our intrinsic draw toward instant gratification; the immaturity to accept the fish rather than learn how to fish.</p>
<p>I believe as Malcolm Forbes did in that âeducationâs purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open oneâ; an empty mind with an open mind not one filled with pre-digested facts. This is where education in America falls short. The open mind is one which seeks to find the answers, not knows them, a mind which questions and has the âability to entertain a thought without accepting itâ, Aristotle. We are not taught to, but we all must question; we must question facts, theories, and the accepted way of life. If we donât, if we simply follow the crowd, learn the answers, memorize trivial information, then I say again, we have neglected the spirit of learning and we have insulted what education once was and should be.</p>
<p>It is said by William Chace, the President of Emory University, that âeducation is sometimes wasted on the young.â What a profound statement. But some of you have zoned out, stopped listening to my crass rant on cosmetic education, and you have accredited William Chaceâs remark. Education is about an open mind, one which looks for knowledge, even if it is not going to help you get a better grade on your next periodâs test. Education is about learning and not about a piece of paper or a grade, and so too many students have forgotten that. It is accepted now, that we read, do our homework, study, all these things asked of us and more so we can get that grade. Get the grade and forget all that useless information; to quote Chace, what a waste. What a waste that we donât go to school to learn but we do because thatâs what you do, and you make good grades so you can go to a good college and get a good job. It is a waste and shame that this is rarely questioned, because this is the plague of developing minds, and as long as society follows these shallow steps without iconoclasm, without question, and without individuality, education will not be wasted on the youth but education will be wasted itself.</p>
<p>We need individuality. In our students, in our teachers, in education, individuality is the beginning of true knowledge, because true knowledge is obtained by those who seek it. The lost student, who is trampled by the stampede of forced curriculums and judged by impersonal numbers, is found when he finds himself as an individual and steps out from the herd so he may take the less traveled path to knowledge; a path that is overgrown with the branches of curiosity and the flowers of comprehension, a path where learning and understanding are sought after as the precious commodities that they are. You can no longer sit back expect to be taught, because you wont be. The hardest thing for a teacher to do is teach those who donât desire to truly learn. We as the future leaders of this world, future reformers, and philosophers, must find ourselves in a curiosity for something more, step out as individuals and open our minds to the great wonders of this world so that we may, someday, understand it.</p>
<p>I challenge everyone in here to walk through the halls of learning and embrace the spirit of a true education. I ask that you go and learn something new today, learn something that you find interesting, and once you do, share it with some one else, for this is what the greatest minds in all of history did then and may it be what the great minds of today do now. Iâd like to close in a quote by Oscar Wilde: âEducation is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember, from time to time, that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.â</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>âYou canât do that.â âIt would be too hard for you.â âYouâre not capable of that level of work.â In a society where âthe sky is the limitâ, and âyou can be whatever you want to beâ; what hypocrisy, what a contradiction in the path to success, education and, most importantly, learning. Who has the power to judge the capabilities of others, who can say what I am capable of?</p>
<p>Not you. Not a school administration, neither a boss nor a parent. I believe oneâs will and strength of heart and mind are the only means of measure for success; not a past, not a grade, or a report, only a drive to be better and a desire to learn.</p>
<p>I have had such a desire, I have a desire to learn something new, to experience rather than be taught, and to run rather than walk. Though in our cookie cutter society and education system, students like myself are hindered. We must conform to strict curriculum and spoon fed education. We are told that we donât prove ourselves in the classroom, nor do we act as though an honor student would. In rebuttal, I shouldnât have to prove myself, and thank you. Thank you for recognizing the difference between the vast majority of students and those like myself; those who go to school for a piece of paper and those who go to learn. So too often do student want to go to âYaleâ or âHarvardâ just for degree which will be titled with such a weighted and ostentatious name. If âI havenât proved myself in the classroomâ why keep me from advanced classes? Maybe I donât want advanced classes for the letters âAPâ to be on my college application. Maybe I have a desire to learn. One which is left unsatisfied by the narrow minded ideal that, since I havenât been the best student âIâm not capable of Advanced workâ, wonât even give me, the wanting student, a chance.</p>
<p>A model of hypocrisy in education is the application process by which students ask to be in advanced courses, ask for a better education and ask to learn more than the average student. The mere fact that some students are denied this privilege, no, right is an outrage and an insult to what education once was, and should be.</p>
<p>I side with learning, by whatever means. My transcript has suffered, yes, and though I might not know the etymology of a word, I understand how a generator works, tax codes, and some basic structural engineering. I have hands on experiences building houses with my grandfather or discussing real world issues with a political advisor. I have single handedly, at age sixteen, designed and developed a profitable and successful business. I wonât ever let someone else tell me what I am capable of, and I wonât ever stop learning. In the words of a devoted learner, Mark Twain, âDonât let a formal education get in the way of your learningâ</p>
<p>Jace Angell was almost asked to leave TMI when his absences from school were far beyond acceptable. Jace justifies his absences with the belief that he was doing something more useful with his time as a student. Angell would skip school to listen in on an economics, psychology, business, or another class at a local college. In 2005 Jace designed an investment plan which he developed into a small investment firm, J&amp;J Endeavors. J&amp;J Endeavors has produced returns triple that of the S&amp;P 500 by proving true their slogan "A disciplined Approach to Investing". Jace plans to attend Notre Dame or Emory University so that he may further his learning and expand his business.</p>

<p>Lago del Bosco is an Italian immersion summer camp in Minnesota. It is currently lacking a permanent facility, and is renting Sandhill Lake Bible Camp near Fosston, Minnesota. Established in 2003 as a part of Concordia Language Villages, Lago del Bosco is attended by Italian learners from ages 7-18. "Lago del Bosco" means "Lake of the Woods" in Italian, as do the names of most of the other Concordia Language Villages. The camps are located next to different lakes in Minnesota. Two-week sessions are available for villagers of all ages. For high-school age villagers, a four-week credit session is available. The four-week session provides the equivalent of a full year of Italian learning, meeting the requirement of 180 hours. This time requirement is met through daily classes, study hour, music lessons, cultural games and activities, engaging mealtime skits, and other exposure to the Italian language. Counselors at Lago del Bosco speak Italian fluently. Many are native speakers who come to the US to be a part of Lago del Bosco, and others have learned the language studying in the US. Counselors must only speak in Italian around campers to encourage the immersion environment. They may speak English in emergencies and at a certain time with their cabin. Villagers at Lago del Bosco are arranged into cabins named after Italian cities. They are divided by session, gender, age, and special request. Each cabin has two counselors that are responsible for the villagers in the cabin. Villagers eat with their cabin at breakfast. For lunch and dinner, they are divided into families of mixed session, gender, and age with some counselors to act as "parents." Camp food is authentic Italian cuisine. Before each meal, a group of villagers presents a self-made skit to the other campers. The different courses of food that are being served at that meal are incorporated into the skit. At the end of every day, everyone gathers for an evening program. This usually consists of a campfire, with the singing of Italian songs. There is usually a dance every Friday at which popular Italian music is played. Campers at Lago del Bosco can have any level of experience with Italian, and can come from anywhere to attend the camp. In 2006, there were local villagers, from Minnesota, or farther out villagers, from California. Some came from different countries, such as Venezuela. The cost of Lago del Bosco is $710 for the 1-week session, $1,445 for the 2-week, and $3,215 for 4 weeks.</p>

<p>The first people on the earth date back to apes but according to religions such as Christianity people were origanily in or in similar shape to mordern man. But what most people agree on is the origin of man being somewhere in babylon or in christianity, Eden suposoubly its neighbour. The first country was sumeriah that was the point where our great anscestors spoke one language araimic. That country had states which fought eachother and having no ruler for the entire country. The first where adam and eve as they grew its population sumeriah had one great family as a nation. However states still fought eachother and god told noah, his family and freinds that they where the only decent people around according to christianity. Then noah had to gather two of each animal and built an arc to scale that what god told him. Then god flooded the earth.</p>

Domus Academy is an international postgraduate school of design based in
</pre>
<p>Milan, Italy that share the eminence of the Royal College of Art and today represents what Bauhaus (1919-1933) and the Ulm School (1955-1968) meant in their time. Founded in 1983 by Maria Grazia Mazzocchi along with Pierre Restany,Alessandro Mendini,Alessandro Guerriero and Valerio Castelli.</p>
<p>An innovative institution as the paradox of Italian design was that it had become a dominant influence in the world, yet no one taught it, except in the studios of individual designers. Over the last twenty years, Domus Academy has taught industrial design, fashion design, urban management and interactive design to hundreds of young people, coming from universities in Japan, China, Korea, America, Australia, Turkey and Israel as well as countries all over Europe.</p>
<p>Students are involved in the activities of the Domus Academy Research Center, distinguished by its pioneering studies on the separation and recycling of materials like plastic and design projects for services and computer functionality. Domus Academy teaches how to arrive at a product through studies on eco-compatibility, service and function rather than simply teach how to design a product in a traditional way</p>

Anyone can become a shopper in Thailand easily. Typical shopping items for tourists are handicrafts, silk products, ceramics, carvings, wood products - they can be found in small shops and market places around the city. However, Baan Tawai with surrounding area and places along the way to village of Hang Dong, 15 minutes drive from the city by the south-bound highway, is the center for local handicrafts, ceramic and wood-art shops, or places selling antiques. Tourist come here to find cheap but interesting gift items - wooden toys, figures, vases, plates, carvings, ceramics, decorative objects and accessories. Some shops offer huge vases and pots, or different kinds of ceramics for garden or porch, or indoor display. Items of a higher historic or artistic value are often found available. Teak wood products have here a long tradition. Teak wood is the commodity of choice for craftsmen making wood carvings and also furniture makers. Antique furniture shops scattered around the area carry a lot of furniture from British colonial era (<a href="http://www.goldentriangle.co.th" class="external free" title="http://www.goldentriangle.co.th" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldentriangle.co.th</a>). The British colonized the neighboring Burma, along with other places around the region in the period of 1870s-1940s. They influenced the local architecture as well as the interior design.<br />
Baan tawai does not need to be presented as a place for shopping only - it is a place which provides for the visitor an insight to local temporary and historic art, the wood - workmanship which has a long tradition here, along with a variety of other unusual items and products of the local craftsmen.</p>

<p>I was educated at Poole Grammar School in Dorset before going to the Univeristy of Bristol where I spent six years (BSc, Bristol (1975); PhD, Bristol (1978, with Professor Selby Knox and Professor Gordon Stone). I then spent two years as a SRC-NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of California, Berkeley, USA (1978-80) in the laboratories of Professor Peter Vollhardt before taking up a position in Sheffield back in the UK, where I am a senior lecturer in chemistry. I was the RSC Sir Edward Frankland Fellow for 1986 and 1987 and the Royal Society of Chemistry HE award winner for 1998.</p>

<p>Migration reactions are an important fundamental class of reactions in organometallic chemistry. Our current main research thrust concerns migrations of hydride and alkyl groups to metal coordinated carbene (see Scheme 1) in processes which result in new alkyl ligands. To date, most of our work has involved molybdenum (see Scheme 2 for an example), tungsten, iron, and ruthenium. Scheme 1 Scheme 2</p>
<p>Such reactions are models for some important C--H and C--C bond formation processes but surprisingly little is known about these rearrangements. We are particularly concerned to discover the the mechanisms by which they proceed. These migrations are the reverse of Î±-elimination reactions and we now find that some of the above products Î±-eliminate under photochemical excitation to regenerate the initial carbene starting materials.</p>
<p>Many of the compounds are somewhat air-sensitive. The work has a large synthetic component but research workers use mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy extensively for characterization and monitoring. We also make great use of the Department X-ray crystallographic service.</p>
<p>A recent interest concerns applications of the 'World Wide Web' (WWW) for chemistry. This is an international hypertext networked information system that show great promise for information movement in chemistry. Selected Publications</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-09_41ae.html" title="Edit section: Cofactor Expansion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cofactor Expansion</span></h2>
<p>Cofactor expansion, also known as Determinant Expansion by Minors or Laplacian Expansion, is a convenient method of calculating the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinant.html" title="Determinant">determinant</a> of a matrix.</p>
<p>To calculate a determinant by cofactor expansion, one begins with a matrix one would like to find the determinant for:<br /></p>
<p>M = <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/5/d/c5d2fd0add19454a166fcf54c3a64bea.png" alt="\begin{pmatrix}   6 &amp; 4 &amp; 2\\   2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\\   5 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}" /></p>
<p>One then "crosses out" a selected row and column that intersect at particular entry. For example, removing the first row and first column of M, which intersect at the 1,1 entry of M gives the following submatrix:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/4/b/04be88656922b46517cdabf7d3654c6c.png" alt="\begin{pmatrix}   3 &amp; 5\\   6 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}" /> The determinant of this submatrix is known as the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_%28linear_algebra%29.html" title="Minor (linear algebra)">minor</a> of entry M<sub>11</sub>. In this case Det(M<sub>11</sub>) = -33</p>
<p>One then multiplies the minor by the factor (-1)<sup><i>i</i>+<i>j</i></sup> where <i>i</i> is the number of the row deleted and <i>j</i> is the number of the column deleted. In this case <i>i</i> = 1 and <i>j</i> = 1. This product (-1)<sup><i>i</i>+<i>j</i></sup> * det(M<sub>11</sub>) is known as the <i>cofactor</i> of M<sub>11</sub>. In this case, the cofactor of M<sub>11</sub> is (-1)<sup>1+1</sup> * -33 = -33</p>
<p>To finish calculating the determinant, one selects a row or column (it may simplify matters to choose one with many zeros) and multiplies the entries of that row by their cofactors and sums the products.</p>
<p>For example, Det M = [M<sub>11</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>11</sub>)] + [M<sub>21</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>21</sub>)] + [M<sub>31</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>31</sub>)]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Det M = [M<sub>11</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>11</sub>)] + [M<sub>12</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>12</sub>)] + [M<sub>13</sub> * cofactor(M<sub>13</sub>)]<br />
Det M = [6 * -33] + [4 * 27] + [2 * -3]<br />
Det M = -96</p>

<p>Dr Margaret Chan, born in Hong Kong, from the People's Republic of China, obtained her Medical Degree from the University of Western Ontario in Canada. She joined the Hong Kong Department of Health in 1978, where her career in public health began.</p>
<p>In 1994, Margaret Chan was appointed to Director of Health of Hong Kong. In her nine-year tenure as director, she launched new preventive and promotive health care services. She also introduced new initiatives to improve communicable disease surveillance and response, enhance training for public health professionals, and to establish better local and international collaboration. She has effectively managed outbreaks of avian influenza and of severe acute respiratory syndrome.</p>
<p>In 2003, Margaret Chan became WHO's Director of the Department of Protection of the Human Environment. In June 2005, she was appointed as Director, Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response as well as Representative of the Director-General for Pandemic Influenza. She now continues in the role as Representative along with the duties as Assistant Director-General for the Communicable Diseases cluster.</p>
<p>In July 2006, Margaret Chan took a leave of absence from WHO, in relation to her candidacy for the position of WHO Director-General. The position of Director-General will be decided upon by the World Health Assembly on 9 November. Until that decision is made, Dr David Heymann is Acting Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases.</p>
<p>In November 2006, Margaret Chan was selected as the WHO Director-General, making her the first Chinese national chosen for such a high-ranking U.N. post.</p>

<p>IF HARVARD Business School is the West Point of Capitalism, and Stanford is the Yale of the West, that makes Stanford Business School--Hell!! Well, atleast according to Peter Robinson, it's Sheer Agony and the inscription over the portals should be, "Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here." For that's how Mr. Robinson sees himself there, as a poet in Hell(read Stanford).</p>
<p>Poets, in B-school slang, are the few members of the first-year class who come, economically speaking, from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are career-shifting English majors or track-jumping corporate types or, in Mr. Robinson's case, speechwriters leaving the Reagan White House. At Stanford, they are up against the financial whiz' who are already comfortable with spread sheets and other quantifiable esoterica. The competition between the two cultures is dreadfully unfair and Mr. Robinson records it here at painful length.</p>
<p>The purpose of this volume, as suggested by Mr. Robinson, is to answer the question: "What is business school like?" And he does. And given the author's tour as a phrase-maker for the Great Communicator, it's not surprising to find the tale told in crisp, post-collegiate prose.</p>

<p>EADA came into being in 1957 in Barcelona as an institution for continuous training, due to the initiative of Arturo Alsina and Irene VÃ¡zquez. In its first years of existence, EADA was formed as a consultancy in business management and administration. Two years later, our activities expanded into continuous training, specializing in the field of business management and administration, the backbone of our institution's activities to this very day.</p>
<p>In 1967 EADA became an incorporated company. The founders, teachers and non teaching staff became EADA's shareholders.</p>
<p>Since 1990 EADA has not only occupied the building in AragÃ³ street, but also owns the Residential Centre in CollbatÃ³ to consolidate, since 1999, its presence in the Latin American market with the creation of a branch in several countries.</p>

<p>He is a national award winner for best film maker. He is an actor/producer/writer/director.Born Tom George Kolath, on Dec 24th, 1970, to Dr K. M. George and Chinnamma George, he was raised along with his siblings Mary, Mathai, Abraham, Anna and Elizabeth, in a loving, traditional family in Palghat, a small town in Kerala, one of the southern states of India. While still a child, George was fascinated by the world of movies. As he grew older, the fascination only deepened and turned into a serious pursuit. But a traditional Indian family, which is known not only for its warmth and security but also for its tough love, lays stress on education. George's parents insisted he first get a world-class education before pursuing other choices.</p>
<p>And so, George gathered a string of degrees, which include undergraduate program in India, Bachelors in Accounting from Binghamton, State University of New York and an MBA from Columbia University. He also became an active member of National Society of Public Accountants and set up a business in New York City practicing Income Tax. Expanding the business further, he opened three plush offices in the City of New York and Long Island. With a solid financial backing in place, he was ready to launch his movie career.</p>
<p>After having lived in U.S. for over 10 years, George decided to get in touch with his roots once more and moved to India in 2001. There he took every opportunity to learn more about the technical aspects of filmmaking. He went to act in a string of movies, T.V. serials and produced many of them too. Making of Akale (2004), was a learning experience for him. It hit home the fact that a great movie may never hit box office bonanza, but the praise and the recognition accorded it provides the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. Perseverance and kinship with the community of new and budding movie makers inspired George to stay the course and further polish his skill. Not surprisingly, he acquired a diploma in Filmmaking from Hollywood Film Institute in March 2005. His most recent work is a short film named Lessons which sends the social message of condemning child abuse and the psychological impact thereof on a child's mind.</p>
<p>He is a busy man these days, shuttling frequently between New York and Kerala, to launch his latest directorial venture titled Gandhi Park. The movie will star a mix of cast from Hollywood and the Indian movie industry nicknamed Bollywood. Gandhi Park is a contemporary, cross-cultural romantic comedy. At heart, it is a passionate and soulful love story that deals with the realities when an Indian girl and an American white boy fall in love, the family tension that ensues, the inherent conflict of cultures, the pressures of going against family traditions that are set in stone.</p>

<p>The Crab Bowl is a college football game played between two in-state rival teams from Maryland: The United States Naval Academy and the University of Maryland, College Park. There have been eighteen games to date. The games go back to 1905. The Naval Academy has won thirteen of the games. Navy won all of the games up to and including 1934. The two teams have split the wins since 1934.</p>
<p>The University of Maryland won the most recent Crab Bowl. This game was played on September 3, 2005. The score was 23 (Maryland) to 20 (Navy).</p>

<p>This information is taken from the "Yearly Results" shown for "Navy Midshipman Football" at the "United States Naval Academy" page on Wikipedia. As a life-long Maryland (grew up near Annapolis, MD . . . home of the Naval Academy) and an alumni of the University of Maryland, College Park, I know these games are the "Crab Bowl". I attended the 2005 Crab Bowl. There was some controversy concerning the 1963 Crab Bowl that kept the Crab Bowl from being played for over thirty years. So I left that part out.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-09_41ae.html" title="Edit section: Causal structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causal structure</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Relativity_700f.html" title="General Relativity">General Relativity</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifold.html" title="Manifold">manifold</a> has a non-trivial causal structure. In simple terms, this structure categorizes sets of points in terms of the (non-)existence of causal curves between the points.</p>
<p>For a given point <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span> of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a>, a number of different causal sets may be defined. The main ones are</p>
<ul>
<li>The chronological future of <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span>, conventionally denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i> <sup>+</sup> (<i>p</i>)</span>;</li>
<li>The chronological past of <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span>, denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i> <sup>â</sup> (<i>p</i>)</span>;</li>
<li>The causal future of <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span>, denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i> <sup>+</sup> (<i>p</i>)</span>;</li>
<li>The causal past of <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span>, denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i> <sup>â</sup> (<i>p</i>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sets may be extended in obvious ways to sets of points; surfaces are a case of particular interest. In fact, for a particular kind of hypersurface --- a <i>closed achronal set</i> <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i></span> --- one defines the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The future domain of dependence of <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i></span>, denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i> <sup>+</sup> (<i>S</i>)</span>;</li>
<li>The past domain of dependence of <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i></span>, denoted <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i> <sup>â</sup> (<i>S</i>)</span>;</li>
<li>The (full) domain of dependence of <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i></span>, <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i>(<i>S</i>)</span>, is the union of <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i> <sup>+</sup> (<i>S</i>)</span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i> <sup>â</sup> (<i>S</i>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The causal structure of space-time relates directly to its properties as a topological manifold, and is particularly pertinent to the study of space-time singularities.</p>

<p>Eric C. Anderson is one of the leading entrepreneurs in the space industry. He has led the development of commercial human spaceflight and the space tourism industry since its inception, and is a true astropreneur (as coined by Wired magazine). Mr. Anderson co-founded Space Adventures, Ltd. in 1998 with several former astronauts and leading visionaries from the aerospace, adventure travel and entertainment industries. Since founding, and having served as President and CEO of Space Adventures, Mr. Anderson has led the worldâs premier space tourism company through several successful years and has sold more than $120 million (USD) in spaceflights, including those taken by the first and only four tourists who have actually flown to space: Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Greg Olsen and Anousheh Ansari. He has developed and financed over $500 million (USD) in new projects for Space Adventures, including two global spaceports and the first private voyage to the moon, set to launch in 2010. Under Mr. Andersonâs direction, Space Adventures remains the leader of the space tourism industry through the continuous launches of commercial passengers to the International Space Station, the recent offering of a circumlunar mission and through future suborbital spaceflights. Mr. Anderson is an oft-seen broadcast interviewee, including multiple appearances on the Today Show (NBC), Good Morning America (ABC), Your World with Neil Cavuto (Fox News), Fox &amp; Friends (Fox News), CNN Headline News and BBC World. He is also a guest speaker and lecturer on various topics within the aviation/aerospace and travel industries. Recent speaking engagements include WIRED NextFest, The WTTC Global Travel &amp; Tourism Summit, and The Forbes CEO Forum. Mr. Anderson also co-authored the âSpace Touristâs Handbook,â published in 2005 with bestselling author Joshua Piven. As an outspoken advocate of commercial space transportation, private space exploration and space tourism, Mr. Andersonâs vision is to open the space frontier to all private citizens which will then enable the development of space resources for the benefit of humanity. Previously, Mr. Anderson was the principal and co-founder of Starport.com, later sold to SPACE.com in 2000. Mr. Anderson was also lead engineer and business development lead for aerospace software firm Analytical Graphics, Inc., and has held various consulting and research positions with NASA, where he authored several technical papers, articles and evaluations on topics ranging from space tourism and launch-vehicle analysis to the business and economics of various space-related ventures. Mr. Anderson graduated magna cum laude from the University of Virginia with a degree in aerospace engineering, and was selected by USA Today as one of the nationâs Top 40 university graduates of 1996. In 2006, he received the University of Virginia Engineering Foundation Outstanding Young Engineering Graduate Award. He is 32 years old and lives in Vienna, Virginia. He is a member of the Standard &amp; Poorâs Society of Industry Leaders, the World Travel and Tourism Council and the Young Presidents Organization, and is a Board member of the X Prize Foundation and Zero-G Corporation.</p>

<p>The legend of Mr. Bob Riley is one of the greatest stories in the history of McCaffreys. As a front end manager, he dealt with situations that the average person would not have to go through. Between bouts with angry customers, and dealing with the delivery guys in the back...Bob gets the job done his way.</p>

<p>Before C Money &amp; P Gunna started P.A both of these crooners were in a heavy fueled rivalry droping off cd's at each others mail boxes and passing cd's thru classmights filled with jabs at one another until the audience not only asked but demanded that the pair squash the beef and do a colaboration but instead they created one of the most successfull independent record labels in the game and still going strong today. When the dust was settled they knew they needed a 3rd member and in came Imax a friend of the 2 which had a huge role in getting the 2 crooners to barry the hatchet and start this unstoppable force. Today a Sublabel also exsist "P.A Music Group"</p>

<p>What makes seperates P.A from all other acts is they're way of aquiring and treatment of fresh new young talent refferd to as "Developmental Talent" or "D-Talent". Although most New/young talent dont sign to Pimp Audio records right away a sublabel was created in order to produce mixtape type albums which developmental talent can be heavily featured on or have they're own full length mixtape all to themselves. Past D-Talent were Prize, Marx, Brock, Druels, &amp; Beers. In September of 05 P.A made a change in the roster releasing all of the developmental talents from they're contracts a move that shocked many if not all of the talent signed. The only D-talent released that was contacted about a deal was Prize.</p>

<p>Rumors were flying across messege boards and were confirmed that Pimp Audio was ready to sign another unknown artist known as Don P, but there was a twist with this deal because Don P and P Gunna are one in the same as both are alter egos and 2 different personas By Paul Delgado. A very strange and contraversial move by the label as they wanted Don P and P Gunna to be 2 different artist but be the same person. None the less the move proved to be a hit with fans as everyone is waiting in anticipation for Don P's 1st album "The R$B in Me"</p>

<p>Decide the type of limousine (Standard Stretch, Super Stretch, SUV Hummer, Escalade, Rolls Royce) desired color, the number of passenger. How many hours you would like to rent the limousine. Questions to ask when calling to inquire about renting a limousine While most people assume that all companies are equal, well they are not. Most consumers concern themselves with the hourly rate first and this is a typical mistake, since most of the times you get what you pay for! When you hear a price that is much lower than other companies be for warned it will probably mean the year, make and features of the limousine offered are older and over used. So the word to the wise: Pay the extra $5-15 dollars more per hour. For a first class vehicle and the professional service you can expect to get from a well trained driver. Besides when you consider that a typical 3 hour minimum you are only talking $75.00 dollars on the high end for a new six passenger limousine versus one that has gone beyond the 100,000 mile mark and the car looks like it too. Multiple Vehicle Discounts If renting more than one vehicle. Example: a limousine, a bus, be sure to ask about discounts that may apply to the second vehicle. Many companies offer special discounted rates when multiple vehicles are used. Murphyâs Laws Back Up Will the limousine company provide you with a live person to contact during your scheduled event should you require any assistance. If not, be certain to obtain a contact phone number of an operating manager in charge. Additional Questions To Consider How long has the limousine company been in business? Do they have testimonials from past clients? How big is their limousine fleet? What types and colors of limousine are available on your specified date? Do the vehicle have air conditioning and heat controlled from the passenger area? What are the cost? Are there minimum hour requirements? Is the gratuity/tip included in the final price? How much are tolls if applicable? Are the vehicles fully stocked and are the drinks complimentary? Does your company charge for driving time to and form the limousine rental company or does the time start when the driver arrives at your pick up location? How are the drivers dressed? Some limousine companies have a uniform standard while others do not. The appearance of the driver is as important as the appearance of the vehicle and you will want to have your driver appearance professional and clean. If renting for a wedding and want to display a âJust Marriedâ sign can it be attached to the vehicle? If so, does the company provide a standard sign or allow you to attach your own. If so is their and extra cleaning or service charge.</p>

<p>Englewood District: Contains the neighborhood of "Northeast Teaneck" and parts of Central City</p>
<p>West Bogota District: Contains Both Southside Zones</p>
<p>Cedar Lane District: Contains both Westside Zones, Queen Anne Square, Parts of Central City.</p>
<p>Glenpoint District: Contains the neighborhoods of Country Club, Glenpoint, and the Baseball Section.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORHOODS</p>
<p>Central City: LOCAL NAME: HIGH SCHOOL SECTION The Central City section is possibly the most diverse neighborhood in Teaneck, economicly and ethnicly, its most noted for its large black and jewish population. This neighborhood is the area from queen ann road and cedar lane to and east to about state street. This section doesnt have a downtown area however there is a very large plaza with plenty of diverse stores. This sections main park is votee which is the largest and nicest of the teaneck parks.</p>
<p>SouthSide Zone 1:The section is on the east side of Degraw Ave. and consists of mostly italian and some spanish families. This neighborhood is very diverse in economics but mostly is a middle class neighborhood.</p>
<p>Southside Zone 2: LOCAL NAME: Mexican Row This section is on the west side of Degraw Ave. Amman park marks the center of this area. It is not an overly dangerous area however the park does attract gangs, crooks, and a place to deal drugs. This side is mostly working class.</p>
<p>WestSide Zone 1&#160;: LOCAL NAME: None</p>
<p>This is a very large section of Teaneck and is very diverse in income. As you enter the neighborhood it may seem like a lower class area but as you approach the center of the neighborhood you will find many large houses. As you walk more east you will start to see smaller houses again. It consists of mostly all cultures but there is a substantial jewish population.</p>
<p>Westside Zone 2: Local Name: None This section is a more lower-middle class area. however it is very diverse. Mostly apartments and two family houses are around this area. There is a large concentration of Italians, Germans, Blacks and Hispanics. The area is extremely underdeveloped and in the last year has seen a huge increase in crime with a recorded number of 2 murders (stabbings) 1 shooting(none hurt) and a number of car thefts. The revitalization of cedar was thought to be the answer to the sections woes but it showed no results. There is a new plan in review to fix the area.</p>
<p>Glenpoint: Local Name: "By the Marriot" This section is the section closest to the Marriot. Although many revitalization attempts have been made this section still remains the "forgotten neighborhood" of Teaneck. Because of the lack of stores and parks in the area most people except the residence that live there go to the Glenpoint Section. This area is characterized by run down/ abandoned houses and empty lots. It is a mostly Indian population.</p>
<p>Baseball Section:Local Name: The Fields This section is a mostly middle class section. It is located around 4 baseball fields.</p>
<p>West Englewood: Local Name: Hebrew Hills This section is the wealthiest of teanecks neighborhoods. It is dubed "Hebrew Hills" because of the large influx of jewish residence. This section of teaneck is pretty much all upper middle to upper class. However it is a small neighborhood so it tends to not have that nice of a feeling. Also big homes are packed together with no land.</p>
<p>North East Ward: Local Name: Black side, Goonieville, Goon row</p>
<p>This section is not actually a ward because Teaneck council decided on not choosing a ward system for teaneck contrary to popular believe and demand. This is the largest section spanning from the teaneck road bridge up till The Teaneck Armory, and spreading into parts of the Central City section and Englewood. This section is almost 100% black and is a lower class neighborhood than the other neighborhoods. This is the most dangerous area of Teaneck and is for the most part a very depressed area.</p>
<p>Queen Anne Square:Local Name: None</p>
<p>This is a neighborhood close to the cedar lane neighborhoods and is a small high class neighborhood. It is just over the tracks from the South Side (West Zone) section and is a completley different neighborhood.</p>
<p>Country Club: Local Name: None</p>
<p>Country Club is a neighborhood off of cedar lane. It is pretty much a high class neighborhood however like most of the high class neighborhoods it is very small. It is probably the most desirable neighborhood to live in. One things that draws people away from this area is that it is located next to a industrial field which someitmes make the neihgborhood look grungy. This neighborhood consists of mostly jewish and blacks like Central City except it is a more upscale neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>For as far back as about 4000 years, we can find references to nose surgery. Our present-day cosmetic surgeons are the most recent in a long line of gifted surgeons who worked on peopleâs noses. About 600 B.C., an Indian surgeon, Sushruta, (1) wrote down what heâd learnt from his teachers and their teachers, extending back to the creation of the universe, when the science of life (Ayurveda) was first inspired by meditation. (2)</p>
<p>In ancient times, an often-used punishment was having your nose tip cut off. That gave rise to nose surgery to re-attach it. Sushruta taught surgery at Banaras University in India and has been given the title âFather of Plastic Surgeryâ. (3)</p>
<p>Hereâs a summary of his procedure for re-attaching a cut-off nose:<br />
1. Gather a vine leaf big enough to cover the cut off nose piece and cut a piece of flesh the same size from the personâs cheek.<br />
2. Make a series of small cuts in the nose piece and press the piece of flesh closely onto it.<br />
3. Dust it with a mix of three powders: Pattanga (Cesalpinia sappan, an antimicrobial, immunostimulant and antiviral), (4) Yashtimadhukam (Licorice root, to promote healing, (5) and Rasanjana (to reduce swelling and perhaps bleeding) (6).<br />
4. Insert a small pipe into each nostril for breathing and to keep those airways clear.<br />
5. Bind the nose piece on with karpasa cotton and sprinkle it generously with refined sesame oil.<br />
6. When the nose and face have reunited, remove any excess skin.<br /></p>
<p><b>Traditional Rhinoplasty</b></p>
<p>Rhinoplasty (nose surgery, from two Greek words, <i>Rhinos</i>, nose, and <i>Plastikos</i>, a verb meaning to shape) has come a long way since those days, when wine was used as the anesthetic and incantations accompanied the procedure. You can have medical rhinoplasty to improve the noseâs functions, and cosmetic rhinoplasty to improve its appearance. Both those procedures have been done increasingly often, with many people pleased with the results. However, both are surgery, with the accompanying disadvantages:<br />
Â· Temporary facial disfigurement<br />
Â· Temporary pain and discomfort<br />
Â· A recovery period which calls for time off work<br />
Â· The usual surgical risks, e.g. infection, excess bleeding, etc.<br /></p>
<p><b>Non-Surgical Nose Job</b> <a href="http://www.westsidemedicalspa.com/non_surgical_nose.html" class="external text" title="http://www.westsidemedicalspa.com/non_surgical_nose.html" rel="nofollow">Alexander Z. Rivkin M.D. pioneered the Non Surgical Nose Job in 2004</a>. Itâs an office based, filler injection procedure, designed to be an alternative to traditional surgical rhinoplasty. Itâs the first non-invasive procedure for altering the noseâs shape.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Rivkin, M.D.</b> By devoting his practice to developing non-invasive alternatives to traditional cosmetic surgery, Alexander Rivkin, M.D. has become an acknowledged international expert in the new field of non-surgical cosmetic procedures.</p>
<p>He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University and completed medical school at Yale University School of Medicine. He then went on to train in Head and Neck / Facial Plastic Surgery at University of California San Diego and University of Texas Houston.</p>
<p>In 2003, Dr. Rivkin established his practice in Los Angeles and has been featured throughout the national and local media for the procedures he has developed, on shows like the TODAY show, the Tyra Banks Show and EXTRA.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of this procedure, also called "non surgical rhinoplasty" or "injection rhinoplasty," it has been widely adopted throughout Asia, especially in Japan. The Non Surgical Nose Job procedure is becoming more popular in the United States as the FDA approves longer-lasting injectable fillers.</p>
<p>The secret to reshaping the nose successfully lies in injecting the right amounts of filler in the right places. The two fillers typically used are:</p>
<p>1. Restylane â the main component of which is hyaluronic acid. Restylane requires no allergy testing since it is not animal based. Hyaluronic acid is a lubricating protein found in the joints of most living creature. Restylane is soft, doesnât form lumps and lasts about eight months.<br />
2. Radiesse â the main component of which is calcium hydroxyapatite. Calcium hydroxyapatite is very similar, molecularly, to tooth enamel. Radiesse also requires no allergy testing. It lasts one year to 18 months.<br /></p>
<p>The Injection Rhinoplasty procedure is actually more precise than surgical rhinoplasty in many cases. Because the procedure involves small injections, more subtle and detailed adjustments to nasal contouring are possible with this procedure than surgery.</p>
<p><b>How is it Done?</b></p>
<p>During the initial consultation, the patient and their facial plastic specialist discuss exactly what results they would want to see from the procedure. The doctor also goes over the risks and limitations of the procedure.</p>
<p>Risks include mild bruising, some redness around the area of injection and some mild swelling. All these potential side effects are very temporary and disappear within a few days. All limitations of the procedure concern its inability to physically decrease the size of nasal structures. Straightening the appearance of the nasal bridge by filling in the areas around a prominent hump will make the nose look smaller. The nose is no longer irregular, it no longer attracts the viewerâs attention and it blends in to the rest of the face. The illusion is that the nose is smaller. However, this procedure cannot actually reduce tissue, so it is not useful to those patients who have a very prominent nose that needs to be physically reduced. The procedure itself takes a quarter-hour to a half-hour.<br /></p>
<p>Â· A anesthetic cream is smoothed on the nose<br />
Â· The Restylane or Radiesse is carefully injected into precise points of the nose<br />
Â· The filler is then massaged gently for a smooth appearance<br />
Â· Ice is then applied off and on for the rest of the day<br />
Â· After the procedure, patients should avoid trauma to the nose and should not wear glasses for a week and a half.<br /></p>
<p>As soon as itâs done, patients can return to work, with none of the usual post-surgical discomforts and recovery tasks.<br /></p>
<p>What can Injection Rhinoplasty correct?<br />
Â· Bumps anywhere on the bridge of the nose<br />
Â· Crooked or deviated nasal bridge<br />
Â· Flat or broad nasal bridge (most common in African American patients)<br />
Â· Flat or underdeveloped nasal bridge (most common in Asian patients)<br />
Â· Indentations, cartilage collapse, nostril notching or scarring from past nasal surgery<br />
Â· Sloped or âski-jumpâ nasal bridge<br />
Â· Drooping tip<br />
Â· Turned up tip<br />
Â· Insufficiently projected tip<br />
Â· Asymmetric tip<br /></p>
<p><b>Recovery</b></p>
<p><i>From Traditional Rhinoplasty</i> Recovery typically takes a couple of weeks before normal activities can be resumed. For the first week a splint is worn on the outside of the nose. Severe nasal congestion typically lasts one week to ten days. Bruising around the eyes and most of the swelling typically resolves in about two weeks. Strong pain medication and cool compresses are typically required. For six to seven weeks, eyeglasses must be secured in a manner that prevents them from resting on the nose. The final results can take up to a year to appear.</p>
<p><i>From Non Surgical Rhinoplasty</i> Most people return to work on the same day. The results are immediate. There is no significant swelling or pain. Sunglasses or heavy eyeglasses should be avoided for two weeks after the procedure, as the filler material becomes integrated into the skin of the nose.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Cosmetic Results</b></p>
<p><i>From Traditional Rhinoplasty</i> The results of traditional rhinoplasty are frequently good, but whether good or bad, theyâre always permanent. Surgical rhinoplasty can result in over- or under-correction, with potentially poor cosmetic outcomes. It can take a year for the final results to be visible. In the meantime, the look of the patientâs nose may not be desirable and the end result can be hard to predict.</p>
<p><i>From Non-surgical Rhinoplasty</i> The injectable filler is used in small amounts and in precise locations. That gives the specialist total control over the shape and contours heâs creating. During the procedure the patient is typically asked to look at their nose and provide feedback, giving the patient control over the end result as well.</p>
<p>Results are immediate and last a year to a year and a half. Because theyâre temporary, adjustments can be made as the patientâs face changes over time and they always retain a natural look.</p>
<p><b>An Artistic Aspect</b> Injection rhinoplasty doesnât drastically alter the size of the nose, but subtly changes its proportions, removing any noticeable feature such as a bump, hollow or twist. In the absence of those noticeable features, when the nose is more straight and symmetrical, it harmonizes better with the rest of the face, blending in and appearing smaller.</p>
<p>As we age, our face changes. The short-term nature of non-surgical nose jobs becomes a distinct advantage then, because it can be done slightly differently as time passes, so as to best complement the rest of the face.</p>
<p><b>What is the Cost?</b><br />
Typically, around $1000.</p>

Capital Punishment was formed on November 20th 2001. It was created by Alex Hooah in conjuction with <i>Ekl</i> and was a Mya Butt creation. Capital Punishment is a fusion of the slowmoving waltzes of the 1800s and the fast moving, headbanging punishment of deathmetal. The group was formed in Mexico City drawing from the experimental sounds of the nomadic desert bands that would wander the country playing for money and beer. The band includes a melotron, a tuba, fifteen violins and a vocalist as well as a cocophany of percussionists on native metal drums. The band is known for it's energetic performances that often include playing without any clothes on and calling upon their God "Abraxas"to appear in it's wolf form.</p>

<p>Probably there is no one who has been duped at least once in a life time. But can the whole world be duped? This may seem impossible. But in the matter of Indian and world history the world can be duped in many respects for hundreds of years and still continues to be duped. The world famous Taj mahal is a glaring instance. For all the time, money and energy that people over the world spend in visiting the Taj mahal, they are dished out of concoction. Contrary to what visitors are made to believe the Taj mahal is not a Islamic mausoleum but an ancient Shiva Temple known as Tejo Mahalaya which the 5th generation mughal emperor Shah-Jahan commandeered from the then Maharaja of Jaipur. The Taj mahal, should therefore, be viewed as a temple palace and not as a tomb. That makes a vast difference. You miss the details of its size, grandeur, majesty and beauty when you take it to be a mere tomb. When told that you are visiting a temple palace you wont fail to notice its annexes, ruined defensive walls, hillocks, moats, cascades, fountains, majestic garden, hundreds of rooms archaded verendahs, terraces, multi stored towers, secret sealed chambers, guest rooms, stables, the trident (Trishul) pinnacle on the dome and the sacred, esoteric Hindu letter "OM" carved on the exterior of the wall of the sanctum sanctorum now occupied by the centotaphs. For detailed proof of this breath taking discovery, you may read the well known historian Shri. P. N. Oak's celebrated book titled " Taj Mahal: The True Story". But let us place before you, for the time being an exhaustive summary of the massive evidence ranging over hundred points:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1. The term Taj mahal itself never occurs in any mogul court paper or chronicle even in Aurangzeb's time. The attempt to explain it away as Taj-i-mahal is therefore, ridiculous.</p>
<p>2. The ending "Mahal" is never Muslim because in none of the Muslim countries around the world from Afghanistan to Algeria is there a building known as "Mahal".</p>
<p>3. The unusual explanation of the term Taj mahal derives from Mumtaz Mahal, who is buried in it, is illogical in at least two respects viz., firstly her name was never Mumtaj Mahal but Mumtaz-ul-Zamani and secondly one cannot omit the first three letters "Mum" from a woman's name to derive the remainder as the name of the building.</p>
<p>4. Since the lady's name was Mumtaz (ending with 'Z') the name of the building derived from her should have been Taz Mahal, if at all, and not Taj (spelled with a 'J').</p>
<p>5. Several European visitors of Shahjahan's time allude to the building as Taj-e-Mahal is almost the correct tradition, age old Sanskrit name Tej-o-Mahalaya, signifying a Shiva temple. Contrarily Shah-Jahan and Aurangzeb scrupulously avoid using the Sanskrit term and call it just a holy grave.</p>
<p>6. The tomb should be understood to signify NOT A BUILDING but only the grave or centotaph inside it. This would help people to realize that all dead Muslim courtiers and royalty including Humayun, Akbar, Mumtaz, Etmad-ud-Daula and Safdarjang have been buried in capture Hindu mansions and temples.</p>
<p>7. Moreover, if the Taj is believed to be a burial place, how can the term Mahal, i.e., mansion apply to it?</p>
<p>8. Since the term Taj Mahal does not occur in mogul courts it is absurd to search for any mogul explanation for it. Both its components namely, 'Taj' and' Mahal' are of Sanskrit origin.</p>
<p><b>TEMPLE TRADITION</b></p>
<p>9. The term Taj Mahal is a corrupt form of the Sanskrit term TejoMahalay signifying a Shiva Temple. Agreshwar Mahadev i.e., The Lord of Agra was consecrated in it.</p>
<p>10.The tradition of removing the shoes before climbing the marble platform originates from pre Shah-Jahan times when the Taj was a Shiva Temple. Had the Taj originated as a tomb, shoes need not have to be removed because shoes are a necessity in a cemetery.</p>
<p>11.Visitors may notice that the base slab of the centotaph is the marble basement in plain white while its superstructure and the other three centotaphs on the two floors are covered with inlaid creeper designs. This indicates that the marble pedestal of the Shiva idol is still in place and Mumtaz's centotaphs are fake.</p>
<p>12.The pitchers carved inside the upper border of the marble lattice plus those mounted on it number 108-a number sacred in Hindu Temple tradition.</p>
<p>13.There are persons who are connected with the repair and the maintainance of the Taj who have seen the ancient sacred Shiva Linga and other idols sealed in the thick walls and in chambers in the secret, sealed red stone stories below the marble basement. The Archaeological Survey of India is keeping discretely, politely and diplomatically silent about it to the point of dereliction of its own duty to probe into hidden historical evidence.</p>
<p>14.In India there are 12 Jyotirlingas i.e., the outstanding Shiva Temples. The Tejomahalaya alias The Taj mahal appears to be one of them known as Nagnatheshwar since its parapet is girdled with Naga, i.e., Cobra figures. Ever since Shahjahan's capture of it the sacred temple has lost its Hindudom.</p>
<p>15.The famous Hindu treatise on architecture titled Vishwakarma Vastushastra mentions the 'Tej-Linga' amongst the Shivalingas i.e., the stone emblems of Lord Shiva, the Hindu deity. Such a Tej Linga was consecrated in the Taj Mahal, hence the term Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya.</p>
<p>16.Agra city, in which the Taj Mahal is located, is an ancient centre of Shiva worship. Its orthodox residents have through ages continued the tradition of worshipping at five Shiva shrines before taking the last meal every night especially during the month of Shravan. During the last few centuries the residents of Agra had to be content with worshipping at only four prominent Shiva temples viz., Balkeshwar, Prithvinath, Manakameshwar and Rajarajeshwar. They had lost track of the fifth Shiva deity which their forefathers worshipped. Apparently the fifth was Agreshwar Mahadev Nagnatheshwar i.e., The Lord Great God of Agra, The Deity of the King of Cobras, consecrated in the Tejomahalay alias Taj mahal.</p>
<p>17.The people who dominate the Agra region are Jats. Their name of Shiva is Tejaji. The Jat special issue of The Illustrated Weekly of India (June 28,1971) mentions that the Jats have the Teja Mandirs i.e., Teja Temples. This is because Teja-Linga is among the several names of the Shiva Lingas. From this it is apparent that the Taj-Mahal is Tejo-Mahalaya, The Great Abode of Tej.</p>
<p><b>DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</b></p>
<p>18. Shahjahan's own court chronicle, the Badshahnama, admits (page 403, vol 1) that a grand mansion of unique splendor, capped with a dome (Imaarat-a-Alishan wa Gumbaze) was taken from the Jaipur Maharaja Jaisigh for Mumtaz's burial, and the building was known as Raja Mansingh's palace.</p>
<p>19. The plaque put the archealogy department outside the Taj mahal describes the edifice as a mausoleum built by Shah-Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal , over 22 years from 1631 to 1653. That plaque is a specimen of historical bungling. Firstly, the plaque sites no authority for its claim. Secondly the lady's name was Mumtaz-ul-Zamani and not Mumtazmahal. Thirdly, the period of 22 years is taken from some mumbo jumbo noting by an unreliable French visitor Tavernier, to the exclusion of all Muslim versions, which is an absurdity.</p>
<p>20. Prince Aurangzeb's letter to his father,emperor Shahjahan,is recorded in at least three chronicles titled `Aadaab-e-Alamgiri', `Yadgarnama', and the `Muruqqa-i-Akbarabadi' (edited by Said Ahmed, Agra, 1931, page 43, footnote 2). In that letter Aurangzeb records in 1652 A.D itself that the several buildings in the fancied burial place of Mumtaz were seven storeyed and were so old that they were all leaking, while the dome had developed a crack on the northern side.Aurangzeb, therefore, ordered immediate repairs to the buildings at his own expense while recommending to the emperor that more elaborate repairs be carried out later. This is the proof that during Shahjahan's reign itself that the Taj complex was so old as to need immediate repairs.</p>
<p>21. The ex-Maharaja of Jaipur retains in his secret personal `Kapad Dwara' collection two orders from Shah-Jahan dated Dec 18, 1633 (bearing modern nos. R.176 and 177) requestioning the Taj building complex. That was so blatant a usurpation that the then ruler of Jaipur was ashamed to make the document public.</p>
<p>22. The Rajasthan State archives at Bikaner preserve three other firmans addressed by Shah-Jahan to the Jaipur's ruler Jaising ordering the latter to supply marble (for Mumtaz's grave and koranic grafts) from his Makranna quarris, and stone cutters. Jaisingh was apparently so enraged at the blatant seizure of the Taj mahal that he refused to oblige Shah-Jahan by providing marble for grafting koranic engravings and fake centotaphs for further desecration of the Taj mahal. Jaising looked at Shahjahan's demand for marble and stone cutters, as an insult added to injury. Therefore, he refused to send any marble and instead detained the stone cutters in his protective custody.</p>
<p>23. The three firmans demanding marble were sent to Jaisingh within about two years of Mumtaz's death. Had Shah-Jahan really built the Taj mahal over a period of 22 years, the marble would have needed only after 15 or 20 years not immediately after Mumtaz's death.</p>
<p>24. Moreover, the three mention neither the Taj mahal, nor Mumtaz, nor the burial. The cost and the quantity of the stone also are not mentioned. This proves that an insignificant quantity of marble was needed just for some supercial tinkering and tampering with the Taj mahal. Even otherwise Shah-Jahan could never hope to build a fabulous Taj mahal by abject dependence for marble on a non cooperative Jaisingh.</p>
<p><b>EUROPEAN VISITOR'S ACCOUNTS</b></p>
<p>25. Tavernier, a French jeweller has recorded in his travel memoirs that Shah-Jahan purposely buried Mumtaz near the Taz-i-Makan (i.e.,`The Taj building') where foriegners used to come as they do even today so that the world may admire. He also adds that the cost of the scaffolding was more than that of the entire work. The work that Shah-Jahan commissioned in the Tejo-mahalaya Shiva temple was plundering at the costly fixtures inside it, uprooting the Shiva idols, planting the centotaphs in their place on two stories, inscribing the koran along the arches and walling up six of the seven stories of the Taj. It was this plunder, desecrating and plunderring of the rooms which took 22 years.</p>
<p>26. Peter Mundy, an English visitor to Agra recorded in 1632 (within only a year of Mumtaz's death) that `the places of note in and around Agra, included Taj-e-Mahal's tomb, gardens and bazaars'.He, therefore, confirms that that the Taj mahal had been a noteworthy building even before Shah-Jahan.</p>
<p>27. De Laet, a Dutch official has listed Mansingh's palace about a mile from Agra fort, as an outstanding building of pre shahjahan's time. Shahjahan's court chronicle, the Badshahnama records, Mumtaz's burial in the same Mansingh's palace.</p>
<p>28. Bernier, a contemporary French visitor has noted that non muslim's were barred entry into the basement (at the time when Shah-Jahan requisitioned Mansingh's palace) which contained a dazzling light. Obviously, he reffered to the silver doors, gold railing, the gem studded lattice and strings of pearl hanging over Shiva's idol. Shah-Jahan comandeered the building to grab all the wealth, making Mumtaz's death a convineant pretext.</p>
<p>29. Johan Albert Mandelslo, who describes life in agra in 1638 (only 7 years after mumtaz's death) in detail (in his `Voyages and Travels to West-Indies', published by John Starkey and John Basset, London), makes no mention of the Taj mahal being under constuction though it is commonly erringly asserted or assumed that the Taj was being built from 1631 to 1653.</p>
<p><b>SANSKIRT INSCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>30. A Sanskrit inscription too supports the conclusion that the Taj originated as a Shiva temple. Wrongly termed as the Bateshwar inscription (currently preserved on the top floor of the Lucknow museum), it refers to the raising of a "crystal white Shiva temple so alluring that Lord Shiva once enshrined in it decided never to return to Mount Kailash his usual abode". That inscription dated 1155 A.D. was removed from the Taj mahal garden at Shahjahan's orders. Historicians and Archeaologists have blundered in terming the insription the `Bateshwar inscription' when the record doesn't say that it was found by Bateshwar. It ought, in fact, to be called `The Tejomahalaya inscription' because it was originally installed in the Taj garden before it was uprooted and cast away at Shahjahan's command. A clue to the tampering by Shah-Jahan is found on pages 216-217, vol. 4, of Archealogiical Survey of India Reports (published 1874) stating that a "great square black balistic pillar which, with the base and capital of another pillar....now in the grounds of Agra,...it is well known, once stood in the garden of Taj mahal".</p>
<p><b>MISSING ELEPHANTS</b></p>
<p>31. Far from the building of the Taj, Shah-Jahan disfigured it with black koranic lettering and heavily robbed it of its Sanskrit inscription, several idols and two huge stone elephants extending their trunks in a welcome arch over the gateway where visitors these days buy entry tickets. An Englishman, Thomas Twinning, records (pg.191 of his book "Travels in India A Hundred Years ago") that in November 1794 "I arrived at the high walls which enclose the Taj-e-Mahal and its circumjacent buildings. I here got out of the palanquine and.....mounted a short flight of steps leading to a beautiful portal which formed the centre of this side of the `COURT OF ELEPHANTS" as the great area was called."</p>
<p><b>KORANIC PATCHES</b></p>
<p>32. The Taj Mahal is scrawled over with 14 chapters of the Koran but nowhere is there even the slightest or the remotest allusion in that Islamic overwriting to Shahjahan's authorship of the Taj. Had Shah-Jahan been the builder he would have said so in so many words before beginning to quote Koran.</p>
<p>33. That Shah-Jahan, far from building the marble Taj, only disfigured it with black lettering is mentioned by the inscriber Amanat Khan Shirazi himself in an inscription on the building. A close scrutiny of the Koranic lettering reveals that they are grafts patched up with bits of variegated stone on an ancient Shiva temple.</p>
<p><b>CARBON 14 TEST</b></p>
<p>34. A wooden piece from the riverside doorway of the Taj subjected to the carbon 14 test by an American Laboratory, has revealed that the door to be 300 years older than Shah-Jahan, since the doors of the Taj, broken open by Muslim invaders repeatedly from the 11th century onwards, had to b replaced from time to time. The Taj edifice is much more older. It belongs to 1155 A.D, i.e., almost 500 years anterior to Shah-Jahan.</p>
<p><b>ARCHITECHTURAL EVIDENCE</b></p>
<p>35. Well known Western authorities on architecture like E. B. Havell, Mrs. Kenoyer and Sir W. W. Hunter have gone on record to say that the Taj Mahal is built in the Hindu temple style. Havell points out the ground plan of the ancient Hindu Chandi Seva Temple in Java is identical with that of the Taj.</p>
<p>36. A central dome with cupolas at its four corners is a universal feature of Hindu temples.</p>
<p>37. The four marble pillars at the plinth corners are of the Hindu style. They are used as lamp towers during night and watch towers during the day. Such towers serve to demarcate the holy precincts. Hindu wedding altars and the altar set up for God Satyanarayan worship have pillars raised at the four corners.</p>
<p>38. The octagonal shape of the Taj mahal has a special Hindu significance because Hindus alone have special names for the eight directions, and celestial guards assigned to them. The pinnacle points to the heaven while the foundation signifies to the nether world. Hindu forts, cities, palaces and temples genrally have an octagonal layout or some octagonal features so that together with the pinnacle and the foundation they cover all the ten directions in which the king or God holds sway, according to Hindu belief.</p>
<p>39. The Taj mahal has a trident pinncle over the dome. A full scale of the trident pinnacle is inlaid in the red stone courtyard to the east of the Taj. The central shaft of the trident depicts a "Kalash" (sacred pot) holding two bent mango leaves and a coconut. This is a sacred Hindu motif. Identical pinnacles have been seen over Hindu and Buddhist temples in the Himalayan region. Tridents are also depicted against a red lotus background at the apex of the stately marble arched entrances on all four sides of the Taj. People fondly but mistakenly believed all these centuries that the Taj pinnacle depicts a Islamic cresent and star was a lighting conductor installed by the British rulers in India. Contrarily, the pinnacle is a marvel of Hindu metallurgy since the pinnacle made of non rusting alloy, is also perhaps a lightning deflector. That the pinnacle of the replica is drawn in the eastern courtyard is significant because the east is of special importance to the Hindus, as the direction in which the sun rises. The pinnacle on the dome has the word `Allah' on it after capture. The pinnacle figure on the ground does not have the word Allah.</p>
<p><b>INCONSISTENCIES</b></p>
<p>40. The two buildings which face the marble Taj from the east and west are identical in design, size and shape and yet the eastern building is explained away by Islamic tradition, as a community hall while the western building is claimed to be a mosque. How could buildings meant for radically different purposes be identical? This proves that the western building was put to use as a mosque after seizure of the Taj property by Shah-Jahan. Curiously enough the building being explained away as a mosque has no minaret. They form a pair of reception pavilions of the Tejomahalaya temple palace.</p>
<p>41. A few yards away from the same flank is the Nakkar Khana alias DrumHouse which is a intolerable incongruity for Islam. The proximity of the Drum House indicates that the western annex was not originally a mosque. Contrarily a drum house is a neccesity in a Hindu temple or palace because Hindu chores, in the morning and evening, begin to the sweet strains of music.</p>
<p>42. The embossed patterns on the marble exterior of the centotaph chamber wall are foilage of the conch shell design and the Hindu letter "OM". The octagonally laid marble lattices inside the centotaph chamber depict pink lotuses on their top railing. The Lotus, the conch and the OM are the sacred motifs associated with the Hindu deities and temples.</p>
<p>43. The spot occupied by Mumtaz's centotaph was formerly occupied by the Hindu Teja Linga a lithic representation of Lord Shiva. Around it are five perambulatory passages. Perambulation could be done around the marble lattice or through the spacious marble chambers surrounding the centotaph chamber, and in the open over the marble platform. It is also customary for the Hindus to have apertures along the perambulatory passage, overlooking the deity. Such apertures exist in the perambulatories in the Taj mahal.</p>
<p>44. The sanctom sanctorum in the Taj has silver doors and gold railings as Hindu temples have. It also had nets of pearl and gems stuffed in the marble lattices. It was the lure of this wealth which made Shah-Jahan commandeer the Taj from a helpless vassal Jaisingh, the then ruler of Jaipur.</p>
<p>45. Peter Mundy, a Englishman records (in 1632, within a year of Mumtaz's death) having seen a gem studded gold railing around her tomb. Had the Taj been under construction for 22 years, a costly gold railing would not have been noticed by Peter mundy within a year of Mumtaz's death. Such costly fixtures are installed in a building only after it is ready for use. This indicates that Mumtaz's centotaph was grafted in place of the Shivalinga in the centre of the gold railings. Subsequently the gold railings, silver doors, nets of pearls, gem fillings etc. were all carried away to Shahjahan's treasury. The seizure of the Taj thus constituted an act of highhanded Mughal robery causing a big row between Shah-Jahan and Jaisingh.</p>
<p>46. In the marble flooring around Mumtaz's centotaph may be seen tiny mosaic patches. Those patches indicate the spots where the support for the gold railings were embedded in the floor. They indicate a rectangular fencing.</p>
<p>47. Above Mumtaz's centotaph hangs a chain by which now hangs a lamp. Before capture by Shah-Jahan the chain used to hold a water pitcher from which water used to drip on the Shivalinga.</p>
<p>48. It is this earlier Hindu tradition in the Taj mahal which gave the Islamic myth of Shahjahan's love tear dropping on Mumtaz's tomb on the full moon day of the winter eve.</p>
<p><b>TREASURY WELL</b></p>
<p>49. Between the so-called mosque and the drum house is a multi-storey octagonal well with a flight of stairs reaching down to the water level. This is a traditional treasury well in Hindu temple palaces. Treasure chests used to be kept in the lower apartments while treasury personnel had their offices in the upper chambers. The circular stairs made it difficult for intruders to reach down to the treasury or to escape with it undetected or unparsed. In case the premises had to be surrendered to a besieging enemy the treasure could be pushed into the well to remain hidden from the conqueror and remain safe for salvaging if the place was reconquered. Such an elaborate multi-storey well is superfluous for a mere mausoleum. Such a grand, gigantic well is unnecessary for a tomb.</p>
<p><b>BURIAL DATE UNKNOWN</b></p>
<p>50. Had Shah-Jahan really built the Taj Mahal as a wonder mausoleum, history would have recorded a specific date on which she was ceremoniously buried in the Taj Mahal. No such date is ever mentioned. This important missing detail decisively exposes the falsity of the Taj mahal legend.</p>
<p>51. Even the year of Mumtaz's death is unknown. It is variously speculated to be 1629, 1630, 1631 or 1632. Had she deserved a fabulous burial, as is claimed, the date of her death had not been a matter of much speculation. In a harem teeming with 5000 women it was difficult to keep track of dates of death. Apparently the date of Mumtaz's death was so insignificant an event, as not to merit any special notice. Who would then build a Taj for her burial?</p>
<p><b>BASELESS LOVE STORIES</b></p>
<p>52. Stories of Shahjahan's exclusive infatuation for Mumtaz's are concoctions. They have no basis in history nor has any book ever written on their fancied love affairs. Those stories have been invented as an afterthought to make Shahjahan's authorship of the Taj look plausible.</p>
<p><b>COST</b></p>
<p>53. The cost of the Taj is nowhere recorded in Shahjahan's court papers because Shah-Jahan never built the Taj mahal. That is why wild estimates of the cost by gullible writers have ranged from 4 million to 91.7 million rupees.</p>
<p><b>PERIOD OF CONSTRUCTION</b></p>
<p>54. Likewise the period of construction has been guessed to be anywhere between 10 years and 22 years. There would have not been any scope for guesswork had the building construction been on record in the court papers.</p>
<p><b>ARCHITECTS</b></p>
<p>55. The designer of the Taj mahal is also variously mentioned as Essa Effendy, a Persian or Turk, or Ahmed Mehendis or a Frenchman, Austin deBordeaux, or Geronimo Veroneo, an Italian, or Shah-Jahan himself.</p>
<p><b>RECORDS DON'T EXIST</b></p>
<p>56. Twenty thousand labourers are supposed to have worked for 22 years during Shahjahan's reign in building the Taj mahal. Had this been true, there should have been available in Shahjahan's court papers design drawings, heaps of labour muster rolls, daily expenditure sheets, bills and receipts of material ordered, and commisioning orders. There is not even a scrap of paper of this kind.</p>
<p>57. It is, therefore, court flatterers, blundering historians, somnolent archaeologists, fiction writers, senile poets, careless tourists officials and erring guides who are responsible for hustling the world into believing in Shahjahan's mythical authorship of the Taj.</p>
<p>58. Description of the gardens around the Taj of Shahjahan's time mention Ketaki, Jai, Jui, Champa, Maulashree, Harshringar and Bel. All these are plants whose flowers or leaves are used in the worship of Hindu deities. Bel leaves are exclusively used in Lord Shiva's worship. A graveyard is planted only with shady trees because the idea of using fruit and flower from plants in a cemetary is abhorrent to human conscience. The presence of Bel and other flower plants in the Taj garden is proof of its having been a Shiva temple before seizure by Shah-Jahan.</p>
<p>59. Hindu temples are often built on river banks and sea beaches. The Taj is one such built on the bank of the Yamuna river an ideal location for a Shiva temple.</p>
<p>60. Prophet Mohammad has ordained that the burial spot of a Muslim should be inconspicous and must not be marked by even a single tombstone. In flagrant violation of this, the Tajamhal has one grave in the basement and another in the first floor chamber both ascribed to Mumtaz. Those two centotaphs were infact erected by Shah-Jahan to bury the two tier Shivalingas that were consecrated in the Taj. It is customary for Hindus to install two Shivalingas one over the other in two stories as may be seen in the Mahankaleshwar temple in Ujjain and the Somnath temple raised by Ahilyabai in Somnath Pattan.</p>
<p>61. The Taj mahal has identical entrance arches on all four sides. This is a typical Hindu building style known as Chaturmukhi, i.e.,four faced.</p>
<p><b>THE HINDU DOME</b></p>
<p>62. The Taj mahal has a reverberating dome. Such a dome is an absurdity for a tomb which must ensure peace and silence. Contrarily reverberating domes are a neccesity in Hindu temples because they create an ecstatic dinmultiplying and magnifying the sound of bells, drums and pipes accompanying the worship of Hindu deities.</p>
<p>63. The Taj mahal dome bears a lotus cap. Original Islamic domes have a bald top as is exemplified by the Pakistan Embassy in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, and the domes in the Pakistan's newly built capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>64. The Taj mahal entrance faces south. Had the Taj been an Islamic building it should have faced the west.</p>
<p><b>TOMB IS THE GRAVE, NOT THE BUILDING</b></p>
<p>65. A widespread misunderstanding has resulted in mistaking the building for the grave. Invading Islam raised graves in captured buildings in every country it overran. Therefore, hereafter people must learn not to confound the building with the grave mounds which are grafts in conquered buildings. This is true of the Taj mahal too. One may therefore admit (for arguments sake) that Mumtaz lies buried inside the Taj. But that should not be construed to mean that the Taj was raised over Mumtaz's grave.</p>
<p>66. The Taj is a seven storied building. Prince Aurangzeb also mentions this in his letter to Shah-Jahan. The marble edifice comprises four stories including the lone, tall circular hall inside the top, and the lone chamber in the basement. In between are two floors each containing 12 to 15 palatial rooms. Below the marble plinth reaching down to the river at the rear are two more stories in red stone. They may be seen from the river bank. The seventh storey must be below the ground (river) level since every ancient Hindu building had a subterranian storey.</p>
<p>67. Immediately bellow the marble plinth on the river flank are 22 rooms in red stone with their ventilators all walled up by Shah-Jahan. Those rooms, made uninhibitably by Shah-Jahan, are kept locked by Archealogy Department of India. The lay visitor is kept in the dark about them. Those 22 rooms still bear ancient Hindu paint on their walls and ceilings. On their side is a nearly 33 feet long corridor. There are two door frames one at either end of the corridor. But those doors are intriguingly sealed with brick and lime.</p>
<p>68. Apparently those doorways originally sealed by Shah-Jahan have been since unsealed and again walled up several times. In 1934 a resident of Delhi took a peep inside from an opening in the upper part of the doorway. To his dismay he saw huge hall inside. It contained many statues huddled around a central beheaded image of Lord Shiva. It could be that, in there, are Sanskrit inscriptions too. All the seven stories of the Taj mahal need to be unsealed and scoured to ascertain what evidence they may be hiding in the form of Hindu images, Sanskrit inscriptions, scriptures, coins and utensils.</p>
<p>69. Apart from Hindu images hidden in the sealed stories it is also learnt that Hindu images are also stored in the massive walls of the Taj. Between 1959 and 1962 when Mr. S.R. Rao was the Archealogical Superintendent in Agra, he happened to notice a deep and wide crack in the wall of the central octagonal chamber of the Taj. When a part of the wall was dismantled to study the crack out popped two or three marble images. The matter was hushed up and the images were reburied where they had been embedded at Shahjahan's behest. Confirmation of this has been obtained from several sources. It was only when I began my investigation into the antecedents of the Taj I came across the above information which had remained a forgotten secret. What better proof is needed of the Temple origin of the Taj mahal? Its walls and sealed chambers still hide in Hindu idols that were consecrated in it before Shahjahan's seizure of the Taj.</p>
<p><b>PRE-SHAH-JAHAN REFERENCES TO THE TAJ</b></p>
<p>70. Apparently the Taj as a central palace seems to have a chequered history. The Taj was perhaps desecrated and looted by every Muslim invader from Mohammad Ghazni onwards but passing into Hindu hands off and on, the sanctity of the Taj as a Shiva temple continued to be revived after every Muslim onslaught. Shah-Jahan was the last Muslim to desecrate the Taj mahal alias Tejomahalay.</p>
<p>71. Vincent Smith records in his book titled `Akbar the Great Mughal' that `Babur's turbulent life came to an end in his garden palace in Agra in 1630'. That palace was none other than the Taj mahal. 72. Babur's daughter Gulbadan Begum in her chronicle titled `Humayun Nama' refers to the Taj as the Mystic House.</p>
<p>73. Babur himself refers to the Taj in his memoirs as the palace captured by Ibrahim Lodi containing a central octagonal chamber and having pillars on the four sides. All these historical references allude to the Taj 100 years before Shah-Jahan.</p>
<p>74. The Taj mahal precincts extend to several hundred yards in all directions. Across the river are ruins of the annexes of the Taj, the bathing ghats and a jetty for the ferry boat. In the Victoria gardens outside covered with creepers is the long spur of the ancient outer wall ending in an octagonal red stone tower. Such extensive grounds all magnificently done are a superfluity for a grave.</p>
<p>75. Had the Taj been specially built to bury Mumtaz, it should not have been cluttered with other graves. But the Taj premises contain several graves atleast in its eastern and southern pavilions.</p>
<p>76. In the southern flank, on the other side of the Tajganj gate are buried in identical pavilions queens Sarhandi Begum, and Fatehpuri Begum and a maid Satunnisa Khanum. Such parity burial can be justified only if the queens had been demoted or the maid promoted. But since Shah-Jahan had commandeered (not built) the Taj, he reduced it general to a Muslim cemetary as was the habit of all his Islamic predeccssors, and buried a queen in a vacant pavillion and a maid in another idenitcal pavilion.</p>
<p>77. Shah-Jahan was married to several other women before and after Mumtaz. She, therefore, deserved no special consideration in having a wonder mausoleum built for her.</p>
<p>78. Mumtaz was a commoner by birth and so she did not qualify for a fairyland burial.</p>
<p>79. Mumtaz died in Burhanpur which is about 600 miles from Agra. Her grave there is intact. Therefore ,the centotaphs raised in stories of the Taj in her name seem to be fakes hiding in Hindu Shiva emblems.</p>
<p>80. Shah-Jahan seems to have simulated Mumtaz's burial in Agra to find a pretext to surround the temple palace with his fierce and fanatic troops and remove all the costly fixtures in his treasury. This finds confirmation in the vague noting in the Badshahnama which says that the Mumtaz's (exhumed) body was brought to Agra from Burhanpur and buried `next year'. An official term would not use a nebulous term unless it is to hide some thing.</p>
<p>81. A pertinent consideration is that a Shah-Jahan who did not build any palaces for Mumtaz while she was alive, would not build a fabulous mausoleum for a corpse which was no longer kicking or clicking.</p>
<p>82. Another factor is that Mumtaz died within two or three years of Shah-Jahan becoming an emperor. Could he amass so much superfluous wealth in that short span as to squander it on a wonder mausoleum?</p>
<p>83. While Shahjahan's special attachment to Mumtaz is nowhere recorded in history his amorous affairs with many other ladies from maids to mannequins including his own daughter Jahanara, find special attention in accounts of Shahjahan's reign. Would Shah-Jahan shower his hard earned wealth on Mumtaz's corpse?</p>
<p>84. Shah-Jahan was a stingy, usurious monarch. He came to throne murdering all his rivals. He was not therefore, the doting spendthrift that he is made out to be.</p>
<p>85. A Shah-Jahan disconsolate on Mumtaz's death is suddenly credited with a resolve to build the Taj. This is a psychological incongruity. Grief is a disabling, incapacitating emotion.</p>
<p>86. A infatuated Shah-Jahan is supposed to have raised the Taj over the dead Mumtaz, but carnal, physical sexual love is again an incapacitating emotion. A womaniser is ipso facto incapable of any constructive activity. When carnal love becomes uncontrollable the person either murders somebody or commits suicide. He cannot raise a Taj mahal. A building like the Taj invariably originates in an ennobling emotion like devotion to God, to one's mother and mother country or power and glory.</p>
<p>87. Early in the year 1973, chance digging in the garden in front of the Taj revealed another set of fountains about six feet below the present fountains. This proved two things. Firstly, the subterranean fountains were there before Shah-Jahan laid the surface fountains. And secondly that those fountains are aligned to the Taj that edifice too is of pre Shah-Jahan origin. Apparently the garden and its fountains had sunk from annual monsoon flooding and lack of maintenance for centuries during the Islamic rule.</p>
<p>89. The stately rooms on the upper floor of the Taj mahal have been striped of their marble mosaic by Shah-Jahan to obtain matching marble for raising fake tomb stones inside the Taj premises at several places. Contrasting with the rich finished marble ground floor rooms the striping of the marble mosaic covering the lower half of the walls and flooring of the upper storey have given those rooms a naked, robbed look. Since no visitors are allowed entry to the upper storey this despoliation by Shah-Jahan has remained a well guarded secret. There is no reason why Shahjahan's loot of the upper floor marble should continue to be hidden from the public even after 200 years of termination of Mughal rule.</p>
<p>90. Bernier, the French traveller has recorded that no non Muslim was allowed entry into the secret nether chambers of the Taj because there are some dazzling fixtures there. Had those been installed by Shah-Jahan they should have been shown the public as a matter of pride. But since it was commandeered Hindu wealth which Shah-Jahan wanted to remove to his treasury, he didn't want the public to know about it.</p>
<p>91. The approach to Taj is dotted with hillocks raised with earth dugout from foundation trenches. The hillocks served as outer defences of the Taj building complex. Raising such hillocks from foundation earth is a common Hindu device of hoary origin. Nearby Bharatpur provides a graphic parallel. Peter Mundy has recorded that Shah-Jahan employed thousands of labourers to level some of those hillocks. This is a graphic proof of the Taj mahal existing before Shah-Jahan.</p>
<p>93. At the backside of the river bank is a Hindu crematorium, several palaces, Shiva temples and bathings of ancient origin. Had Shah-Jahan built the Taj mahal, he would have destroyed the Hindu features.</p>
<p>94. The story that Shah-Jahan wanted to build a Black marble Taj across the river, is another motivated myth. The ruins dotting the other side of the river are those of Hindu structures demolished during Muslim invasions and not the plinth of another Taj mahal. Shah-Jahan who did not even build the white Taj mahal would hardly ever think of building a black marble Taj. He was so miserly that he forced labourers to work gratis even in the superficial tampering necessary to make a Hindu temple serve as a Muslim tomb.</p>
<p>95. The marble that Shah-Jahan used for grafting Koranic lettering in the Taj is of a pale white shade while the rest of the Taj is built of a marble with rich yellow tint. This disparity is proof of the Koranic extracts being a superimposition.</p>
<p>96. Though imaginative attempts have been made by some historians to foist some fictitious name on history as the designer of the Taj others more imaginative have credited Shajahan himself with superb architectural proficiency and artistic talent which could easily concieve and plan the Taj even in acute bereavement. Such people betray gross ignorance of history in as much as Shajahan was a cruel tyrant, a great womaniser and a drug and drink addict.</p>
<p>97. Fanciful accounts about Shah-Jahan commisioning the Taj are all confused. Some asserted that Shah-Jahan ordered building drawing from all over the world and chose one from among them. Others assert that a man at hand was ordered to design a mausoleum and his design was approved. Had any of those versions been true Shahjahan's court papers should have had thousands of drawings concerning the Taj. But there is not even a single drawing. This is yet another clinching proof that Shah-Jahan did not commision the Taj.</p>
<p>98. The Taj mahal is surrounded by huge mansions which indicate that several battles have been waged around the Taj several times.</p>
<p>99. At the south east corner of the Taj is an ancient royal cattle house. Cows attached to the Tejomahalay temple used to reared there. A cowshed is an incongruity in an Islamic tomb.</p>
<p>100. Over the western flank of the Taj are several stately red stone annexes. These are superflous for a mausoleum.</p>
<p>101. The entire Taj complex comprises of 400 to 500 rooms. Residential accomodation on such a stupendous scale is unthinkable in a mausoleum.</p>
<p>102. The neighbouring Tajganj township's massive protective wall also encloses the Taj mahal temple palace complex. This is a clear indication that the Tejomahalay temple palace was part and parcel of the township. Street of that township leads straight into the Taj mahal. The Tajganj gate is aligned in a perfect straight line to the octagonal red stone garden gate and the stately entrance arch of the Taj mahal. The Tajganj gate besides being central to the Taj temple complex, is also put on a pedestal. The western gate by which the visitors enter the Taj complex is a comparatively minor gateway. It has become the entry gate for most visitors today because the railway station and the bus station are on that side.</p>
<p>103. The Taj mahal has pleasure pavillions which a tomb would never have.</p>
<p>104. A tiny mirror glass in a gallery of the Red Fort in Agra reflects the Taj mahal. Shah-Jahan is said to have spent his last eight years of life as a prisoner in that gallery peering at the reflected Taj mahal and sighing in the name of Mumtaz. This myth is a blend of many falsehoods. Firstly, old Shajahan was held prisoner by his son Aurangzeb in the basement storey in the Fort and not in an open, fashionable upper storey. Secondly, the glass piece was fixed in the 1930's by Insha Allah Khan, a peon of the archaeology dept. just to illustrate to the visitors how in ancient times the entire apartment used to scintillate with tiny mirror pieces reflecting the Tejomahalay temple a thousand fold. Thirdly, an old decrepit Shah-Jahan with pain in his joints and cataract in his eyes, would not spend his day craning his neck at an awkward angle to peer into a tiny glass piece with bedimmed eyesight when he could as well his face around and have full, direct view of the Tjamahal itself. But the general public is so gullible as to gulp all such prattle of wily, unscrupulous guides.</p>
<p>105. That the Taj mahal dome has hundreds of iron rings sticking out of its exterior is a feature rarely noticed. These are made to hold Hindu earthen oil lamps for temple illumination.</p>
<p>106. Those putting implicit faith in Shah-Jahan authorship of the Taj have been imagining Shah-Jahan-Mumtaz to be a soft hearted romantic pair like Romeo and Juliet. But contemporary accounts speak of Shah-Jahan as a hard hearted ruler who was constantly egged on to acts of tyranny and cruelty, by Mumtaz.</p>
<p>107. School and College history carry the myth that Shah-Jahan reign was a golden period in which there was peace and plenty and that Shah-Jahan commissioned many buildings and patronized literature. This is pure fabrication. Shah-Jahan did not commission even a single building as we have illustrated by a detailed analysis of the Taj mahal legend. Shahjahn had to enrage in 48 military campaigns during a reign of nearly 30 years which proves that his was not a era of peace and plenty.</p>
<p>108. The interior of the dome rising over Mumtaz's centotaph has a representation of Sun and cobras drawn in gold. Hindu warriors trace their origin to the Sun. For an Islamic mausoleum the Sun is redundant. Cobras are always associated with Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>109. The Muslim caretakers of the tomb in the Taj mahal used to possess a document which they styled as "Tarikh-i-Tajmahal". Historian H.G. Keene has branded it as `a document of doubtful authenticity'. Keene was uncannily right since we have seen that Shah-Jahan not being the creator of the Taj mahal any document which credits Shahjahn with the Taj mahal, must be an outright forgery. Even that forged document is reported to have been smuggled out of Pakistan. Besides such forged documents there are whole chronicles on the Taj which are pure concoctions.</p>
<p>110. There is lot of sophistry and casuistry or atleast confused thinking associated with the Taj even in the minds of professional historians, archaeologists and architects. At the outset they assert that the Taj is entirely Muslim in design. But when it is pointed out that its lotus capped dome and the four corner pillars etc. are all entirely Hindu those worthies shift ground and argue that that was probably because the workmen were Hindu and were to introduce their own patterns. Both these arguments are wrong because Muslim accounts claim the designers to be Muslim, and the workers invariably carry out the employer's dictates.The Taj is only a typical illustration of how all historic buildings and townships from Kashmir to Cape Comorin though of Hindu origin have been ascribed to this or that Muslim ruler or courtier.</p>
<p>It is hoped that people the world over who study Indian history will awaken to this new finding and revise their erstwhile beliefs.</p>
