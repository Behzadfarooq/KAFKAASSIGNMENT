<li><b>Keep</b> This page just survived two very recent votes for deletion. It is inappropriate to list again so soon: nominator is basically saying that it should be listed again because the people in the last two votes did not vote as she/he wanted them to. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:26, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I for one don't consider two months and four months ago to be "very recent", and I don't consider the nominator's reasons for nominating the article a third time grounds for disregarding the content of the article, which is crufty to the max. Bad articles should <i>not</i> escape deletion because of technicalities. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 03:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, first, let me express that my 'Keep' also applies to the article itself. It is maintainable, noteworthy, and verifiable. It also has undergone lots of work from many editors. You honestly don't consider two months to be recent? Would you renominate articles that have already survived a AfD every two months? It would be one thing if the (unsigned) nominator presented new evidence, or someone how convinced us that the previous voting process was flawed, but they have done neither. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 13:58, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>You're right. The anonymous user has not provided any new reasons why the list should be deleted, so I'll have a go at it. Firstly, I don't think Nom 2 should be given any weight at all. The only rationale for keeping the list was that the article had been put up for deletion only a month previously. There has been no discussion of the merits of the article itself since August. If two months is stretching it, three months is surely OK. Secondly, as of now the vote stands at <b>15-9</b> in favour of deletion, which indicates that opinion has swung heavily since August. My guess is that my fellow Wikipedians are getting fed up with the proliferation of listcruft in Wikipedia and, in my view, rightly so. There's obviously strong opinions on both sides and I think there needs to be discussion about it. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 02:58, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this is an unsalvageable, pointless list.

<li><b>Delete</b> self-referentiality is too loose and slippery a property. "This is the story of. . ." means about the same thing as "Once upon a time", and neither falls into the same category as "you think this song is about you". While one could potentially do a survey of the songs falling into the latter group, WP is not the place to do so.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I just realized there's an institutional imbalance in the tension between Keepers and Deleters of Wikipedia articles. Someone can renominate an article for deletion over and over again, as long as there's some unspecified minimal delay between nominations, but if <i>one time</i>, the interested parties miss the vote window, the article is deleted and can <i>never</i> be recreated without being speedy-deletion bait. This means that anyone on a crusade to rid WP of controversial articles need only be persistent, and they're likely to win, whereas someone fighting to keep such an article loses forever with one negative vote. This troubles me. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 18:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It's not quite that bad. Sometimes deleted articles get recreated when more notable content is available, and are not necessarily speedied, or even deleted at all. Still, I <i>do</i> think it is somewhat cynical to renominate articles for deletion that have survived multiple prior rounds. It's a rare case (and not this one by a long shot) where the prior notability of a topic suddenly vanishes. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's not that bad <i>in practice</i>, but how would one necessarily know that anyway, given the current size of Wikipedia? Anyway, it doesn't change the principle. I know that if <i>I</i> were an admin here (I am at Wikiquote), I'd feel completely justified SDing such an article — perhaps even obligated to, since I might disagree with the original deletion and feel it necessary to SD per policy to ensure neutral policy practice. (Of course, WP is vastly larger than WQ, so perhaps admins don't feel similarly compelled here.) ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 19:03, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your observations make two mistakes. 1) they assume votes are partisan between two camps - they are not, many of us vote on merits not preconceptions. 2) if we are talking of 'institutional imbalance' then remember that the 70% threshhold for deletion (30% to keep) would be a greater conterbalance. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 19:15, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Doc, I'm sorry but I cannot follow your reasoning here, at all. (1) votes <i>are</i> "partisan" if you describe those parties as "those who vote delete on the merits" and "those who vote keep on the merits". Besides, I cannot see in what way JeffQ's argument relies on the "mistake" that votes are partisan. (2) Comparing the 30:70-thing with JeffQ's don't-keep-renominating-thing is comparing apples with fishwives. Surely it's obvious that your chances of getting a 70% vote on one occasion increase in proportion to the number of times you put the matter to the vote. For what it is worth, my view is that:
<ol>
<li>Broadly, editors should respect a keep consensus at AfD and not renominate articles they do not like in the hope of a more sympathetic crowd at AfD on the next occasion;</li>
<li>Wikipedians should be far more careful than usual in voting to delete pages like this one which are long-established and have attracted a lot of editors.</li>
</ol>

<dd>There is no clear way to separate "partisan" from "non-partisan", as anyone following politics can readily observe. Most passionate arguments stem from basic ideas that have some merit within a society; otherwise one or the other side would feel too uncomfortable to speak up. Many people who claim non-partisanship do so because they refuse to accept the other side as rational. Sometimes this is true, but usually it is emphatic rhetoric to demean opponents. Consider how dismissive and even mean some of the current votes here are ("obviously misconceptions", "stupidly unmaintainable", ridiculing with "ridiculous") and compare them to <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a> guidelines. (And what the heck is a "proto-Hornby"? I don't know whether the list editors should be flattered or insulted by this. It would have been nice if JJay had <i>taken advantage of the medium</i> and added a link to whatever was meant by this!&#160;:-) As for AndyJones's idea about respecting keep consensi, I agree in general but acknowledge that we should be able to renominate articles after <i>some</i> reasonable time, because situations and the mood of the community can change over time. But rapid-fire renomination is an abuse of the process. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 18:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
