<p><b>Delete</b>. I think that this article deals with someone who, while likely a very nice person, is not publically significant enough to justify a page on Wikipedia. Strelchik is a failed political candidate, and, according to the article, a rights activist in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornhill%2C_Ontario_5275.html" title="Thornhill, Ontario">Thornhill</a>. However, his article is so overwhelmingly for him, that it makes me dizzy. Whenever it is changed to make it at least somewhat neutral and acceptable, these edits are reverted. But even without this, there are many more 'important' people, and I use the word lightly, who are better suited to a page on this website. I even created this article, but now realize it was wrong. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">Theonlyedge</a> 22:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> Please do not keep. The Canadian House of Commons has 308 seats. The US House has 435. The Canadian election, in many ridings, had Conservatives, Liberals, NDPs and Greens, along with a variety of independents. The US has Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians pretty consistently, and a growing number of Greens, as well as a good crop of independents. A huge number of these candidates are running in the only election of their lives. Merely being on the ballot is not a sign of notability, and most of them will be forgotten after the election is over. Unless an individual has other notability, or made the campaign notable in some way, they should not have permanent articles. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not certain that he remains a director; he doesn't appear on the <a href="http://www.freethechildren.com/aboutus/theboard.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freethechildren.com/aboutus/theboard.htm" rel="nofollow">list of members of the Board of Directors</a>, and a search for his name on the Free the Children site returns only two <a href="http://www.freethechildren.com/sitesearch/search.php?zoom_query=Simon+Strelchik" class="external text" title="http://www.freethechildren.com/sitesearch/search.php?zoom_query=Simon+Strelchik" rel="nofollow">results</a>, each of which is actually in reference to Simon Fraser College. Nevertheless, his involvement does appear to be legitimate, at least inasmuch as both <a href="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=8301" class="external text" title="http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=8301" rel="nofollow">Canadian Jewish News</a> and the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/196/" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/196/" rel="nofollow">CBC</a> reference such involvement, although it's unclear whether either means to vouch for the information as independently verified or simply to recapitulate Strelchik's provided biography. I'm profoundly disinclined to doubt the information, but I wonder as to our sourcing; then again, if indeed he co-founded the organization at age 13, it's unlikely we'd get many Ghits apropos of that involvement. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>there are lots of connections as theonlyedge either being Alan Shefman himself or a sockpuppet of Pm shef, first the name "edge" is the same name as shefman's company, they both were attack the same oppenents and have info that only they would know, appears to be politicaly motivated. being from the vaughan area myself they both (if not the same person) have been doing similer practices outside of wikipedia.

<dd>I know you must be very frustrated with all the non-sense but the reason he originally wrote it had to do with 1) the federal election and 2) when the Alan Shefman article was up for deletion to show an opponent that he beat had an article. It is a real shame that the wike admins. don't have all the info. about this group. I don't think you realize, the non-sense that this group that the shefman's are in, causes here in vaughan. Mark my words, one day soon, you will read about a major scandal coming from Vaughan area politicians that not only include shefman but also there "king pins" De Biase, Kadis, Sorbara, Bevilaqua and there realife puppets, like shefman, ferri and many more</dd>

This AfD was nominated by theonlyedge and I see that pm_shef has not made a single appearance on this page.

<p>The Panteios University has history of 75 years. A history creative, ascendant course that was connected not only with the course of Maximum Education and the growth of Social Sciences in Greece, but also with the more widely social transformation in our country. It deserves for this sees no one closely how it was created initially as Faculty and how it developed until today. Two persons connected their name with the arrest of idea, the foundation and the first steps of Faculty. G.Fragkoy'dis, of synjdryti's Panteios University the one was the Cypriote Gew'rgjos P. Fragkoy'dis (1869-1939), that came from historical family of Lemesoy'. It legally studied in Athens and Political Sciences in Paris. Kosmogyrjsme'nos, afterwards his return in Greece dimosjografoy'se and poljteyo'tan. In December 1923 was elected attorney Athens and Piraeus. In in the National assembly he was head of team of reformers. It published a'llwste - with the Koytoy'pi - the newspaper the "Reform". Existed friend and collaborator of El. Venjze'loy and G. Papandreou. Al. Pa'ntos, donor and synjdryti's the Panteios University second was Alexandros J. Pa'ntos (1888-1930) from wealthy family of Volos. Studied also he Legally in Athens and later Political Sciences in Paris. It coincided also the two men they watch - in different however each one season because difference of age - courses in the "Freely Faculty of Political Sciences of Pares". This Faculty, as free step of scientific knowledge and expression, practised big influence in the intellectuals. However, the streets of two men were not crossed never! They had however a common vision. This vision was the foundation in Greece of Faculty of Political Sciences, as that of Paris. The first, Fragkoy'dis, some moment made this vision work of life. The second, Pa'ntos, dying gave the economic possibility is completed the vision, after it left entire his almost fortune for the foundation in Greece of "Faculty of Political Sciences" at the system of "Free Faculty of Political Sciences of Pares". Promoting his reforming ideas, the Fragkoy'dis founded in 1924 the Company "Educational Rebirth" locating thus in the Education and in particular in the "Maximum" space of necessary reforming changes. As repeatedly djeki'rytte: "If he is true that via the education and only it is possible anadimjoyrgici' Greek patrj's, the foundation of Faculty (it later means the one that he became Panteios) dw'si the sign of national reformation via the creation of hearth of studies of national questions and step of superior reforming teaching". For the realisation of this objective, the G. Fragkoy'dis through the "Educational Rebirth" founded the Faculty of Political Sciences. It aspired constitutes this for Greece what was the "Freely Faculty of Political Sciences" that existed hearth of reformation of French Administration and world importance Institution. Justifying little later her foundation, it wrote: "With tojay'tas thoughts was founded the Faculty Political, Economic and Social Sciences, to opoj'an edj'daskon men between the most excellent Greeks and which will turn out superior Academy of moral education and regeneration". On 2 January 1927, the chairman of Democracy admiral Pavlos Koyntoyrjw'tis placed the foundation stone of central building, that is found today in the avenue Syggroy'. Two chairmen of Greek Democracy existed excel professors of Faculty: the M.Stasjno'poylos that djete'lese and first Dean of Faculty (1952-1958) and the K.Tsa'tsos. And other of course her professors were elected in academicians, while a pleiad from them they kept occasionally or keep still important leading places in the policy and generally are distinguished for their important role in the public life of country. The first building of Panteios Faculty the construction of her first building did not stand easy. The G. Fragkoy'dis in order to it finds the necessary money made repeated calls in the interior and abroad and it was forced to travel also the himself in order to it convinces the fellow countrymen of America mainly, they strengthen their work. The courses begin officially stjs 18 November 1930 with the presence of Prime Minister El. Venjze'loy. the himself aspired he is the first professor of Faculty and existed her first donor. At the same time, the death and propanto's the last will of Al. Everywhere, that died in June 1930, came it helps decisively. Wish his was with the bequest that left to be founded Faculty of Political Sciences. Charm in the persuasiveness and the enthusiasm of animator of idea G. Fragkoy'di, but also the perspicacity and the readiness of El. Venjze'loy that as Prime Minister was executant of will Everywhere, the bequest with the building of "Educational Rebirth" they incorporate in 1931 in the "Panteios Faculty of Political Sciences". Thus the initial vision of two men becomes reality. The Panteios Faculty of Political Sciences functions as NPJD and her first regulation is voted 1933. With this is created two departments: 1) The Politician, that had ten tactics and six extraordinary seats and 2) Socio-economic that it had nine tactics and five extraordinary seats. The study is forecasted three-year. The Faculty grants degree and also is forecasted also the handing-over of doctoral diploma. The wealth of courses and the distinguished professors that constituted the first instructive personnel (A'mantos, Eyelpj'dis, Kalljtsoyna'kis, Keramo'poylos, Kanello'poylos, Koyge'as, Koytoy'pis, Loy'varis, Sgoyrj'tsas, Seferja'dis, Sjde'ris, Tsa'tsos k.a.) contributed in is established fast the Faculty, in 1936, as self-existent Institution of Maximum Education, equivalent to the Universities and the other Maximum Faculties. In 1937 are nominated in Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences and function as NPDD. Her aims, as they are reported concretely, are: A) The benefit of superior political education and the national and intellectual constitution of leading executives, with conscience of mission and responsibility of these, via the prosperity and progress of in general Homeland. V) Friday of public employees, via the growth of policies, economic and social scientific knowledge. C) Of further training of public employees as well as graduates of Law, oj'tjnes it is djda'xwsj to the High schools and the Urban Schools "the Elements of Right and Policy of Economy" D) the dj' of eklaj!keytjkw'n lectures, studies, garages erey'nis and other educative means policy of population education and enlightenment on the government owned aims and objectives, the awareness of need of discipline, solidarity and collaboration of various social classes, the culture of spirit of sacrifice thanks to general good, the reinforcement of patriotic belief and the fighting of partisanship and in general atomistic and egwjstjkw'n tendencies and ideas... ". M.Stasjno'poylos, dean 1952-58 in 1939 the Faculty is renamed in Panteios Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences and Public Employees. Above in these constitutive beginnings it tried walks the Faculty, rendering intense her existence, not only in the space of Social Sciences but also the wider social space. The public debates in Panteios for subjects of more general interest constitute henceforth delivery for the Faculty, beyond the scientific congresses that are organised in this, in tactic almost base. It deserves we report here, one from the first public debates, with which Panteios was established as free step of expression of ideas, as him had envisioned her founders. It is the eminent discussions on the parliamentarism that became in her rooms in the 15,1 7,19 and 22 May 1932. In that discussions they took part distinguished parliamentary, as the G. Papandreou, minister of Education then, and other distinguished scientists, many from which they were already professors of Faculty, as the Svw'los, Sgoyrj'tsas, c. Tsa'tsos, Kanello'poylos, k.a. as well as her a lot of students. Wing M.Stasjnopoy'loy Sample from other of her social sensitivities and progressive her character existed also the establishment from beginning afternoon and evening hours of courses, so that they can him watch the workers. Also they could be written also women in the Faculty, while was forecasted by the regulation even the organisation of students in association. The students her first time of operation were 205. With the N.540/43 the Faculty recovers her old name Panteios Maximum Faculty of Political Sciences, with which it functioned up to 1989 and it acquires the right to grant doctoral diploma. With the same law in the Faculty is founded "Department of education of journalists aim having the preparation via the journalistic profession and metekpaj'deysin the already workers of journalists". The operation of Department they would be regulated with special Decree, which however was not published. From 1951 is imported the traditional Academic organisation in the Faculty. The Administrative Council is replaced by the Dean, the Senate and the General Assembly of Professors of Faculty. K.Despoto'poylos, dean 1978-79 in 1963 the study is fixed four-year and the Departments of Faculty is named: Political Science and Public Administration. Afterwards the reformation of maximum education with the application of N.1268/82 the Faculty katate'mnetaj, in 1983, in three Departments (P.D.462/83). These are: a) the Department of Political Science and International Study, v) the Department of Public Administration and c) the Department of Sociology.

For another, this information is redundant; it's all present in a variety of other articles (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Intel_microprocessors_aca1.html" title="List of Intel microprocessors">List of Intel microprocessors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Intel_Pentium_4_microprocessors_49d7.html" title="List of Intel Pentium 4 microprocessors">List of Intel Pentium 4 microprocessors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Intel_Pentium_D_microprocessors_5ed6.html" title="List of Intel Pentium D microprocessors">List of Intel Pentium D microprocessors</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Intel_Core_microprocessors_8cd8.html" title="List of Intel Core microprocessors">List of Intel Core microprocessors</a>, as well as the individual processor pages come to mind). It also violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, as this is a classic example of "an indiscriminate collection of information". Processors are added for the sole reason that the article's original creator finds them "confusing". Entire product lines are skipped solely because of an author's POV. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">Jgp</a> 01:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm confused here- am I right in thinking this article is being re-nominated for deletion 3 weeks after it survived a previous AfD, and if so, why? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Superman-strong Keep</b>, since no response to the above question, regardless of article content. It borders on bad-faith to renominate an article so quickly, simply to try and reverse an unwanted result. Deleting an article under these circumstances sets a bad precedent- should not be renominated unless there have been <b>significant</b> deleterious changes to the content or context in the interim since the last save. In this case, there have been none at all. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:48, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. First of all, newer pages have been created. They have been <b>linked</b> in the nomination. These newer pages are not POV and actually have a focus, unlike <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_processor_confusion.html" title="Intel processor confusion">Intel processor confusion</a>. Second, you should vote based on Wikipedia policy and not based on politics. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">Jgp</a> 23:32, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b>. You do not specify in your nomination that these pages are newer, or that the information has been recently merged into those pages, as per the consensus of the previous AfD. If that is the case, then why is the article listed here again? After the merge, it is now a candidate for Speedy D, surely (after a brief opportunity for discussion on the article's talk page)? Secondly, you incorrectly opened this discussion on the previous archived AfD without specifying that this was a re-nom. Thirdly, from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">WP:DEL</a>: "<i>There is no policy or consensus for a hard time limit before an article can be renominated, but some people are likely to state 'keep' for the reason that it was already discussed last week.</i>" Please point out the passage where the deletion policy instructs us that we may not vote 'Keep' for a quick re-nom. Not unexpectedly, this AfD debate is turning into a carbon-copy of the first- all a bit of a waste of time really. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article can be <b>improved</b>. I have added a summary table at the top. The rest of the tables can be deleted, as they are redundant, with see alsos to the more detailed tables.

<li>I have deleted the extraneous information that I don't think anyone wants. (If you think this was presumptuous of me, please feel free to revert the change.)

<li>It beats the heck out of what was there before, and I think it was entirely correct to blow that stuff away, as it's all in the new processor list pages. Of course, once the page is renamed, one could argue that the old "Intel processor confusion" page has, in effect, been deleted (its content was moved elsewhere, and no page has that name any more), and a new page, giving a summary of the family "brand names" Intel's using for various x86 processor lines, was created <i>ab initio</i>. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 03:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks.&#160;:) Of course, "Intel processor confusion" should redirect to the new page. What about the new name?

<dd><b>Comment.</b>Publication does not imply that a book is being sold. Books may sit on shelves months without ever being sold. There's no proof that simply because it was published by a mass market publisher that people actually purchased it. The proof, once again, is in the readership not the publication.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 04:15, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, but she has three books published by the same company; I don't think they'd have brought her back for the second unless the first had some measure of sales success, and 5,000 seems modest in that regard. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 04:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

While <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carphone_Warehouse_77fa.html" title="Carphone Warehouse">Carphone Warehouse</a> may be big enough to be noteable, its brands and products normally should appear only in the main article for the company. Notable products, like the <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, may have articles of their own, but non-famous products and names of subsidiaries belong in the main article. Understand that Wikipedia is not a vehicle for advertising. Any article that could be construed as an ad is a likely candidate for deletion. Because so many companies, people, and bands try to use Wikipedia for self-promotion, the people who watch for this tend to be a bit curt with promotional attempts. This can be confusiong to newcomers. Write an article on something you're not selling and you'll receive much better treatment.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the original article is a bit critical, and could be more so. Search Google for "one stop phone shop" and "complaints".

<li><b>Decouple</b>, and consider each case separately. I think Think of Me should have its own article, though the current is worthless, and could be deleted without prejudice to a new article.

<li>Wouldn't decoupling imply the need to review each article separately? They're all songs from the same musical; they all contain more or less the same information -- information now contained in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_%281986_musical%29_2cba.html" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)">The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)</a>.

<ul>
<li>Bulk merges are fine. You can use {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} and talk page discussion to do that. Bulk deletion is not ok in this case, as it involved the permanent removal of information, and requires individual attention. Also, if you did a true merge (e.g. kept signficant amounts of content), then deletion isn't even allowed (though I suspect you meant facts not actual content was kept, which isn't really a merge). BTW, why have you listed <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masquerade.html" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, a disambiguation page, for deletion? <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masquerade_%28song%29.html" title="Masquerade (song)">Masquerade (song)</a> was merged in June of 2005 (after a prior AFD). Also, I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Point_of_No_Return_679a.html" title="The Point of No Return">The Point of No Return</a> is an ok article, that has information not in the main article, and it should be kept as a stand-alone article. It has information not in the main article. Also, while these were all written for the stage musical, they could evolve to properly discuss the 2004 film, which, it is my understanding, has the same songs, but with certain notable differences (I don't know for sure, as I only saw the movie). Many comparisons would be to detailed to note in the main articles, but could be mentioned in each song article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:32, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_no_Return_6e3b.html" title="Point of no Return">Point of no Return</a> does, indeed, have information not included in the main article. However, it still fails all fourteen criteria on song notablilty <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_Songs_5d80.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs">here</a>. Furthermore, the information it contains is not necessarily important to the plot of the play or the movie, nor is it otherwise musically signifigant. -- <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376">MusicMaker5376</a> 19:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think we should have sixteen different pages to discuss the differences between the play and the movie in excrusciating detail. The differences in the Phantom's costumes between stage and film versions are certainly non-encyclopedic and should be left to a fansite. MAJOR differences between the play and the movie can certainly be tackled in one article in the future. -- <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376">MusicMaker5376</a> 19:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You missed my entire point. If I wanted sixteen stand-alone articles, I would have voted "Keep all". I didn't. I said I wished to decouple, and consider them separately. The easiest thing to do at this point, is redirect all of them (without deletion), and then, in the future, anybody may undo the redirect, and expand the article. Do you oppose a redirect? If so why? What is the need for deletion? I think you're under the false impression, that if we don't delete all of them now, we we'll have stand-alone articles now. That's not so. You need to explain what purpose deletion serves, that a simple redirect does not. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Redirecting these articles would simply point them back to the article from which they're being linked. In every instance (save one slightly misguided link), the only articles to which these articles are linked are either other articles up for deletion or the main Phantom of the Opera article. Several of the articles link to the next song in the musical, forming an unnecessary chain of related articles. -- <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376">MusicMaker5376</a> 22:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Circular linking can easily be fixed by delinking where appropriate. If somebody types in "Think of Me" in the search box, what do you want them to see? Should they be redirected to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_%281986_musical%29_2cba.html" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)">The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)</a> or should they get the message "<i>No page with that title exists. You can create this article or request it</i>". I prefer the first result. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't really think someone would be apt to search for "Think of Me" before they search for "Phantom of the Opera", which, of course, hearkens back to the notability issue. Should someone first search for "Think of Me" and come up emptyhanded, their next search would be for "Phantom of the Opera" or "Andrew Lloyd Webber" -- both of which would eventually direct the search to the POTO page. Furthermore, it was my impression that we're trying to reduce the number of redirects out there. -- <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376">MusicMaker5376</a> 23:29, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Added: Another advantage of stand-alone articles, is it includes the ability to link from multiple articles. A song article could be mentioned in the bio articles of the lead singer(s), the stage musical, and the 2004 film. Somebody may be interested in all the Phantom songs sung by Butler in the 2004 film (with comparison to his stage predecessor), but not the other songs. Rather then give a detailed descussion in Butler's bio, give links to the songs, for more depth. Generally merges make sense when the information only relates to one central master article, but I don't think that's the case here. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure I understand your argument, here. The songs sung by Butler in the film are almost exactly (and I say "almost" only because I'm not 100% sure) the same as in the stage version. However, the above proposed differences between film and stage versions article would almost certainly answer that question. -- <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376">MusicMaker5376</a> 19:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Criteria for deletion is not dependent on whether or not you feel a particular endeavor is worthy. The games that the subject plays have referenced articles and would likely survive an AfD nomination. Many people may agree that being a chess grandmaster is more prestigious than becomming world champion in a collectible card game, but that doesn't make it any more or less notable. I believe the subject of this article meets the fourth and ninth bullet points at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I do concede that it does just barely, but the information contained in the article is verifiable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I would agree with a vote to merge, however this may be problematic because the subject is a notable player in two CCGs with articles. I'd also like to point out that notable players in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7EThe_Gathering_e0f6.html" title="Magic:The Gathering">Magic:The Gathering</a> have independent articles. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 17:02, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I did a quick search on Google and couldn't find any mention of Orvis Jordan in connection with a Campbell Institute or the CCW-USA.

<p>Tell you what: if it is that important to you to delete my article, go ahead and delete the article. The entry on ICCC, CCW, and Jordan's role in the CCW is in Melton's most recent ENCYCL. OF AMER. REL. You may have to dig a little in hard copy books to confirm OFJ's role in Campbell Institute. A google reference to his listing as "heretic of the week" in an old CHRISTIAN STANDARD journal used to be on the web. Jordan wrote an article disputing the historicity of the Jonah story. This will be my last attempt to ever write or edit wiki. Parkridge1998 (signed)</p>

<p>First of all, the article's title would need a change. Putting that aside, the subject of the article is, as far as I can see, quite non-notable on its own. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 12:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>With the added links, and more soon to come, it is clear the Mr. Deutsch is a notable individual, deserving of a place on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>How does one go about changing the title? And what would you reccomend?</p>
<p>Try 'googleing'... Music Compasition and "maury deutsch", he has got hundreds of articles about him.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Definetly notable. This person is a doctor who's even written books on dance band arranging.

<li>Ahh, the article is much better now, so I'll have to change the vote to a <b>keep</b>. I see the title has also been changed to a proper one!

<li>I find striking through the nomination, adding a line to the end of the discussion calling for a speedy keep and early close, "as nomination is withdrawn and all votes are to keep", and offering a prayer fora ttention to the <i><b>Powers That Be</b></i> via the edit summary is usually effective</li>

As stated above, stuff that random people at Safeway don't know about isn't automatically non-notable. If we only listed stuff that people already know about, there would be no point in maintaining an encyclopedia. --82.92.150.193 11:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well the fact that those fans voted just because they liked it goes to show that noone votes based on policy when it comes to stupid internet shit.

<p>India is a country of more than a billion people. 95 percent of these have no access at all to the internet.

<li><b>Reply to reply</b> - I'd like to point out that the list you are talking about features almost exclusively red links. I'd also like to point out that several of the few that actually have articles are up for deletion as well. You really can't add things to Wikipedia without sources - if you do, it is indistinguishable from "original research", which is specifically not allowed on Wikipedia.

<p>I really cannot understand your sustained opposition to this article. Anyway, I maintain that this is not a hoax and worth an article on this site. I knew that the internet originated in the US but did not understand the extent to which American ideas and restricted world view influences it even today (the world much bigger than US &amp; western europe my friend).This will be my last comment on this issue. Do whatever you want with this article.

I suggest you present some sources as requested rather than go on about how prejudiced the US is if you want your article to be kept. I've recommended hundreds of articles for deletion on the grounds of original research/no references/no google hits. Your article is no different.

<p>This isn't a debate about American's being close minded. I am not an AK-47 carrying supporter of Osama who hates Americans. We in this part of the world are also english-speaking, college educated, liberal people like I expect you are too. My point was and is that just because there were only a few google hits or because you have never heard of it doesn't make it irrelevant. The point is there ARE Google hits which will grow in number. Anybody can create web pages ... many web pages and give them as external sources. If this was a hoax, believe me, there would've been a number of external links to prove that it is not. Without sounding anti-american I will still say that if you were in this part of the world you would not be arguing on these lines.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.227.162.153 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.227.162.153.html" title="User talk:220.227.162.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.227.162.153_7def.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.227.162.153">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Wikipedia can certainly do without articles that only exist to prove a political point. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 15:59, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The page has been named at various times, Palestinian terrorism, Palestinian political violence, Palestinian militancy, and Palestinian terrorism and militancy. What is the subject? It looks to me like it's Palestinian terrorism. I think that's a legitimate topic for an encyclopedia article, under whatever name. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since we <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoid self references</a>, the fact that it is about us should not influence the decision. Wiki-community noteriety =! general notability. Yes, Brandt is <i>infamous</i> within Wikipedia, and yes, this website 'names' a number of wikipedians (including myself), but that does not make his every action worth an individual article. The detailed blow-by-blow content of this article, describing the history of the website would simply not be tolerated in any other web-related article. The article exists only because of a perceived battle between Brandt and Wikipedia, but actually it only serves to feed and exacerbate that same silly foolishness.

<li><b>Create</b> a brand spanking new article entitled "A List of Websites which Daniel Brandt is Affiliated With", and then <b>merge</b> the contents of both this article and of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>, plus that of information on Yahoo! Watch, NameBase and Wikipedia Review, into the new article. Then, delete all personal information about Brandt (Age/Gender/Location is one thing, but I seriously doubt people were going in 1947: "Good Lord! A Child has been born to missionary parents in China! Let us visit him!" Equally, I seriously doubt there is anything else within his "Background" section that he is notable for. As far as I see it, he is notable only for his contributions to those 5 websites) and then <b>merge</b> what non-personal information there exists left from the Brandt article (including the Seigenthaler stuff) into the new article. This way, several birds are killed with one stone: We cannot complain that Brandt is over represented in his articles in Wikipedia because he will only really feature in one as this proposal details; it will end the controversy in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article over the inclusion or not of Wikipedia Review because now we will have information about it; Brandt will most likely cease to complain because what he feels to be "private matters" will no longer be on Wikipedia for everyone to see; and it can stop this bitter war that exists between Brandt and Wikipedia: Brandt can be left to his own devices and Wikipedia can finally have a Brandt article free of controversy and one which they can be truly proud of.. Besides, let's remember that Wikipedia Watch is actually a very notable website because it appears that every single time Brandt's name is mentioned here, friends or foes of Brandt will mention Wikipedia Watch. Whether you agree or disagree with Brandt's politics, what cannot be denied is that people who are either pro-Wikipedia or anti-Wikipedia cannot stay away from it. Plus, Wikipedia Watch is notable because it is directly linkable from Google Watch until the title: "Google Loves Wikipedia". Jonathan 666 13:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The items enumerated under the heading "AfD etiquette" are not exclusively prescriptive; the "bias" guideline of which William writes is quite evidently descriptive, inasmuch as one's failure to comply with it is seen as untoward. Nevertheless, a justified "keep" by the creator of an article is not summarily disregarded, especially where the creator cites a relevant notability guideline (whether "it is REAL" meets this test is a different question); no article creator is "required" to "disclose his bias". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:16, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for pointing that out, Joe. I wrote rather hastily. I should have said "suggested" instead of "required".

<p><b>Change title or delete</b> <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iran and weapons of mass destruction">Iran and weapons of mass destruction</a>, which is misleading since it automatically forces the conclusion that Iran has got such weapons of mass destruction. Although Iran does have a <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran%27s_nuclear_program.html" title="Iran's nuclear program">nuclear program</a>, started in the 1950s, there is no proof whatsoever that Iran possess WMD. As there are very real threats of a US "pre-emptive" attack on Iran, I do not think that Wikipedia should advocate this position using titles good for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. Read the article carefully: the first section on chemical weapons deals with... the Iraqi use of chemicals! The part on the nuclear program is well treated in the specific article concerning it. What else is there? Whatever the effective content of the article, such a title automatically leads to the confusing conclusion that Iran <i>does</i> has WMD, ready to use for today. After the Iraqi War and the proved conclusion that Iraq did not dispose of any WMD, I think everybody should be a bit more careful with stuff like that. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyagit_f7d4.html" title="User:Satyagit">Satyagit</a> 16:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The tilte does not insinuate anything. It does not read "Iran's Weapons of Mass Destruction", which would make the previous stance correct. The tilte effectively seperates the two ideas of "Iran" and "WMD" but at the same time seeks to explore the relationship between the two. It shows both sides (the Iranian view and the U.S./E.U. view) and links to support both theories. User:Brian Steeves 00:22, 12 April 2006</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. We have dozens of "X country and WMDs" articles (see <a href="../../../w/m/d/Template%7EWMD_7676.html" title="Template:WMD">template:WMD</a>) which are meant to discuss all aspects of a country's alleged or denied WMD development; the title does not automatically imply anything, it is meant to be an article about Iran and WMDs, which could just as easily be about how they <i>don't</i> have them. As for "being careful", I don't think Wikipedia article titles had any effect on the Iraq war. The article also contains discussions of Iran's chemical weapons history and their having signed the biological warfare convention; it is not limited to nuclear issues. The overt attempt to use AfD as a forum for a political issue of this sort ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFarnkerl&amp;diff=47977379&amp;oldid=18458375" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFarnkerl&amp;diff=47977379&amp;oldid=18458375" rel="nofollow">vote for peace?</a>") is inappropriate to say the least. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 15:59, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> per Mmx1. A leading summary, such as that proposed by Yannick, is an unnecessary disclaimer (since the title insinuates no possession of WMDs on the part of Iran).

<li><b>Hesitant Keep</b> I agree that we should be neutral towards Iran, and that people are only worrying about them because they're Middle Eastern. However, many people think opposite me, and they also have to be respected. In that sense, we should have an article discussing those allegations, whether they be true or false. The title doesn't necessarily say that Iran has WMDs, it just says that some people think they do.

<li>Actually, the title says neither of those things and I think if Iran was located on an island off Antarctica inhabited solely by Polynesians but with the same policies then there'd be an article just as much.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 13:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - we have articles for all credible potential nuclear powers and former nuclear weapon powers (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_weapons.html" title="List of nuclear weapons">List of nuclear weapons</a>). Iran surely meets the criteria of being credible potential, and has for some time. NPOV requires labeling known fact and speculation appropriately, but the article is clearly justified. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:22, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I do not feel the title simply implies that Iran has "weapons of mass destruction", but could also rather imply the relationship of WMDs and Iran. This could also include Iran's stance on them, such as treaties they've signed into, their position toward each type of WMD, etc. Provided enough information, all countries in the world could/should(?) have an article titled "&lt;country&gt; and weapons of mass destruction"; think "United States and weapons of mass destruction". I do, however, believe that the template on the right-hand side of the page, titled "Weapons of mass destruction" is very biased, implying that a country on the list currently has WMDs; it lists both countries that currently have WMDs and countries that used to have WMDs at some point in history but not at present. Maybe the template should read something like "History of WMDs by Country"? --<a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnkerl_3335.html" title="User:Farnkerl">Farnkerl</a> 16:15, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The template also lists countries which had some tangental interest in WMD technology, or aborted or potential WMD programs (Taiwan, Brasil, Canada, Netherlands; it should include South Korea, who briefly had a nuclear bomb program in the early 1980s, but doesn't right now). Inclusion in the list does not imply current posession, as any review of the template list entries will show. I understand the knee-jerk reaction that inclusion presumes them guilty, but objectively Iran clearly does qualify for inclusion on the same basis as many of the others. The list should actually be significantly longer (see <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq7.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't much expect this nomination to succeed. But let me make something clear. I know people love this. I know it's fun. I also happen to know that it sets a precedent for all these other unnotable internet phenomena which barely effect anyone but a percentage of the bored internet population.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: I totally disagree. Consider how long it's been since it started, and the article is still being actively edited and cleaned up nearly every day. You make it sound like there's only this tiny minority of netizens that are enthusiastic about it, and nothing could be farther from the truth. The number of parodies alone is indication of how widespread and popular this thing is. There are dozens of flash toons on the weebls-stuff site, and hundreds to thousands of somewhat-popular flash toons scattered among other sites, but this one has shown incredible staying power. If this was a print encyclopedia on a bookshelf, where space is precious, then I might understand simply giving this one line on a list of popular flash toons. But this is Wikipedia, dynamic and expansive, and the popularity of the toon, as well as the "craze" surrounding it, make it worthy of an article. To put it bluntly, nobody's being hurt by this article existing, there's really no <i>good</i> reason to delete it, and such a deletion would seriously disappoint (and possibly piss off) a lot of people. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 17:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree 37signals has got some recognition though, and as such should probably be kept in <i>some</i> form (at least discussed briefly in either Rails or Hansson articles, or something like that). And I can hardly say JzG is having a "bad temper" here - they're just saying what the article says and then stating the company fails the notability criteria we have... --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:50, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't fail <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as it has been mentioned in the press many times. Even so <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is just a guideline, and in its current form not appropriate for emerging technologies and the small agile companies that produce innovation. What notability criteria are you referring to? and who is we? If Wikipedia isn't democratic and doesn't serve to be better than conventional encyclopedias by including more current and new information then its significance will diminish. And why can't we include every company? Is server space running out? If inappropriate links to an article appear in other pages then it is detracting from wikipedia. <i>If a page is only linked to from relevant places then how can it be deemed to be detracting?</i> I do think there must have been an element of jealousy, bitterness or temper in the attempt to delete a company which in the technology community is regarded as perhaps the most significant up and comer of 2006. I looked on JzG's page before making the comment, and it said he worked in IT , so he must have been aware of their significance. It seems very unlikely to have been an honest mistake. Davebrooky
<ul>
<li>OK, if it doesn't fail WP:CORP, the article should be made to point out the reasons the subject is notable. Lots of stuff gets nominated for deletion because it doesn't <i>explain</i> its significance (which may be hasty, agreed, but at least it hopefully get concerned people off their butt and do something about the article), which then gets added during the deletion discussion period, and in the end, everyone agrees the site is notable enough and shouldn't be deleted. The CORP criteria was what I was referring to, "we" as in "Wikipedia". Hope this clears things up.<br />
As for reasons why there is a notability criteria, one of the reasons is that there's awful lot of stuff out there that just gets in the way. In the end, the really important stuff gets shadowed by tons of stuff that some kids invented one day. (Really, hang around the AfD, you see a lot of Things Kids Made Up One Day getting nominated and ultimately deleted...) Would you really want an article for every two-minute shell script MP3 tagging hack, for example? Or every school club? Because if you don't draw the line somewhere, that's what you get for articles, too.<br />
As for WP:CORP being a guideline, yes, it's not a policy, but it <i>is</i> a thing that gets considered during deletion and it <i>does</i> represent the opinion of quite a many editors, and as such it does carry a lot of weight - if you disagree with the criteria, voice your objections and discuss about it, though.<br />
As for jealousy, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Some AfD nominations do get shot down because they are bad faith nominations, and it's okay to point them out; if they truly <i>are</i> and you can tell why if it isn't obvious. But if you can't demonstrate it, it's shaky. I, for one, think JzG's point was well argued (in which case it doesn't <i>really</i> matter whether or not it was in bad faith or not), and haven't seen JzG going around doing too many frivolous nominations, but don't listen to me, I need a coffee to tell for sure.<br />
And then, <i>what</i> jealousy and bad faith? Almost everyone I've seen seems to agree RoR is the best thing since sliced bread, and are glad to provide <i>facts</i> to those who disagree, and not resort to accusations of jealousy - the things speaks for itself! I'm a rabid Rails user (one of the primary authors of Rails article, in fact), and I agree 37signals is a <i>small company.</i> I think it's <i>borderline</i> notable, but not much hotter than that - a couple of interesting products and some media mentions and awards. But if I told them "hey, you're a small company", I don't think they'd say "you're just jealous". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:17, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. Some links to press articles might have helped. I am not sure I agree JzG's point was well argued. The top paragraph seems like a rant, not a carefully considered opinion. However there is one point I want really press you on. How does stuff get in the way, unless there are superfluous links to it? The people that weren't interested would never see it. Thats the beauty of an electronic encyclopedia as opposed to a paper one. So if an article about an mp3 hack of extremely limited application was only linked to from a page discussing that limited application area, what harm would it do? The debate should focus on linkage policies, not page deletions. If a page about fibre optics had links to loads of manufactures sites that would get in the way. If a page about fibre optics had a link to a page listing university research departments and leading manufacturers, then only those seeking that would find it. A policy focussing on linkage policy and polluting general interest articles would also solve the spam problem, as the search engines work on a linkage principle. So you could have full coverage, serving the needs of those interested in the leading edge and idiosyncratic detail, without problems. Does that make sense? Davebrooky
<ul>
<li>The problem would still be how to find the appropriate topic from the sea of links, most of which are <i>kind of</i> related to each other. You need to pick what to do: spend time picking what's notable, or spend time arranging stuff. (Kind of like my experiences with MySQL and PostgreSQL manual tables of contents, but that's <a href="http://wwwwolf.livejournal.com/248774.html" class="external text" title="http://wwwwolf.livejournal.com/248774.html" rel="nofollow">another tale</a>.)<br />
Anyway, I think this discussion isn't the perfect place to discuss WP's notability and linking criteria; there are better places for that. Like the talk pages of the notability and linking, or something? Also, believe me, your ideas are hardly new =)<br />
And still back to JzG's point - the AfD nominations tend to be to-the-point and blunt. You see this a lot. It's probably intimidating, and may not be the most friendly way to get the ball rolling, but it does its job. There's a couple of <i>hundred</i> deletion nominations every <i>day</i>; few people want to read gigantic nomination texts, especially if shorter text does the trick. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 00:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JzG was hasty, to the point, blunt, and incorrect. It doesn't fail WP:CORP. There is nothing in WP:CORP to say the article has to include the links to the independent press articles, it only says these independent articles need to exist. So unless WP:CORP is changed, the onus is on the editor to do his research before recommending an AfD. If JzG clearly admits his mistake, i.e. not doing his research, I'll believe that the process is objective. He need only have visited their website and followed the link to press articles [<a href="https://jf.backpackit.com/pub/194991" class="external text" title="https://jf.backpackit.com/pub/194991" rel="nofollow">37 signals press</a>]. Its a pretty impressive list, including front covers, businessweek, wall street journal etc etc. With a list like this JzG has made a laughing stock of the deletion process. Whata mistaka tomaka Davebrooky
<ul>
<li>Actually JzG was correct: <i>The article</i> doesn't have any evidence of the company's notability. In its current state, it makes the whole company look like a two-guys-in-the-basement New Media operation. Please add the mentions of the articles, etc to <i>the article</i> now that you've pointed out the notability in the AfD debate. Please improve <i>the article</i> and tell why the company <i>really</i> matters.<br />
And don't vandalise AfD nominations. That makes you look very silly. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:42, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>IT DOESN'T NEED EVIDENCE WITHIN THE ARTICLE FOR WP:CORP. Please read WP:CORP. The criteria you are INVENTING would mean every article being strewn with links to press articles to justify its existence, and press articles often get deleted after six months. Following a link from a companies home page to press articles is not rocket science. I'll repeat it in case you didn't get it IT DOESN'T NEED EVIDENCE IN THE ARTICLE FOR WP:CORP. The company satisfies WP:CORP. However so as not to look as lazy as JzG I have added a compliance note to the bottom of the 37 signals article. I suggest you go about adding a similar note to every other page on wikipedia. Guilty until prooven innocent right? Davebrooky
<ul>
<li>Of course no article <i>needs</i> evidence of notability in article. However, if an article <i>lacks</i> any such information, it's more likely to get nominated for deletion for exactly that reason, and if such information doesn't materialize during the deletion period, it's likely to also <i>get</i> deleted. Of course, it <i>might</i> have been nicer if JzG would have tagged the article with {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} for some period of time, but it's too late to argue about that now that the article <i>is</i> on AfD. We wouldn't be having this discussion if the article had had such information in the first place, now would we? I'm not saying "guilty until proven innocent"; I'm saying "The subject <i>looked</i> really insignificant and without knowing better, I would have arrived to that conclusion, too". Just because stuff gets <i>nominated</i> for deletion doesn't mean it <i>will</i> get if people can present evidence against that.<br />
Now please calm down and handle the case a little bit less hot-headedly, okay? It's not making the case look any better, you know. Over the time, I've seen a lot of people get leaning toward deletion also because of inappropriate behaviour by proponents of keeping the article. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:24, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Would you have looked at the company homepage? Would have done any research before nominating the article? Bad behaviour is not having the decency to say 'It was a mistake. Sorry. We'll be more careful in future'. People can clearly see I signed the extension, so people will judge for themselves whether it was vandalism or humour, and whether the bad behaviour is on your part for not just admitting the mistake, or mine for insisting that the mistake is admitted to and hopefully won't happen again. If you start inventing a moral code and declaring it universal as well as inventing criteria I will get hot-headed. People have seen many a false argument propped up with statements like 'I've seen' and 'a lot of people' and 'Now please', so you aren't helping your case by resorting to hand waving. However I was young once too, and I remember assuming ones own opinions to be universal truths was a characteristic of the age. Anyway I'm done. I have already had to repeat myself. Davebrooky
<ul>
<li>I would have tagged the article with {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. Or first used {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} to see if anyone really contests its notability (and take some workload off the AfD). You can dismiss my comments as handwaving for all I care. I'm just stating something I've learned from watching the AfD discussions over the past six months or so: Specifically, there's a lot of behaviour that isn't going to work in AfD discussions. Excessive arguing about policy rather than the <i>subject's notability</i> isn't working too well, I've seen, nor are accusations of other users working too well either. Don't worry, AfD sure looked a lot more confusing back then to me too... =)<br />
Also, believe it or not, people <i>do</i> get picky about the talk page and AfD protocol. It's difficult to converse if someone is <i>literally</i> twisting what you've said previously, now isn't it? Thusforth, we have a thing called talk page etiquette. Specifically, the rules about <i>not</i> touching other people's comments (aside of refactoring/reformatting, and perhaps simple spell/link fixes, even when some people get upset if you do the latter), and <i>not</i> modifying the AfD nomination text, which should only be amended by the original nominator. Technically, you didn't sign your comment either (please use "~~~~" in future, or use the signature button on the page edit toolbar. People who don't get their morning coffee might view "Finishing someone else's sentence" not that funnily and revert it with anger coursing through their brain, and tell you under no circumstance ever do that again. Others just laugh and revert it back and tell you not to do that again, with a friendly smile. I tried to do the latter. I hope I succeeded to at least some extent.<br />
Believe me, over this discussion, I've just trying to give helpful advice on how <i>I've</i> seen the AfD process works. I had a hunch that you didn't know too much about the AfD process - now it turns out you have got the account only a few days ago, and nobody even gave you the usual newbie sermon. I hope the comment I added to your talk page is sufficiently informative.<br />
And all I'm saying right now, as a <i>hopefully helpful</i> advice, is that we Finns have a lot of weird folk sayings, one of which happens to be "it's too late to cry when the milk has already been spilled all over the floor". The article got to AfD. It's time to fix the article and voice your concerns. It's no use to argue about validity of the nomination unless there's clear evidence we're dealing with a bad faith nomination. There's no need to apologise after AfD nomination either, because AfD nomination is <i>not</i> a personal attack, it's a voice of <i>concern.</i> View this AfD as a last-resort call to improve the article to meet the quality criteria. Not sure if this article will be kept, but keep this in mind for future in either case. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:47, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do you accept not visiting the company website (linked to from the article) before nominating for Afd was sloppy? Is this likely to happen again? Davebrooky 07:39, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It might have been sloppy not to do so. I did. I saw a list of product which have recently been linked (often incorrectly) into very spam-prone lists. Like <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basecamp.html" title="Basecamp">basecamp</a>, for example. I fixed the links to point to the company article, did some basic checks, n oted that one user had added it in a blitz to a load of other articles, and decided to let AfD have a look at it. Right or wrong, my experience of AfD is that it usually results either in confirmation of my judgment or in a speedy fixing of the content (which {prod} and {notability} don't in my experience, but things change over time of course). As pointed out above, life is much easier if people go the extra mile (well, the extra coule of yards, really) and tell us what the company is supposed to be famous for. It is a <i>very</i> small firm, after all, and not publicly traded. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed - prod &amp; co. are along the lines of saying "we'd really appreciate this would be fixed, you know, no hurry though", afd is like saying "please fix this mess and explain why it's existence is justified, or we need to take out the big guns. You have a week." For better or worse, it gets people moving <i>fast</i> if there's, in fact, no question about the real notability. (I know it got <i>me</i> running around like a headless chicken when someone AfD'd an article I had been working on, like, "Where do we get the <i>numbers?</i> And speaking of which, where the heck did the nominator get the idea there's only a handful of users?"... Nom withdraw. Keep. =) And in case of this particular AfD, apparently the single person who cares about pointing out the notability hasn't bothered to do much constructive stuff. A shame. Looks like there'll be some bits of merges and in my schedule in near future... --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:07, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a purely hypothetical case, yes, it <i>might</i> have been nicer to tag the article before hand, but now that it got AfD'd, it's too late to complain. From my experience with AfD discussions in general, it happens, say, quite a few times every week and every day, so I believe the answer to your second question is a resounding "yes". Again, I restate that I personally believe in {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ing rather than bringing articles to AfD straight away, because AfD is overcomplicated as it is.<br />
Why are you asking me all this stuff, though? Never done such thing in my whole life, and I certainly was well aware of the company's significance, which is why I voted Keep or failing that Merge. Perhaps you should not try to argue with almost completely unrelated passers-by who <i>already agree</i> with you, and instead either divert your energies to fixing the article (now that the information is there, it isn't <i>apparent</i>, and is whiny in tone - for examples of two articles whose notability concerns I've cleared up, see <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlaneShift_87ae.html" title="PlaneShift">PlaneShift</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Green_Dragon_8bbb.html" title="Legend of the Green Dragon">Legend of the Green Dragon</a>), or complain to the people actually responsible if you <i>really</i> want things done. Go on. If you get the nominator to reconsider the thing, that's good for you. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Interesting you should say that. A lot of cultures have trouble with the British sense of humour. Even closely related cultures have trouble. The Aussies call us 'Whingeing Poms' and the Americans have to have all our comedy shows like 'The Office' translated into American versions. The British have a stereotype of Finns as having no sense of humour, but what that probably indicates is that the Finns have a particularly hard time understanding the British. Probably better on an international site if you preceed your comments about tone with 'As a Finn it comes across to me...' rather than 'the tone is'... I probably ought to use more&#160;:) signs ... again as you get older and experience more things you'll become less absolute... Your vandalism annotation at the top is hysterically funny to someone versed is stereotypes about Finns Davebrooky 20:22, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I actually do have a sense of humor. I merely try to conduct myself in a manner appropriate for a serious, somber occassion (which an AfD discussion is, in theory, supposed to be), and I don't want to be spewing out quasi-humorous stuff in front of a newbie who is obviously misreading my intentions. Seriously, if I got an almost hostile response for just trying to give helpful advice, I was <i>terrified</i> about the idea of even imagining what effect <i>humour</i> might have had! I had an irresistible urge to add "...but this usual newbie welcome template message is <i>obviously</i> unnecessary since you <i>already</i> know everything about Wikipedia policies" to the message I left on your talk page, but I backed down - after all, injecting some Sarcasm to an already tumultuous topics might have bizarre results. I wouldn't want the admins to go all Ironic on my rear.<br />
By the way, we Finns are also funny in the way that we have this intriguing concept of "old jokes", and the proposed EU-wide prohibition of them is one of the <i>positive</i> side effects of <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Karpela_d302.html" title="Lex Karpela">Lex Karpela</a>. Some government ministry somewhere tracks down and lists all jokes that, in the immortal words of one of our <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jari_Tervo_61da.html" title="Jari Tervo">notable humorists</a>, "so old that even the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narmer.html" title="Narmer">Pharaohs</a> found them ancient." Your little bit of editing tomfoolery to the deletion nomination was, when passing through the <a href="../../../f/i/c/FICIX_fc5e.html" title="FICIX">FICIX</a> router somewhere, automatically filed under "this has <i>so</i> been done before".<br />
In other words, if you thought you were a veritable source of utter hilarity, you failed to account for the fact that someone might have beaten you in this little game of yours. Please, <i>please</i> consider the implications of that. If you try to be funny in Wikipedia, at least be familiar with what's <i>not</i> considered the height of hilarity.<br />
Now let's not talk about me. We're Wikipedians. We have no identity or personality. We're all just impartial Editors of neutral, objective Collection of Information. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, by saying it is likely to happen again, you have admitted that the wikipedia policies don't include following the link to the homepage before complaining about an article. So how can you claim they are to be taken seriously? By not simply having the honesty to say 'Yes he should have followed the link to the homepage' you have shown your lack of character, beyond all reasonable doubt. My character isn't wonderful, but at least I don't take myself seriously, unlike you who continually goes on in a self righteous and sanctimonious manner even after having been clearly shown to be in the wrong, and making futile attempts defend the indefensible. One minute you say you would have done the same thing as JzG, you gradually back off from that by saying you would have done something slightly different, and then eventually say you agreed with me all along anyway. Why not just have admitted he was wrong right way? And all jokes are old jokes, because human nature never changes. And humour is just our way of dealing with the failings of human nature. A country without old jokes is therefore a country with no jokes. Is that Finland? Davebrooky 09:56, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In Wikipedia, everyone's entitled to nominate an article for deletion if there's severe doubt about the notability of the subject, <i>whether or not</i> groundwork for that has been done - though to bolster the deletion claim, it's always nicer to show that they've done some groundwork (as in in a purely hypothetical example, "the company is privately held and has seven employees"). Personally I see deletion proposal part of verification: If an article has been nominated for deletion and survived, it's a precedent about the subject's notability. If it has been deleted, it's a precedent against. "Follow a link to homepage" doesn't mean damn; the article is <i>supposed</i> to give <i>all</i> interesting information about the company, and that <i>by definition</i> includes all important achievements and all unique features. And I am, by the way, pretty sure JzG <i>did</i> visit the company's home page and <i>still</i> thought the company was not notable. Or maybe he didn't.<br />
If you want people to take you seriously, <em>behave</em> seriously. (Some wise guy somewhere probably said that. I couldn't possibly be bothered to find a proper quote so here's a random paraphrasing from a random moron.)<br />
And let's make something clear: There's <i>one</i> thing I agree you with, and it's that the company <i>may</i> be borderline notable. It <i>may</i> grow in future and as such meet the notability criteria <i>at later time</i>. Right now, perhaps not. Personally, I think you should do some more research on how Wikipedia's notability rules are practically applied and how the deletion process really works, since you don't seem to have a clue. Go on, do that - it's quite interesting, really. One day, you'll see this discussion and laugh about how clueless you seem in retrospect.<br />
And I didn't mean to say Finland <i>has</i> no old jokes. What I meant to say, we <i>know</i> an old joke when we see one, and we don't automatically dutifully laugh at them. There's a big difference. We may even consider people who tell old jokes major bores and even, horrors, Annoying.<br />
In closing, please consider other people and, I might add, also try to find out about this "<a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>" thing that's all the rage these days. The AfD discussion will probably be closed soon; when an article you care about will be AfD'd next time, I <i>really</i> hope you rather fix the darn thing rather than spending time pointing fingers and diverting discussion. And also, it might be a good time for you to finally learn to sign your posts properly. Would this also be a bad time to note that in AfDs, newbie votes get less weight? (Surely you knew that, being a veritable veteran of AfD debates...)<br />
And since the AfD is closing soon and it's already triggering length warning, I'm not going to comment further on this AfD. Please reply on my talk page if you really want to continue this debate. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:59, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The case is not borderline. It is irrefutably in compliance with WP:CORP clause 1. The article should never have been complained about if the Wikipedia procedures had been properly adherred to. They are available for all and sundry to read. You do not need experience. You just need to be able to read the policies. The WP:CORP policy says that a company need to meet one of the criteria, not all. So meeting 'independent press articles' is a legally sufficient condition. I have edited the article as logically as I can to point this out. Davebrooky 21:21, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well done Dhartung. However I do still contend your are creating a sad situation if every article has to justify its own existence.

<li>I understand your reasons, but the result is a bit of a tradegy. Within the current structure of Wikipedia I can't think of a way of eliminating spam without the result that every article reads like a piece of self-marketing. So yes, my brief experience has convinced me this isn't the project for me. Maybe the approach now being taken by the Wikipedia founder, his Digital Universe project, where there are expert editors to keep everything in order will work? They will know if something is notable, so the contributors will feel free to write a balanced critique. Anyway, good luck. When you have all had time to think, maybe you will accept some of my points were valid, even if not expressed in a manner to your tastes. Davebrooky 12:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry you feel that way, Davebrooky. I think <b>notability</b> <i>per se</i> is not objectionable as a policy.

I know I'm more inclusionist, and sometimes the deletionists get on my nerves, too, but see how I chose to improve the article and address its deficiencies. Even if the article is still deleted, I know that I've done the best thing I can to make the article, and Wikipedia, better. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia's idea of web site notability. In 10+ years when people do actual research about websites do you want them reading a bunch of blogs? Wikipedia can be so much better if you just drop this deletionist attitude. Wikipedia is about what people know and what they want to record and inform others about. For instance I wanted 3rd party objective information on the American Nihilist Underground (anus.com) (hell I've had admins reverting my requests that such a page be made), but I checked wikipedia and couldn't find any object information because it was subject to some anti-troll anti-website circle jerk of admins. This is crap, I want objective NPOV information about websites and blogs I visit. Websites are notable, especially this one. Use all your lame google and alexa metrics you want. 37signals pisses people off and is notable enough to be the object of hatred and trolls.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The film is independently produced on a small budget. As with the producer's previous movies the film has failed to go mainstream, yet is important and highly revered in limited regions. The expectations for video sales and rentals are projected to surpass ticket sales. The film has yet to have its worldwide release, yet it is already coveted by fans of the director and actors and those who have been lucky enough to have an early screening. Modern cult classic is an oxymoron and is used to describe a movie's expectations rather than its current standing. Those who want to delete this movie's listing because they haven't heard of it are being bias. A majority of artists are not famous while they are creating their art; only mainstream blasé is. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadebro_9b9a.html" title="User:Cadebro">Cadebro</a> 10:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't speak for the whole delete side, but I can tell you my own thoughts, which are this: (1) the BCC is an extremely small, partisan off-shoot of another already small partisan group (Not in Our Name), and as such, doesn't get much notice from the press, so there's no way to verify through reliable sources what it is that they say and do; (2) because of this lack of notability, almost anything that's said about them is original research or POV pushing from persons that agree with the political slant of the group; (3) because of (1) and (2), the article doesn't attract enough editors to keep it NPOV. As such, the article will always be dominated by NION and Bush Crimes Commission supporters, endlessly pushing their POV. In my opinion, it's better to delete those kinds of articles because they will never be encyclopedic, and therefore don't belong on WP. I would say the same thing about any highly political article where the ideas presented in the article are non-notable and stridently advanced by a small group. Wikipedia seems to be replete with those kinds of articles. I don't think that WP will truly work as a project until we have found a mechanism for controlling advocacy-planting, and am open to your ideas. As to the keep argument, I can't speak for it. Consider both sides, and the goals of Wikipedia, and vote as you see fit.

<dd><b>comment</b>: Interesting criterion, but the corporate media is complicit in the deceptions and coverups that have defined the modus operandi of the Bush Administration. There is plenty of attention being paid to the Bush Crimes Commission, and that attention has played a noteworthy part in the escalating drumbeat that is finally beginning to pierce the veil of corporate mass media's silence regarding Bush's crimes. These crimes are increasingly viewed as treasonous by many observers, and if the drumroll calling for censure and impeachment continues to escalate, thanks in part to the Bush Crimes Commission, Bush may finally be drummed out of office. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:24, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>: A number of organizations collaborated to put the Bush Crimes Commission together. The high ranking officials and well known activists and organizations which participated evidence both great notability and the broad range of alleged crimes being scrutinized. The Bush Crimes Commission has diligently performed a job which the lobbyist-plagued US legislatures have been unwilling and unable to perform. It is interesting that after congress shirked its responsibility, the efforts to investigate and expose what the Bush Administration has perpetrated (largely through deception) is itself portrayed by Morton devonshire as propaganda. Along the same lines, it is remarkable that this AfD has been proposed on a week when the asleep-at-the-wheel media establishment is finally beginning to report on the widespread propaganda, election fraud and political ploys that have been orchestrated by the Bush Administration (e.g., the intentional 'leak' of classified documents aimed at discrediting <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Valerie Plame</a>'s husband; the fact that the Administration had just received, claissified and shelved a report dismissing the possibility that two small trailers were actually WMD equipment, yet went ahead days later claiming to have found their justification for 'preemptive war'; and that the top GOP election official for New England has been shown to have communicated frequently with the White House during the vote fraud campaign in 2004 that secured another term in office for Bush, an outcome that was even more clearly the result of full press, across the board, systematic undermining of the voting system, which produced obviously fabricated results in each of the last two presidential election cycles). This AfD is just a matter of gaming the system and an attempt to impose upon the Wiki the same propagandistic mindset that has corrupted mass media in the US. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, please</b> The article clearly states that this is not a 'formal' commission, but a formalised discussion. This is not misleading. We should respect the right of thinkers and writers to discuss. There is grave concern across the globe concerning the conduct of the Bush administration and there is enough evidence to warrent discussion. Enormously more evidence than was used to warrent invasions. These concerns about the legality of Bush policy do exist and are evidenced enough to deserve a place in our wikipedia. Those that say delete, please ask yourselves, 'Do you love freedom, or would you prefer to delete these thoughts?' Most people that would ask these questions are asking them about administration, not America. Discussion about 'administration' help us, who are outside the States yet inside the sphere of direct effect, to seperate from over-generalized and close-minded anti-American sentiment.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To point out what should be obvious, that simply isn't true. A mock trial held in a law school classroom does not typically try the POTUS. It does not get reported in newspapers or in blogs, or get broadcast on the radio and TV. It does not have notable people involved with it. The BCC is clearly more notable. It is correct that it has not more authority than a classroom trial, but lack of authority is not a reason to delete. The discussion in this AFD would be more valuable if people gave valid reasons for their choices. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 15:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>While a mock trial in a law school classroom might not typically try Bush in absentia, as this commission has chosen to do, it certainly could. If this was strange enough to be commented on in a few local papers, or picked up on for brief comment by a few partisan news broadcasters, would it make the mock trial notable? Personally, I'd say no. A small smattering of news coverage does not make notability... if that were all it took, there could be Wikipedia pages for hundreds and hundreds of pets that had vaguely interesting experiences in small towns or on slow news days. As this commission is not sanctioned by anyone, has no power, and really does nothing but voice criticism, an argument could be made for their simple existence being notable, but not so that it would merit its own article, but at most a footnote in some other one. Criticising a President is hardly new, nor does dressing it up with some play-acting make it notable. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:58, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And you seem to be missing the point. Arguing that the article should be deleted because it is supposedly 'propaganda' appears to be an example of doublespeak, or what psychologists would call projection of the Bush Administration's faults as faults of the Bush Crimes Commission. As for the Commission's notability, the fact that many top level officials and high profile anti-war and anti-Bush Administration organizations came together to expose the propaganda, lies, deceit and crimes of the Bush Administration is extremely noteworthy, especially given the growing momentum of the Bush censure and impeachment movements, triggered in part by the Commission, and the concurrent plummet in approval ratings for Bush. In fact, the Bush Crimes Commission has obviously played a significant role in the consolidation of the movements, while helping bring focus to the staggering breadth and depth of crimes perpetrated abroad and against Americans at home. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only question AFD is intended to answer is whether the subject matter - the Commission in this case - deserves an article. The criteria is not "what editors think of the subject" or of the Commission, not personal views on Bush and politics, but whether studied dispassionately, it is encyclopedic and notable. Arguments that it is biased, or politically slanted, are arguments to correct an article and write it better. They are not arguments to delete it. The question can be framed relatively simply: Does the subject matter exist (is it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>)? If so, is it notable and deserving of an article? The fact that it is an informal group, that relatively few people may look at it, are <i>not</i> arguments that it is non-notable, because relatively few people look up many obscure articles. Within its own field - the Bush, crime allegations, impeachment and similar controversies, is the Commission likely to be considered interesting or notable, or otherwise valuable, to the people looking up related issues on Wikipedia? At the risk of restating what should be obvious, <b>that</b> is closer to the issue. Not whether the article is politically this way or the other, or who wrote it, or who thinks what of Bush.</p>

<dd>Way too late for that my friend. &#160;:-) Certainly, you can change your own 'vote', although I think there is consensus to either merge or keep, so the meat of the article should survive one way or the other.

<p>I'm pretty sure there definatly isn't a consensus to keep or merge and more like it's a 60/40 split in favor of delete. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERiconoen_0a12.html" title="User:Riconoen">Riconoen</a> 19:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>60/40 in favor of delete possibly translates to keep by reason of no consensus. Ultimately, though, it's up to the closing admin to weigh the reasons given here more than the single word recommendations. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:46, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To echo your point, as Ben said, it's not a vote. If it were a vote, and I were so inclined, I'm absolutely sure I could go spam selectively to round up 20 keeps to match Morton's round up of 20 or so deletes. That's obviously not how we should be proceeding here, so it's a good things it's not a vote, but a discussion. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrillig20_55d1.html" title="User:Brillig20">Brillig20</a> 20:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But is it a rounding up of votes, or notifying people of this taking place? As has been noted in several places, people have not voted the way Morton wanted them to. While his purpose in going around placing the notice on Wikipedia users' talk pages might be suspect, in the end all he is doing is notifying people that it is taking place, it is still up to the individual user to make their choice about how to vote. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:52, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The bottom line is if it was nominated for AFD before and passed it shouldn't be up for a vote again. That's like continuing elections until your candidate wins or you get the outcome you're looking for. I think everyone stated their cases here except for the various votes for delete that had no reason for deletion which I don't understand why a person can't express why it should or shouldn't be deleted. Regardless if it already passed AFD and was renominated then all of this is irrelevant because it has passed before. We can't keep nominating articles until we get the outcome we want. Aeon explained that he didn't ooriginally nominate and wants to withdraw, it is not too late for that. Especially since it has already passed AFD before.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElohimgenius_7400.html" title="User:Elohimgenius">Gnosis</a> 15:14, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia isn't an election, though. As has been pointed out several times, this isn't even an actual democratic voting measure... it's a chance for people to make their case against it or for it. If people can continue to make a case against it, it can continue to be nominated for removal. If it is a strong article and conforms to Wikipedia's guidelines, it should be in no danger. However, if it is a weak article on a non-notable subject, as people argue, then the first AFD was simply in error and this is correcting that error. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 19:49, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This slippery slope scenario is without foundation. We're talking about Star Trek references in the Simpsons. A show that references pop-culture constantly referencing a pop-culture show. I fail to see how we get to "close down wikipedia" from there. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 02:52, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I admit I went a little over the top with that comment, but the fact remains the same, if enough wiki's pop up we can move any article on wikipedia to another wiki. Both <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> are huge pop icons of the current American, and World life style. So when one does refrence the other it is notable. The question I place to you is do you want wikipedia to be a true representation of life and culture today, or do you want it to be a dry, bare bones, just the facts encylcopedia? If I wanted that I could go to Encyclopedia.com (or somewhere else). Wikipedia is diffrent, created by people for people. It lends itself to have knowledge of popular cuture, as well as some obscure, but notable facts. EnsRedShirt 03:09, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As such, it seems like something that belongs in the readme file for that mod, not in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>Below are the rules of importance and underneath each is how they meet the criteria of importance:</li>
</ul>
<p>" article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true: There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)."</p>
<p>The site in question has well over 1,000 members who have taken time to register it is also well know in circles of people involved in Celtic FC.</p>
<p>"It is an expansion (longer than a stub) upon an established subject."</p>
<p>It has been added to over the past day and is over 2000 words now. That is longer than what would be described as a stub.</p>
<p>"Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance. If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</p>
<p>of insufficient importance, fame or relevance currently small or a stub, or obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.) Note that notwithstanding these criteria, other Wikipedia deletion policy may still apply to an article."</p>
<p>It is important as has been shown above by myself and therefore meets criteria set by Wikipedia so should cause no problems to the site</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the more important criteria can be found under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As is stated there: "The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section." If you can present evidence that it meets one of those points there then it should be able to stay. Also, about the vandal, the reason I assume it came from The Gallowgate is because the same user added information about specific users to the article. If the user was a rival of the site you would think the information would be vandalism. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKoG_b161.html" title="User talk:TheKoG">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheKoG_e45e.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheKoG">contribs</a>) 16:00, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Having read the information on the subject matter i see no reason to delete THE GALLOWGATE as it seems to me to be informing me off a website relating to celtic and also an area of glasgow with historic value and i very much enjoyed reading about lord haw haw as i have an interest in WW2 history as for this word vandal being thrown about i think that is just nit picking as its not as if its real vandalism like graffitti in the bronx that is stubborn to move and costs manpower to clean up,all you do on here is delete it,quite simple really and maybe some people take things to serious in life and therefore should just chill out a tad.im sure we all know the importance of being PC but to go overboard about a few typed words is utterly astonishing. lestat <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.13.116.132 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.13.116.132_29e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.13.116.132">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Also, the story about LORD HAW HAW, if it is true, has nothing to do with the website. That story is about the street the website is named after and should most likely go in a separate article. With the recently added information this article is about two separate subjects.

<p>Comment I only have your word on the vandalism issue but maybe you could elaborate on it was it explicit or maybe just an observation or opinion on the information available on your user page,do you actually work for WIKIPEDIA and if not i cant understand why you are relentlessly pursuing this issue.I also agree that some of the material may not be relevent to the uneducated but to anybody in the extended celtic family around the world ex pats and suchlike any information about the gallowgate,celtic and the history of the area is welcomed with open arms,im afraid you can quote the rules all night if you feel you must that is your right to do so anat the risk of repeating myself you realy dont know the history as for lord haw haw i can assure you that if you take the time to delve into the history archives you will probably find out that the in formation posted by theuser is correct. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.13.116.132 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.13.116.132_29e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.13.116.132">contribs</a>) 22:21, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Okay, is that enough evidence to declare PRT a total joke? Why aren't the other so-called PRT companies condemning Skytran for being such a joke and giving the rest of them a bad name? Why haven't the anonymous PRT proponents mentioned that Skytran is supposed to be built by robots? You can't get sillier than this statement "The light weight per foot of the track design also allows the use of a semi-automated track forming manufacturing robot (much simpler than the Robosaurus machine)." Here's the Robosaurus<a href="http://www.robosaurus.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.robosaurus.com/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that Skytran and Robosaurus were invented by the same person... I don't think the design calls for giant dinosaurs to assemble the tracks. Yes, it's unproven, but the company does exist, and has some patents as well. I'm not clear on why the Unimodal page was removed originally, but it makes sense to me to have a Skytran/Unimodal page, and a link from the Personal Rapid Transit page linking to it. Basically, if I Google the topic I'd like to see something about it on Wikipedia.

<dd>As for the merge, I think I might agree with that. I was going to argue against merging too, citing that the article had lots of contributors etc, but looking back through the history, it seems that *I* wrote just about half that page. I was just trying to impart my knowlege about the system to others.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I think that (since SkyTran is a proposal that is interesting enough to be one of the very few PRT proposals with its own page) SkyTran should either keep its own page in a stripped down fasion - or such a strip down can be put on the PRT page. However, I think that it would be out of place to have a description of a single PRT proposal on the PRT page, and it would need descriptions of other ones as well.</dd>

<dd>I do *not* think that Skytran should be deleted entirely - as Ken Avidor wants. Avidor has decried the censorship of his vandalism, but now wants to censor entire pages.

<p>SkyTran has existed for at least 10 years, and its roots extend back to maybe 1990. It was incorporated as a business once, for a short time. UniModal began a few years ago. It is incorporated as a business now. Both efforts are closely related, sharing several of the same persons. The SkyTran/UniModal system is unique in being very lightweight, relative to many other proposed PRT implementations. From these perspectives, as long as an article is not excessively one-sided, or factually incorrect, then it should be acceptable, except where it duplicates information in the general PRT article; such information should be moved from the SkyTran/UniModal article and merged into the general PRT article. Thank you. 22:20, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you (JzG) had even skimmed the page relating to "fancruft" here, it says that it does not a "plain and simple" meaning - its "hotly debated" the article says. Not only that, the article mentioned that "fancruft" is mostly said to describe fictional subjects like <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional universes</a>. You as an administrater should be more careful in using words like that.</dd>
<dd>Unimodal is a *real company* as noted by the above post. Thus it isn't just fiction. The ideas the company proposes are also not fictional ideas. Those ideas use *real* technology that is in fact available "now" (to the chagrin of Avidor who apparently thinks that they mean SkyTran is here now).</dd>
<dd>I have changed my mind from my previous post - placing SkyTran's info on the PRT would indeed put "undue weight" on that subject, and so it should be kept as a separate page. Not only that, but I'm thinking about moving it back to its original title as simply "Unimodal" - but I can't decide if there is benefit to doing that (as long as the words "skytran" and "unimodal" link there). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 00:46, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In a post above, Wiki editor Avidor states: "How about fraud? Millions of dollars worth of shares have been sold by these phony PRT "companies". They have also received millions of $ in public funding...all wasted. Wikipedia shouldn't help the PRT scam artists anymore." This is a misrepresentation, that verges on being libelous. In the case of SkyTran/UniModal, for both businesses, it is a matter of public record that not even one share was ever sold, and no public funding was ever received. Clearly, as businesses, both firms are failures, so far. Lack of success is not the same as fraud. 01:41, 18 April 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.242.235.189 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.242.235.189.html" title="User talk:209.242.235.189">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.242.235.189_5abd.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.242.235.189">contribs</a>).</small>

This company is at best a clever and elaborate internet deception... the claim that Skytran is 15 times less expensive than light rail amounts clearly an attempt to monkey-wrench the public decision-making process involving transportation. Wikipedia should not assist the cyberspace sabotage of the public planning process of communities like mine. In a matter this crucial to taxpayers and investors, Wikipedia should not allow anonymous editors to create that deception.

<p>It is not up to skeptics like myself to prove a negative...that Skytran, for example doesn't exist when there is no credible evidence to the contrary ..or even that this "company" is making any effort to build a PRT system. In fact, the inventor himself states on his website that he doesn't have sufficient energy to pursue the creation of Skytran. I suggest that instead of insulting me, bowdlerizing my comments and deleting my posts, that PRT proponents like "Fresheneez" make an effort to prove that these PRT companies really are "going concerns" It wouldn't be hard to do. For instance, they could ask the officers of these companies to send proof that they are more than just flashy Photoshoped visuals on the internet.... good luck.<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">Avidor</a> 20:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>-Disagree with deletion. However, I strongly suggest a more clear Wikipedia strategy on how to handle company and product information. Basically I think Wikipedia should contain a lof of information about the ideas behind systems and products, not the products themselves. For example a "car" or "automobile" is much more relevant than a "Ford", "Volvo" or "Toyota". The "car" section should the have links to known homepages of car makers over the world. Similary, I suggest that the emphasis should be put on "PRT", "Podcars" etc. in this case, and that the "Unimodal" information should be shorter and maybe connected to the inventor instead (Douglas Malewicki). However, I stronly disagree with deleting the entire entry, as all products, regardless of status, is a result of human effort and therefore is of interest now and later for various reasons - even if the product never sees the ligh of the day. Christer Lindström, IST (www.podcar.org) Sweden</p>
<p>-Disagree with deletion. The comment that because some PRT companies are frauds, therefor Unimodal and Skytran are probably a fraud is libelous. I just ran for City Council in Scottsdale Arizona, and my sole platform plank was that Scottsdale should seriously consider SkyTran or a similar PRT system. Obviously I don't think it's a fraud. (see <a href="http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/loomisforcouncil.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/loomisforcouncil.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/loomisforcouncil.htm</a> ) I did not win a seat on the council, but I did not come in last, either. At any rate, this is fascinating stuff and deserves an entry.</p>
<p>-Disagree with deletion. SkyTran is a legitimate engineering project that has been granted USA Utility and Design Patents and is now in the early prototyping stages. 9:30 PM PST, April 18, 2006.</p>
<p>-Disagree with deletion. I have been aquainted with Skytran/Unimodal for ,ore then 4 years. It is a ligitmate concept that has a solid theoretical basis. 10:25 pm PDT April 18, 2006</p>
<p>-Disagree with deletion. The idea looks quite fleshed-out to me; I see useful/interesting information in this page. But as Christer mentioned above, it may be worthwhile to refactor the Personal Rapid Transit group of pages. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricTalevich_5ffc.html" title="User:EricTalevich">EricTalevich</a> 05:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>DISAGREE with deletion. The unimodal skytran idea has been in published form for more than five years. The concept has been endorsed by Professor Jerry Schneider, in an issue of I.D. Magazine (International Design), and in Scientific American, January 2000. There seems to be one particular vocal individual who for whatever reason is against even the idea of modal/skytran in Wiki. The term "mode" as dictionary defined can mean one way of doing something, such as in transportation, or logical. Obviously that would apply here with this concept. Practical or not, feasible or not, this is a company that has an idea and patented invention that regardless of its current status of development or implementation does exist and should remain on Wiki. Just because a person does not like the concept, does not warrant the entry to be deleted. They just need to find something else better to do and let ideas like unimodal/skytran be available for others to read and learn about.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.254.36.138 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.254.36.138.html" title="User talk:64.254.36.138">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.254.36.138_30b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.254.36.138">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Furthermore, it is quite notable for many people as it is one of the oldest summer camps in the country.

<li><b>Comment</b> The notability of this particular camp is not the issue. Wikipedia is designed to be an informational resource for all internet users, researching all subjects. The site includes thousands of articles about people and places that can hardly be considered notable. Their removal, however, would be extremely detrimental to the usefulness of the site. Naturally, Wikipedia is not the obvious research destination for all subjects, simply because other resources exist that can provide more comprehensive information. It is, however, the obvious destination for an internet user looking for basic information on an obscure, or even seemingly unimportant, subject. Therefore, so long as the information contained in this article is true, the fact that the subject is not a household name is entirely irrelevant. -Colin Mead <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.185.240.121.html" title="User:132.185.240.121">132.185.240.121</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/2/User_talk%7E132.185.240.121.html" title="User talk:132.185.240.121">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.185.240.121_7496.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.185.240.121">contribs</a>).</small>

The search on Wikipedia works differently than Google's search. In order to find an article here you have to know the name of it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I Agree the website is still underdeveloped but the print version seems to be the main issue here. If anyone has any detailed information on it he should add it. I've seen the flyers but not the magazine, it's possible the first issue only came out recently. I've also heard of the <i>citizen culture</i> contest, so I would wait for more information before deleting it. Right now, I don't think it hurts to leave it awhile and see if anything is added.

<li><b>Comment</b> I started this article because I believe print magazines usually imply a certain commitment on the part of creators, while there are millions of dead websites written by bored teens out there. As you can see in my article on <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zembla.html" title="Zembla">Zembla</a>, I think there's value in writing about printed magazines that present new approaches or ideas, even if they didn't last too long. I hope to get hold of a copy of <i>Smyles &amp; Fish</i> soon and expand the article on it. If anyone has a principle objection to any sort of article, I would really like to hear it (If the article reads like an ad I apologize, at any rate, I'm not sure what kind of promotional value it has, it's not linked to, or feeding off, some popular article). I'm looking forward to responses, I'm here to learn. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshcroftIleum_5918.html" title="User:AshcroftIleum">AshcroftIleum</a> 08:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody disputes their commitment. In a few years when they have a circulation in the tens of thousands or more and are widely discussed in secondary sources they can certainly have an article, but right now the magazine is too new and too small to have the amount of coverage required to ensure that it can be covered in line with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>; also per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> it might fall into the category of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (an indiscriminate collection of information).

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for a link that actually works (even though I can read almost no Russian). Perhaps it would be appropriate to <b>Move</b> the page to reflect the more common name of "Kolibri OS." Also, I don't like having a direct link to a software download right at the beginning of the article. This makes it appear to be a form of <b>advertising</b> to me, as does much of the language at the bottom of the page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: thanks. However, there are still only 325 unique results and many, perhaps most, are irrelevant.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Okay guys, this is the original writer of this article speaking. I have been extremely busy as of late and have not had a chance to edit this article further. I plan to expand this article quite a bit once I get a chance (which is why it is a stub. . . .) Once I get a chance to work on this further it will be an article that is a lot longer than it currently is - maybe about twice as long as, say, <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Line_d737.html" title="Power Line">Power Line</a>.</li>

<dd>I must respectfully disagree with the statement that <a href="http://www.regenerateourculture.com" class="external text" title="http://www.regenerateourculture.com" rel="nofollow">Regenerate Our Culture</a> is an "obscure weblog". Google PageRank rates it at a "5" - which is pretty high for an "obscure weblog". All articles published on this site are rigorously edited and re-edited (I know from personal experience). There are hundreds and hundreds of sites which link to ROC using its <i>macromedia link button</i> - which might explain why Alexa cannot read it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a quote from the WP:NOT page: "Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so." That is one reason that I made a stub - so that the rest of the Wikipedia could have an opportunity to contribute and I would not be doing it all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I did not create this page in order to advertise for ROC; the hundreds of websites that link to them are doing an excellent job of that already. I created it so that the Wikipedia community could compile 'neutral' information on a relevant topic that people might want to see - which is the whole point of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is famous for delivering a NPOV on just about every topic imaginable - which is what makes it so popular. ROC is not an obscure weblog, nor is this stub the extent of the article that will eventually exist if you guys help out. Help improve Wikipedia by getting more information about ROC and similar programs and making new pages!</dd>

<dd>This isn't really a POV issue, else I'd have just stuck a template up at the top of the Talk page and tried to clean up the article a bit. The reason I submitted this article for AfD is that firstly, it appears to be an advertisement; and secondly, it does not appear to be a notable subject for a Wikipedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No offense intended, but I don't believe that that the article you created can pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">Notability</a> for web content. According to that guideline, Regenerate Our Culture should either have been: "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself", the recepient of "a well known and independent award", or "distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster". As far as I can tell, Regenerate Our Culture meets none of these standards, and is therefore not considered to be notable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, the article reads like an advertisement for a group of bloggers, with a "this article is a stub" thrown in at the bottom. A person not Assuming Good Faith might think that it's nothing more than blog-spam hiding behind stub status. IMO, whether or not you flesh out the article doesn't make Regenerate Our Culture any more of a notable subject; which is why I submitted this article for AfD to begin with. If anything, I think you should just let the AfD go through, and then once you've got a fully fleshed-out article ready just stick the whole thing right back up. That way you can take all the time you need to write up a really good article, and you won't have to deal with AfDs while you're trying to do so. I think the article would have a much better chance of standing up to an AfD for notability if it were filled with lots of relevant, verifiable info presented in an NPOV manner.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you might want to consider copying the relevant parts of your defense to the article's Talk page, so that it'll be easier to find and use in the future. Cheers! <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortelrye_df48.html" title="User:Nortelrye">Nortelrye</a> 03:32, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hear what you are saying about Notability. However, the notability page is not official WP policy. I would contend that a site receiving in the neighborhood of 2500 unique hits per day is notable enough.</dd>
<dd>I would let the AfD go through except for these two points-in-question:
<ul>
<li>The Regenerate Our Culture blog network and online magazine is plenty notable for Wikipedia,</li>
<li>The WP:NOT page recommends that editors directly involved with a subject not be the primary writers of an article on that subject, so I want other people to contribute so it's not just my private opinion.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To clarify: this page was never intended to be and will not be an advertisment page, and even though ROC does not fit the "notability" criteria on a non-official policy page, its PageRank and astronomical hit count constitute plenty of "notability".</dd>
<dd>I understand your concerns, Nortelrye. But how about taking off the AfD and instead helping to improve the article yourself (like I said, I don't want to contribute too much) and once it is fully fleshed out then decide whether it should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>Thanks so much, guys!</dd>

<dd>You're right, Notability is nothing more than a guideline, it's not official policy. However, WP:NOT *is* official policy. It really does seem that the ROC article is little more than an advertisement, and so under WP:NOT and the Deletion policy it ought to be removed - it seems pretty straightforward to me, and judging by the votes on this page, I'm not the only one who feels that way. If you'd like to get other people to flesh it out, perhaps you could copy the article to your Talk page and get people to work on it there? Once it's no longer obvious blog-spam, it would probably stand a better chance of surviving an AfD when you re-post it. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortelrye_df48.html" title="User:Nortelrye">Nortelrye</a> 22:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
