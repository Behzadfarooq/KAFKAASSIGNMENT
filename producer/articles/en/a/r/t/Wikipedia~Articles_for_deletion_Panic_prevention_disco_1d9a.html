<p>An article about a mixtape that a musician used to give out at gigs. While the musician is (barely) notable enough to warrant an article, these tapes are not. Speedy deletion tags repeatedly removed by the author of the article.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> One review, a mention of the tapes being given out, I don't think these references demonstrate this tape is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ok, few things you have got wrong: "Barely notable?", If you haven't heard of a fairly popular UK charting artist have the decency to admit it rather than making out he is extremely obscure. The tapes are still handed out at gigs and are fairly important to those researching this upcoming musician. Yes its a cult thing, but it seems if we left things up to you, we would only have articles on U2 and some other bland mainstream rubbish. Another thing, is it really worth all this hassle? i see nothing wrong with it being seperate. it definately doesn't merit this kind of arrogant fuss that comes from wiki-superiors and general meddlers.

<li>Lay off the personal attacks, please. What position exactly did these mix tapes reach in the charts? This isn't about the notability of the musician, whoever he is. It's about the notability of the tapes. They're mentioned in the Jamie article, and you can expand that section of the article (and if you feel like it, write a whole chapter on them).

<p>I would like to add that the mixtapes are very relevant because it is a large part of the artists success and why there was so much hype from magazines like NME. It has itself resulted in a boom in mixtapes amongst the independent music scene in the UK, from just normal kids, to other bands etc. Since this artist has an album out in january and is predicted by prominent mainstream faces of the UK music scene like NME and Zane Lowe of being a massive success i think it is important to anyone researching him. He is also signed to Virgin records, just to give you an idea of the scale.--Joeshawuk 19:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the links that you have provided:
<ul>
<li>1) <b>drownedinsound</b> - interview with artist's manangement team with a splash of hyperbole</li>
<li>2) <b>factmagazine</b> - tells us that he makes mix tapes. This was not disputed</li>
<li>3) <b>canvasmag</b> - informs us that there are mixtapes. Again - This is not disputed.</li>
<li>4) <b>jamie-t</b> - the artists own site. This counts as self referential citation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These links don't appear to do anything that supports your case. If you can cite evidence to support your claims (re: NME hype, the mixtape boom) then there might be something worthwhile. In the meantime, wikipedia is not a primary source of information - for anybody researching the artist, or his work, it is a starting point that collates sourcesm but doesn't make any conclusions itself. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincess_Tiswas_8ce5.html" title="User:Princess Tiswas">Princess Tiswas</a> 12:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
