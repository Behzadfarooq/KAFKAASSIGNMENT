<li><b>Delete.</b> In-joke within a fairly restricted little coterie of netizens. No significant usage outside of one particular newsgroup, talk.origins. (Google groups search: 88 hits total, 77 of them in talk.origins). "Godwin's law" gets 54,900, BTW, so this is about 0.16% as notable; if you take into account that Godwin's law is mentioned in many, many groups but "Salem hypothesis" basically only in one, it becomes even less encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:51, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A lot of work has gone into the production of this list (which would more acurately be titled Medical schools in Europe and Russia or Medical schools of rank in Europe and Russia (I don't know what this rank is, but I've never had any connection to a Medical school). I have started the wikifcation of it, and after the best part of an hour I've done the sections pertaining to Italy, Russia and France.

It is linked only from <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_schools_in_europe.html" title="Medical schools in europe">Medical schools in europe</a> - a redirect page.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. 5 users voted keep. 5 users voted to delete. One person voted "merge and delete" which must be interpreted as keep despite the plain wording of their vote. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the article (in some form) defaults to keep.</p>
<p>Looking further into this discussion, I note that the second edit to this article added a great deal of content which I strongly suspect of being an unsourced excerpt from the book. That would constitute a copyright violation. The contributor was an anonymous editor who only made the one edit to the page and has not returned to Wikipedia since.</p>
<p>After stripping out the suspected copyvio material, this article is left with a definition of what even the keep voters admitted was a neologism. I am going to exercise my discretion as an ordinary editor to merge and redirect this article to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html#Definition" title="Discrimination">Discrimination#Definition</a>. When the concept of rankism is much more widely discussed, I believe it may become appropriate to break this back out to a separate article. In the meantime, I believe that future readers will be better served if rankism is discussed in context with the other, more established forms of discrimination. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:31, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Coined in 2003, and with only 3800 hits on google (with this article being 6th - not a good sign), not a big -ism in the grand scheme of things. I don't deny that this concept exists, but its a superset of all discrimination -isms, all of which exist in much more and much better defined terms. So, to sum that up, it's a non-notable neologism. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">hfool</a>/<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">Roast me</a> 04:05, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The relevance of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manneken_Pis_6be5.html" title="Manneken Pis">Manneken Pis</a> is that it was a Flemish statue in a city <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> where the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish.html" title="Flemish">Flemish</a> were culturally opressed by the <i>bourgeois</i> French-speaking part of the population. The action was also a call for education in Flemish in Flander's universities. It was an (albeit a tiny) item of world news back in 1963 because of its symbolic value and preceded the famous European student revolts of May '68 in Paris and other major European cities...
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but the <i>article</i> doesn't really put the history and actions of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikings.html" title="Wikings">Wikings</a> in this context, does it? Nor does it cite any references or even say when this abduction took place. I tend towards keep mostly because of the age and a gut feeling that this is <i>probably</i> an important group in its own context. When you post an article about a student society, of which there are dozens at every university, you have to explain why it is notable enough to be in a general purpose encyclopedia. More on history and more on the historical context and what effects it may have had on its academic or political environment. Important former members, people who started their political careers in the context of the society etc. A lot of student societies don't do anything but partying and that is perhaps fine for a brief mention in a general section on the student life at the university, but not for an article of its own. You have to think about who is going to read something you write. A lot about the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikings.html" title="Wikings">Wikings</a> may already be known or at least vaguely familiar to the readers of the Netherlands Wikipedia, but <i>here</i> on en:WP (or any other language version) that has to be stated explicitely. OK, sorry for the rant, but the article doesn't really make its own case. If it had, it probably wouldn't have been nominated for deletion. Please work on it a bit more. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 20:15, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I removed the POV part about "significant following". The article needs stub-expansion, though. I would estimate, given that it has 290 members, that's it's borderline on the "audience of 5000" (they allow anons to read, and a 20-to-1 ratio is reasonable) criterion. If anyone tries to spam by further linking it in with the wiki, then cut that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 08:29, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, websites can easily gain an audience of 5000 without ever being noteworthy. Wasn't that criterion for books/authors?

<li><b>Delete</b> Unbelievable... Let me provide some more insight. User:Nick0r kept inserting links to cardschat.com on various articles (note:Nick0r admitted it was his site, and the nameservers are at nick0r.co.uk). I explained to him that they were spam, why the site was non-notable, etc. Now just a few days later isn't it amazing that an article on cardschat.com pops up? Anyway, considering the merits of the article and the forum itself, it's not at all notable, has only a handful of members and a couple dozen threads. As a comparison, a large forum (and potentially notable because some poker pros post there) would be cardplayer.com (CardPlayer Magazine). <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 16:44, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Clearly this is not a major player in email clients, and quite possibly it doesn't deserve it's own article, but I'm trying to get something done here in terms of comparing various email clients, even the ones in early development. The author is interested in this article even though I didn't meet him prior to writing this article. However, I don't want to break any specific Wikipedia rules. Would it be more acceptable if I created a Miscellaneous Email Clients article and put in my comments about all of the currently non-notable email clients there? I would be happy to fix the opinion statement, but I think that if it doesn't result in a huge bloat in articles there could be a miscellaneous catch all article for anything that isn't yet notable. Would there be a problem with that? I'm trying for completeness, rather than just noteworthiness. I think it is noteworthy that there are a lot of development efforts going on in this area now&#160;:-) I looked in the VfD page, and I couldn't find anything on being "notable" could someone please point me to the text on that subject?
<ul>
<li>You might consider making a "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_email_clients.html" title="List of email clients">List of email clients</a>" and putting comments about less significant ones in that. (Excuse me not trying to explain what 'notable' means, the definition seems to be different for everyone. Try <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> instead.) I vote <b>merge</b>/redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_email_clients.html" title="List of email clients">List of email clients</a> or some similar article if created. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:48, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't disagree that gitmail is not particularly "notable", however, I'll be darned if I can find anything policy-wise on Wikipedia that would reject an article soley on that basis. The importance article is not official policy, just suggested policy. And it's quite subjective as what's important to one person is not to another. Is it really "important" to have articles on every single minor character in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>? I mean <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Ravenclaws_0e8f.html" title="Minor Ravenclaws">Minor Ravenclaws</a> is really on the verge of absolute irrelevance even if you are a major Harry Potter fan! Of course, it does give precidence for a list of unimportant things. I'd really like to see a logical argument that the article should be deleted based upon concrete Wikipedia policy, not just a few opinions. Otherwise, anarchy reigns. If we can't come to a consensus to leave the article as is, I would propose that we create a Minor Email Clients or some such thing that can be divided off when things do become major, and make this a redirect page to there. I've seen some very compelling arguments that Wikipedia should be as comprehensive as possible. After all, when you are pushing half a million articles, it gets harder to cherry pick good articles that don't exist yet&#160;:-)</li>

<li>I agree with Jfdwolff that information on this subject should be kept, and not just in individual entries. But it should probably be agglomerated by disease in List of...

<p>This article should be merged with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>. It is mainly about David's interaction with Jonathan, which has been the subject of universal speculation but still not enough to warrant its own article. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 09:02, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: as the nominator mentioned, it's "been the subject of universal speculation." But I think there <i>is</i> enough to merit a full article: certainly a fully expanded discussion of Jonathan and David debate would bog down their individual articles. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 09:40, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. Most of the narrative information should be pared. I'm unfamiliar with WP policy with Biblical citations, but speaking for myself having a citation every sentence is death to readablity. There are NPOV problems as well. The article's whole reason for existence, the debate over the nature of the relationship, is actually rather threadbare. Needs a whole lot of work, but the subject is worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhanartist_5a5c.html" title="User:Khanartist"><font color="green">Khanartist</font></a> 10:46, 2005 Jan 17 (UTC)

<li>Your comment about the readability is well noted. I (and I hope others) plan to improve on this in the future, but cut me some slack! It's only been up for two days!! I was just quickly trying to outline the bare bones of the story and the debate surrounding it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting article! I found the article to be thought provoking and unbiased. The author provides substantial reasons in support of both viewpoints. This article should be on its own page since it is an in depth discussion on the relationship between David and Jonathan. Figaroo 02:02, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The page for <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> is already fairly substantial, and it doesn't seem right to crowd it with this. I only started it two days ago!! I haven't had time to really expand it more. Right now it's just an outline. I hope to expand on the narrative and both interpretations, with external links and citations. I was also going to add a section on its similiarity to the same-sex warrior love relationships common to that era of writing (such as between <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgamesh.html" title="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/k/Enkidu.html" title="Enkidu">Enkidu</a> in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Epic_of_Gilgamesh_0ddc.html" title="The Epic of Gilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a> which parallels this narrative similiarly). It's too much info for the David page, and this article has enough substance to stand on its own.

<p>A long, earnest essay about, or precis of one issue of, or perhaps the whole of one issue of, this zine.

Because of that, however, it's important that we as nihilists uphold the value of trolling, since discourse is dead." So prepare for fireworks!) Those matters aside, the coverage is non-encyclopedic.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. 3 clear "delete" votes, 2 clear "redirect" and one "delete and redirect" which must be interpreted as "keep". The decision defaults to "keep".</p>
<p>Reviewing the article, I concur with the assessment that there is nothing to merge. Therefore, I will do a redirect without merge. By the way, my personal vote is redirect for two reasons. 1) Redirects are cheap. 2) It might prevent the article from reappearing. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:53, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I think this article consists of accurate statements about widely held opinions. Jimbo has said that "facts about opinions" are legitimate. I took a fairly careful look the Mac OS section and have no doubt that all of the opinions mentioned <i>could</i> easily be backed up by citations. That they <i>aren't</i> is an obvious weakness, which can be fixed. I saw no obvious evidence of bias in the article. It is a reasonable summary of the "conventional wisdom."

<li><b>Keep</b>. the NPOV policy doesn't mean what you think it means, Alistair; an article that describes POVs is itself NPOV as long as it doesn't take a stance on whether any of those POVs is actually true. Quoting from the policy: "when one writes neutrally, one is very careful not to state (or imply or insinuate or subtly massage the reader into believing) that any particular view at all is correct." As long as this article is merely describing the various common arguments that are made, it's fine. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 22:17, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Not Sure</b> I made some contributions to know-how wiki. I seem to remember reading about know-how wiki in a newspaper article too, so it could regarded as 'well-known'. It was quite a clever idea of a wiki (unusual approach for formatting the information), and a free and open resource just like wikipedia. As for whether wikipedia should have a article on it... I guess that depends. I don't know what the normal policy is on articles about websites. Also the website is offline at the moment (has been for a month or so), which I guess counts against it! -- <a href="../../../n/o/j/User%7ENojer2_32fa.html" title="User:Nojer2">Nojer2</a> 23:59, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree the idea behind the site has great potential, and I hope something else like it springs up... just think, an open "How to do everything" manual.

<li><b>Comment</b> If the wiki were still live, I'd lean toward inclusion on the basis that, well, our bar for wikis should be a little bit lower than for other web phenomena. I get the message "Forbidden: You don't have permission to access /~paquetse/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi on this server," though, which suggests that at the moment it basically doesn't exist, in which case I don't think it merits and article.

<li>I'm shocked that that statement has gone unchallenged for 2.5 days! Yes, Wiki is in some sense the religion, or at least passion, of WP editors. But that only emphasizes the PoV involved in saying "Wikis are special in WP." Special in the WP: namespace, fine; they <b>must not</b> be treated any differently from other software topics in the article namespace. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 15:51, 2005 Jan 22 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> Know-How Wiki was running up until at least December 2004, when it was being hit very heavily by wiki spam. I assume the site owners had to take it down because the spam overloaded the site. The article could be updated to reflect those facts. It seemed like a useful idea for a Wiki and had some interesting content. The site may be gone, but the concept has not.

Wikipedia strongly discourages original research. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">Verifiability</a> means more than just "go try it".

<p>The Metanet article appears to be something like original research or a vanity page. The article reads more like a technical proposal for Metanet than like an encyclopedia article about Metanet. In several places it asserts minor points of view, e.g. "Unfortunately, membership is by invitation only" (only unfortunate if you hold the POV that participation is important), "Implementing an anonymous network on a service by service basis has its drawbacks," and the section evaluating various threats to Metanet stating how "worrisome" they are.</p>
<p>Rather than informing the reader of Metanet's existence and explaining its purpose, history, and characteristics, the article seems to be aimed at readers who already accept the need for such a network and are interested in reading about how it could be done. (In fact the article offers no proof that Metanet even exists other than as somebody's fantasy; if there is a Metanet website, a true external link to it rather than to IRC channels would be a good start toward making the article encyclopedic.)</p>
<p>The Metanet proponent seems to be advertising "his" article about Metanet on at least slashdot: <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136334&amp;cid=11387401" class="external free" title="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136334&amp;cid=11387401" rel="nofollow">http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136334&amp;cid=11387401</a> .

<li><b>Do not delete</b>, this is the only reliable source of info we have on these networks. Entry-points to multiple different meta-nets can be found on IRC. Due to the highly private nature of these networks it makes sense that people are saying "We can't find these networks". That's the point. If you haven't been invited, you'll have a hard time finding one. That doesn't mean this page contains invalid/inappropriate/untrue information. If the page is deleted it will simply be submitted again. Also, the author of this "delete" article fails to realize there are MANY meta-nets. There isn't just one. Rumour has it two of them may be linking up at some point but that's about all I can say. This "delete" proposal is unfounded editorialism at best.</li>

<dd>Why is this article a "reliable source of info"? It <i>may</i> be true, but without verifiable references there is no way for anyone to know. Without verifiability, it remains as you say, a "rumour". Rumours have no place in an encyclopedia. You have it backwords, it is the proposals to keep which are, so far, "unfounded" the burdened of proof, falls on those wanting to keep, not delete. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 05:38, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I consider myself an "expert on the matter" and I am verifying right now that at least one metanet exists, seeing as how I am a member of one. Seeing as how the Wiki entry is fairly broad and general in its descriptions, that makes the entry hard to verify automatically. That doesn't mean impossible, just hard. The fact that some of the information is hard to verify does NOT lessen its validity or accuracy. I'm telling you, as a member of an actual metanet exactly as described, that the article is accurate and perfectly valid. You appear to have a very "guilty until proven innocent" type of attitude about this matter, which I believe goes against the concept of this site and its goals.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I have spoken with the author of that slashdot post, he did NOT submit this page, and thus is clearly not using it to promote his network, seeing as how, quite clearly, a member or owner of some other Metanet submitted the page. I know him well enough to know he is telling the truth. He actually wasn't even aware of the Metanet entry on wikipedia until someone else pointed it out to him. Don't make conclusions upon things you can't prove.</li>
</ul>
<p>note: for those criticizing the unverifiability of the article, notice the 3rd "external link" which allows you to actually *connect to a metanet* for evaluation purposes. It doesn't get much more verifiable than that.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Metanet exists. The idea of "evaluation purposes" is silly. If you can't figure out how to get on Metanet from a 'public router' then you shouldn't be on anyhow. It sounds like many want this entry deleted because they can't get on. Are we going to delete entries on religion because some people don't get it?</li>

<p>Pretty close to patent nonsense, but I figured I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Complete text at time of VfD is: "Am i neutral being?" Possibly D&amp;D related? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:12, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm ready to take the heat in case anyone disagrees, but this was more than "pretty close to patent nonsense". Entire content was "Am i neutral being?". I've speedied it accordingly. -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 22:29, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addendum: For the record, it's not D&amp;D related but related to the TV series <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmed.html" title="Charmed">Charmed</a>. There has been lots of fun with charmed-related articles already - some people have spent lots of time creating dozens of substubs about totally nonnotable minor characters, copy/pasting lots of copyrighted material into different "list of..."-articles etc., then recreating all that stuff after it had been deleted. If you ever have a bored afternoon, follow the links from the main Charmed article and dig around the edit histories of the related articles -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 22:35, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, based on my understanding, "patent nonsense" by the WP definition refers primarily to random or semi-random words or characters. An article named "etjpforijgp" or "Monkey soapdish shadowfax mudskipper" would certainly be considered Patent Nonsense. I'm not sure that this qualifies, as some might see real-article potential in the Charmed Neutral Beings concept. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you on this one though, as I won't miss this silly little article one bit.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:45, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We have actual content, apparently, at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Charmed_Good_Beings_895e.html" title="List of Charmed Good Beings">List of Charmed Good Beings</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Charmed_Evil_Beings_e3e2.html" title="List of Charmed Evil Beings">List of Charmed Evil Beings</a>. This does not make the article that was deleted any less patent nonsense, since unlike these other articles the deleted content contains <i>nothing</i> that would answer anyone's questions about neutral beings on <i>Charmed</i>. It seemed more like sandbox play or confusion than an attempt to create an article, which makes it patent nonsense under the local definition. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 20:28, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>&lt;boilerplate&gt; Wikipedia is not a way for web-loggers to advertise their curricula vitae to potential employers and their web-logs to potential readers.

<li>Good point. Groups shows just under 300 results, but those DO go all the way back to 1999. But while we're looking at Google tabs, over on the News tab, it seems Klausfiles has been mentioned on NPR, The Washington Post, and American Politics Journal, among others... and that's just within the last couple weeks. I completely understand what you mean by Googlebombing but this just doesn't seem non-notable to me, at least not in the way that term is usually used around here. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:13, Jan 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is the bad precedent? That there should be articles on blogs? The only way an article on this shouldn't be in Wikipedia is if we are going to have zero articles on blogs. I would put this in the top 10, say, most significant blogs. In VfD, we are voting on whether the topic merits an article, not on whether the article currently does justice to the topic. If the subject merits an article and the article is poor, it should be retained and marked for cleanup, or attention. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:05, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Kausfiles is clearly notable being one of the first political weblogs by a notable journalist with a significant readership. During the 2003 recall, Kausfiles made a post breaking the story of Arnold Schwarzegger's interview with <i>Oui</i> magazine talking of participating in group sex which led to other allegations of sexual misconduct by the candidate. Mickey Kaus should also have an article as he is notable for his 1992 book <i>The End of Equality</i> which was significant in the move towards <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_reform.html" title="Welfare reform">welfare reform</a> and his earlier journalism career.

<li>It almost hurts to say this, but <b>Delete</b>. There is some good advice here, and it's obvious someone put a fair amount of effort into writing this. But it just isn't an encyclopedia article, and the basicness and childish tone ("...can't play worth jack shit...") would make transwikiing not likely worth it. PS: The part I found most amusing was <i>"Use acoustic guitars when first writing songs. This can be done outside of practice, even at school with the two guitarists"</i> It sounds like he's advocating playing acoustic guitars <i>while at school</i>.
