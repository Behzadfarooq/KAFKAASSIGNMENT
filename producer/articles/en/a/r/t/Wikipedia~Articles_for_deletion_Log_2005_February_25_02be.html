<li><b>Delete</b> TV personalities are a tough case because they're often close to the inclusion line. Unfortunately, I'd say she's close in the wrong direction.

<li>Unsubstantiated? Every statement in the article is backed up with a verifiable source. Is there anything specific that you disagree with or can contend to? In not, there is no justification for removing this information. --Ghost of Jefferson
<ul>
<li>Every statement might be backed up, however the fact that they are all related to the execution of the 9/11 attacks is not. As it is, the article is a bag of statements with no real connection between them and the attacks. Also, there is no visible link between the first and the second parts of the article. The article looks too much like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 03:35, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Any useful information should be included in one of the many other 9/11 articles. This article also needs so much cleanup that it likely wouldn't be worth the effort. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 03:41, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please do not delete.</b> I apologize for all the confusion. I originally included this material in the "Planning and Execution" section, however the page became too large. In order to clean it up I separated "Planning" and "Execution" into two separate categories. The "Financial Support" doesn't exactly fit the title but I believe the information is very relevant and should remain someplace on the site. I'll admit that it needs clean up, but I plan on improving and expanding both parts of the article in the near future. In response to this being <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, there are no "new theories" proposed in the text; it is all documented information. In response to CesarB, the war games <i>are</i> connected to the execution of the attacks for the following reasons: Officials at NEADS and the FAA originally considered the hijackings to be part of Vigilant Guardian and acting CJCS Richard Myers reported Vigilant Warrior as conflicting with fighter response. NORAD's already limited amount of fighters were participating in a bi-national live-fly exercise that pulled Air Force resources away from NEADS and towards Alaska and the North Pole. False blips had been injected onto FAA and military radar screens. A nuclear strike/retaliation was being simulated and planes were sitting on the ground armed with nuclear weapons. The NRO and the CIA were simulating a plane crashing into their headquarters. And there were other exercises that have yet to be investigated, such as Apollo Guardian and Crown Vigilance. This information is almost impossible to find, and I would argue that Wikipedia is the only place that it is fully and objectively documented. I am therefore issuing a plea to the community to keep this information available and accessible to all Wikipedians. --Ghost of Jefferson

<p><b>According to the Popular Mechanics article</b>: <i>"In the decade before 9/11, NORAD intercepted only one civilian plane over North America: golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet, in October 1999."</i><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> However the Associated Press reported on August 12, 2002: <i>"From Sept. 11 to June, NORAD scrambled jets or diverted combat air patrols 462 times, almost seven times as often as the 67 scrambles from September 2000 to June 2001, Martin said.</i></p>
<p><i>In June, Air Force jets scrambled three times to intercept small private planes that had wandered into restricted airspace around the White House and around Camp David, the presidential retreat."<a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/020812ap" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/020812ap" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></i></p>
<p>Popular Mechanics also states <i>"it took an F-16 1 hour and 22 minutes"</i> to reach Payne Stewart's jet, however <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> of <i>The Knight-Ridder Tribune</i> reported on October 26, 1999 the following...</p>
<p><i>"according to an Air Force timeline, a series of military planes provided an emergency escort to the stricken Lear, beginning with a pair of F-16 Falcons from the Air National Guard at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., about 20 minutes after ground controllers lost contact."</i><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dmn.orig" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dmn.orig" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dallasmorningnews" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dallasmorningnews" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>Popular Mechanics also states: <i>"Rules in effect back then, and on 9/11, prohibited supersonic flight on intercepts."'</i> However ABC News reported in September 2002, after interviewing the pilots, that the fighters scrambled on 9/11 were traveling at <i>"mach 1.2, nearly 900 mile per hour."</i><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/attack/abcnews091102_jenningsinterviews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/attack/abcnews091102_jenningsinterviews.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>All the other points made in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a> article refer to the ridiculous claims made on letsroll911.org, which never really required a debunking because very few people believe in such garbage. Most people questioning the government's official story don't believe in missile/pod theories. In fact, they have risen some very valid arguments, however such people are usually shadowed by-, grouped with-, or dismissed as-"conspiracy theorists". Incredibly, the points in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a> article that <i>do</i> refer to the topic I've been discussing, as shown above, are false. --Ghost of Jefferson</p>

The wargames threw off NORAD and it is important for people to understand this.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'd had some difficulty making this decision, but the new edits of the page have me sold.

<li>DEFINITE <b>KEEP</b>ER because he is a part of the history of the 2004 Presidential Election. He had scoops about the CBS story and the internals of the Bush 2004 campaign that will be important for future historians to know just how the Blogosphere was developed and how it became a force in American Politics. Liberals may disagree with him but I would say he is just as important to add to the wikipedia as probably Kos is. Because without telling either of those two names how are future historians going to know about this election? <i>unsigned comment from 70.21.52.143</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreeing with his politics should not be a criteria, it is whether he was involved with or has done anything significant. He was involved in the CBS document story and other stories pertaining to the election and his a current writer for NRO. All the other writers for NRO are considered worthy of Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>No one is suggesting his politics should be a criteria. Many writers and reporters were "involved" with the CBS document story, he was not involved in any significant way.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Geraghty did not break the forgery story but he reported it extensively on a day by day basis (essentially running the story) for NRO and National Review. That is what reporters do. While I would agree it was not to the same level as Powerline and LGF, it was significant. Most of the writers for <i>The Nation</i> have seperate pages as do all the other contributors for <i>National Review</i>. To describe Geraghty as "just another blogger" is not true.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just so we're all clear on this: Ross Jr. isn't some executive-producer figurehead type. He also did the voices of Alvin (the main Chipmunk), Theodore, and Dave Seville in nearly every Chipmunks production from 1972 onward, as well as producing and writing many of them too. This includes their big hit TV series that ran through the 80s for nearly a decade, their feature film, and several videos. He's not as important as his dad was, and most of us probably wouldn't recognise him on the street, but virtually everyone in the civilized world has heard his voice at least once. It's impossible to imagine why he shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:38, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The present <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%27s_theorem.html" title="Bell's theorem">Bell's theorem</a> page contains the description of only one of the Bell inequalities. This inequality is not the one Bell originally derived, is derived in an unnecessarily restricted manner, using non-standard notation, and is not accompanied by a clear description of how it is to be applied. To merely re-direct the current page to Bell's theorem is therefore not reasonable. As a source of information on the inequalities, the present page is totally inadequate. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:39, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nevertheless, this appears to be an actual POV fork in the correct sense of the term, where the information, <i>if true</i>, belongs in the main original article -- the very one to which you are suggesting the material might be returned. Creating a new article that has a different title but is actually on the same subject, so that you can get in information that consensus will <i>not</i> let you get in the main article, is a POV fork and it's not a legitimate way to deal with a failure to get your material approved by consensus. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:15, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Right, so the material should be returned to the main article, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%27s_theorem.html" title="Bell's theorem">Bell's theorem</a>. The notation in the new sections of this introduced by CSTAR is non-standard, though, so somebody will need to do a considerable amount of editing to convert it.

It is necessary for this purpose to make it clear that there is more than one Bell inequality and that they are not all equivalent. [The statement that a Bell inequality has been violated carries different degrees of weight according as to <i>which</i> Bell inequality was used (and, incidentally, what adjustments may have been made to the data before analysis).] It is also necessary to use consistent notation. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 18:02, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fear the above opinion is made in ignorance of some of the facts. Dr Chinese has elsewhere expressed the opinion that all the various inequalities are equivalent. Though this is widely believed it is not true, which is why the page is necessary. Different inequalities involve different assumptions, over and above the basic ones of local realism. Some inequalities have been used in practical applications, some not. Can it really be the case (as recent discussions have seemed to indicate) that wikipedia is totally uninterested in expanding human knowledge and correcting misconceptions, only in regurgitating that which is (in the opinion of the few who take part) already "well known"? Are people unable to read for themselves and see from the page that what is "well known" is, in this instance, clearly wrong? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 22:05, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> (or partial merge). Upon a Google search of Bell test loopholes, eight of the first ten entries (that is the 1st page entries) point to CT's contribution or references to it (one of the ten points to Real Estate loopholes). It doesn't get much better on te second page. What this proves is that CT's efforts have succeeded in converting WP into a vehicle for promoting her ideas.<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 17:25, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The correct thing for Uncle G to have done would have been to have (1) written the article about "John Driscoll (economist)" as a new article, if he actually believes the Federal Reserve Bank economist is notable; (2) redirected the article originally under discussion to "John Driscoll (programmer)"; (3) created a disambiguation page betweeen the JD two articles; (4) patched up the VfD so that we were discussing the deletion of "John Driscoll (programmer)". Better yet, he might have waited until after the original article was deleted, then written a new article on the economist, which would have saved effort on the disambiguation page and the patching up, wouldn't have changed the subject of the vote in mid-stream; and finally would have saved the admin who implements the vote some trouble. If he had done that, it might have occurred to him after the programmer article was deleted that the economist, although more notable than the other guy, isn't that notable either. What he has instead done has been to preempt the process for forming a consensus on whether the original John Driscoll article was vanity. Perhaps it was, but that is what we were in the process of deciding. Uncle G, who is in other respects a great Wikipedia contributor with whom I am almost always in agreement, thinks it is amusing to swoop in and change the subject of (alleged) vanity articles while they are waiting to be deleted. I can see why he thinks this is fun, but I don't think it is fair to do that until the original article has received its 5 days in court. If one person can decide that an article is vanity, then that person should be an administrator authorized to speedy-delete it. That authority was voted on recently and was not granted to administrators. The extra few days of waiting through the full VfD doesn't cost anything, and not waiting makes it seem as though the deletionists (which includes me, I guess) are in a big hurry to remove stuff from the Wikipedia. I realize I'm not making much headway with this argument. It is probably going to take Uncle G screwing around with an article that he thinks is vanity where others do not agree before he gets my point. And this is most likely not that article. Nevertheless, I make the point again. My vote: <b>Delete</b> the article. The original version on JD #1 was vanity. The current version by Uncle G on JD #2 is about a government economist who does not pass the average professor test. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:36, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The solution here would be to write the new article on the Talk page, so others can comment on or add to it. If the current nominated VfD article goes under, simply add the new article from the Talk page. If it is an entirely different individual/topic it can't really be classed as article recreation.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> reasonable but unspectacular Google score, a couple of notable products</s> Changing to <b>weak delete</b> in light of Hyperzonk's considerable research on the subject. I don't put as much stock as he does in the Alexa rank in this case, as I believe that when one wants to download free software, one is just as likely (if not more) to go somewhere like download.com or something similar than go to the developer's own site. As a result, the Alexa ranking might not be as representative of notability of a software project as it would of, say, a blog. However, I fully agree with the rest of Hyperzonk's thinking on this one. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:46, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It certainly does get a lot of Google hits, but they appear to be almost entirely self-promotional entries in open-authorship places and free download pages. Why did I look into this so deeply? Because this site's <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=ciphire.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=ciphire.com" rel="nofollow">score on Alexa</a> is the astonishingly low <b>3,790,861</b>! I'm sorry, but truly notable software companies do not rank a million places lower than my own vanity web site. On its <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ciphire/?branch_id=55733&amp;release_id=188626" class="external text" title="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ciphire/?branch_id=55733&amp;release_id=188626" rel="nofollow">freshmeat entry</a>, you will find that this software's vitality is only 0.03%, and its popularity is only 0.34%. Lastly, as I have said before, I don't care what marketing calls it, anything that has a version number beginning with zero is in <b>alpha</b>, not even in beta (call me old-fashioned if you must). As far as I can tell, the only notable thing about this software company is that it somehow managed to get a butt-load of Google hits without being either notable nor widely adopted.

<li>Okay, you got me confused. It could be the case that they're spending more effort on marketing than on actually doing something (that's a viable strategy in the shareware market, I suppose). I browsed around in their forum (which is active, but not that active) and found out that their official release date is january 11th, 2005 (that's for CiphireMail, which is their only product but will have some add-ons later on). What struck me as peculiar is that this same post says they spent <b>three years</b> in development and a fourth in testing. However, all their software purports to do is encryption and sending of e-mail, which both consists of a bunch of mathematical or logical algorithms that are widely available in open source. This seems to support the idea that they're hyping up something relatively simple, in order to make money (their current product is free but they will release a commercial version later on). Clever, I guess.
<ul>
<li>Anyway. Since the software was officially released about a month ago, I don't think it deserves an encyclopedia page until it sees some widespread usage. Given its current Alexa rating that seems unlikely.

I tried like hell to find this piece of art: the title without the artist is completely meaningless, and all the works I could find on art.com and the artcyclopedia were clearly not this work.

<li><b>Delete.</b> a) Patent nonsense, b) original research/personal essay. In present form, there is actually no context and it fits the second definition of patent nonsense, "Stuff that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irremediably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to try to make head or tail of it." This technical makes it a speedy candidate, but since the problem could be remedied if the painting were identifiable, it is reasonable to put it up for discussion here. However, even if the painting were identified, no sources for the "simple analysis" are given, so it's deletable as original research/personal essay. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:11, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC) P.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<dd>I vote NOT to delete. In my opinion, and the opinion of all former followers of Prem Rawat who have expressed an opinion, the main Prem Rawat article is 90% pro-Rawat POV. That is a natural consequence of the Wikipedia system, where articles will always reflect the opinions of those who are willing to dedicate the most time to editing. I and others were able to spend some time ensuring that the criticisms of Rawat were at least included on Wikipedia, and although I don't have the time and the inclination to police these articles full-time, after the work I put in to this article, I strongly object to it being deleted. If it was to be deleted, then all the criticisms would have to be included in the main article, which would, I understand, make it too large. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 20:07, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The proper way of dealing with that is asking for Moderation or Arbitration, not creating a new article on the same topic (because, if the new article is not locatable, it is rather pointless; if it is locatable, it merely provides a new ground for the revert war).

<dd>Radiant, the situation we have is that if a conscientious, independent, journalist were to write an article on Prem Rawat it would include all the negative aspects of his life so far. The article on Rawat is a whitewashed version of his life so far. What has happened on Wikipedia, is that we former followers of Rawat, who are most qualified to talk about those negative aspects, have been attacked, ridiculed, and marginalised. We don't have the time, inclination, nor respect in the Wikipedia process, to continously fight Rawat's supporters, so when the criticism article was created, a few of us did put the work in to ensure that readers would have the opportunity to read the information that Rawat's supporters are trying to hide. I would support merging the articles, but am loath to go through the arguments again. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:04, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's exactly my point. You claim that the article is POV. Now the procedure to follow is to discuss this with the people that hold said POV, and if that fails, ask for mediation.

<dd>Jossi, I thought I explained the level of my interest very clearly in my post. I check out the articles once a week or so, and intervene where significant changes happen or are proposed. Deletion of the article is clearly a significant change. I contributed significantly to the Criticism article. I haven't the time, the interest, nor the belief in the system to put any more time into Wikipedia. That should be clear enough for you. There is certainly nothing sinister requiring highlighting of the word 'suddenly'. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 07:44, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, not for the Rawat articles. In the end I was reasonably happy that any readers would be able to do the necessary research to avoid being ensnared by Rawat's cult. I did try to get the mention of former followers ("ex-premies") as a "hate group" removed from the Hate Group article, but to be honest, the process is so laborious, and Rawat's supporters so dedicated, I gave up. All I do now is keep an eye (maybe once a week) on the Rawat and Criticism articles to ensure that nothing too inaccurate gets included. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:28, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe that the VfD is founded on a mistaken notion of what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> means and calls for; I do not believe that it even <i>is</i> a "POV fork", let alone "the mother of all POV forks" as <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> calls it. A POV fork, to my understanding, would be if someone who didn't get his way at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a> started a new article with a title like "[[Censure of Prem Rawat]]" -- creating a second article that is in every real respect on the same topic as the first, with no <i>good</i> reason to do so and with the <i>bad</i> reason of avoiding/defying consensus in this fashion, by filling the second article with that which he had been blocked from at the first.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is <i>not</i> "forking" in that sense; it is instead separating out one aspect of a larger topic to be covered in detail in its own article. (If you try to edit <i>either</i> article right now, the editing screen will actually <i>suggest</i> to you that you do this -- that you find a way to spin some of the detail off to a new article.) Pjacobi seems to be arguing that that <i>particular</i> aspect is inherently POV, but he seems to mistake "people will clearly have strong POVs on the subject" for "the subject is clearly inherently POV". IMHO, it is <i>difficult</i> for a subject to be inherently POV; to do so it usually either has to incorporate an opinion directly into the article title or it has to commit the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_fallacy.html" title="Existential fallacy">existential fallacy</a>. Direct opinion-incorporation into the article title (like <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>'s "[[Reasons why XYZZY is bad]]" is usually so clumsy that NPOVing the title is easy and produces a better title, like "[[Criticisms of XYZZY]]". Of course, in theory the new title could be committing the existential fallacy -- but to do so, it must be making an assumption that something exists, and there must be serious dispute over that statement of existence. Is anyone actually seriously claiming that Prem Rawat has never been criticized??</dd>
<dd>A final note on the timing: this article was created eight months ago, by a self-described proud student of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Maharaji</a>. It was specifically created as a place for critical views of Prem Rawat to be aired (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&amp;oldid=4335113" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&amp;oldid=4335113" rel="nofollow">as can be easily verified</a>). For eight months, it has served that purpose. Now it's being claimed that the subject itself is inherently POV and that this merits deletion of the article? I trust that Pjacobi nominated this VfD in good faith and that he does not want a bad precedent to be set, but I can think of a worse precedent that could be set, that of separating the sub-topic "Criticism of ..." out to a separate article when the main article gets too large and then saying "No, this article shouldn't exist, we'll have to merge those parts <i>which fit</i> back into the main article." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:10, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is about one of ten VfDs on POV forks, I participated in. Just today, by random chance, I put up four of them (thanks to Andries for pointing to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>). Generally speaking, most senior editors tend to agree that all POV forks must be killed. This discussion is to clarify, whether the situation with this article is special.</dd>
<dd>But the most important things I've heard so far, is that the <i>main Prem Rawat article is 90% pro-Rawat POV</i>, that <i>The article on Rawat is a whitewashed version of his life so far</i> and that <i>Rawat's supporters [are] so dedicated, I gave up</i>. This strongly suggest to me, that the entire topic needs serious re-assessment, and merging the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a> article into the main article would be a very important first step.</dd>

<dd>Mr. Smith, a more accurate summary of the article would be "Wiki contributors give corroborated information about Rawat that Rawat supporters don't want in the main article, Rawat supporters give lame rebuttal..." Actually, I'm coming around to the view that we should merge the articles. I am willing to put the time in to ensure that only reliable sources are included. Any sources that are proven to be unreliable will have to be rejected, or quoted as such in each reference. For instance, I can prove that Elan Vital and TPRF are unreliable sources for information about Prem Rawat. The only other sources are independent media articles, and personal testimonies. Yes, let's merge the articles - should be an interesting exercise. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 23:48, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Rename the Critics in "annoyances with prem rawat" or something else and he will have an argumentation problem. Tell me jacobi, is it that the POV-fork results in a buffer overflow of the wikipedain policy stack and therefore it has to be avoided? My advice: rewrite the library. Maybe you do better some programming. Your decisions based on your lack of your ability to read properly are proven, by setting the urv-flag in ther german article because you couldn't find the author's names in the head of the article. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_h_3105.html" title="User:Thomas h">Thomas h</a> 09:50, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep - branching out criticism articles is not POV <i>if the subject is summarised in the main article</i>.

<dd>Dear 140, this isn't an issue of what I think, but what are the facts. As a follower of Rawat for 25 years, I think that other followers, and prospective followers, have the right to know the truth about Rawat. Would you follow a diet from someone who was obese? Rawat clearly does not have peace in his life otherwise he wouldn't drink heavily, smoke, cheat on his wife, and demand the best material gadgets his followers' money can buy. All these allegations have been repeatedly corroborated, as well as the fact he lies about his past. The truth might look unpleasant expressed in the stark terms I did, but for someone who makes the claims he did and still does, it is clearly in the public interest that the truth about Rawat be known. And where have I been obtuse? Anyway, looks like the consensus is now to keep the articles as they are, so you will be spared months of arguing about the validity of every source for the Prem Rawat article. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 07:38, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Don't call me dear, pleeeze! 25 years? So why did you stay with Prem rawat for 25 years? If you were so stupid to follow him for so long, what makes you now credible? The fact that you left him? How does that work? Sudden enlightenment?

<dd>I rejected Rawat largely because he, and Elan Vital, kept information about Rawat hidden from me. When I became aware of this information, I considered it, considered the good aspects of my involvement, and made my choice. I became active as I think other people should also be able to make the same informed choice. I partially agree with these statements about the bias of former followers, but I am sure everyone agrees that testimony from current followers is at least, but probably more, unreliable. I know my testimony as a follower was, although sincere, unreliable, as I wasn't aware of the facts. Being aware of my own potential for bias, I try to ensure that the facts on ex-premie.org are verified. Facts are facts - we might put different weight or spin on the facts because of our bias, but unless the facts are disputed (and Elan Vital have yet to dispute a single fact on ex-premie.org), they should stand so that interested readers can make up their own minds. The only argument I can think of for not publishing facts about a prominent person is that it could be an invasion of privacy. In the case of Rawat, as he claims to be able to teach a method of achieving personal peace, how he exemplifies this peace in his personal life is of utmost importance, and is definitely in the public interest.</dd>

<dd>The solution to the problem of current and former supporters having bias, is to have the article written by people who have never been involved, are not related to current or former members, and of course have not been hired by current or former followers. The flaw in this is that very few such people have any interest in the subject of Prem Rawat. The few independent newspaper articles that have appeared in recent years have no problem in including criticism of Rawat. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Brauns_4da7.html" title="User:John Brauns">John Brauns</a> 10:07, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep.</b> The main descriptive information about Prem Rawat is at 32KB, and could be larger. The criticism/controversy information about Prem Rawat is at 32KB, and could be larger. Attempting to include both these aspects in a single 32KB article space would lead to condensation and omission to the point of unintelligibility. Larger articles are indeed to be broken out according to topic, and that is what happened here: the criticism/controversy article is actually a large break-out Prem Rawat subtopic article. It cannot be scattered into other articles because it fills an entire 32KB article space all by itself.</p>
<p>Prem Rawat is not one article, but actually a complex of several articles: a main introductory description/history article, one on his teachings, one on his support organization, one on his father, one on criticism/controversy, one on his yoga techniques, a few other minor ones. This complex of articles, and especially the main and criticism articles, are the product of hundreds of user-hours (no exagguration) and many real-time weeks of patience, research, delicate political negotiation, wading through invective, and carefully executed and justified editing. When the process was complete, the results were an example of a balanced and informative text crafted in a polarized atmosphere where everybody had the ability at any moment to press the delete button, but managed to compromise anyway. When it was finished, we specially marked those versions in the edit history as the final reference versions, so that they could serve as baseline versions if there was too much "info creep" or "POV creep" in subsequent editing.</p>
<p>Those final reference versions represent the best and most encyclopedic, readable, and informative work complying with the 32KB rule that could be produced on this highly polarized topic in the "mutually assured deletion" Wikipedia environment. I am weak at the thought of all the work they took.

But the having a separate "Criticism of Prem Rawat" (in its current state and with it objectives) is surrendering the NPOV. The Criticism article and all other P.R. articles give totally different views about P.R. - this is the core issue, why this is an undesirable POV dork.

<dd>Interesting your use of <i>real world</i>. What is the <i>real world</i>, Antaeus? Apostate testimonies are not all equal. I am talking about the group of apostates that have been labeled <b>professional enemies</b>. Note that most people, just move on, taking with them whatever experience they had. I have several close friends that no longer practice Maharaji's teachings. They learned what they learned, they did not see the need for a teacher anymore, and they stopped being students. No big deal. Then there is the few of those that make it their purpose in life to become <i>professional enemies</i>. Some of them make a career and a living out of it. They write books, become special "witnesses", etc. Others just become consumed with their hatred of their former love. Some of them become obsessed, bordering on the pathological. Do you know that these people come together online <b>daily</b> to check the <i>latest news</i> on Maharaji, day after day, after day, after day <b>for years</b>? Regarding your assertion about the "rest of the social world", note that Sociologists have studied the subject and most agree that testimonies of professional apostates is not reliable. There is abundant research in the subject. Apostates such as the ex-premies are not an exception. They are a minuscule group, and yes, in a free society they have the right to express their point of view, as long as their actions do not impinge on other people's freedoms. Their actions speak for themselves. Since we started working on these articles, I have received hate mail of the most disgusting nature, targeting me and my family, for the only reason that I post here under my real name. Tell me that this is also part of being the <i>most valuable informants</i>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">‚âà jossi ‚âà</a> 04:09, Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, Jossi, but you're committing the <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> fallacy from the moment you classify some critics as "professional enemies". You're right that most sociologists do not regard the testimonies of "professional apostates" as reliable. That's because real scholars don't commit such a fallacious pre-classification to begin with! Tell me, if you were the Better Business Bureau, and you were trying to find out who were the good companies to do business with, and who were the ones ripping off their customers -- would you automatically classify any former customer who says that a company behaved with complete disregard for their customers and for the law, and who is angry about that, and who lets people know about it, as a "professional unsatisfied customer" who is not to be believed?! Why on earth <i>wouldn't</i> someone who was cheated and tricked by an unethical company be rightfully angry, and why on earth would it be considered evidence of bad faith for them to blow the whistle on the goings-on? And yet you're claiming that the majority of the academic world (instead of a tiny minority disproportionately relied upon by cult-structure groups) takes any public announcement of "I was cheated and tricked by an unethical group" as not just evidence, but <i>proof</i> of bad faith, of being a "professional apostate". Any so-called scholar who decides that <i>only</i> those former members who are <i>not</i> angry enough to speak up are a truthful source of infomation on whether the group did anything to be angry about is a scholar not worth his salt. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:25, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>All right, let's do that, let's talk about <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i> attacks. As you know, though it is quite often conflated (accidentally or deliberately) with the general notion of <i>any</i> sort of identification of a person or any sort of critical commentary about that person, <i>ad hominem</i> actually refers specifically to trying to disparage an argument, not by finding flaw with the argument, but by imputing flaws to the person who holds the argument, or by suggesting some particular rewards that a person would stand to gain from the triumph of their argument, and arguing that such flaws or rewards, in themselves, somehow affects the validity of the argument. So, looking at this, we can clearly see that "the testimonies of apostates are invalid because they are serving some pathological inner hatred" and "the testimonies of apostates are invalid because they are making careers out of criticism" are exactly examples of this latter type of fallacy, <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> attacks.</dd>
<dd>Now, sound academic scholarship is built on a foundation that includes a grounding in elementary logic. A college sophomore with a single course in logic under their belt should be able to see the flaws in discounting the testimonies of <i>a whole class of persons</i> based on <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> argumentation. Thus, it is shoddy scholarship to adopt such a principle, and a "scholar" who adopts such a principle is a shoddy scholar. You have now introduced the names of specific "scholars" who do in fact advocate this fallacious filtering, and you are accusing me of <i>ad hominem</i> against them. But simply put, even if <b>I</b> was the one who had named all those people, even if <b>I</b> had said "they're shoddy scholars, and their position on apostate testimony is shoddy scholarship", it still wouldn't be <i>ad hominem</i>. If I had said "their position on apostate testimony must be shoddy <i>because</i> they are shoddy scholars", it would be <i>ad hominem</i> -- but the fact is, I didn't. The position is shoddy scholarship because it's founded on an elementary logical flaw. Asking "how dare you call these authorities I have now appealed to a bunch of shoddy scholars!" is the wrong question; the right one is "if these 'scholars' are promoting a position which has an elementary logical flaw as its bedrock, what right do they really have to authority?" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:37, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. In short, what you are saying hat these scholars don't use "elementary logic" and that you know better than these scholars. It could have been said in just these last 8 words. I would kindly suggest that you break open one of their books and read them rather than dismiss their findings as <i>shoddy scholarship</i>.

<dd>I didn't just say it. I showed it. If there is some argument buried in one of their books which could actually make a case for dismissing the testimonies of an entire class of persons based on <i>ad hominem circumstantial</i> reasoning, I would suggest you show it; it's not really very convincing or impressive when you just sneer that I should read their books and then strut around as if you'd actually presented a rebuttal. By the way, I must tell you, it's <i>very</i> amusing that when I say "This is <i>not</i> a general truth of the sociological community, it's shoddy scholarship only promoted by a small coterie," Jossi's response is "It is so! This is something that <i>most</i> sociologists believe, not just a small coterie!" and your response is "How dare you accuse Eileen Baker, Reender Kranebourg, Jeffery Haden, Gordon Melton, David Bromley, Irving Hexman, Anson Shuppe, and Douglas Cowan of shoddy scholarship!" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:43, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi, I'm very concerned. If you have been the recipient of harrassing emails I strongly condemn it. I have been the harrassment target by premies who post online and who have created a website using my real name to harrass and libel me, so I know how awful and frightening it feels to be such a target, so I sympathize with you. It's never acceptable behavior. If you want to provide evidence of this, I would be happy to expose that unacceptable behavior and publicly condemn it on the ex forum with a strong demand to anyone who reads the ex-premie forum to stop it. Please let me know, because I can safely say that all the ex-premies that I know (especially the ones who post on the forum using their real names) would also protest anyone harrassing you, Jossi. It's simply wrong and very bad behavior, whichever side of this argument one is on.</dd>

<dd>I also want to point out to you that the particular sociologists of NRMs that are quoteed and referenced in the Rawat articles have been discredited as cult apologists by their peers -- other sociologists of NRMs. In particular, Gordon Melton has been strongly criticized by his peers because of how he dealt with The Family, which, as you know, is the child sex abuse cult that has been in the U.S. news so much in recent weeks. Introvigne is another controversial "scholar" of NRMs who has also been scrutinized by his peers because of his extremist views about "apostates." Melton was paid by The Family (Children of God) cult, and he also appeared in one of their promotional films/videos. Not all of these scholars paint former members as "apostates being automatic liars" -- Benjamin Zablocki and Steven Kent come to mind. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnother_Ex-Premie_b78d.html" title="User:Another Ex-Premie">Another Ex-Premie</a> 13:55, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "Prem Rawat" article, as well as "Criticism of Prem Rawat" that is the subject of this current discussion, both cite Gordon Melton in the Resources and Bibliography sections. One assumes that when an author and their material is cited, that they are a reliable authority, and Melton sets himself forth as an authority on the subject of NRMs, even though he has received strong criticism from his professional peers. Here is the link to a website called "Skeptic Tank" that published an article titled "When Scholars Know Sin," by Stephen Kent and Theresa Kreb. In this article, Melton's and his colleague's questionable activities when studying NRMs, is discussed. But, this is fairly old information that has been available for quite some time. I recommend you brush up on the subject of sociologists of NRMs and destructive cults, as well as psychologists and other professionals who also study NRMs and destructive cults, before you jump in and call it all "bs." IMO, one must become informed about all sides and pov's of a particular subject before one can make an informed conclusion or opinion.</dd>

<dd>You make me do all your homework; that's okay. It's not a "smear campaign," but you don't have to believe me. On the Apologetics Index website, you can read Melton's, Shupe's, and Lewis's responses to the above-mentioned article and then there's a link at the bottom of the page where you can also read the response from Stephen Kent called "Clarifying Issues --A Rejoinder to Melton, Shupe and Lewis." It's a published debate online that's quite interesting. Also, there's proof Melton took money from The Family. It's on an IRS income reporting form and also available for viewing online. Again, you don't have to believe me, the copy of the form is linked below on the movingon.org website (a website that supports those poor kids from The Family cult that were so horridly abused). Yes, I believe those kids. Also, Melton has given favorable reviews (for money) to other destructive cults like the Scientologists and the Aum Shinrikyo cult (the cult that put sarin gas into the Tokyo subways).

<dd>I just want to point out here that having an unsubstantitated, repeated allegation on Wikipedia (See Hate-Group article) that ex-premies are a hate-group (I know, I know, the wording isn't "just exactly like that") makes it mighty, mighty, uncomfortable to come here and write/edit on Wikipedia. The only source to support that allegation is the Rawat cult on it's FAQ webpages. Jossi Fresco has spent more time trying to discredit ex-premies than ensuring that an accurate writing of facts about Prem Rawat takes place. He gets quite cantankerous towards any ex-premies who've tried to participate in the "wiki process." All of the Prem Rawat articles are pure POV advertisements and promotional pieces for Prem Rawat, written by current cult members (yes, I know the word "cult" is censored and considered obscene here). I just wanted to point that out and say that which ever way this vote goes, I'll never recommend any of these articles about Rawat as anything more than novellettes or fairy tales, wishful thinking on the part of current "students" of Prem Rawat. The "Past Teachings of Prem Rawat" article is a particularly hilarious example of what happens when facts get in the way of writing about the truth. If I cared much about Wikipedia, I'd fight for the truth here, but, on the whole, all the Rawat articles present such a distorted and revised view of Prem Rawat, that they all need to be sent to the scrap-heap and rewritten. That is, of course, if Wikipedians are actually interested in anything factual. Yeah, that hate-group allegation is quite stunning -- it's there because a cult says so and no other reason.

<dd>Jossi, I don't need your approval or permission to work on Wikipedia articles, but frankly, I don't have time for your ankle-biting. It's tedious. Nobody is abridging your freedom to practice a religion, either Jossi. Anyway, Prem Rawat states right on his Elan Vital and Prem Rawat Foundation website FAQs that the practice of Knowledge is <b>not</b> a spiritual practice, philosophy or a belief system, but, you seem to want to have things both ways, otherwise you pout and point fingers. Fact is, Rawat has <b>always</b> claimed that what he offers is <b>not</b> a religion, so I don't really know where your "freedom of religion" complaint is coming from now. I didn't get selected by Prem Rawat's inner circle people to work full-time for him because I <b>did not</b> understand Maharaji, Knowledge, his message, or my own devotion to him. But, I do understand very well that you don't <i>want</i> me talking about that secret project. You and your premie friends are so adamant <i>against</i> my talking about it that you even try to tell folks that I was <i>never even there</i> in Miami Beach, Florida, from 1979 through 1981, and if I <i>was</i> there that I'm crazy, and so mentally unbalanced, that no one should ever believe anything that I say. And <b>you</b> have the nerve to accuse ex-premies of being a hate-group that dehumanizes people. Fact is, Jossi, I don't need Wikipedia, or your or Prem Rawat's permission in order to tell the truth about my past as a foot-kissing devotee, and <i>my</i> telling the truth about <i>my</i> life as a devotee of Maharaji is really none of your business, and it certainly does not take away <i>your</i> ability or your freedom to be a practicing premie now.</dd>

But note, that whatever you "personally think" is inconsequential to this conversation. FYI, I have no intention to "understand" a group of people that think, speak and behave as they do. I know Maharaji close to 25 years, both as a teacher and as a person, and I can assure you that I have not been in the company of a human being that is more noble, impeccable, kind and inspiring as Maharaji. Through thin and thick (and this is <i>not</i> an analogy, I have been in a war as a soldier, for example), his inspiration and guidance have been there from me throughout all these years, consistently. I must admit that given my experience of Maharaji and his teachings, it makes me sad to see the hearsay, gossip and appalling remarks and actions by that small group of people, and see their ill-will, arrogance and attempts to be seen as credible as even more saddening. If that is the company you chose to keep, Andries, it is your choice, and so be it.</dd>

<dd>Jossi, it sounds like you're simply too emotionally attached to the subject matter to be involved in this article. You seem to be almost seething at the mere possibility that someone would disparage your beloved Maharaji, irrespective of the facts and evidence and their implications, large and small. This doesn't seem good for your own mental health and I'm sure it's unsettling for others who are trying to edit the article(s) from a different perspective. For example, I, personally, would like to add a couple of things to one of these articles. New evidence has come to light that Rawat once bragged to the Boston Globe about having millions of criminals as followers. These people would be willing to steal cars, hijack planes, even kill others or jump out windows and kill themselves if they thought it would please him. This was said just days before Mahatma Fakiranand tried to kill the reporter who threw the cream pie at Rawat. Furthermore, in the late 70's, Rawat claimed that Knowledge could give one supernatural powers such as the ability to make things levitate although, he warned, he could take them away in a flash if the devotee wasn't dedicated enough to him. I think these are key points that must be added somewhere, especially given Rawat's and EV's current attempts to characterize his past as they do. But, Jossi, even if these facts are perfectly documented, as I believe them to be, will you allow their admission to stand? Or will you just go ballistic and sabotage the editting as you have in the past? I'm glad some new eyes have taken a look at these Rawat articles. Perhaps they'll finally receive some real balance. I'm just not sure that you'll want to stick around for the process. I think it will pain you too much. --24.68.221.224 03:23, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Both are sourced to official DLM or Elan Vital publications. Yes, they're outrageous. Yes, they fly in the face of how Rawat presents himself these days.

<li><b>KEEP</b> -- This is just silly. The Criticism section was "forked" off because the acrimony was making editing impossible, and a concerted effort from what fit the Wiki definition as a "hate group" attempted to fill the original article, in fact, swallowing up the whole. The best compromise was doing it this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>The circus played out like defining something like "cherries." Instead of saying "<i>cherries are a small round fruit</i>," and having a parenthetical section that said "<i>some people don't like cherries</i>" these people tried to define cherries as "<i>the foul-tasting seed of hell, poisonous to the touch</i>" and then circular and anecdotal reasoning to say "<i>I heard a guy who once looked at a cherry and he was turned to stone, so don't even LOOK at cherries.</i>" And for citation, see an anonymously maintained web page and chat room that no-one admits to running.

<p>I vote to keep the Criticism page on Prem Rawat on Wikipedia and also to merge it with the main article on Prem Rawat. Jossi, who is one of the principal contributors to the Prem Rawat page argued for a separate page for any criticisms. Now he is requesting it's deletion because of its POV. The Criticism page is backed up by both verbatim transcript of Prem Rawat and by scholarly assessment. It seems rather transparent that the push for deletion is a calculated strategy to remove any viewpoint that does not adhere his and other followers' POV.Verification <b>note:</b> <i>This user's vote is the one and only edit in Wikipedia.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I vote to keep, but in my opinion the article needs a thorough cleanup, such as removing 75 external links to the critic's website (Wikipedia is not a link farm, nor should it be a marketing tool for any website), and I belive the article needs a thorough NPOV of the article, removing gossip, etc. --<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck_J_3fcb.html" title="User:Chuck J">Chuck</a> 21:12, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>are you sure you didn't mix ex-premie.org with elanvital.org and tprf.org and a couple of others in this article to get to the number of 75? We should then count the pro-rawat links at the main article and follow that through all forks.This is a brilliant idea.

<p>ahem chuck, i found your mistake, you just took the number as shown in the article until a certain paragraph and thought this all must be links to critcs-sites. So what does that mean. 1. You did not read the article by no means, otherwise you would have noticed the piles of links that lead to pro-rawat sites as well. 2. You have no idea how much and how intensive your pro-rawat mates have collaborated in this special critics article 3.

<p>As the Wikipedian who originally authored this VfD, please let me state a (strictly speaking off topic) remark: The discussion here just doesn't look sane to me (and all PR articles, pro and con, just doesn't look encyclopedic to me), so if there would be any chance of enforcement, I'd propose banning all <i>premies</i> and <i>ex-premies</i> from editing all PR related articles. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 12:05, 2005 Mar 2 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sir: I don't think it's appropriate for you to be characterizing the mental health of people who have made comments here as "not sane" or "insane." That goes for those on either side of this argument. I demand an immediate retraction and apology from you and Wikipedia. Btw, are you in any way officially paid by,or affiliated with, or employed by Wikipedia? Anyway,in reponse to your proposed ban of premies and ex-premies from writing/editing any Prem Rawat articles, would you also include in that ban-from-writing/editing, any and all of the PR article writers/editors who are being paid by Elan Vital or Prem Rawat (or any affiliated organizations) to write/edit on Wikipedia on their behalf, by requiring them to make a full disclosure of the same? Would you also include in that ban the "hate group" article (that characterizes ex-premies as a hate group) and the "Purported List of Hate Group" article, and all of the other articles in which people have also been involved in writing/editing, such as apostates, cults, anti-cult movement, etc.?</dd>

<dd>hello pjacobi, i see you have the same rough temper when it gets you as i have. I can understand that you want to have it simple, but unfortunately the interest of independend people in that matter is limited. I appreciate the effort of MBq concerning the "Lehre" Paragraph in the german scratchpage for example, but it is simply wrong and the content is indeed unencyclopedic. It takes time to do a research and you have to visit "physical" libraries to really cover a topic. Google research alone will never bring you close to an acceptable result.<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_h_3105.html" title="User:Thomas h">Thomas h</a> 15:05, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten by Andries; no longer a promo or POV piece. Notable translation of a sacred book in Hinduism; note that we already have a precedent set for allowing articles on different translations of the Bible (e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Living_Bible_183a.html" title="The Living Bible">The Living Bible</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Standard_Version_d556.html" title="American Standard Version">American Standard Version</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_English_Version_f5f3.html" title="Contemporary English Version">Contemporary English Version</a>, etc.); the same may apply to sacred books in other religions. What distinguishes this translation of the Gita is its wide distribution, the elaborate "purport" given for each verse, and its use by ISKCON. (IMHO, there are much better renderings into English of this marvelous work). Oh, and for those who like the Google notability standard, 25,600 hits on "bhagavad gita as it is". <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 17:45, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also, 'gee, I can burn my own CDs now, whose music should I bootleg and distribute via Yahoo groups and eBay?' is a snide yet invalid reason because the bootleg is well-known amongst Ryan Adams's bootleg collectors and is traded widely, therefore it is pertinent to Ryan Adams's history. No other compiled bootleg of Ryan Adams's is as well-known as this. Nonetheless, it would perhaps be best to create a "Ryan Adams rarities" page to list the known but unreleased songs.

<ul>
<li>One could argue, especially on Wikipedia, that there are equally as large fanbases for Pok√©mon and Digimon. Focusing back on the article itself, what makes <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">this document</a> <i><b>encyclopedic</b></i>? Is there a systemic bias towards sci-fi related material on Wikipedia, or is this a special case? If so, why? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 20:16, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the entry is not a simple comparison of the differences between the two franchises, such as the Poke/digimon is and the proverbial Apples and Oranges articles I imagine would be. Instead, its an article focusing on the actual debate that has some interesting mathematical and philisophical points to it, and the internet culture that has sprung up to support it. Well known participants in the debates were actually credited for their contributions in official Lucasfilms literature, for example. Look at the Poke/digimon article and look at this one. Do you really think there isn't a difference in both the topic and quality? However, on the negative side, there are some who don't grasp NPOV and encyclopedic tone that drags down some of the article, such as the external links section. Would you find something like this in Britanica? No, but then again I don't enjoy randomly browsing its pages nearly as much as I like Wiki. <a href="../../../a/k/e/User%7EAkerkhof_18c0.html" title="User:Akerkhof">Akerkhof</a> 20:43, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No. Just because you wouldn't find something in Britanica does not mean that thing is not potentially encyclopedic, and just because something is not enjoyable to read does not mean it is. But that's not your argument either, I imagine. In my view, if it is notable, and if it's well written, it probably should be kept. I could see how reasonable people would disagree on both counts, but I lean toward keeping this, and I certainly don't see the connection to the Pokemon article. Yet I will not lose sleep if this article somehow fails a <b>third</b> VfD, either. <a href="../../../a/k/e/User%7EAkerkhof_18c0.html" title="User:Akerkhof">Akerkhof</a> 21:23, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I tend to agree with BM, the fact that it has been nominated <i>twice</i> already and cleared for keeping twice, makes me vote a <b>keep</b>. I believe two more reasons for keeping it are 1) there is in fact a newsgroup with rather high mailflow about it; and 2) the technical (dare I say obsessive?) nature of some Trekkies and Warsies, and the fact that both series are based on some variation on known physics, makes a conversation like 'could a tie fighter defeat a bird of prey' at least somewhat meaningful. Note that neither of these reasons is true for Pokemon vs Digimon, nor for Apples vs Oranges. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 21:20, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>After double-checking, it appears that no mention of a documentary is made within this article. Is this a home-brew documentary or a real documentary?

<ul>
<li>I believe that the point may be that the differences between Star Trek and Star Wars aren't encyclopedic per se, but the avid online community about it is (as in, internet phenomenon; and yes I know we have too many of those already). And you can't discuss the latter without explaining the former. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:38, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although Star Trek is more sci-fi science and Star Wars more sci-fi fantasy, alt.startrek.vs.starwars has existed for a long time regarding the debate of these two series. The primary issue with the whole thing is that many fans wonder whether or not it was Trek that sparked the whole Sci-fi interest or was it Wars? Even though they can't really be compared at the same level or scale, they both were science fiction birthed or rebirthed almost the same time. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 22:23, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although the article could get into non-encyclopaedic issues such as the question about which spaceship would win a conflict mentioned in the opening para, it keeps fairly close to a brief to write about the differences between two examples of an extended series of popular science fiction.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It would be a very bad precedent to keep this article on the basis that it isn't really <i>about</i> 'Star Trek versus Star Wars' but rather about the widespread discussion of this topic as an Internet phenomenon. That would grease the skids for all sorts of unencyclopedic, moronic, flame-fest topics that are popular on Internet forums to enter the Wikipedia supposedly as meta-topics. Canon versus Nikon wouldn't be about Canon versus Nikon, but rather about the widespread discussion of Canon versus Nikon on the Internet. Yankees suck, Red Sox rule wouldn't be about whether the Yankees suck and the Red Sox rule, but rather about the widespread discussion on the Internet of this subject. And so forth.

<li>I expected to vote for deletion when I took a look at the article, but in honesty it's actually an example of what I think a breakout from a main article that's gotten too large should look like. This could use cleanup, sure, but it focuses on a high-level topic, of non-trivial complexity, which is present in varying forms through all incarnations of the series, and it discusses the incarnation of the topic across <i>all</i> the various Digimon series, and it's hard to think of a more important central concept to the series.

<li><b>Delete</b>. An article cataloging all the wonderous ways by which Digimon transform to their wonderous higher forms is not encyclopedic.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Several people voted "merge and redirect" but gave no indication where this should or could redirect <i>to</i>. The best recommendation was to move it to the Wikibooks section for Pokemon but apparently that's not an option yet. Had I seen this earlier, I would have voted to consider this an unexpandable stub (by which I mean that the only possible expansions would have broken the rule that "Wikipedia is not a gameguide"). I am going to exercise my discretion and delete this for now. If someone can determine an appropriate redirect, please do so. If you need help restoring it in order to move it to Wikibooks when that's ready, please contact me. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 08:51, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The phrase "The Sum of Human Knowledge" didn't originate with Jimbo or the Wikipedia. It was the marketing slogan of the 1911 Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Clearly, it didn't "necessarily imply" that EB 1911 was a pan-specialist encyclopedia, and it does not "necessarily imply" that Wikipedia is that now. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:06, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's 'cos they ran out of paper. We could ask Jimbo what he thought he meant when he said it, or would you not believe him either if he disagreed with you? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 01:58, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>They described the EB that way after they published it in all its paper-imposed finitude. I'd believe Jimbo's statement as to what he meant, of course. Why wouldn't I? He's the world expert on what Jimbo Wales means when he says things, unless its his shrink (or his wife). As for whether I'd agree with his (current) definition, that would depend on what the definition was. It would be nice if he were clear enough on its meaning that it would have some operational meaning -- so that one could determine, for example, that the "sum of human knowledge" includes or does not include an article on the "Trade Federation Platoon Attack Carrier" from Star Wars. If "sum of human knowledge" means that Wikipedia is a "pan-specialist encyclopedia" with indefinite drill-down on specialized interests, then why do we have the statement in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> that it is not a "general information base"? But I dare say that if Jimbo were ever clear on the subject, that would have more influence in forming consensus amongst Wikipedians than my opinion, or yours. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:46, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Note:</i> There was a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Criticism_of_Wikipedia_4d9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Criticism of Wikipedia">previous VfD</a> 2004-Dec-23 but the discussion drifted away to question whether and which criticism of Wikipedia should be allowed, with statements like <i>"Keep. It is POV not to have articles that are critical of Wikipedia"</i>. Ahem, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article itself should contain the critical POV. Also some contributors remarked, that <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> is much too pro-Wikipedia. Anyway, it's easier and suggested by policy, to put all aspects in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> an enhance that one article.</p>

<li>I think this VfD is ill-considered on several counts. For starters, I believe it is completely incorrect to call it a "POV fork" in the first place. If someone said "Hmmm, the article on Wikipedia is getting pretty large, why don't we make <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#Sister_projects" title="Wikipedia">Sister projects of Wikipedia</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#Software_and_hardware" title="Wikipedia">Software and hardware of Wikipedia</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#History" title="Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a> its own article?" no one would call it a fork; why then is [[Criticism of Wikipedia]] a "POV fork"? As Pjacobi says, it is suggested by policy that all aspects of a subject go into that subject's article, but it is not only suggested by policy that aspects of a subject get spun out if the subject's article gets too large, it's a suggestion that's automatically made by the editing software every time the size of the article approaches 32K! It is definitely <i>not</i> the case that policy is unambiguously calling for a merge and redirect. I am voting for a <b>keep</b> unless some more convincing case than 'this is a POV fork <i>(disputed)</i> and "all POV forks must be killed"' is made. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:08, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a term used only by a tiny group of people, and thus I believe it falls below the notability threshhold for inclusion in wikipedia. Perhaps it is more suited to one of the internet's numerous urban dictionary websites.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Neologism.

<li><b>Undelete</b>. I am a body builder in the West Hollywood region of Los Angeles and have been hearing this word frequently. It seems that Eric Leven's "invented neologism" has spread and has become an accepted term for a certain body type/physical mentality/sexual orientation.

<li><i>Comment:</i> The article hasn't been deleted yet, so "undelete" is not a valid vote.
