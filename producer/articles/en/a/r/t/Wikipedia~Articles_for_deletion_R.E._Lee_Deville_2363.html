<p>This is what has happened to this article so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>This page was initially created as vandalism; most likely an attack.</li>
<li>I nominated for deletion. (see below)</li>
<li>During the debate <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">User:Remes</a> made a commendable rewrite of the article, but apart of him, only one person, yours truly, commented on it (I changed my vote from delete to weak delete).</li>
<li>The article was deleted.</li>
<li>The article was undeleted (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html#R.E._Lee_Deville" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion#R.E. Lee Deville</a>) with some doubts from several users.</li>
<li>I have now submitted this for deletion again for a new debate.</li>
</ol>
<p>My vote is still <b>delete</b>. I know it may seem paradoxical that I keep voting keep on fictional Pok√©mon characters and delete on real people; but I think that fictional characters are often known to more people, and therefore more notable. I am not saying that they <i>should</i> be more notable, but I feel that they <i>are</i>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:31, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, to quote from my comment on the original VfD: "I have absolutely no knowledge of mathematics, so I can't say whether he's notable, although I doubt it, since essentially he's a postdoc at NYU." I'm not voting in this VfD, although I'm not going to be sad if it get deleted. It would be nice if someone who knew about academic mathematics could say whether his articles are notable or not, since I don't really accept a Google test as a reasonable gauge one way or the other in this case. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 19:13, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I was among those who voted to undelete, as I figured it deserved another go as rewritten (the original was a silly attack page). While this is a vast improvement, the subject is just not notable enough. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:40, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article freely admits that Mr. Deville is "of little merit". THat does not sound particularily notable. I suggest that this article be deleted. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 15:13, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I have just rewritten this article as a stub about the real R.E. Lee DeVille. I have absolutely no knowledge of mathematics, so I can't say whether he's notable, although I doubt it, since essentially he's a postdoc at NYU. Someone who knows more about math could look at it and comment here about whether he's worth keeping in. Also, my stub is really inadequate, because I can't really understand his CV or his research interest statement. Again, someone who knows more about math could do much better than I did. Anyway, I'm going to withhold a vote at all now, because while this is no longer the attack or nonsense that it was before, I'm still not sure whether he's sufficiently notable or not. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 22:58, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> He's real, a research mathematician at NYU... but this article smells more like an attack page than an attempt to start a bio stub. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:16, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was on the verge of nominating this for a speedy deletion, but I was a bit unsure. I was sure that this article merited a deletion or massive cleanup. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:25, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Still <b>delete</b> but weakened, Remes has made a valiant attempt at saving this page, and the page is no longer an attack (or perhaps a self-deprecating vanity?). I do not think that Deville passes the <i>average college professor</i> bar (I believe that has been the standard on whether to keep or delete such articles) for notability however, being an associate research scientist would suggest that he does not. Nonetheless, Remes should be thanked for his attempt. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:18, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
