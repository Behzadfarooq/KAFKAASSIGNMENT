<li><b>Comment</b>. While the article has <i>definitely</i> improved since I nominated it, and even reads like an appropriate Wikipedia article, it's still not notable. True, he's a "real" politician (whatever that means), and he has held political office before, but come on.

<li>Bayyoc - it's simple enough. I'll explain. 4 wickets mean 4 batsmen (who although batting might well be bowlers) are now out. Not out as in the middle of the field and so in. But out as in out and no longer in. So 4 batsmen are out. Easy huh? And 29 runs are 29 times they have scored. That's even simpler. Of course they may have scored 4's or 6's - but that depends. And 8 overs. Well really. That just means 8 lots of 6 balls. Isn't that obvious? ;) --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> It's painfully obvious that Bart McQueary or someone who knows Bart Mcqueary has been editing the article in favor of McQueary, and there's no way that he/they are ever going to let up. This is probably a rare instance in wiki, someone vandalizing their own entry in their favor; but if Mcqueary can't play by the rules, and he won't allow anyone else to play by the rules, well, I see no great loss by removing his entry. He doesn't exactly... well... matter, anyway. Im sure there are plenty of other bible thumpers and porno pushers out there to take up the clout.Timmybiscool 02:10, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>STRONG Delete</b> I've tried to work on this the best I can. Honest to God I have. I've done my homework. I've combed through page after page of McQueary's own archived websites looking for the truth. I find the man despicable, but I have put the positive information I found on him in this article. I could have easily neglected that he did in fact raise money for children's charities, that he was in fact harassed unjustly by the police, that his statutory rape arrest was due to a piddly three year difference. I did no such thing. The good and the bad are both in this article. But McQueary doesn't want the latter of those two included, apparently. Case in point: Bart McQueary is trying to edit the article to remove the fact that he once advertised his page as an escort service. For over two years now the web archive service has featured the page proving this. It was linked to here in the article, and for the past week or so you could click on that link and see it for yourself. Now that McQueary has come in and started editing the page, the "escort page"-- which for YEARS has been out there in the web archive for all to see-- has suddenly been disabled by a robots.txt. Coincidence? I think not. And of course he is going to come in here, boorish as he is in real life, saying, "PROVE IT. PROVE that it existed." Well guess what, Bart, I could've, if I'd have known you were going to block the page. I could've saved the page to my PC and uploaded it to another server for all the world to behold. But you got rid of it. And now, no, I can't "prove it." And the only reason is because of you. McQueary is trying to manipulate what people can know about him. If that's the case, there's no need in having an entry on him in Wiki; he'll only allow information about himself that he WANTS to be known.<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 02:26, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just out of curiosity... have you ever looked up Robert Million in the Harrodsburg listings?
<ul>
<li>Sign your posts with four ~ so people can see who you are. Yes, there is a Robert Million in Harrodsburg, per the Kentucky white pages. I will check in a moment to see if this number matches the one on REM Entertainment. If this truly is the operator of REM, it brings up a new question-- if McQueary had truly been "born again," why would he enable the furtherance of pornography by selling his business to someone else to continue marketing his stuff-- including homosexual porn? Why didn't he shut down the site? And why did REM Entertainment go down in the same time frame as McQueary's page? Bart McQueary, hater of homosexuals, not only sells his porn page rather than shut it down, but he sells it to someone in the exact same town he lives in, who keeps McQueary's phone number on the page for an extended period of time, and when a new number appears people call it and claim to have reached Mcqueary, AND it goes down at the same time McQueary's page goes down? Let us use Occam's Razor here. By the way, while I was at it, I looked up Bart McQueary and found zero results. Also zero for Bartley McQueary, and the only B McQueary was a "B.M. McQueary" in Louisville. <a href="http://www.whitepages.com/10001/search/Find_Person?firstname_begins_with=1&amp;firstname=&amp;name=McQueary&amp;city_zip=&amp;state_id=KY" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitepages.com/10001/search/Find_Person?firstname_begins_with=1&amp;firstname=&amp;name=McQueary&amp;city_zip=&amp;state_id=KY" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Even Fred Phelps keeps his number listed. And what do people have to gain by saying they called REM and got ahold of McQueary?

<li>Golly, isn't that funny? After two years of being able to access Bart's Stuff/REM Entertainment's archived pages via archive.org, in the past few days they have mysteriously been blocked from viewing by the site's owner! Isn't that a splendid concidence to protect the venerable name of Bart McQueary? If his life is such an open book, why does he feel the need to hide these things about himself? This article needs to be deleted on the sheer basis that McQueary is actively destroying information about himself. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 04:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Timmybiscool. An article on Fred Phelps is appropriate, but I can't see that Bart McQueary is anything other than an attention-starved moron.

<li>Whether legitimately members or not, I feel that cult members do not necessarily get to have a page over non-cult members for doing the same acts.

<li>I would have no problem with McQueary being a section in the ACLU Ten Commandments Lawsuit, kept strictly to being about his lawsuit. As it is, the article now is about him as a person, and thus requires looking at the whole scope of him: Sex offender, charity fundraiser, champion of the law, pornographer, philanthropist, hypocrite, radical, liar, crusader.65.71.127.228 19:38, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>SIGN YOUR COMMENTS'</i>. I led the charge to have this deleted last time, too. But since it didn't go through, I figured the truth about McQueary might as well be known. Now that another opportunity has come up... My "claims" as you call them only became "claims" a few days ago when Bart McQueary blocked the archives of his webpages in order to get the information taken out of wiki per lack of evidence. Before then, they were not claims-- they were indisputable facts. Hey, Bart, how about you get rid of your robots.txt so everyone can see that I'm telling the truth? Oh, I forgot-- the truth isn't what you're interested in. If McQueary truly had repented his old ways, why would he block the archived pages, unless they were evidence of a crime he didn't want known? Paul of Tarsus certainly didn't try to cover up that he was a murderer.65.71.127.228 19:38, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I've lived in Harrodsburg, and I have no doubt that Bart is editing his stuff. I used to see him coming into Wal-Mart to buy the packing envelopes for his videos. And you know what? After he "sold the page," I STILL saw him coming into Wal-Mart and buying packing envelopes en masse. Make no bones about it-- his "conversion" is an absolute joke. Bart has either gone insane, he was never firmly based in reality to begin with, and thinks he is Phelps, or he has become Phelps because his pleasure in life is hurting others, and who has done that better than Westboro. It was a real ugly thing when his brother died, I think that might have something to do with it. And his the whole business with him and the girl. Take it from someone who's met him and had to deal with him: This guys ten commandmetns lawsuit was nothing more than an attempt to feed his own bloated, hateful ego. He doesn't give a damn about the ACLU or anybody's freedoms, only causing trouble for others and stirring up crap. Mention him in the lawsuit if you have to, but keep it to a bare minimum; anything more is inviting him to ooze his way into the cracks of Wiki and poison it. 216.7.251.54 17:05, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Verbewarp, from your comments here and at Talk:Science today, it seems you're misunderstanding at least some of the comments that recommend deletion. In particular, your essay is not being criticized for containing "no original research"; it is being criticized because it <i>violates</i> Wikipedia's principle of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. Your article is a very detailed explanation of what your opinion is and why you hold it; there is absolutely nothing wrong with you <i>holding</i> that opinion, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with you <i>sharing</i> that opinion. However, there <i>is</i> a problem with you using Wikipedia's resources to try and share and promote that opinion, because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought</a> and sharing your opinion is <i>not</i> the purpose for which Wikipedia allowed you the use of its resources. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:07, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Antaeus Feldspar - Your comments are accepted - But, please explain "I also suspect copyvio" Please explain "No original research, though I wonder if it's just nonsense. " Please explain "reeks of Time Cube." etc., etc.</p>
<p>Your comments are not consistent with the deeds in evidence and you are misunderstanding the nature of your own judgemental issues. Let me explain to you that this submission under Verbewarp has been a test of the intgerity of the Wikipedia process - not an intention to publish, although cloaked in that guise. This article was taken from my blog to be found at <a href="http://verbewarp.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://verbewarp.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://verbewarp.blogspot.com/</a> as purely a test case. This test case has arisen due to a number of other rejections and judgements posted by your colleagues - upon other matters. The result is that your active judges are mostly and clearly unqualified and inexperienced individuals inflated to egoistic status embedded in a high level of arrogance and misunderstanding of their own abilities and the issues at stake.</p>
<p>Science can never be consensual - that idea is ludicrous - and this type of "peer" review appears to be derived from the "lowest common denominator" of social attainment; the beginning of life processes rather than from lives hoary with sagecity and experience. As a consequence of this test, my students and colleagues are to be issued with a warning notice as to the integrity of Wikipedia - or lack of it - that is not to say that Wikipedia will be black listed but more framed in an aspect of suspected oversight that needs strong referencing for support. Or, use only as a last resort but only if supporting evidence can be established from other more reliable sources.</p>
<p>Nothing personal about your intentions to create something useful, but before embarking on such adventures that have such huge and serious social implications, particularly for the unsuspecting youth, and in light of this site becoming a social point of reference and therefore a possible milestone for intellectual reference, I would strongly recommend that you all review the implications and possible damage that this effort, built in flawed and thoughtless conception, will bring upon our civilization. Wikipedia is a technology which is posing as a vault of intellectual knowledge and far better that there should be warning to your Users that the information contained within comes from a self appointed group of unqualified and inexperienced individuals acting out judgemental roles in some sort of immatured order. Far better that you train those that judge. far better that Wikipedia clearly declare itself a purely a store for societal storage or warehouse for trivia.</p>
<p>My article 'Science today' should have given you some clue as to where this was taking you as it sketches the basics of what and why general mainstream science today has no integrity and no future. You missed the point due to the fact that you didn't take time to consider the article, finding the construction thereo, uncomfortable and painful to your delicate and spoiled minds. This is no insult. Aristotle wrote of this over 2000 years ago, quite clearly and yet it persists today - rote, imitation and practise. You failed to adjudicate correct and according to your own rules. You took delite with insult. You alleged slander knowing that you couldn't be held responsible. You failed.</p>
<p>Your efforts will build more "dogma" in this world already overflowing with the emotional sewage of the wanabees and false pretenders and as a consequence will Wikipedia only assists in furthering the destruction or devolution of human achievement - dogma and practised thinking together with immatured opinion represents a danger to civilization more horific in its footprint than war; atomic war.</p>
<p>To teach would be more worthy of your time than to record.</p>
<p>I wish you all well but I would strongly suggest that you reconsider your future and priorities. This effort that si Wikipedia - just ain't worth wasting your lives on! Verbewarp --peter 06:22, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I find it amusing that, at 78 comics, it doesn't even pass the author's own proposal for inclusion (which VfD very consistently ignores), which basically kicked off the Webcomic Wikiproject. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 08:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

At this stage, Gossamer Commons is well under a year old and doesn't have sufficient depth of archive to justify inclusion at this time. The honorable mention does bespeak a certain significance to the webcomics community, but it can be argued said significance better fits within the general "Eric Burns" entry. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Burns_bdeb.html" title="User:Eric Burns">Eric Burns</a> 06:09, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>page appears to have been created by a one-time user about themselves, with no evident claims to notability. Material is more appropriate for a User page. Text also includes substantial advertorial content for a publication supposedly produced by this person. It's been flagged as PotentialVanity for about 2 weeks, the user has not added anything else in that time, so probably time to delete this. <a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 06:02, 2005 August 3 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was the first VFD I'd ever been involved it, so I wasn't trying anything malicious with the VFD page - I put my vote for keep up and then removed it because I wanted to see what kinds of comments would be put on the page before commiting to that vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I would agree that it is a neologism, yet, I think that the basic concept, a sexual practice made possblie by the internet, is a an identifiable conecpt that should have a term. the label would be helpful in discussions. This is English, after all, essentailly a chimera of neologisms words stolen form other languages. The influx of technology, and the resultant new methods of interaction are rapidly increasing the speed at which a neologism is accepted. Blogging, podcasting, Googling, Etc.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Langauge is an ever changing and evolving concept of verbal communication. As such new words with merrit must be kept in some sort of record (hence Wikipedia). As <b>all</b> words were new once, word age cannot be considered a valid reason for discontinuation. Also, considering that the average person's vocabulary is less then 25,000 words (Psycholinguist Dr. Catherine E. Snow - Harvard Gradruate School) and there are more than three times that many 'official' words in the English Langauge (Oxford English Dictionary), one cannot assume common usage as an appropriate moniker for a word. Most importantly though, the word provides an adequate label to "innapropriate internet behavior", something that has yet to be done; therefore, the word has a place in the English Language and a justified exsistence.</li>

<p>In essence this is not an argument for whether Webcest should be a word or not, that will be decided simply if it cathes on or not. This argument concerns the ability of one to post a usefull and catchy neologism on this site.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). For those interested my vote count shows 9 to delete, 5 to keep which is short of a two-thirds majority anyway. Furthermore, there is agreement that "Jumping the couch" is a neologism, but the keep voters are arguing that <i>this</i> neologism is notable for some reason, and have backed it up with some evidence. Second, there is at least one delete vote which wants part of the article moved to <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">Jumping the shark</a>, this would probably require at least a redirect to be left behind to remain GFDL compliant. I also get the impression that many of the complaints to this article is that it is awfully similar to the more common "Jumping the Shark" phrase. I would like to point out that my closing of this debate as a "keep" does <i>not</i> mean that it's impossible to merge this article with something else if anybody will be <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a></b> and do it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:26, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and for three reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The assertion that this article's topic is "not notable," especially when that assertion is not backed up with evidence or argument, is no reason to delete this entry. There are many entries in Wikipedia that most people would not consider notable. That gives us no reason to delete those entries, however. Wikipedia aspires to be a collection of all human knowledge, whether that knowledge is notable or not. Indeed, perhaps the more esoteric an entry is, the more useful it is; it serves a purpose that is likely not served elsewhere on the web.</li>
<li>That the article is allegedly POV is absolutely no reason to delete it. If it's POV, then alter it so that it's neutral. Many people believe the entry on President Bush is POV. Does that give us a reason to delete that article, though? An article's non-neutrality is no reason, by itself, to delete the article.</li>
<li>The fact that this entry has been referenced by another website, and a significant one at that, is further proof that this entry is serving a useful purpose. Shouldn't we be doing everything to make sure that Wikipedia is a popular and frequently used reference source? Deleting this article would be doing precisely the opposite.</li>

<li>The pressure should be on the <i>keep</i> camp to prove notabilty. NOT on the <i>delete</i> camp to prove non-notabilty. Proving notabilty (if notable) should be a lot easier, anyway.</li>
<li>I agree here. POV article should be edited, no deleted. Non-notable articles should be deleted.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Athough not one of my favourite artists, I saw C-Flow perform in Wollongong during his east coast tour (summer 2003) and I was one of maybe 400 people there. Considering Wollongong isn't huge, and Australian hip-hop isn't very popular, 400 people is a massive turnout, and it was only in a school hall, so it was pretty full. I heard he drew much larger crowds in Sydney and Brisbane, and my friend is a big fan. I don't see how he isn't notable, and I'm surprised you other aussies haven't heard of him. --MC Grave | Talk (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the article was created by an enthousiastic visitor (I recognize his nickname) noticing the absence of a English article apparantly, but needs expanding. I believe CampZone is notable because it is an established unique large outdoor LAN party event. I haven't been able to disprove the claim that CampZone is indeed the largest outdoor LAN party at the moment yet. I'm going to expand the article as much as I can (I have been participating in the event for three years now). <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeroenHoek_e40c.html" title="User:JeroenHoek">JeroenHoek</a> 16:26, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I also am convinced that Campzone should be allowd to take it's place here. Although i also can niether prove/disprove the "biggest in Europe" claim, i DO know that it is big, and fast becoming a "Cult Event" in Europe and is worthy of a wider audiance, especially in an Online Encyclopedia like Wikipedia. I myself have just returned from my 3rd Campzone event and as always am looking forward to the next years Event. The addition of this entry will only help the growth of an already much publisized (in Holland) event in the gaming community. --Coyotekid57 17:48, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, CampZone is quite an unique event and it's worth a place in the Wikipedia so more people can take notice of the fact that an event like this exists. CampZone is also working on a more international character of the event, so a Wiki article can be usefull to reach some more people from abroad. At the moment people are seriously busy expanding the article. Please give them some time to write it. --Chell 22:39, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I am one of the organizers and would also like to request to keep this article. There is allready a forum thread active on discussing the entry and which information to provide. Speaking as organisation of Campzone I would also like to see a correct and informational article take form and be incorperated into the global knowledge that is wikipedia. Several plans are beying made to submit information in detail. This is not just meant as a big advertisement, we have enough of that. Campzone to our knowledge is a quite unique event, especially on our scale (1700+ people). Biggest outdoor lan in Europe is certainly true, actually, I know of no other in the whole world? --Quindor 23:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Together with the rest of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-patterns.html" title="Anti-patterns">anti-patterns</a>, it makes for an interesting collection of programming mistakes, which I at least feel I get something out of looking through.

<li>Just to clarify myself. In many cases where I have seen this the programmer understood what the code did and used it accordingly. The program worked just fine, but the code did not take advantage of the OOP features available in the language. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBergsten_f850.html" title="User:Bergsten">Bergsten</a> 12:03, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP:NOR is neither explicitly nor implicitly related to this. It covers the kinds of articles which might issue from, say, Archimedes Plutonium.

<li>I have to agree; this page simply is not original research.

<p>Hey whats that? This is a free dictionary, its supposed to contain INFORMATION. My articles are just that, information. I see no reason what so ever to delete these entries just because they don't return enough hits on google.</p>
<p>Also, search for WorldPower 3.0 and you will get a hit on the nationsim directly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005]] ([[User talk:Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Itake}17:52, 3 August 2005|contribs]]).</small></p>

<li>First of all, Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a dictionary. That is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>. Also, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia Is Not</a>... an indiscriminate collection of information. That is to say, simply because something <i>exists</i> or <i>is true</i> does not grant it automatic inclusion in Wikipedia. Generally, for things such as websites or games, the object in question must be "notable" for its importance in a particular field or area of interest, or for its visibility in popular culture. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 17:58, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, encyclopedia. Whatever. They are all notable. If you did some time to read up on this subject you would see that there exists like 50 or so (and probably more thats just not listed) nationsims, but only TWS, WP, SPC and Qpawn are really big. Thats why only did pages for them. If I wanted to, I could have done it for every single nationsim but I didn't since there are many that have been inactive for years now. So they are significant in this context, they are significant in the world of nationsims. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a></li>

<ul>
<li>This is why I withheld judgment on Qpawn and SuperPower Classic. Also, a dictionary is <i>very</i> different, and serves a distinct purpose, from an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:03, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I <i>know</i> what a dictionary is and I know what an <i>encyclopedia</i> is. Thank for that brief but unecessary lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the WP and TWS entries are only one-liners because I don't have any more information on them. There is probably alot more information to fill in there. If you look at the wikipedia entry for goverment simulation you will see alot of info on TWS that I plan to put in there. As for WP, no I don't have anymore info.

<li>That is probably the longest discussion without a single vote on VfD that I have seen. That being said, I'm really not sure that the notability of these nationsims extends beyond the people that play them, and since there aren't too many that are active, I suggest we <b>delete</b> them all as the "biggest one" of these three has 68 listed registered users. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">T</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">C</a> 19:33, August 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are thousands of players playing these games, and thats what I call notable. US gov sim for example, has about 500 members. The ASG has 500 members. WorldPower has 80 members.

<li>I vote to <b>Keep.</b> This is a notable genre in internet gaming. Is this not the debate? If so, then let my opinion be heard. This is a notable genre, though it may not have the number of users as EverQuest, or World of Warcraft, or even Master of Orion 2. Measuring the notability in numbers, though, is both very difficult, given the constant fluidity of geopolitical world simulator gamer population, and in many ways incompetent. The genre doesn't have great numbers for a few reasons, not one of which is not that the genre itself, more a subgenre of simulation, is unimportant. These games are long, many times tedious, and most people only want to play one of a very few nations, and when they do get it, they may leave. Also, think about it. When was the last time you saw an ad for any of these games? See, there is no member benchmark for notability, because that would be silly. It's the idea behind the game that we should be talking about. The idea to put players in the shoes of world leaders has been an idea in the backs' of many developers' minds, starting with Civilization, which could qualify as the first nationsim, and now we are just carrying that tradition on. Allowing players to have "power" over a nation/organization is an idea that, frankly, few have picked up on. Call me a partisan and ignore me, if you wish, but my points are still valid. This idea is notable and deserves to be heard, not ignored. <small>This unsigned vote was by DJ_R.

<li>Your analysis simply appears to examine voting patterns and assign membership of a putative group on that basis. But the only thing linking those whom you assign to a group is that, for their various reasons, they do not share with you the belief that notability criteria apply to schools and they vote consistently to reflect that lack of agreement with you. You cannot infer group membership from shared opinion. Indeed to make matters worse my opinion, to take an example, has changed a great deal over time. Go back to November/December and you'll find that I was of the opinion that listing schools in Wikipedia was wrong, and I even listed one or two for deletion myself. I changed my mind.

<li>Just thought I'd point out that this statement, "they do not share with you the belief that notability criteria apply to schools and they vote consistently to reflect that lack of agreement with you" proves exactly the point I made earlier. They don't analyze individual schools or articles on merit but rather the fact they are schools. By that logic all grocery stores, bars, and 7-Eleven locations should be kept as well. Being a school does not guarentee notablity.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:14, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The "Route 95" article was one Maoririder started. In it, he was apparently trying to describe <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> as "a highway that runs from Maine to Florida." Since I've always heard the term "route" applied to US and state highways, I redirected it to the article on US 95, a completely different stretch of road not far from where I live in California. So, the link's even wrong...and I'd told him what I'd done regarding the redirect. Sigh yet again... - Lucky 6.9 20:43, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>FWIW, here's the prior content of "Route 95:" <i>It is the main route from Maine all the way to Florida.</i> It was followed by a homemade template which resolved to <i>this route stub is about routes and you can help expand it!</i> Why he didn't research this first is beyond me since every main interstate in the US has an article. - Lucky 6.9 20:47, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Promotional article, apparently about a would-be singer. The albums and singles referenced are unavailable from English-language sources and appear to be vanity published. There were also two articles for each individual single (why not have a seperate article for the "special edition" version?) that I have redirected here; these should be deleted as well. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 21:02, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that Punkmorten's point is that there is little evidence to suggest that Sayaka is a "star" of Japanese pop. Since there are no English-langauge sources that we can check, the article is not verifiable. Also, she does not appear to meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The evidence on hand is that she's the daughter of <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiko_Matsuda_f3b6.html" title="Seiko Matsuda">Seiko Matsuda</a>, she has various internationally-available record releases, and her first single was composed by a member of a notable band. This single apparently reached the top 100 (#5) and satisfies WP:MUSIC. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:43, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being a daughter of a notable musician is not in itself notable. Having your single composed by a notable musician is not in itself notable. As for the single's chart position, it's unverifiable. Verify it, and then we can talk about established notability. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 11:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nevertheless, this is a commonly used term in fora; if you can think of a better name for the article, please feel free to rename it, but I object to a perfectly legitimate article being deleted because it doesn't return on google define. Neither, you may note, does Tomie, and that article hasn't been requested for deletion. Wikipedia is meant to be a collaborative encyclopedia of everything, and even if Google hasn't heard of a frontpage turd, that doesn't mean actual people haven't.</p>

<dd>I take it that's a Keep vote, or at least not a Delete? It'd be useful if you provided some evidence that it was "a commonly used term in fora", though, since I didn't only use Google Define, either: there are no hits returned either on the main Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22frontpage+turd%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22frontpage+turd%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> or (relevant to your argument) on Google Groups <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=%22frontpage%20turd%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=%22frontpage%20turd%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Putting a space in it (ie "Front page turd") produces precisely one hit. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22front%20page%20turd%22&amp;qt_s=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=gw" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22front%20page%20turd%22&amp;qt_s=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=gw" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> I can't see how it's anything but non-notable. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 22:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is a Keep vote. I haven't time nor patience to trawl through dozens of forums and development websites looking for this phrase.. It should be enough proof of the concept's existence that I can define 'frontpage turd' in this much detail.

<dd>I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for some evidence for the common existence of a phrase which is almost completely unknown to Google, seeing as no sources are cited in the article itself. You're quite right to say that Google is not the whole Internet, but as a very important search engine neither is its silence irrelevant, and Google hits are often used here as a rule of thumb for notablity or otherwise. If the consensus here is Keep then the article will stay and of course I'll accept that entirely. The fact I've nominated the article certainly doesn't mean I think you're making the whole thing up, since I don't: simply that I'm unconvinced it's notable enough for Wikipedia.

Flanders is hardly sympathetic to FrontPage, calls it "AffrontPage," and says "Microsoft doesn't use FrontPage to create pages on Microsoft.com -- even the pages discussing FrontPage. If Microsoft doesn't use it, why should you?" The title of his website shows that he is not averse to using coarse language.

<li><b>Keep</b> If this term is not notable, it should be! although I've never heard the term, it describes a genunine phenomenon and is precisely explained. In other words, web sites built with FrontPage tend to share the undesirable characterists the author describes.

<li><b>Merge</b> - O come on, there is more info here than his own faculty website <a href="http://inside.bard.edu/religion/facultyproj/neusner/" class="external autonumber" title="http://inside.bard.edu/religion/facultyproj/neusner/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> bothers to reproduce.

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I think it can be turned encyclopedic.

<li><b>Merge</b> back to the main article. A brief scan of articles on some major academics shows that the tendecy is very strongly to collect the most influential works, and list them as a section on the main page, with perhaps a breif description. I looked at <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html#Major_works" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Boas_aa34.html#Writings_by_Boas" title="Franz Boas">Boas</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Clerk_Maxwell_e091.html#Publications" title="James Clerk Maxwell">Maxwell</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html#Works_by_Feynman" title="Richard Feynman">Feynman</a>. Even Feynman, with close to three dozen items (and that may be too many) looks just fine, especially as they are well organized. I see no reason why the same couldn't be done here. (Unless, of course, no one can be found who knows which works are major, and which aren't. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem, and ignorance is no excuse for clutter.) After all, if the purpose of an encylcopaedia is to provide information, it does no good to have a giant list of all of someone's publications if the reader can't tell which ones are really that important, and if they're desperate to find some minor work, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> either a collection of links (or titles) nor an indescriminate collection of information.

<p>Entirely non-notable. <a href="http://www.ociojoven.com/gallery/imageview/2354/" class="external text" title="http://www.ociojoven.com/gallery/imageview/2354/" rel="nofollow">This "thing"</a> is the extent of what I can find on this topic. Otherwise, I can't find any evidence of a manga called "Ninja vs. Samurai" on Google, though I do find a lot of forum posts about it. It's possible I've just never heard of it, but my fiancee, an avid manga reader, hasn't heard of it either... so here it is, nominated for deletion. I thank the Wikify project for pointing me in the direction of this page.</p>
