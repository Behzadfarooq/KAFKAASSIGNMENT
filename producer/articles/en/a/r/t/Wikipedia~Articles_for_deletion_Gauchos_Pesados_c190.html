<p>Vanity page? Definitely not remarkable, 6 Google matches. On the other hand, not everything is on the net, and the article is self-contained, complete and well written. Nevertheless, I propose to delete it.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Marianocecowski</a> 15:11, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Vanity of non remarcable music group. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Marianocecowski</a> 15:11, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> ¿Non remarcable music group?. It's the group that initiated the genre that later made bands like Ráfaga become famous worldwide. The group itself is not famous, but at least you can link it from the glamorous cumbia article. This band used to have a web page, years ago when they were a little famous in their region. The legacy is the music they invented, not the band work itself. It deserved, at least, to be a link from "glamorous cumbia". Remember that some people and some places are not so computerized. I'm not related to any person of the band. Even more, I never got the chance to talk to them. I don't live near their area. On the other side, it's true that I was and I still am a fan of the band and that I like their music. But people that reads the glamorous cumbia article perhaps want to know about the creators of the genre. Another example: Nobody remembers the group Smile, but it invented the style that Queen took to become famous. So, let's see if I explained myself: I don't want to argue, and I do not want to bother anyone. But this band deserves at least a link from the article of the musical genre. It's not vanity. It's history. Thank you. <i>User:200.73.180.22</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a lower-class band from a country where net access is not as widespread as US- and Euro-centric Wikipedia POV seems to consider normal; it's far less likely to be indexed by Google. It certainly achieved some notoriety in its time; I don't think its being a local phenomenon precludes listing it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaragui_2f04.html" title="User:Taragui">Taragui</a> 07:24, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Allmusic is not aware of them and Google has limited records. As a contemporary band that has supposedly released a number of albums, one would think that there would be more than six Google hits. Google indexes what is present. Argentina has a reasonable internet presence. I suspect a hoax with little verifiable information. The "glamorous cumbria" seems suspicious too. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 04:53, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

There are no references to this band locatable from a Google search other than Wikimedia and its mirrors. This heightens my concerns about the verifiability of this band.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not verifiable, so deletion is required. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 07:10, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. First. Most bands and singers in <a href="http://www.fantasticobailable.com/gruposysolistas.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fantasticobailable.com/gruposysolistas.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> are not on allmusic.com, while all of them exist with varying degrees of sucess in the argentine cumbia scene. The fact that the site of one of the main venues of the cumbia scene in <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> lists those bands makes me think they're rather on the "sucessful" section of "varying degrees of success", so I think the "is not in allmusic.com" argument to be faulty. Second, cumbia is a very low-class musical expression in argentina, a country which has around 50% of it's population living in poverty -hence no access to internet, let alone upload some page about some lesser known band-, so I consider the "no references on google" to be faulty too in this case. On a side note, the author seems too eager to put this thing here, and links the bands article to pages that shouldn't (ie: <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbia.html" title="Cumbia">Cumbia</a>, see <a href="../../../c/u/m/Talk%7ECumbia_9872.html" title="Talk:Cumbia">talk:Cumbia</a> for why I consider a lesser known band of Argentine Cumbia shouldn't be on that article). I don't know the band, perhaps because I hardly know the scene, but -personally- I wouldn't even consider including this article on wikipedia. On the other hand... <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">meta:Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits</a> turns my opinion into <i>Keep</i>, sadly On a last comment, to User:200.73.180.22: <i>Nobody remembers the group Smile, but it invented the style that Queen took to become famous.</i>, Smile turned into <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html#Origin" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>, they're not unrelated. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 06:09, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I had 4.910 hits of Google, not 6. Here is the direction. <a href="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=gauchos+pesados&amp;meta=</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But when looking for "gauchos pesados" I had 72 hits (<a href="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.ar/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22gauchos+pesados%22&amp;meta=</a>). Try it if you want. 72 hits is enough for a band of a genre that is not very computerized. Google standards should be lower for less computerized places. On the other hand, I think people who remember this band is computerized, because, as I said on the article, glamorous cumbia was not for lower-class people, but for upper-class (take the example of Ráfaga, the best exponent of the glamorous cumbia genre, for which I made an article too). To say glamorous cumbia is a lower-class music is like saying that The Black Eyed Peas is a lower-class music in the United States. Everyone listen to them. And the same with Eminem. And another thing: don't be fooled with the statistics, because it may be true that 50 percent of people in Argentina lives in bad conditions. That is in the ugly zone of the country. But in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and all the provinces of the South, people has a lot of money. Take myself for example: I don't have more money than all the people I know, but everyone in my town (including me) has everything (internet with a high connection, flat TV, DVD with home theatre, a nice house with garden and a swimming pool; and everyone has a third grade or university degree (I'm a publicist creative) and speaks at least spanish and english (I speak portuguese and italian too). But I'm not a millionaire. It's simply that this is the status in the richer zones of Argentina. So don't pay attention to the news that shows tha bad parts of the country. We're not mixed with lower-class people. They have their own provinces and cities, and rich people or people who lives well we have our own cities and towns (in my case, a private neighbourhood). So stop talking about Argentina like it is Camerun, Rwanda or Afganistan. It's not like this. Is a country formed by immigrants from Europe. And a great country, indeed (at least half of it).</p>

<dd>those 4.910 are all either unrelated to the band or from wikipedia or it's mirrors. The 72 figure on "gauchos pesados" are all wikipedia articles the author has created or modified to include the band (Wikipedia or it's offsprings...) That is to say: 0 reference on it besides wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 16:13, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
