<li><b>Delete</b>. While our article on <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chop_suey.html" title="Chop suey">chop suey</a> <i>does</i> acknowledge the food as "pseudo-Chinese cuisine" and doesn't explicitly name its inventor (which at first led me to believe this might not be as ridiculous as it sounds), after a little research on Google it seems whoever wrote this article was confused or mistaken. Father Armeni, it seems, was just an Armenian man who was quoted by the band System of a Down in their song <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chop_Suey%21_1be9.html" title="Chop Suey!">Chop Suey!</a>. ‚Äî <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">–õ–∏–≤–∞–π</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">‚ò∫</a> 08:56, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (unless someone writes a serious bio) - I hope someday this guy gets a serious article written about him; his name is apparently associated with the Armenian Genocide of 1915, but, alas, he seems to have nothing to do with chop suey. -<a href="../../../e/i/s/User%7EEisnel_29f7.html" title="User:Eisnel">Eisnel</a> 09:32, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please do not bite the newcomers - I suggested to the author to post this. It is sourced from personal research and corporate material. The subject at hand played a key role in defining technology for GoTo, PriceGrabber, Price.com, PartsAmerica and literally dozens of other significant web applications. I have further suggested to the author to expand the information gathering to cite sources. As an influencer and guide, this subject is an unsung hero. I suggest letting her (the author) complete her attempt.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If it needs improvement (and I agree that it does), improve it.

<li>It isn't mentioned because it didn't exist as an entity when the book came out ca. 1989. This is a <i>loose</i> collective of <i>like-minded</i> individuals who happen to approach their various crafts with relatively the same jaundiced (sic) worldview. Maybe if we didn't call it a "movement" and instead focused on just how this collective is different from all others that have preceeded it in type and deed. Dada is undefinable. Surrealism is subjective. UnPop is similarly in the eye of the beholder. Neither you nor I can safely say what it <i>is</i>.

<p>Marked for speedy but isn't a candidate. Reason was "article criterion#1". My understanding of criterion 1 is that the contents of the article do not go significantly beyond what can be gleaned from the title; however, someone unfamiliar with soccer is unlikely to know that Santos FC is the name of a soccer club, or the name of one of its star players. On the other hand, it's a tiny little substub.

<p>The article seems mostly to be about how the Dec 2004 tsunami might well have an impact on the use of "tsunami" in trade names (for which the media are pretty much irrelevant) and the metaphorical use of the word in the media. Thus it seems to be mistitled; it would better be <i>2004 Indian Ocean tsunami impact on the non-literal use of the word "tsunami"</i> -- which of course is laborious and hardly the kind of thing this encyclopedia usually covers.</p>
<p>That's its purpose at one level, at least. At another, it uses findings from the Global Language Monitor and is written in such a way that it's hard not to suspect that it's the GLM rather than "tsunami" that's the main subject here.</p>
<p>We learn that the use of the word "tsunami" in "the" (which?) "mass media" grew enormously immediately after the big one. This of course is no surprise, but the only evidence is that provided by GLM. A look in the discussion page reveals that the article was in effect written by GLM, so this is original research. But let's not belabor this: we really don't need research to tell us that "tsunami" became much more widely written and spoken after the big tsunami.</p>
<p>We then read that <i>Among the immediate impacts were found to be that Tsunami-related product names began to undergo intense scrutiny and that sporting organizations had to reassess tsunami-related team names.</i> If true, this wouldn't be surprising -- but no examples are given of name changes (proposed or actual), and there are no further details.</p>
<p>There's then a rehash of the derivation of <i>tsunami</i> and the inappropriateness of the term "tidal wave", a <i>prediction</i> of the future effect on "the world of consumer packaged goods" and another <i>prediction</i> of the effect on journalistic metaphorical hyperbole.</p>
<p>There's nothing interesting here: just speculation, original research into what doesn't even need research, and a bit of plugging for one service, GLM. And if the article were rewritten without irrelevance and following research that did not depend on proprietary algorithms and such mumbo-jumbo, my guess is that all it would say is that some people became rather less keen on the figurative use of a single word. This would be pretty vacuous. <b>Delete.</b> -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:10, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</p>

<li>Considering the shape of the article, VfD is tempting.

<ul>
<li>I do not need to verify it, and indeed I should not. Wikipedia is not the place for original research-- not mine nor anyone else's, as it lacks the capacity to develop its own criteria for such categorization schemes and then apply them. See my comments on the VfD page for Sixteen known nuclear crises of the Cold War for the same argument. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 05:49, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is absurd--the list simply correlates known accused puppet states with occasional evaluative input as to the validity (in more famous cases). You might have a point at least in asking for cited sources, though I am not going to take responsibility for the material I didn't add personally. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 06:08, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a matter of historical record that North Korea considers South Korea a US puppet state, and that the US made the accusation that East Germany, Poland, et. al. were Soviet puppet states. That much is easily verifiable. Why not let others verify it instead of just destroying information? That's tantamount to vandalism. ‚Äî <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 06:59, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that the nomination brings up some excellent points about this article, but the concept of the article itself is a good one. I just think it should be changed from a list to just a discussion of the concept of puppet states and possibly some historical examples. The beginning of the article is on the right track. (But to call this the "stupidest VfD nomination ever" is ... odd. <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">User:Jtkiefer</a> makes a decent argument, this isn't a nonsensical nomination.) <a href="../../../k/m/c/User%7EKmccoy_af23.html" title="User:Kmccoy">kmccoy</a> <a href="../../../k/m/c/User_talk%7EKmccoy_b427.html" title="User talk:Kmccoy">(talk)</a> 05:45, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would like to clarify my reasoning behind this VFD, I have nominated due to the fact that this lists blind examples of accused puppet states, if this were about the concept of a Puppet state then this would fall right under wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> 05:47, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The comment, <i>"States or governments accused of being puppets since 1990,"</i> is a precondition to neutrality on the matter for including examples--the point is rather elementary, and it preceded any input of mine. You say that, <i>"almost none of these puppet states have ever been proven to be puppets,"</i> but refrain from giving criteria as to what constitutes such as proof--the point of the article is that it is an accusation leveled by individuals, organizations, and/or governments against other governments. It is hard to see that one may credibly deny that this is so, regardless of whether the accusation is true or not, and in several cases within the very list the quality of the accusation is lessened by a brief recount of the relevant history.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For an example take China; the communists receieved substantial assistance from Stalin and played a subservient role to its policy in the communist world from the establishment of the People's Republic, yet it came to resent its secondary status as well as Khrushchev's "revisionism" and broke in the coming decades, with an attempt to achieve an hegemony all its own. Hence, "Red China" was often considered in the west to be the Kremlin's implacable ally but this later proved to be farcical, and the point was played upon by American strategists from the Nixon to Reagan administrations.</dd>
<dd>I also took consideration into the matter of neutrality as it regards the order and listing of puppet "groups", with a simple chronological outlook--the first listed accused puppet state came from the US, then the USSR, and so on (as well as which state came before another on the same list). More groupings could be added, such as with France's colonialism, the coups, and counter-coups, but this is not an area I am knowledgeable in and requires that others participate, not simply vote to delete the matter.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the supposition of deletion itself rests upon the mere listing but the same attributions of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic.html" title="Semantic">semantic</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativism.html" title="Relativism">relativist</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propagandistic</a>, and emotive rationales for terms can be found in the existence of articles for <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kulak.html" title="Kulak">kulak</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom.html" title="Freedom">freedom</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resistance_movement.html" title="Resistance movement">resistance movement</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fighter.html" title="Freedom fighter">freedom fighter</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_of_the_people.html" title="Enemy of the people">enemy of the people</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_state.html" title="Satellite state">satellite state</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggression.html" title="Aggression">aggression</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> and numerous others--this should not imply that the existence and importance of the term be negated nor that it may actually be applied in many cases with species reasoning or not. In short, this dispute is more appropriate for the talk page and not at all proper in deciding for all-out deletion.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think many voters have, however, missed the point. I think that <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> is suggesting that if they do not bear the standard DVD logo, it may for a reason. Various companies have introduced copy-protected or otherwise restricted formats such as <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flexplay.html" title="Flexplay">Flexplay</a> and copy-protected CDs. The protection mechanism requires the format to differ from the standard, and therefore these formats are never in strict compliance with the standard. Standards organizations seem to be taking the principled (and realistic) stand that these products not really be reliably playable on all standard playback gear, and therefore may not bear the trademarked CD or DVD logos.</dd>

<dd>I happen to agree that consumers should treat the absence of a standards logo as a red flag. Unfortunately, as far as I know any notion that Disney DVD's are not standard DVDs is speculation. The fact that Disney DVD's do not bear the DVD logo is a rather trivial fact, <i>unless</i> <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> or someone else can cite credible sources that suggest that there's more to this than Disney corporate ego.

<dd>If there were such a thing as a Disney DVD that wasn't just an ordinary DVD made by Disney with their custom logo, then an article that actually explained this would be great. As it stands, the current article is just speculation that Disney DVDs are somehow different without offering any explanation how.</dd>
<dd>It is quite common for CDs and DVDs to not carry their standard logos without necessarily having DRM present. I have not seen any evidence to the contrary (on Google, or on Slashdot, where people have often mentioned creating backup DVDs for children to use without damaging the original) that a Disney DVD is anything other than the standard format described <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html#DVD-Video" title="DVD">here</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovakreo_5e83.html" title="User:Novakreo">Novakreo</a> 28 June 2005 07:06 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a>, the fact that the Disney DVD's carry a substitute for the DVD logo is a bit of subtrivia. It might be appropriate to mention it briefly in the context of some Disney article. However, DO NOT include any personal speculation about the significance of the fact UNLESS you actually have a verifiable outside REFERENCE you can cite as to what that significance might be.

<dd>I was browsing DVDs at a store today and noticed that at least two Disney releases (<i>The Pacifier</i> and the Mickey/Donald/Goofy version of <i>The Three Musketeers</i>) carried the standard DVD Video logo. Also, if there were truly any special DRM voodoo, it seems that they would create similar names for their other labels‚ÄîTouchstone, Miramax, etc. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><i>tregoweth</i></a> June 29, 2005 02:06 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. I'm sure the DVD Forum does not <i>require</i> licensees to carry the logo. On the Diskey disks, it is probably just Disney ego. I'm not a Disney-watcher, but I could easily imagine their having policy of never allowing any non-Disney logo to appear on their stuff. Certainly, I could imagine them thinking that having a special Disney DVD logo enhances their brand more than the lack of the regular DVD hurts them.

<li><b>Delete.</b> 20yo photographer of rock bands. His work looks good, but hardly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:22, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Author -</i> This is fair enough, and I must admit knowing him personally, however, might I point out Andrew Kendall's entry? Subsequent research from his site shows that Andrew Kendall began at the age of 19. I did not want to add personal spin to the article, but within my own experience he was a tremendous influence to the photography team at King's College London during his time there and has made a deep impression on at least the twenty photographers that he has worked with and trained personally there while rising to the rank of Photo Editor within his first year. That is only one instance of his influence, and for a man of 20, is already impressive, in my humble opinion. On the other hand, if it is commonly agreed that the 'notability,' (which, without malicious intent, seems to be based here on a Google search), of Naresh is not worthy of Wikipedia then perhaps it is too early for an entry? --193.61.200.140 12:19, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: The problem with the analogy to Andrew Kendall (and I could add several other photographers, and many other artists, to this list... maybe I'll just cite <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._S._Bach_769d.html" title="J. S. Bach">J. S. Bach</a> as one) is that you're asking us to predict the future. Neither of these was encyclopedic at age 20, except in hindsight. Yes, the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Google test</a> has its limits, and we have a chronic problem keeping to these and explaining them to enthusiastic newcomers. One often proposed unofficial motto of Wikipedia is <i>we do the Googling for you</i>. Googling is not just a matter of designing a search, most of the skill in using Google is deciding how significant the results are (like most sources of information). Speaking for myself, I often use offline sources and think this is important. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:52, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Wikipedia is a tertiary source of information. I.e. we have to rely upon the general world to have already documented and discussed a figure and to some great degree before we include him. The point is that we are never supposed to be the <i>first</i> place to talk of someone or something. Thus, we have to wait for a photographer to have already made a name for himself or herself. It may be likely that this person will become notable, but he is not at present. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:05, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Author -</i> Sure thing, I understand, <s>feel free to delete both the erroneous entry and this one at will</s>. Thanks for explaining George, I failed to think outside of the scope of Britain, and will take care in future. (Edit: Just read George's article on VfD; I should leave it up to others to determine 'deletability.') --193.61.200.140 13:24, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Please do consider getting an account and sticking around. We desperately need more fine arts content. Forget how little we have on emerging artists: our coverage of established artists is rudimentary for all folks after 1940. In other words, don't get discouraged. Keep the guidelines in mind, and you can always ask for proofreading or help from others. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:42, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Photographer with website and LiveJournal blog. Coudn't find notable event associated with him (thousands Google hits but only few for this person).</p>
<p>Sentence from his website: <i>I've also been documenting my life via photography since 1997, in 2003 after taking photographs and putting them online I was contacted by the NME and am now working with them and various other publications as music photographer</i>.</p>
<p>It looks similar to case of Naresh Verlander, another photographer right on VfD, above (A.K. got compared to him).

<li>Delete: Say, all you keep voters, could you tell me how many other Trinity Preparatory Schools there are in the US? How many in the UK? How many in Australia? How many in New Zealand?

Is it that this one is in Florida? (How many are in Florida?) Have any of you looked at Peterson's Guide to Private Schools?

<li>I'd like to vote for keeping the term. It's become well known online. A google search for "bloggernacle" pulls up 18,800 hits. It's the Mormon equivalent of the Catholic term "St. Blog's Parish" which has a wikipedia entry. (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Blog%27s_Parish" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Blog%27s_Parish" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Blog%27s_Parish</a> ). The blogger conference (BloggerCon) run by the Pew Forum discussed faith-based blogging communities, and included the bloggernacle in the list. (See <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:kSKOjCDsRPQJ:blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/2004/04/07+bloggernacle+jblog&amp;hl=en" class="external free" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:kSKOjCDsRPQJ:blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/2004/04/07+bloggernacle+jblog&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:kSKOjCDsRPQJ:blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/2004/04/07+bloggernacle+jblog&amp;hl=en</a> ). It's a term that is used by enough people that it should have an entry. (And by the way, I apologize if I'm doing the voting thing wrong. I've never voted on wikipedia before. I didn't see a "Vote" button so I clicked "Edit" and I'm putting in a comment that way. Is that how I'm supposed to do it?). Thanks.
