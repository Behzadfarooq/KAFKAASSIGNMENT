<li><b>Keep</b>, on the basis that Candidates and Elections has not been adopted as community consensus yet; it is unreasonable to have the <i>expectation</i> that the race will yet be covered when the community as a whole doesn't know that it's "supposed" to. How can you violate a "discussion?" As for notability, the article itself mentions that he has been a state representative (so he isn't a crank candidate, which would be grounds for deletion on notability grounds, I suppose), <i>and</i> that he has been the major party candidate for lieutenant governor in Connecticut. Furthermore, on the basis of <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat's</a> objection, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that political figures that have held office in a state legislature are notable (see second bullet point in WP:BIO). <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 23:59, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines allow "major local political figures who receive significant press coverage" to receive WP pages. According to Google News, there are 472 recent articles about Joe Courtney, and Courtney has recently been featured on the front page of The New York Times. Additionally, Courtney has been elected to the Connecticut General Assembly, has raised millions of dollars of campaign contributions, and is one of the more prominent politicians in the state. Removing this entry would be a non-NPOV commentary on the race.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 00:45, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I placed <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Murphy_%28politician%29_2640.html" title="Chris Murphy (politician)">Chris Murphy (politician)</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Courtney_%28politician%29_9420.html" title="Joe Courtney (politician)">Joe Courtney (politician)</a> pages up for deletion because the Diane Farrell page was delete (which I objected to). All I am saying is that Farrell should not have been deleted and these 2 not. Like Courtney, 2006 is Farell's 2nd time running against Shays in a tight contest. What we need is CONSISTENCY here. Perhaps we should just create another page on Farrell and defend it from AfD again.
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree completely. Deleting Diane Farrell's profile was ridiculous. While the current political notability policy is misguided, even following the policy, all three candidates (Murphy, Courtney and Farrell) have received more than adequate press coverage per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requirements (all three have been profiled on the front page of the NY Times, among others) and should not be deleted. What needs to be done to petition to resurrect Farrel's bio?--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 04:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Courtney was a former member of a state legislature and is thus specifically covered by the reference to state legislators which means former or current. Any coverage of subsequent activities adds to verifiability. Also appears to be a case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as per comments above. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 04:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Disagree strongly. Even if Courtney weren't running for Congress in the Second District, he'd deserve a WP:Bio of his own, as he is a prominent Connecticut lawyer, political figure and former state representative who has received considerable personal (as opposed to election-specific) press coverage. Write an article on the race as well, but don't delete this. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 20:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay.. so the article needs to establish notability. Former state reps are a dime a dozen, and so are lawyers. Has he done anything notable? Authored any notable bills?

<dd>Agree with Aguerriero. Francis, if you want Wikipedia to have an article on Joe Courtney, <i>you</i> do the research and write it. What we have now is not a full article but a tiny stub that has no business being an article of its own. The article can be replaced with a redirect to an article on the election in question until there's enough info for a full article on Courtney. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Until there are a lot more House of Representatives election articles (I count precisely <b>five</b> article on individual House elections in 2006, at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_by_state_46a8.html" title="Category:United States House of Representatives elections by state">Category:United States House of Representatives elections by state</a>), it is worthwhile to keep the pages of Democratic and Republican <b>nominees</b> (not <i>candidates</i> - <b>nominees</b> who will be in the November 2006 election). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 22:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
