<li>Actually, the original warning said "This article contains photographs of sex acts. For a version without photographs, see Oral sex (no pictures)." before Gmaxwell vandalized Template:Photo warning. <b>Keep</b>, per precedent at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Abu_Ghraib_prisoner_abuse_%28censored%29_a5ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse (censored)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse (censored)</a>. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 10:07, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Vandalized? That is a little rude. I justified my changes in my edit summary, and my edits were in good faith. Abu Ghraib didn't orignally use Template:Photo warning, but rather Template:Morbid warning, which is the same as the current Photo warning, but it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Deleted/Archive/Feb05&amp;redirect=no#Template:morbid_warning" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/Deleted/Archive/Feb05&amp;redirect=no#Template:morbid_warning" rel="nofollow">deleted</a>. The consensus was that the Abu Ghraib article would not use a template for its link to the censored version. A primary argument was that the existance of the template would encourage the creation of other censored articles. I did not realize that the link in Abu Ghraib had been replaced with the template in violation of that decision. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 14:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Would you please discontinue your overt hostility towards me, I'd prefer a civil discussion. I think it is probably useful to have a warning of the explicit nature of such pages, and I believe there was such a warning on on the article before that template was used. I was not attempting to ruin it so that it would be deleted but rather, I made two changes which I believed would improve it. I changed the wording to reduce a POV slant, and I removed the no pictures link because disabling images is the only sure way to not see naked pictures. I'm well aware of the TFD page, and would have nominated it myself if I felt that was clearly the best path at this time. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:48, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There was a proposed addition to mediawiki in the past to provide a navigation button to disable images easily (eh, well I can't find the cite, but other people tell me I am remembering correctly). It was overwhelmingly denied. The process of creating a (no pictures) version of Oral sex is a substantially POV pushing action because it says that the encyclopedia has an opinion of what content is 'right' and what is 'wrong'. I would support an easy to use hide image button in the main navigation, but the creation of special no images pages is harmful (encourages forking and censorship, since the *text* is explicit as well so a Oral sex (no thought crime) is the obvious next step. I also oppose the semi-fork as it cruds the database, and because it encourages POV pushing in links (changing links to the censored version)). Also the (no pictures) version would be a huge target for vandalism, as someone could easily stick a shocking picture at the top and really surprise people who though they were safe. Finally, since it is not possible to edit Oral sex without looking at the pictures, we are effectively telling people that don't want to see nudies that we don't want them editing wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:08, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unnecessary duplication. Anyone who would be offended by the photos would be offended by the text.

<li><b>No vote. Comment:</b> The reason anyone would want this is not to prevent <i>themselves</i> from being offended, but so that it is safe to view in a public or semi-public place (school, library, work, at home with young children or paranoid parents). And while people can browse with images off, some people may not know how to, and in any case it's inconvenient. On the other hand, having it for an individual article is an ugly hack and perhaps bad precedent. I personally think there should be an option when browsing Wikipedia to not view any images inline, which would be much cleaner (no pun intended) and more effective. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">Nickptar</a> 12:46, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Right which is why I pointed out in the VFD that it's not technically a fork... although the practice encourages forking as now Woman on top sex position (no pictures) which is actually a fork, and even fails to link back to the orignal and is biased in what pictures it removes. Creating no pictures links for some articles and not others is POV. People who want a no pictures option need to start a vote for that feature. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 16:06, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>End-user image suppression is currently on hold because of technical and design problems. Articles like this, where someone has identified a problem and gone to the trouble of fixing it, and has done so without forking, should be kept as stopgap measures until the software solution is in place.

<li><b>Delete</b> POV fork. And I'm genuinely offended that anyone would compare depictions of oral sex to depictions of prisoners being tortured—I think it takes a pretty skewed value system to find them both equally distasteful.

<li>I find it most disturbing that Cool Hand Luke has responded to this VfD by changing the inlined image on the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">Oral sex</a> page to a link. This in my opinion is blatantly against the sense expressed by most of those who have voted to delete the bowdlerized page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:34, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong concur</b> with Tony Sidaway. I am at work at the moment, and so viewing the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">Oral sex</a> article would not be apropriate, but this is no reason to remove pictures - I would expect it to have pictures and thus not be suitable for work. If I want to read about sex-related topics then I can do that at home. Tony, if you haven't done already please revert (do so in my name and/or cite this comment if you want). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:41, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is a second article on the subject of oral sex. It is based on the article <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>. It is not exactly the same as the article <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>. Therefore, it is a fork of the original article. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:27, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The only time I edited Oral Sex was after this page was voted Delete here and I'd spoken to an administrator about archiving the discussion. Had it been my intention to orphan it in bad faith, I would have not let it sit for a week. My edit to the template was made without complete understanding of the template, and without realizing it was in use elseware because I was in the middle of doing RC patrol. For that I am sorry. I have left it alone since that discussion. I think it is wrong to force decisions on articles by deleting their content via TFD and IFD, or to hide something that should be deleted by removing a link. As far as the fork issue, I was clear in the nomination that it is not a true fork. ... I imagine those voting delete because it is a fork voted that way because it is a fork in spirit if not technically--<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:52, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with Korath. Gmaxwell's behavior could be interpreted as somewhat trollish, and I am sure that isn't the impression he wants to give. I hope he will reconsider his actions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:35, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would to suggest, without the intention of offending, that you have failed to completely investigate the timeline of the events here before drawing your conclusion. I ran across the article on recent changes, saw the template directing to the no pictures version. I found the previously TFDed morbid photo warning template (by searching for the content of the template to figure out how it worked) and saw that it was deleted because (in part) it encouraged making forks/quasi forks. I adjusted the template to fit that concern (and did not remove it because I thought the warning was useful on the page). I then noticed that the Oral Sex (no pictures) page was actually a real page (I had previously thought it was a sideeffect for the template). I put it up for VFD. I was then told that the prisoner abuse used the template too... I'd missed that because when morbid warning was TFDed it was decided not to use a template by rather to include the text in the article. After that point I allowed the template to be reverted and left it alone. After this articles VFD timer expired with a clear delete decision, I talked to an admin about closing the VFD and I went and removed the template from the Oral Sex page. I presume this VFD has yet to be closed and archived because the debate restarted today after I yanked the template last night. After removing the template from Oral sex, I went to see if anything else was still using it, and then followed the link to the prisoner abuse article to read up on the discussion there.. After being confused by the history page, I realized that it was a copyright violation and followed the procedure for reporting it. In further discussion with Korath, I have discovered that it's possible to fix the copyright issue without removing the page... but I have to impliment that change because I am concerned by the fact that my intentions are being questioned. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:28, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Okay, firstly I'm sorry if I've misrepresented what you did. Secondly, I've no idea what you did or what state the whole silly thing is in now--which templates exist or do not exist, or whatever. Thirdly couldn't we just revert the whole silly thing to the way it was a week or two ago and pretend it never happened? This is getting embarrassing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:12, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
