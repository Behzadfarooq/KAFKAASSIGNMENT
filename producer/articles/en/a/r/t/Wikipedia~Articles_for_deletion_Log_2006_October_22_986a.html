<li><b>Delete as is</b>, though I could change my mind if the article was expanded. They've released a single full-length on a somewhat-notable indie label, and they have an article in a single reliable source; both of these (along with no other asserted notability) means it fails <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. The BBC article says they're on a "UK Tour", but it doesn't state if it's a national tour or just, say, a dozen shows in small clubs around Southern England. However, since the BBC article says that they've "blasted onto the music map", it's quite possible that there are other articles in reliable publications which would help the band pass WP:BAND (in which case, I'd obviously change to support). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:06, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The summary section of this article in the mother article is almost identical to the actual content of this one. The only additional content is ONE paragraph, namely <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Smyrna_7464.html#Occupation" title="Occupation of Smyrna">Occupation of Smyrna#Occupation</a>! (not to mention about its selective content)</li>
<li>There is no {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} template in the mother article (for obvious reasons), despite the fact that the original edit stated <i>"moved from Greco-Turkish War to have its own page"</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_%C4%B0zmir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40501636" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_%C4%B0zmir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40501636" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>

<p>Also, the title of the article, although a military term, is largely POV, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is anachronistic since the city was officially named "Izmir" later; should be "Smyrna"</li>
<li>it is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">paradox</a>; an army does not "occupy" a city if the majority of population is of same ethnicity; it "liberates" it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare the existing title to Temporary liberation of Smyrna to see the contrast of the two POV's. Either a more NPOV term should be used, to bridge those two extremes, or the article should be deleted under any name. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 00:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am quite annoyed that this article was tagged, covered in pov, then nominated for deletion within the space of an hour. I took the time to carefully research and cite the contents of this article, and i intended to return to it when time permitted. Firstly, this article is not a pov fork. There is no pov implied in the title or the article (and its content is not selective, i've tried to show the treatment of Muslims and Christians within this city), it is simply the most common term used for the Greek presence in Izmir during the Greco-Turkish war by historians. It is certainly more notable than Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922 as suggested by the nominator. Granted, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Smyrna_7464.html" title="Occupation of Smyrna">Occupation of Smyrna</a> may be even more notable, but i was prepared to rename it to this, this was not an issue for me. Secondly, as to its right to be separate from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, that article covers the Greek campaign from the landings in Izmir, to the Greek incursion right across Anatolia. I intended this article to deal solely with the Greek presence in Izmir over the war and in due course would have expanded it from its current state. Put simply, is the title verifiable through third party sources? Yes. Is the subject worthy of an article? In my opinion I believe it is. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 01:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article was created 8 whole months ago, and since then, no notable <i>fact</i> or <i>source</i> has been added to it. As Hectorian pointed below, it would be more legitimate to have a possible article named Occupation of Smyrni 9 September 1922-July 24 1923, talking about the turkish control of the city until the signing of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lausanne_64b1.html" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>. This article is a narrow POV selection, both geographicaly (should be <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionia.html" title="Ionia">Ionia</a>), and as a timeframe. Those 3 lines of text should be part of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, or Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922, or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>. <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 10:08, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It was not me who created it 8 months ago, i rewrote and sourced it only a few weeks ago. If your critcism is that it is not substantial enough, then this not a valid excuse for afd.

However, I find myself persuaded by the need to avoid a POV fork given the opposing historical and national views that still resonate from these events. The current content of this article is not much more than in the corresponding section of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>, which is currently entitled <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html#Greek_landings_and_consolidation.23Occupation_of_Smyrna" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greek Occupation of Smyrna</a>. There's currently little apparent value-added from a separate article to offset the POV fork potential. If the content were significantly expanded so that the value of a separate article could be made more apparent, I would be more inclined to support a <b>Keep</b> vote than I am now. If the article will be expanded, it would be reasonable to allow some time for this to occur.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The article deals with a specific event, part of the 'Greco-Turkish war (1919-1920)'. In its current state (under this title and with that content) the article serves as a POV-folk. Though it is claimed to refer to events connected with the city, it talks about Alasehir and Ataturk, not to mention that through hersays and selective usage of sources it has the place of a 'turkish pov-vehicle'... Concerning the title, it expresses the clear turkish pov, talking about 'occupation'... for the greeks, it was 'liberation' (having in mind that the majority of the population were Greeks). in addition, the Greek army landed in the city under permission of an international treaty (the one of Sevres), which had been signed by the then legitimate turkish government. Apropos, a possible article named Occupation of Smyrni 9 September 1922-July 24 1923, talking about the turkish control of the city until the signing of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lausanne_64b1.html" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>, would be more legitimate, since the turks of Kemal took a city with Greek majority, without being legitimised to do so under any treaty... Furthermore, the city's name was 'Smyrni' that time, not Izmir (also have in mind about this how the majority of the city's population and the world, or even the Ottoman administration called the city). I would agree with NikoSilver in the creation of an article named Greek administration of Ionia, 1919-1922, since: 1. this is the most NPOV title, and 2. it would talk about the whole area under Greek control (roughly corresponding to the histori region of <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionia.html" title="Ionia">Ionia</a>). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 06:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We have been here before, Greece occupied izmir a whole year before the Treaty of Sevres was signed, that is why its presence is referred to as occupation by historians. Even George Horton uses the term "Greek occupation of Smyrna". So your claim it landed under the provisions of a treaty is false. Second, invading a territory with the same ethnicity does not make it a liberation. It is still the territory of another sovereign. But all this is pointless, the title of this article is the most commonly used term for the events and it can be verified through impartial third party sources. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 10:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Garnet: I've no idea if my answer will be pointless, but if u look in the historic facts, u will see that Smyrni, at the time of the landing of the Greek army was not territory of another sovereign... The Ottoman Empire had been defeated in WWI, and so had sovereignty nowhere... (unless someone would thing he is ready to talk about 'French occupation of Alsace and Larraine...' (again, prior to the signing of a treaty). but even if we accept that the Ottoman Empire still was sovereign, the Greece administered the area, did not conquer it.... (that's why the ottoman flags remained in their place and there was a committement for a referendum). moreover, saying that since the treaty of Serves was not yet signed, we are free to name the article occupation, i'll have to remind u that the article does not cover the period 1919-1920, but more... In addition, under this pretext i can create another article, 'Turkish occupation of Smyrni 1922-1923', where the 'Great Fire' will be also discussed (more or less it would be as povfork as this one). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 19:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This debate seriously doesn't belong here, but just for the record: Being defeated in a war does not strip a state of its sovereignty over its territory, according to early 20th century international law.

<dd>My point is that as much legitimate it may be to call the greek administration of Smyrni as 'occupation', the same validity could apply to the territories Germany, Austia-Hungary, or anyone else's who was defeated in WWI (early 20th cent.). But it seems that the Germans are not pushing any pov concerning Gdansk or Lorraine...

<dd>Yes, but the question is whether the article content is substantive enough to stand on its own or whether it should be merged back into the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a> article.

<dd>I see your point. To my knowledge, there weren't any events <i>after</i> the war. In any case, why should this article be separate <i>until</i> we see such evidence? <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 08:51, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, strike what I said. I misremembered what I had read. I don't think there is any claim that the occupation extended beyond the end of the war. Re-reading the above, it appears that the Turks retook Smyrna after the end of the war. In which case, the occupation COULD be part of the article on the war or it could be separate. The question remains... is there enough encyclopedic material to warrant a separate article on the occupatio alone? Based on what's in the article now as opposed to what is in the article on the war now, I think there could be but it's a judgment call. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 09:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Could-should-would</i>, but definitely <b>isn't</b>. When it <i>will-shall-may</i>, we see if we make it separate. We'll have more data for bitching on what to call it too.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 09:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me be more clear. The article on the war has only two paragraphs on the Occupation of Smyrna. The Occupation of Izmir article has much more than that and can stand on its own as an article. If the Occupation of Izmir article were only two paragraphs, it would be a definite candidate for merging into the article on the war. However, because the Occupation of Izmir article is as big as it is, it is a judgment call whether to merge all of that info back into the article on the war, thus expanding the two paragraph section into a much larger section. I could support the merge or the keeping of the article as a stand-alone. I lean towards the keeping of the article as a stand-alone but, as I said, it's a judgment call.</dd>
<dd>If the Occupation of Izmir article is merged into the article on the war, it might be considered to be taking up a disproportionate amount of space in the article on the war. This is a good argument for pulling out the details of the occupation and having it be in a separate article.</dd>
<dd>If the Occupation of Izmir article were much larger than it is right now, there would be no question that the article should be a stand-alone.</dd>
<dd>Thus, I don't see this as being a POV fork issue at all. IMO, it's only a question of whether there is enough encyclopedic material to warrant a separate article. I think the answer is "Yes, just barely".</dd>

<dd>What, I'm supposed to actually READ the articles in question before expressing an opinion? Since when is that a requirement of AFD? &#160;;^)</dd>
<dd>Seriously, I confess that I am guilty of having looked at this question too superficially. I looked at the section in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Turkish_War_%281919-1922%29_4d8d.html" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a> article and saw the section titled "Occupation of Smyrna" and read those two paragraphs. If I had read the whole article, I would have seen what you pointed out. To wit, most of the rest of this article is covered in that article. In my defense, that other text was not clearly identified by the section headings as relevant to Smyrna. I have added in section headings to help the reader understand the flow of the article on the war. At this point, I am sitting on the fence, leaning towards a merge of the two articles. I have changed my vote above accordingly. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The whole argument that it needs merging because of the lack of content is pointless. No one is disputing its relevance or notability, only the amount of content, but this is something which can be expanded in time, and which i did intend to expand (i only rewrote and sourced it a couple of weeks ago). If it is merged, then put simply, i will recreate and expand it when i have time to do so. But it is unfair that other editors will not have the chance to expand it, and the onus will rest on me to research and expand the article to a state which will survive another merge request. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 18:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, there is a misconception here that the occupation of Izmir and the Greco-Turkish war were one and the same thing. The Occupation of Izmir was only one stage of the war. The others include, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC_8ed7.html" title="First Battle of İnönü">First Battle of İnönü</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC_a9c5.html" title="Second Battle of İnönü">Second Battle of İnönü</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sakarya_7c4a.html" title="Battle of Sakarya">Battle of Sakarya</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dumlup%C4%B1nar_039c.html" title="Battle of Dumlupınar">Battle of Dumlupınar</a>, and finally the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_Smyrna_c397.html" title="Great Fire of Smyrna">Great Fire of Smyrna</a>. These are all significant stages of the Greco-Turkish war. The current level of content should not detract from the fact that it is a notable part of the war which deserves its own article. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 18:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I got to this page searching for "list of british films" so it would be nice to keep it, at least redirecting to the category page(i don't know if it's possible), other reason to keep it is that it's classified by year (witch may be useful).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Why have a list where a category will suffice? Already, wiki has problems ensuring categories are correct and up to date. Admittedly, it's easier to create a list to modify all the entries in one go, but it defeats to whole purpose of wikicategories to have properly maintained lists and not categories. If it's useful for people to know which decade a film is from, I think that subcategories of for example '1980s British films' could be created. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:25, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do not disagree with your comment. Note that in no place I stated this was describing an individual community, just informed why the article was originally prod'ed. My concern is that the topic may create a precedent for articles like Halo community, Half-life community, Digg community, etc, which are not encyclopedic unless correctly sourced and verifiable. Also, the article has been "hidden" since creation, as it has no wikilinks, no categories, no stub, etc, and has since then became a link farm. I agree with your idea of merging some information into the main article, but the current one is, apparently, unencyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's clear that no one here has done any research into this community. To couple it with the article about "Petz" itself would be a sort of sin. "Petz" as it means to this community has nothing to do with the current programs by the same name. The following of these old and dead games borders on a cult, and anyone who has set foot into one of the stomping grounds of this community would know this. There are years and years of history, and plenty of sources that could be added. How about instead of deleting it, someone puts some effort into making it *accurate*? The difference between this community and the "halo community" or the like is obvious. We're united, and we're actually a <i>community</i>, we don't just all "play the same game". Many members of the community don't even play the games anymore. I challenge anyone who thinks the PC is on par with "a group of people who like to play Halo" to come visit us. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.104.242.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.242.76_b2e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.242.76">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>Hello there, 70.104.242.76. Unluckily, as you can read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">here</a>, the burden of evidence is in the editor who added the text, not in the ones reviewing it. We are not forced to find the "plenty of sources that could be added", they should be added by the ones adding the information in Wikipedia. Hopefully that made our position clear. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 05:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh, I understand. It just seems absurd to me to delete an article just because it's not instantly complete, rather than to edit it or label it as "incomplete". I'm not much familiar with wikipedia's rules and such, and I don't typically edit articles or anything, it just bothered me that the article might be deleted. Flag it is incomplete or inaccurate or whatever, that would be fine, but why delete something just because it's "under construction", so to speak? As I said, I wasn't the one to add the text, I barely even figured out how to reply here. I just didn't think it was fair to say that we didn't have any importance whatsoever, and all of the other comments here. It may be the editor's responsibility to add the sources, but it's irresponsible to make claims about the community without first doing research. My point: you don't automatically delete every article that is slightly inaccurate as soon as it is posted, do you? This article has been edited in the past month or so, and the last time I saw it, it had plenty of sources. They must have been removed somewhere along the line. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.104.242.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.242.76_b2e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.242.76">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>That was the separate "Metal Gear timeline compared to reality", which coexisted along with this article.

<li><b>Keep</b>... although there really is no point voting anymore since I'm clearly outnumbered. But at least let me clear up a misconception about this article: most of the information in this timeline is not <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">in-universe</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Most of the information are in fact taken from game manuals and supplemental documents that were supplied with the games. In particular, the manual for <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> contains a detailed timeline from 1939 to 1964, while the manual for <i>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</i> contains a detailed timeline from 1986 to 1999. Other information was taken from the <i>Previous Story</i> sections of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> and <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i>, the <i>Briefing</i> section of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, and from the script in the <i>Document of Metal Gear Solid 2</i>. It's not necessary for this article to be deleted but it just requires a clean-up. All it needs is for us to remove most of the information that are "in-universe" and only keep the information that is found in manuals and supplemental documents. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 08:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wiki-articles should "<i>not include instructions or advice</i>" from an instruction manual, but it can include "<i>descriptions of people, places, and things</i>" from an instruction manual.

<dd>It's original research because it arranges bits and pieces of plot summary in an idiosyncratic way. It's plot summary because all of these are story or backstory points. It's in-universe because it describes the fictional universe as though it were a real universe, with no reference to the one in which you and I live. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not original research if the information is copied directly from manuals and documents giving specific years and timelines. It's not plot summary if it doesn't summarize the plot from the games themselves. As for the in-universe aspect, that could be eliminated with a clean-up, by describing each event from an out-of-universe perspective. For example, instead of simply saying "Person A was born in place B in the year C", we could instead say "The manual of game X reveals that the fictional character A was born in place B in the year C". <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 10:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's idiosyncratic arrangement of those plot details: the process of deciding which details from the primary sources to include and exclude is original research. It's plot summary by definition if you're recapping a story. The in-universe issue can be resolved with cleanup; the original research and plot summary problems cannot be. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:44, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suppose that's true, but it's a problematic way to define "original research" because by your definition, every Wikipedia article about a film or novel that includes a plot summary — which is virtually <i>every</i> Wikipedia article about a film or novel — should be stricken due to the "original research" objection. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribcage_bfde.html" title="User:Cribcage">Cribcage</a> 17:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Such a plot summary is going to substantially rely on the structure of the work itself, whereas this reassembles the story points into a new fashion. Ideally we should be using secondary sources even when writing plot summaries, though. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> manual gives the timeline from 1939 to 1964 exactly in the same order as shown in this article. The <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> ending gives the timeline from 1964 to 1971 exactly in the same order as this article. The <i>Metal Gear 2</i> manual gives the timeline from 1986 to 1999 also in exactly the same order in this article. If this article was just a combination of these timelines, then that cannnot be considered "original research" because of the fact that it's a direct copy of several other pre-existing timelines from official sources. Again, I don't see the point in a deletion if a clean-up is all it requires. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 13:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was quick. Well that was just a hypothetical <i>if</i>, not an absolute solution. I was not suggesting we copy anything <i>exactly</i> word-for-word, but was pointing out that there is no original research involved in taking information from official timelines. Well anyway, I've just been looking around for whether there are any policies on fictional timelines, and I doubt there is actually any policy against them, considering the fact that there are already a dozen other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_timelines.html#Fictional" title="List of timelines">fictional timelines</a> on Wikipedia which haven't been subjected to much controversy nor have they ever been nominated for deletion. Why should the Metal Gear timeline be treated any differently to the others? Like I said, this can be solved with a clean-up (and looking at other examples). <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 13:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As with all articles, we'll later deal with those on the merits. In the case of this article, no amount of cleanup can make it not a substantive reproduction of source material or pure plot summary. We don't need a rule that specifically outlaws timelines in order to realize that this particular timeline is extremely problematic, in ways that cannot be fixed with cleanup. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:30, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find arguing that an article should be kept because similar articles haven't been nominated for deletion is a really poor arguement anyway. Maybe those other articles haven't been deleted simply because no-one has got round to nominating them? I know I'm certainly going to be giving them a close inspection afterwards.

<dd>Maybe it is just me but I still fail to see what's so <i>extremely problematic</i> about it (or any timeline for that matter) that cannot be fixed with a cleanup. If you do still wish delete this fictional timeline, then we might aswell delete all of them... but like Kinslayer ponted out, it looks like the Castlevania timeline has also been nominated, although the vast majority over there actually wish to keep it, which further complicates the issue of whether timelines are acceptable. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 13:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's only been up a couple of days, and people haven't noticed it's up yet. Guaranteed now it's been mentioned here, more votes will appear.

<p>Notability/importance in question. Subject's only assertion of notability is working for a comic book company. Appears to be a borderline A7 article, but the author strongly refutes this. <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 04:49, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but I have tried to, respectfully make clear, that Dennis Calero, aside of course from being one of my favorite artists, has worked on hundreds of comics, many of which are featured in wikipedia as significant, as well as having had his most recent title nominated for a Harvey award, which is arguably the second highest award in comics, second only to the eisner.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that he is working on several projects that would be commonly considered "notable."<br />
<br />
Thank you all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ughmonster (<a href="../../../u/g/h/User_talk%7EUghmonster_ea23.html" title="User talk:Ughmonster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ughmonster_792f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ughmonster">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>The projects themselves my be notable, but that doesn't mean everyone who works on them is. What has this person done that is truly notable?

<li>I think this is a bit premature. A good start is that he's the penciller of a recently Harvey-Award-nominated series (and penciller is the principle artistic role for a comic), and there should be mre info to find. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:02, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand your concerns about this being premature. The fact is, the article has been deleted twice, and has been proposed for deletion a third time by more than one person.

</li>
<li>I'm not sure I understand the idea that the project may be notable and yet the person who actually draws it is not? Other than the writer, the penciller (or artist as he both pencilled and inked his own work) is the most significant person on the project. By the way, my apologies for my misunderstanding of Wiki ediquette. In the meantime, here's a link to the 2006 Harvey Award nominees: Thank you man in black.

<li>The notice stays up for a week, so that people can bring up any new information. (It doesn't seem likely that new information will make it more likely to be deleted, but it could turn out that Calero is someone's pen name or a hoax or something. Not likely, but possible.)

<li>Benjar, simply because the previous iterations of this article may have been prematurely deleted and the original authors didn't care to contest it, doesn't in and of itself, speak to THIS articles deletion. Dennis Calero has done more work and mroe significant work, award nomiated work, than many of the other comic artists listed currently in wiki. In fact, the fact that three seperate people (or at the very least two) have tried to put up articles concerning this artist should SPEAK to notability, not against it.

<dd>Your comments are unnecc. acerbic and frankly, presumptuous. No I did nto read the entire manual of style, but I have made an honest effort to read to every page and set of guidelines that I've been referred to, none of which suggested that commenting in a discussion page is ill-mannered. There is no "hype" in my listing, except perhaps for a link to the artist's website, which I did not add.
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how asking me to stop "interjecting" is going to add to the discussion. It's my first page, and if this is supposed to be a discussion, why wouldn't I be encoruaged to try and answer criticism and ask questions?</dd>
<dd>At the same time, I don't want to seem like I'm trying to hinder the process, but I frankly don;t understand, with every Wiki policy emphasizing being kind to first time users, why some obviously more experienced users insist on slamming me for not being as familiar with Wiki policies as they, and to the point of accusations of dsengeniousness, especially considering that in terms of "overt bias" and "advertising", just about every other current comic artist's listing on this site includes contact information and service descriptions. --Ughmonster 02:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one's "slamming" anyone by asking that those who contribute to Wikipedia read up on some of the basic rules and editorial policies.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The author of the article has given a pretty good defense of notability, if it all turns out to be true. Unfortunately, the article as it currently stands does not reflect all the information Ughmonster has cited. The article needs major improvement, it needs to be written out with proper sources to verify everything said by Ughmonster. Starblind notes that the guy is up for a pretty serious award within the industry and working on several major, notable projects is good enough for me as far as notability is concerned. If the article is fixed by the end of the AfD cycle, it should be kept... if it only has a small amount of info, as it does now, then <b>delete</b> it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right that not all articles need to be really long, but they need to have at least some content; this one has a grand total of four sentences and they leave out vital information that ALL biographical articles need: birth date, hometown, education, etc. Four sentences isn't anything, it needs to be written out in a few paragraphs and in the proper form for living biographies. I agree that the guy seems notable enough, though so far there aren't really any sources cited in the article to back up these claims. I think the article should stay but it needs to be expanded, properly sources and properly formatted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To the people concerned about 'ballot-stuffing,' keep in mind that the AfD is NOT a vote and is NOT determined by which side has the most in support. Rather, whether or not to delete an article is determined by the arguments offered by each side. When someone says 'keep' or 'delete' without any argument, the administrator is supposed to totally ignore them. Theoretically, an AfD nomination could have 10 people voting for keeping something and only one or two voting for deletion and the article could still be deleted if those voting for deletion have the better argument. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 04:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Stick to the topic: whether this article should or should not be kept. The admins are smart, if someone is playing games they'll notice; they're only going to look at the arguments so this doesn't matter.

I must say I don't feel very strongly about this, but if this is deleted then probably all the other StarCraft related articles should be deleted. I play the game and I don't know what <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talematros.html" title="Talematros">Talematros</a> is (well, I just read the article, so now I do).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minerals_%28StarCraft%29_d8cb.html" title="Minerals (StarCraft)">Minerals</a> is 90% game guide, 9% speculation, 1% verifiable and enyclopedic knowledge. <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talematros.html" title="Talematros">Talematros</a> is 100% regurgitation of storyline.

<li><b>Comment:</b> AFD is handled by arguging why the article in question does, or does not, violate wikipedia policy.

In this case, just because <a href="../../../u/m/o/Umojan_Protectorate_91c4.html" title="Umojan Protectorate">Umojan Protectorate</a> has not been put up for deletion doesn't say much about why this article doesn't violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.—<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 22:59, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Deletion? Don't be silly! AmigaONE was a brand of computer on the market since two years ago. You can't cancel this evidence and if you consider Wikipedia a serious Encyclopedia, so feel free to start deleting all invoices of: <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Lisa_f49d.html" title="Apple Lisa">Apple Lisa</a>, Acorn BBC, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinclair_QL_ca12.html" title="Sinclair QL">Sinclair QL</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_65.html" title="Commodore 65">Commodore 65</a>, and so on. The fact that these computers had a little market, and could had had just little/medium/great impact in the history of computing does not prevent they have not existed for real and should to be mentioned into an Encyclopedia. Even if they had poor userbase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep Amiga invoices safe to let Wikipedia be a honest serious and well balanced Encyclopedia letting all voices to speak with democracy, and keeping a decent point of view, preserving the history. Even big/little phenomena as AmigaONE.</p>
<p>3000 AmigaONE happy users, who use their machines with profict and consider their machines as the evolution of Classic Amigas ask this to you all.</p>
<p>Check also the thousands of occurrences of AmigaONE in google:</p>
<p><a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=AmigaONE&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" class="external autonumber" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=AmigaONE&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></p>
<p>And see how much AmigaONE is notable (or not) into computers.</p>
<p>Don't be so moronish to delete AmigaONE article. Just don't make Wikipedia from other nations laugh at you of English version. Other language versions respect well Amiga articles. Here in Italy for example there is a good respect of Amiga invoices into Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The terminology 3rd site by its virtue came from a hadith by Prophet Muhammad. It is really wrong to cite from here and there to prove otherwise.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is not necessarily about what traditional Sunni Muslims consider the third holiest site. That is made quite clear on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> page and the top of this page. The article provides information as to what the world at large, including many Muslims regard as the third holiest site in Islam. Advocates for deletion of this page accuse the creators of being politically motivated. However, is not their own proposition for deletion of the page itself politically motivated, to try and deny others of this interesting information?

<li><b>Comment</b> But surely you realize that the article makes no attempt at distinguishing between so-called "claims," beliefs or opinions gathered from various sources, that could be mistaken, from any actual differences in theology between various sects of Islam? The article regards any and all sources with any reference to a third Islamic holy site as equal, rendering undue weight <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight</a> to spurious material and suggesting that all these assorted assertions should be taken equally seriously. This is specious logic. Any actual differences between various sects of Islam, or any religion, would be appropriately discussed within the pages devoted to documenting these distinct religions, including the pages devoted to particular sites that for reasons I can't pretend to know are holy to them, rather than mixing all such sites up with spurious references in an apparent attempt to denature the significance of all forms of Islam and the meaning any such site has within particular forms of Islam. This page seems to me entirely intended to stir up unnecessary conflict and while this is not strictly prohibited on WP I don't find it at all usefull for most users except those users who would get a laugh out of doing this.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 11:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>That</b> claims, beliefs or opinions could be mistaken is a very strange thing to assume. Let’s take the example of the tour guides. They are not just bits of information thought up by the writer. Someone has actually gone to the place, done research, interacted with the locals to get a review of the place. These are then placed in the guide. Their beliefs are mistaken according to you because in your opinion they are wrong! But I agree we could tidy it up and emphasise more clearly where the theological disputes lie. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Undue weight</a> doesn’t apply here, because the original article was included under <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Al Aqsa Mosque</a>, but was considered to be “undue weight” and therefore a new article was created to conform with the following statement in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight</a>: <i>views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented <b>except in articles devoted to those views</b></i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Someone has actually gone to the place, done research, interacted with the locals to get a review of the place. These are then placed in the guide." Are you forgetting that travel agencies exist to do business? Do you think that they'll show any miserable poverty, organized crime and such in a tourist brochure?. And there is 1 dead link, and another outdated faculty handbook that the author himself said contained an error, yet you insist that the old version be linked to and you uploaded it to a freewebs account bearing my username. Also this topic is very well discussed in the List of holy cities article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Cities#Islam" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. There is no need to make separate articles for such things like "The fourth tallest building in every country in Asia" etc. Then why not create several articles like "Sixth holiest city in Christianity", "Fourth Holiest site in Buddhism" etc. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 14:59, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thestick, you state that the old edition contained an "error", an error left undetected for 2 years 4 months? Was it you who has been in touch with the author for the sole reason of discrediting the source and arranged for a new version to be downloaded on the same link dated 2003 (not 2005)?! The new edition may not mention anything about the mosque, but neither is there a “places to visit” section. In the new version the whole section was left out completely; so who’s to say that just the mosque bit was an “error”?!</li>
</ul>

<dd>Btw travel guides regularly warn tourists of “no-go” areas and to be cautious of pickpockets, etc. They also give a brief synopsis of the area, including details of whether there is poverty, etc. Take the following from <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Gaza/" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Gaza/" rel="nofollow">wikitravel</a> as an example: <i>Gaza isn't quite the pure hellhole you might expect given TV coverage, although needless to say the birthplace of the Intifada and one of the most overpopulated bits on the entire planet <b>isn't exactly paradise on earth</b> either. A UN report in 1952 stated that the Strip is too small to support its population of 300,000; there are now well over one million inhabitants and the January 2002 latest figures from the Palestinian Authority put <b>unemployment at a whopping 79%</b>.

<dd>“There is no need to make separate articles for such things like "The fourth tallest building in every country in Asia”</dd>
<dd>That’s because they are concrete (excuse the pun) facts and are not the subject of ambiguity.

However the third holiest site is a common term, and itself a matter of debate with numerous other sites vying for the position!

<li>I'm not going to bother arguing since any source that states anything else other than the Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam is perfectly acceptable to the creator of the article. Wikitravel is different from some travel agency that needs to make money. And yes, that error went undetected for more than 2 years, until you brought it to their attention. Also, there is <b>no other source on the internet</b> that says the Jawatha mosque is the third holiest site in Islam.

<li>There is no question that this article is not written to explain an Islamic concept but rather to spread confusion about it and false information. You cannot just bring any claim and say that some muslims believe that this is a 3rd Holy site etc. I wonder why not finding out also what some muslims consider the fourth site in Islam? What might be also the Second? What is the first? This article is becoming a polling station and not explaining a well-established undisputed Islamic terminology appearing in authentic Islamic texts? When saying "in Islam", is different than saying "by some Muslims".

<li>Thestick, it is interesting that whenever the al aqsa mosque is mentioned the need to assert it as the “third holiest site”, goes hand in hand. THIS is the recent creation. A recent creation aimed at aiding the political intentions of the Muslim world. If, as you demonstrated, it IS the 3rd holiest, why stop there, whenever a Muslim holy site is mentioned, say what number down the list it comes? Is Baghdad known as the fourth holiest, Samarkand as the tenth holiest? Etc. I will settle for deleting the page if on the Al Aqsa mosque page or any other on wikipedia, no reference is made that it known as the “third holiest site”.</li>
<li>Almaqdisi, no one doubts the importance in Islam of Jerusalem. However whenever the term “third holiest” is applied to the temple mount complex, the absolute holiness of the place to another, older religion is disputed, dented, and sidelined. Why the need to emphasise the third, fourth, etc.? It is to bolster the claim. This is an unnecessary politically motivated term which should be discarded. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 17:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Al Aqsa mosque has been mentioned as the third holiest site in Islamic doctrine for over ~1400 years.

<li>Chesdovi, The word third comes from a hadith that says, that the virtue of praying at the site of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, or al-Masjid al-Haram or Masjid al-Madina is not like any other place. The hadith talks about the virtue and reward of praying at these sites. It does not talk about Holiness. The word Holy, 'Mukaddas' is not mentioned in the Hadith. Therefore, the Hadith continues, only to these 3 sites you may go on journey, and anywhere else on this earth, the prayer has the same virtue. There are no political agendas etc, this has been said 1400 years ago. These sites were chosen by the following <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a>: Ibrahim and his sons, Yakub and his sons, and Muhammad.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>According to Islamic teachings, the Quran allocates much of its text arguing that the Message of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a> as being one message, from the same God (Allah, or Elohim). Furthermore, regarding the Temple Mount, historical sources show that when Muslims entered Jerusalem during the time of Umar, they did not find Jews having any temple or worshiping at the site. Hence, the Covenant of Umar did not address that, and only mentioned protecting the Churchs of the Christians etc. No mentionig of protecting the Temple Mount as a site for Jews. Having said so, Muslims believe they fullfilled the Prophecy of other previous <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a> by re-constructing the Masjid, 2nd after Mecca' masjid, that was mentioned and illuded at various places in the Quran text. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 18:06, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The site is among the 3 holiest sites in Islam. First it is the Masjid Al-Haram, second is Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at last is Al-Aqsa Mosque. There are several virtues of the Al-Aqsa Mosque which ave been shown to you time and time again yet still fail to understand it. It's obvious from your previous comments that all you are trying to do is discredit this well established historical and theological fact by any means necessary because for some reason you feel by saying it is the third holiest site in Islam "the absolute holiness of the place to another, older religion is disputed, dented, and sidelined.".This article is a result of that, and it's content is just WikiLawyering <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 16:39, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as I have not been convinced that the title “third holiest site in Islam” refers solely to Jerusalem. Millions of Shia do not agree with this and although “mainstream” Muslims currently refer to the al aqsa as third holiest, there has been no unambiguous proof from the hadith or Koran or any other Islamic holy book that any site, let alone Jerusalem was to be considered 'Mukaddas' or holier than any other place. That others sites are also considered third holiest must not be subdued and should not be seen as a slight against Islamic sentiment…. Just as I would personally not take issue with a page devoted to whether <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel%27s_Tomb_1a1b.html" title="Rachel's Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberius.html" title="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safed.html" title="Safed">Safed</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebron.html" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> is considered the third holiest site in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 17:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Chesdovi, I repeat. There are many hadiths that discusses al-Masjid al-Aqsa. There is one of them mentioning that it is the second masjid designated to worhsip Allah on earth. The first was masjid al-Haram, the second is masjid al-Aqsa. These spots were chosen by God according to muslims long long before the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. In Quran, prophet Muhammad is the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal_of_the_Prophets_6a4d.html" title="Seal of the Prophets">Seal of the Prophets</a> of Islam. Prophet Muhammad called to the same Religion of Ibrahim and Ismail and Isaac and Jacob according to Quran. These are Quranic statements. Hence, 1400 years ago, these Hadiths mentioned the virtue of praying at al-Aqsa mosque. Only these sites which were built by Prophets have such a virtue. Anywhere else, does not. This is mentioend in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque#The_importance_of_Al-Aqsa_in_Islam|al-Aqsa" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque#The_importance_of_Al-Aqsa_in_Islam|al-Aqsa" rel="nofollow">Mosque</a>] article anyway. There is really no need to confuse things up. It is not true to keep arguing that the Shiites discredit Jerusalem position in Islam. Do you have a conclusive evidence. <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, which is Shiite, would strongly disgree with this. AhmadiNajad himself disagree with that. Finally, there is no point to keep looking around to find and Quote just any muslims who talks about what he thinks is holy and what is not. I can find many websites on the internet which mentions that no vistited that moon!! This is a distortion and are not considered authentic sources. Just giving names here and there will not be as credible as sources muslims continue to use for 1400 all attributed to the Prophet of Islam Muhammad. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 20:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b>: The reason being that that there is a misuse of terminology here. Muslim resources describe al-Masjid al-Aqsa as the third virtuous masjid in Islam. The origin of the word 'third' really comes from this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> quotes <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_al-Dardaa_8db6.html" title="Abu al-Dardaa">Abu al-Dardaa</a> as saying: "the Prophet of Allah <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> said a prayer in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjid_al-Haram_4143.html" title="Masjid al-Haram">Sacred Mosque</a> (in <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>) is worth 100,000 prayers; a prayer in <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Masjid_al-Nabawi_02ad.html" title="Al-Masjid al-Nabawi">my mosque</a> (in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>) is worth 1,000 prayers; and a prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is worth 500 prayers more than in an any other mosque.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Then Mecca should be known as the most holiest site in Islam and Jerusalem as “the least holiest site in Islam”? I mean 500 is quite a drop from 100,000. Should Al Aqsa be on the virtuous list at all? <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Praying anywhere else on the earth apart from these three mosques has the same virtue according to the Islamic teachings. It is also described as being the second masjid established on earth (by Jacob) after the one in Mecca (by Abraham). Finally, the same spot was the first Qibla. Hence, if the terminology Third Holiest is used by some, it is really meant to be Third masjid by its virtue. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 06:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>what about the following: It should also be noted that in regard to Fazilat (auspiciousness), as per few references, it is learnt that the Great Mosque of Kufa is <i>better than the mosque of Al-Aqsa</i>. Hazrat Imam <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abi_Bakr_f4e6.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr">Muhammad Bakar</a> had told that if anybody who performs his essential prayer in this mosque, shall be given a benefit of one Haj and if any person performs non-essential prayer in this mosque shall be given the benefit of one Umra. And Dargah Sharief in Ajmer, the most famous Muslim pilgrimage center in India. It is considered the second holiest pilgrim site after Mecca - it is believed that <i>seven pilgrimages to Ajmer equal one to Mecca</i>.<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Ah, these are just POV issues and that is no good reason to delete articles I hear <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> say. No it isn't a mere POV issue at all! A pure POV dispute relating to an article does not merit AFD, except perhaps in extreme cases. You can imagine someone starting an article on some topic, and some other editors come along and they have a genuine debate on that topic. Here we are dealing with articles that are created for POV reasons relating to some other topic. This is similar to the POV Forking problem with the difference that the POV issue does not have to stem from another wiki article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> could just have well started an article on poodles with the first sentence saying that it is a type of dog but then diverting to Blair and framing the whole article around the relation Bush-Blair. AFD would then be warranted because the issue then has nothing to do with a POV debate on poodles. It's also no good saying that the article should be kept because an article on poodles has potential. A genuine article on poodles would be so different from the original that it would be best created by a good faith editor who wants to write about poodles. Also, by keeping the article <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> would have shifted the burden on writing a NPOV article on poodles to others. The only good reason to vote to keep would be if you are willing to put in the effort to transform the article to a genuine article about the subject yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This issue reminds me of the recent AFD debate on <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">Heim theory</a>. There the source of the problem was different than in this case but there are some parallels. There you have POV pushers who want to promote a particular pseudoscientific topic. It then became too much of a burden for the editors of wiki project physics (who are mostly professional physicists) to keep the article in a "NO OR" and "No POV" form. They wanted to delete the article. I voted for keep because like some who voted for keep here, I am of the opinion that the pseudoscientific topic was notable. But then I was told by the others of the physics project that I should then become personally involved in editing that article. It is no good to just say "keep" because it can be made NPOV and then run away from the task of actually putting in the effort to improve the article. After the AFD vote I rewrote the article in an aceptable form.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in conclusion, my opinion is that the article should be deleted unless good faith editors with no agenda stand up right now who are willing to invest the time and effort to rewrite the article. The option of keeping and "let's see later how we improve it", is not adequate because <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> can create new articles written in bad faith faster than good faith editors can be found to step in every time he does so. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 13:34, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This article was in fact not "created for POV reasons relating to some other topic" but was originally part of the al aqsa mosque page but was considered to be “undue weight” and therefore a new article was created to conform with the following statement in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_weight</a>: <i>views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented <b>except in articles devoted to those views</b></i>.

<dd>Nonsense. I'm for neutrality which perhaps to some pro-Israeli editors is seen as "against anything considered by him/her to be remotely conceived as anti-Arab.". You obviously did not see my edit on the Hamas page changing "attacks" to "military action and terrorism". I don't shy away from being neutral at all. I stand by my opinion that the article was created in bad faith.

The fact that some of them may not be neutral in Israeli-Palestinian conflict exactly undermines your argument, because the concept of policide should have nothing to do with this conflict. To use the "poodle" analogy, it's like accusing someone for recruiting people with a pro-Blair bias to take a look at the poodle article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: (I'm not responding to anyone specifically, just making a general suggestion). I think it would be helpful if people tried their best to confine their discussion to the merits of deletion/non-deletion, and to identifying the specific policies and guidelines that apply, rather than analyzing the motivations of the article creators, and AFD commentators. The admin who closes this will do so based on the reasoning presented about <i>the article</i>, so all the comments about people's motivations, while I'm sure well intentioned, are distracting from the central issue of whether we should delete this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You might not realise it but the question of the place of Al Aqsa was highly disputed in Islamic circles at the time. As the sources show, it's still disputed by some today. Other muslims believe that other sites are more important. Even the pov proposer like Almaqdisi admits that there's a big difference between what sunni and shia think on the subject, and this is all relevant info to depict. It was already in the Al Aqsa Article but people thought it was given undue weight so it was moved in compromise. Obviously, this is all pertinent information. <b>These other sites exist and are very imporant for Muslims and many regard them as the most important behind the undisputed Mecca</b> (and Medina). <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 14:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "dispute" you speak of is because '<i>some</i> Muslims did not feel comfortable with the notion that the Masjid Al-Aqsa is the very same "Temple of Bani Isra'il" (Bnei Yisrael) because that's (according to how I've always interpreted it) how it's described in the Qur'an. The verse that describes the 'Masjid al Aqsa' in the Qur'an is immediately followed by sentences mentioning 'Bani Isra'il' a number of times. In Islam, G-d has commanded the 'faithful' to fill in and take over from the followers of Moses and "the son of Mary" because they betrayed their covenant with Him. So He sends his final message to the world through the Qur'an. Jerusalem was the first Qibla in Islam, partly because of the Jewish influence on Mohammad in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>. Things changed after he had a falling out with them. But there is no question in my mind that any dispute over the 'Masjid al-Aqsa' is marginal and irrelevant. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been following the discussion on this board for quite sometime, and I could not let this go on without intervention. This article deals with a Islamic site. This, then has to be decided based on Islamic references, i.e the Holy Quran, Prophet Mohammad's Hadith, and trusted time-proven text that rely solely on those two. Citing any text or references other than those is, by all means, an attempt to cause confusion and dispute over facts that are known for all muslims. The site of al masjid Alaqsa is 3rd in virtue, that is they believe that praying in these sites multiplies their hasanat (the good deed for the judgement day). Muslims do NOT pray for these sites.

<p><b>Comments for DELETE</b>, Amoruso, you are very wrong if you think that Shiites dispute the importance of Jerusalem and its rank after Mecca and Medina. The narrations regarding Prophet Muhammad <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a> are the most studied of any other human being ever existed. The narrations are divded to more than 70 degree, and Muslims have rigorously studied these and settled whatever controversies or mis communication regarding some of the Narrations by weakening some and strengthening some. Hence, I noticed that Amuroso and Chesdovi are putting themselves at a level of what is called in Islam <a href="../../../f/a/q/Faqih.html" title="Faqih">Faqih</a>. The title of this article is about 3rd Holy cite in Islam. Okay, then it is Islamic sources that are verified here then. This article is instead talking about 3rd travel destination preference by some muslims. This does not qualify these preferences to compete with the title of 3rd Holy Sites in Islam. IT is VERY VERY wrong again to say that the Shiites dispute that. You better go and listen to nearby <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> speeches, and your beloved <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> for some info about this. In anycase, Amoruso believes that muslims disputed the location of al-<a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjid_al-Aqsa_7f02.html" title="Masjid al-Aqsa">Masjid al-Aqsa</a>... Wrong again! The Prophet Muhammad's journey is well documented in his narrations and the notion that al-Masjid al-Aqsa being in Jerusalem or Bayt al-Maqdis, was well established and well understood and explicitly mentioned in the words of the Prophet and the majority of Muslims read these narrations at his time and understood it. You keep arguing and mentioing that Jerusalem was never mentioned in Quran etc... Well, the Quran is not a travel brouchure and was not to my understanding written by Human beings! The word Mecca itself only appeared once in the Quran and illuded at others. The word Moses and Jesus appeared at least 128, 22 repectively. The word Muhammad appeared only 4 times... Please let me know Chesdovi and Amuroso some Islamic interpretation, <a href="../../../f/i/q/Fiqh.html" title="Fiqh">Fiqh</a>, about this? It is clear from Amoruso's input at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dome_of_the_Rock#Not_built_by_Jews.2C_not_intended_for_Jews.2C_and_never_used_by_Jews" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dome_of_the_Rock#Not_built_by_Jews.2C_not_intended_for_Jews.2C_and_never_used_by_Jews" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> Dome of the Rock discussion that this is all politically driven dispute of Islamic authentic reports regarding the al-Aqsa mosque in general. Amoruso for some reason favors reports discredited by muslim scholars. Furthermore, Amoruso also disputes the definition of al-Aqsa mosque <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque#Dispute" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Al-Aqsa_Mosque#Dispute" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> or the term al-Masjid al-Aqsa which denotes that whole area surrounding the Rock and not only the congregational mosque per the correct Islamic terminology. Hence the issue is really larger than this article. Please note that Amoruso created this article and at the same time continues to remove the correct Islamic view and definitions regarding al-Aqsa congregational mosque and the Dome of the Rock mosque to prove his own wrong non Islamic theories part of which only appears in this article. This way, Wikipedia is getting turned to an unreliable source regarding Islamic sites and concepts. A great favor and preference should be given first to the better understood and well explained Islamic resources and cannot just be left open to travel brouchures and travel preferences by some muslims googled on the Web. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 19:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - it's a fundamentally unsound topic to be discussing in any kind of "multi-cultural" Forum.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Dear Amoruso, I think whats dubious is your intentions of writing this article in the first place. You cannot continue to shift your argument from the core of the issue like what you showed in your response to Ramellite. Your neutrality towards the issue is questionable. The 2nd Resulotion of 2nd Islamic summet of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) (see [<a href="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/2/2nd-is-sum.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/2/2nd-is-sum.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>]) has clearly stated that the city of Jerusalem represent the Third Holiest City in Islam. There is no logical reason for debate beyond this point, other than the intent to confuse the average Wikipedia user with dubious conflecting information.<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboosh_85a8.html" title="User:Aboosh">Aboosh</a> 00:53, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> Well, my comment in that instance had to do with whether just a link or a whole section on the contested topic in the Al Asqa article was still appropriate, after you forked the content into this article. My "support" towards any solution in any case is always contingent upon critical examination and open discussion, which we are attempting to have here. The rest of my statement in that post, including my final comment, <i>I don't think a whole section on "third holiest sites" is at all necessary</i> obviously extends to the content in this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You are correct that this is "an attempt to use AfD to resolve a content dispute." I wholeheartedly wish this dispute could be resolved here. However, this is not fundamentally about <i>me</i> or my politics, or even about the politics of the other posters here. What this matter is about is whether this content is at all appropriate within the goals and policies of this encyclopedia. I've said before that any actual theological question here should be discussed strictly within theological scholarship, I would think this would be a standard policy for <i>any</i> encyclopedia article on <i>any</i> religious topic, and it frankly shocks me that I seem to be the only non-Islamic editor here that has at all voiced that opinion. Moreover, I am also shocked and suprised that editors with no possible interest in what is a completely specious article have lined up with <b>"strong keeps,"</b> as if the subject actually meant something to them. The plethora of negative responses to this AfD from editors knowledgable about Islam clearly shows that this article is flamebait and cannot be redeemed through ordinary editing practices. I reiterate my strong opinion that the best option for Wikipedia and its readership would be to <b>delete</b> this article completely.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 06:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I find your comment as somewhat not understanding and grasping what wikipedia is about IMO and from my very modest experience. Wikipedia is about sharing sources by users on a variety of subjects. There are both muslim and muslim experts <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that are relevant to the article and there are also other sources which can be used, and it's all good. There's no need to back down simply because it doesn't fit a certain narrow islamic thought as falsely one sided represented by a few users. wikipedia is open to everyone and for anyone to have research using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It's exactly informative articles like this that make wikipedia such a convenient encyclopedia and censoring information rather than discussing, changing, improving it and so on stands in contrast to everything. Therefore, the result should have been <b>speedy keep</b>... <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 07:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there is what <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is and there is what an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is. That Wikipedia does not rely on "well-educated, well-informed content experts" does not mean that <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> is so loose as to accommodate any and all references from people that might not be so well-informed, especially as presented on a topic guaranteed to piss off a huge portion of its likely readership, as this discussion has clearly shown. I still think that realistically, articles on sites sacred to distinct religions should be respectively separated, and that mixing together content on various sacred sites along with non-scholastic references in a single article can only offend religious believers, again as this discussion has clearly shown. Wikipedia is not about anyone's right to piss anyone off on the basis of race, creed or color, and if this site is to become an authoritative resource it must rely on scholastic references, especially on controversial topics, and present information with appropriate respect for the subject matter. I don't see how keeping this article can at all be justified after comments from Wikipedian Islamic experts.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 09:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

Of course this is a not a RS and I have no way of proving the writer is actually a shia muslim, nevertheless, assuming it is an honest statement, it does go someway in disproving what Almaqdisi is trying to lead us to believe. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Almaqdisi I am not going to pretend I am a scholar of the stature of <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusuf_al-Qaradawi_80a1.html" title="Yusuf al-Qaradawi">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> but all I can say is that since Jerusalem is not mentioned (Is bayt-ol-maqqudas mentioned?) it gives us no conclusive evidence that Jerusalem was intended. See <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html#Location_of_the_.E2.80.9Cfarthest_mosque.E2.80.9D" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Location of the “farthest mosque”</a> for elaboration. If Jerusalem would have been mentioned only once, like Mecca, there would be no basis at all for most of the arguments on this page and others. Just that one mention would have dispelled any notion that Jerusalem was not the intended place. Unfortunately it was not, hence the ongoing debate. You are correct in saying that it is not necessarily the mere mention of a place that gives it it's importance: there are tens of name places in the Bible, most of them insignificant to Judaism. However, the fact the masjid al aqsa was not identified in the scripture as being in Jerusalem is just a strong argument whether Jerusalem was the place intended or not. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 12:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But unlike yours, his "POV" is backed by over a billion Muslims, is verifiable by authentic, historical texts, established since the very beginning of islam, readily acknowledged today, mentioned in several Islamic texts that unfortunately arent there on the internet but readily available in any bookstore selling books by Islamic scholars, and a whole lot more. Unlike your theory mostly surviving on your painstaking search for any page on the internet and which IMHO is as credible are those rumours and chain emails circulating on the internet like "Secret corporations headed by the Jews were behind 9/11", with all the alleged "evidence" they provide. - <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMlaheji_4c26.html" title="User:Mlaheji">Mlaheji</a> 17:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't get me wrong -- it shouldn't be hard to demonstrate that the vast majority of authorities consider Al-Aqsa to be the third holiest site, but that some groups of Muslims, such as the Cypriots, consider other sites to be the "third holiest." In fact, assuming that that's true (and I due), <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires that "due weight" be given to each opinion. However, "undue weight" isn't a good ground for deletion, IMHO, just for a {{sofixit}}.

Although <b>this didn't have its own page either</b> - it was in the Al Aqsa Mosque article and <b>moved to its own page after the same people who now wants it deleted</b> wanted it to move.

<li><b>Keep</b> The belief that the furthest mosque is in Jerusalem is not universally held by Muslims, even if it is only with around 10 percent of Muslims. If the Imam Ali Mosque is holier than the Al-Aqsa Mosque to 10% of Muslims then this is significant and an informative article. You will never make everyone happy. This is the reason why there are no modern artist renderings on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> page because it disagrees with the beliefs of many Muslims (but not all). So let it be disputed, but let the article stay as it is quite informative. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 19:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the issue is clear by now. Wikipedia does not supress any information. The supporters of deletion brought examples after examples that were refuted - they said "oh wikipedia doesn't have anything dedicated to the theory that Jews were involved in 9/11" and then they were showed a page that it did have. They said "oh wikipedia doesn't have a page dedicated to the moon hoax" and then were showed a page that it did have an entire article about it, and so on. The problem here I'm afraid is broader than wikipedia... wikipedia shouldn't play a part in censoring information. I think most users acknowledged that article should be edited more and more, articulated nicely to a great article, and not to delete valid information because of POV's. I think again this is non issue according to wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 20:07, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comments</b>: If you do not want to believe this Hadith of the Prophet, it is a problem because Islamic terminolgies we are discussing here started there and not in the Torah or the Bible. There is two more Hadiths regarding the night Journey where the term Bayt al-Maqdis is used too. I do not see why you do not want to listen to these narrations and instead favor other sources to discuss a purley Islamic term. It seems to me that you are now discussin if the Furthest Mosque was in Jerusalem at all apart from it being the third virtous mosque in Islam. Finally, Jerusalem and it surrounding is what was described in Quran as "al-Ard Al-Mubarakeh" meaning the blessed land, or the land God has bless to all nations. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 20:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (to Amoruso): The difference between those articles and this one is that those articles deal with actual orchestrated hoaxes and conspiracy theories as they occur in the real world. This article attempts to inject the same spurious reasoning into what should be a purely theological question and nothing more, the matter of which again would be more diplomatically addressed in different articles associated with particular sites sacred to respective religions. I agree that this is a manufactured dispute on a non-issue.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 21:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A lot of people are saying here that this is a Muslim topic so the Muslims have to have the first and last word on the subject. Well, there's a problem with that. This is Wikipedia, and Wikipedia has articles about Islam, but Wikipedia is not a Muslim project. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multicultural.html" title="Multicultural">multicultural</a> project. Sources from OUTSIDE of the codified Mulslim clerical world can and SHOULD speak on Muslim topics on Wikipedia so that many POVs can be neutrally stated and the reader can get a more full picture. If there were a Mulslim Wikipedia, then the people here who want Islam to have the first and last word concerning what should and shouldn't appear here would be appropriate. In the case of the english Wikipedia, however, that's just not the way things should work. On Wikipedia, omiting sourced material stated in a NPOV way just because it doesn't jive with one's accepted version of Islamic thought represents <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> and smacks of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_burning.html" title="Book burning">book burning</a>. I know this is not a particularly comfortable thing to many, especially those coming from places where individual expression is not especially encouraged, and I don't mean to insult anyone here. I just think that we need to loosen up and allow somethings to stand even if we don't agree with them because others do and also have a right to speak. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 22:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Speaking for myself, to me the matter is about what consitutes reliable sources on what is purportedly a theological issue that would be most appropriately discussed within authoritative scholastic literature. We all should know that it would be impossible and entirely against Wikipedia policy to screen editors on self-disclosed cultural or political affiliations to any or all articles. However, it does seem to me that the practical matter of "what constitutes reliable sources" is being obscured by the political matters you've just described, which however this article seems entirely designed to evoke.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 23:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Comments to Elizmr</i>: WikiPedia is not an Islamic Project I agree. But it is an Encyclopedia that should be informative. The title of this article has problems because of two things. First, it has the word "Third" and the word "Islam" in it. This article would be reasonable if it discusses holy site regarded by muslims in general. In that case, there is a space for this article. However, the people behind this article insist on using the word "Third" which comes from a narration from the Prophet Muhammad. If the word third stays there, then the authors of the article are obligated to stick to the Islamic resources discussing the word third. The problem is right here. This article if you notice is not written to discuss the first or the second site in Islam. It is only written to argue about the Third site! The numbers First, Second and Third are ranks of how virteous is a mosque. This is the only reason these are ranked in Islam and have a designated number. The article would be fine if the authors do not focus on the rankings because they are then entitled to come up with a narration or a resource which explicitly mentions that this sect of muslims reject the narration of the Prophet Muhammad regarding the Bayt al-Maqdis and explicitly demonstrate the argument of that particular sect on what is the first, second, and third site for them. The resources should include what sect is this, and whether there is a consensus in that sect regarding this site, and so for. This article is therefore failing to do so. Some users here say there are articles about the Hoax of Jews and 9/11. That is okay, but still the title say it is a Hoax. Unfortunately, this article we have here give no useful information because it gives all resources equal weight, and is written by people whom main objective is to Challenge and dispute a well established fact in Islam. They are therefore entitled to give their evidence about that from the Islamic resources itself. They need not of course to be muslims, but their evidence should come from Islamic resources and not from anything else. The reason again being in the fact that it has the in the title the word "Islam", and that it uses the word "Third" coming from an authentic narration. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> 00:20, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Almaqdisi: So, it sounds like you are saying that the article could be fixed if 1) divergent Muslim views were discussed more explicitly with what they reject, etc 2) The idea of ranking of sites in Islam and what it means was discussed more explicitly 3) and the sources and how relevant they are felt to by Muslims from different sects were discussed more explicitly in the article and 4) the article touched on the first and second sites more than it does and 5) the title did not include the word "Third" and the word "Islam". <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 00:57, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I repeat, there's no compromise in it.

There's no compromise possible to delete this - most of the users object to deleting this, there's no consencus obviously, and therefore article stays. <b>You can propose possible name changes to this article in the talk page of the article</b>. The information could have already appeared in the differnet articles like it did on the Al Aqsa mosque , and it's not related to the issue of keep or delete of this article.

<p><b>Strongly support Amerique's Proposal</b> for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the article as it appears now is really creating a Hoax rather than Documenting a one.</li>

Only after these bits of information are verified and tested at the respective article, then one may have a single article collecting them. But so far, this article is really creating a Hoax rather than reporting it. <b>For example, if you may check <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Juwana_Mosque_d68e.html" title="Al Juwana Mosque">Al Juwana Mosque</a>, it was only created on October 25th by Chesdovi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Juwana_Mosque&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al_Juwana_Mosque&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[101]</a> after this info was used by Amoruso on September 7th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74295402" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74295402" rel="nofollow">[102]</a>.</b>&#160;?!?!

<dd>I've taken a look, and it seems well-intentioned and well-written, but it is beyond me to evaluate the content issue in this case. All I have been doing is applying my understanding of WP policy to the references used to support these assertions, as that is where this article seems weakest and how it seems most likely to spread misunderstanding and confusion both as to the subject and as to the goals of this encyclopedia.

I think a simple mention of that fact on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is more than enough, given that it is the <i>most widely</i> accepted to <i>most</i> muslims.

<li>Don't you think that it's rather presumptuous of non-Muslims to dictate to Muslims the exact degree of reverence they should give to each site?

<li>I'm prepared to accept that Muslims might not agree on ranking mosques after Mecca and Medina, and that could be discussed in the <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziarat.html" title="Ziarat">Ziarat</a> article.

<li>Striong disagree. You are obviously unfamilar with the work involved. tb is a hiostorical record. i suggest that you continue to act in a vanalistic manner and continue to remove posts that others whcih to make a contribuition.
<p>The information published is a very relvant bhistorical reciord on teh nomination of the Royal Exhibition Buildings and Melbourne heritage. I do not believe you read the content before you acted so recklessly. If you continue to act in such a manner I will lodge a complaint with the editor. now which version have you removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Melbcity (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelbcity_6097.html" title="User talk:Melbcity">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melbcity_8530.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melbcity">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nominator of this post is not a vandal. Melbcity, Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information. It has specific requirements as to what is suitable for inclusion, such as articles being encyclopedic in style, not copyrighted material, written from a neutral point of view, be fact and not opinion, and notability. The deletion of this article isn't a reflection on the content of it, just that it is completely unsuitable for Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 09:13, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are wrong this is a historical record of a public forum related to the nomination of the Royal exhibition Bulidings. I most certainly have seen many other posts that I would claim to have been subjective and not worthy of inclusion. I have chosen these particular opsost for good reason.
<p>Those that are commenting and seeking to remove this information are not aware of nature of teh issue involved. The State premier wanted to demoplish the Royal Exhibitiuon Buidlinsg and it is only as a result of this public camaign that the nomination for world heritage progressed. It is a historicazl record relected to the hsitory of this significant Melbourne land mark.</p>
<p>I chose to publish it as a seperate article in much the same way as other articles are published and linked. You either want to support a community based contributuion or you don't.

The article is a collection of primary source texts, namely a copyrighted newspaper article, some presentations, and some minutes of meetings, with a couple of extra, apparently personal commentary, paragraphs thrown in. From the comments above, where xe is talking about complaining to "the editor", and the comments on Talk:The Dome - Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building, where xe is talking about this being a missing chapter from a book by David Dunstan, it appears that Melbcity (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelbcity_6097.html" title="User talk:Melbcity">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melbcity_8530.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melbcity">contribs</a>) has mistaken Wikipedia for a self-publishing service or a magazine. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">It is not a free hosting service, nor a document repository, nor a publisher of first instance</a>. The place for publishing additional chapters for books is elsewhere. The place for re-publishing copyrighted newspaper articles is elsewhere, too. I see no evidence whatsoever that, as Melbcity claims, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a></i>, a publication that asserts copyright over its archives and that charges a fee for back issues of articles for as far back as 1990, has waived its copyright over its 1996 article written by Arnold Zable. Even if it had, Wikipedia wouldn't want it.

<dd>The surnames don't always indicate caste (for eg. Mira Nair is Punjabi). Except OBCs, SC/STs, castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources. The only sources are the personal sources or magazines/websites run by caste-based organizations. Also, please note that many people (esp. nationalists) that editors have categorized as "Famous Bhumihars" or "Nairs" do not believe in caste system and don't consider themselves as Bhumihars or Nairs. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you need to verify the lists that you've mentioned, you are welcome to put {{fact}} tags (or even move them to deletion, if you are very sure that those lists are unverifiable) -- the burden of evidence falls on the contributors. Please don't complain of systemic bias here. This AFD nomination was by an Indian editor (me), who has not got enough expertise on subjects like Scots and English people. By the way, there have been discussions on whether <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Kalam_46b1.html" title="Abdul Kalam">Abdul Kalam</a> is a Muslim or not (please see respective talk page). <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> No real criteria for inclusion; no sourcing. As an organized and structured list it is better than the precedents were, but not good enough in my eyes. The various sublists might each stand without the Rajput limitation (I.e. List of Param Vir Chakra winners might stand.)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom or <b>Rename</b> to List of Modern Day Rajputs. The word "famous" is inherently POV, as has been discussed many times before. There is <i>no way</i> this list should be allowed to remain with its current name. And there are far too many indiscriminate, unverifiable lists on WP already. The argument that we should have more bad lists because of existing bad lists is futile per GRBerry. We don't keep spam just because there are other spam articles that have yet to be deleted. I find the precedents cited by nom compelling, and think deletion is the best option. Conversion to category is possible too (maybe even preferable to renaming), but the word "famous", in any case, <i>absolutely</i> must go! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:09, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The surnames don't always indicate caste (for eg. Mira Nair is Punjabi). Except OBCs, SC/STs, castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources. The only sources are the personal sources or magazines/websites run by caste-based organizations. Also, please note that many people (esp. nationalists) that editors have categorized as "Famous Bhumihars" or "Nairs" do not believe in caste system and don't consider themselves as Bhumihars or Nairs. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Citations are needed whenever they are demanded -- the burden on evidence is on the contributors. I won't probably demand citations if this were a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indians_777f.html" title="List of Indians">List of Indians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_people_2caf.html" title="List of English people">List of English people</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scots_7b76.html" title="List of Scots">List of Scots</a> (unless there was some obvious flaw in the list). But this list is more like Famous Middle-Class Americians or List of famous Rednecks. By the way, there have been discussions on whether <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Kalam_46b1.html" title="Abdul Kalam">Abdul Kalam</a> is a Muslim or not (please see respective talk page). <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>,That wasn’t a second vote; I was just reiterating my original position (one vote). Moreover, it is highly arrogant of <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> trying to belittle any user who disagrees with his point. I think it shows someone who is highly insecure and can’t handle anyone having a different opinion to him. It's amazing how whenever someone disagrees with him, he tries to belittle the members’ opinion through introducing things to question the person reputation, it shows someone who is very insecure within himself about people having a different opinion to him (almost fascist/extreme or intolerant).--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethj_96af.html" title="User:Pethj">Pethj</a> 19:01, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The word "famous" is inherently POV, as has been discussed many times in the past. And there are far too many indiscriminate, unverifiable lists on WP already. The argument that we should have more bad lists because of existing bad lists is futile—if those lists are bad too, they should be proposed for deletion as well. We don't keep spam merely because there is spam that has yet to be deleted. If the list is kept (and renamed), strict criteria for inclusion should be listed. But I find the precedents cited by Utcursch compelling. Categories are better than lists, IMO, for situations like this, because the inclusion criteria can more easily be discussed on a case-by-case basis that way. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 19:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom or <b>Rename</b> per Bakaman. The word "famous" is inherently POV, as has been discussed many times before. There is <i>no way</i> this list should be allowed to remain with its current name. And there are far too many indiscriminate, unverifiable lists on WP already. The argument that we should have more bad lists because of existing bad lists is futile per GRBerry. We don't keep spam just because there are other spam articles that have yet to be deleted. I find the precedents cited by nom compelling, and think deletion is the best option. Conversion to category is possible too (maybe even preferable to renaming), but the word "famous", in any case, <i>absolutely</i> must go! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> step in the right direction, but for me, the real deciding factor is, "castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources."

<dd>The surnames don't always indicate caste (for eg. Mira Nair is Punjabi). Except OBCs, SC/STs, castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources. The only sources are the personal sources or magazines/websites run by caste-based organizations. Also, please note that many people (esp. nationalists) that editors have categorized as "Famous Bhumihars" or "Nairs" do not believe in caste system and don't consider themselves as Bhumihars or Nairs. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We don't keep spam just because there are other spam articles that have yet to be deleted. I find the precedents cited by nom compelling, and think deletion is the best option.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and consensus from past AfDs is that if a player is listed as a first-team squad member for a leading club (which Roma undoubtedly are), that qualifies him as notable regardless of how few first-team appearances he's made - unlike past deletion of Liverpool youth or Internazional primavera players, who are/were nowhere near the first team.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's my opinion-and feel free to disagree with this-that this article qualifies for a speedy delete, re: advertising/promotional spam. The topic is simply not encyclopedic in any manner, shape or form. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 02:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The topic gives information on a sexual position. If there is a page for the Venus Butterfly, there should be a page for this. They are in no way different. To call this page advertising is completely ridiculous. If you are going to say that then you could say that the Venus Butterfly page is advertising L.A. Law, where the sexual position originated. It also seems to me that because this sexual position is a homosexual sexual position and the Venus Butterfly is not, the people in this debate that are against the page are being homophobic towards it. You all seem to be looking for any small thing to get rid of this page. As for "the topic is simply not encyclopedic in any manner, shape or form" comment, the topic allows you to comprehend what The Byron Insert is; therefore, it is "encyclopedic" as you said. Although that is incorrect usage of the word "encyclopedic", just so you know. As a way of providing the source, the Latino Fan Club was mentioned. But that was VANDALIZED by someone, which I'm just going to guess is one of you who believes that to be advertising. 22:32, 23 October 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Whether or not they are distinct or identical is irrelevant. And in any case you are not in any position to make a dispositive judgment in that regard. Wikipedia operates by consensus, which is why we are having this afd discussion in the first place. I suggest that you tone done your rhetoric-especially your absurd accusations of "homophobia"-try to maintain a more objective attitude about an article in which you obviously have a vested interest, and attempt to collaborate productively with other editors in the Wikipedia community. Thank you. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 02:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is a debate, I'm giving my argument. Calling my accusations of "homophobia" absurd is, in fact, absurd because the same could be said about the accusations made towards the maker of "The Byron Insert" page about this page "advertising" the Latino Fan Club. But considering you are for deleting this page I can only assume that the "advertising" accusation is allowed. I am not for deleting this article, so "collaborating productively with other editors" could not fully apply to me. I obviously have different views than they do and the only thing I am doing is expressing those different views. Instead of attacking my views by calling them "absurd" and "irrelevant", perhaps YOU could try to maintain a more objective attitude and maybe, just maybe, attempt to collaborate productively with me, a fellow editor. If it isn't clear enough to you yet, for what you said in this latest entry you are doing the exact same thing that you are telling me to stop doing. So, I would like to suggest that you read and reflect upon my views on the topic of "The Byron Insert" in a positive way by not bashing my views and sharing with me and everyone else your views. Thank you. 15:45, 25 October 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, please sign your remarks with four tildas. I don't know why your IP address-or user name-isn't showing up, but it isn't. Secondly, this is not a quorum or a debate. If you want to provide evidence that this article is not advertising or spam-other than referring to the promoter of the person who created that image-I suggest that you do so. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 21:01, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> By saying "spam" you are talking about what is considered spam on Wikipedia, which would be a different way of saying advertising. If you want evidence that it is not advertising then why don't you just remove the "Latino Fan Club" comment and the link to the Wikipedia page on the Latino Fan Club? Without those it would not be advertising, correct? But, as stated before, those were added on there to be a source as to where the information came from. Jt801 04:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You see, that is precisely the point. Without the link to a site advertising this sexual technique-presuming of course that it is not completely fictitious-there would be no sources-even that does not constitute a verifiable source-period. In other words, it would not even meet the qualification of being Spam or advertising, but would simply be gibberish or "patent nonsense," and thus qualify for speedy deletion, which it should qualify for in any case. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 17:56, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your point is that you have no point. The first argument against this was that there was no source. So because of that, a link to the Latino Fan Club website was added. But once that was added, the argument became that it was advertising. The page was not created with the link to the Latino Fan Club or with any mention of the Latino Fan Club. But once someone wanted a source as to where the information came from, the link was added. That right there should be proof that there was no advertising (spam) involved. With you saying that it should qualify for speedy deletion in any case, just says that no matter what is added to it you believe it should be deleted. Which would have to mean that your own morals are getting in the way of your decision making here on Wikipedia. The Latino Fan Club is the source as to where the information came from. It is not advertising (spam) and so "gibberish" and "patent nonsense" have no place here. 19:32, 26 October 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again-lest I remind you for the umpteenth time-this is not a debate. If it were, then this article would have been deleted three days ago. The Latin Fan Club-presuming that it is the only source that documents this alleged practice-is not a reliable source and citing it as one merely serves to illustrate the inherent weakness of your argument, yet again. Also, I would appreciate it if you sign your comments in the future. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 02:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It would be for the 2nd time and when did I say "debate" in my last entry? Nope, I didn't at all. Thousands of pages are made based on sources like mine, no I don't mean pornographic distributor's websites but websites in general. Which makes it a reliable source. Have you visited the site before? If not then you cannot call it an unreliable source. As far as weak arguments go, you have no argument. When asking for a source, one is provided. When the page is called advertising, the link to the website is removed. Like I said before, you are letting your own morals get in the way of things. Does something like this really make you so uncomfortable that you have to spend so much time arguing about it? To answer the question now floating around in your head, yes it is important to me that a page like this one be allowed on here which is why I am spending so much time arguing about it. There are a lot of pages for sexual positions and sexual techniques here on Wikipedia, this one should not be excluded. 01:45, 27 October 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You could not find a single website-outside of the promotional vehicle you linked to-which verifies this alleged sexual technique. It's as simple as that. Thousands of articles are not based upon the sourcing of one site. If they were, then they would be on their way to deletion. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 05:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> having trained with a host of famous coaches does not in itself confer notability; Nor does the fact that his live show is amazing. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria must be fulfilled.

<li>Apologies, I didn't mean to delete your post. I only edited it because we were talking about it on MB. on the other hand, I think it deserves to stay in a sense because it is one of the biggest Music forums currently in use, and I have added a link to it on the page. Pehaps there is a better section for it? I am new to Wikipedia, so I am not familiar with it's workings, but MB is definitely not a "totally non-notable site" --Morndas 13:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Firstly, it is not what the title says, but a list of programmes with animals in important roles. Secondly, what defines "important role" (compare Flipper with the dog in Frasier)? Thirdly, in over 18 months, the list has reached the grand total of 10 articles. Fourthly, to create an exhaustive list on either criteria is impossible, if worthwhile, which I doubt.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry, but I don't see why Lostpedia should be deleted and Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha, for examples, shouldn't be kept. Besides, the extensive attempts to find problem with Lostpedia seem more like reaching than genuine concerns. Really, these kinds of frivolous complaints do not improve your arguments. CSS incompatible?? Where? What pages? Copyrights of others? Are you kidding? Lostpedia isn't a site about software piracy (<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astalavista.html" title="Astalavista">Astalavista</a>) or movies (<a href="../../../i/s/o/IsoHunt_1aa2.html" title="IsoHunt">IsoHunt</a>). 3 Advertisements objectionable? CNN.com has just as many. The nytimes.com page has even more. I don't know about the behavior of the sysops there, but there is certainly plenty of verifiable information on the site, and even if there is fan speculation, it is often identified as such, so it's not a problem. Besides, it's not like there isn't published works on Lost(Amazon for example, has at least 3 Unofficial Guides that I could find without looking hard), and it's not a no-name unknown show. So, there are sources for it as well. But seriously, it seems to me that there is some serious personal animus here. That's a concern that tends to make me doubt the fairness of this proposal. Seems to me that this is a conflic that needs to be resolved more than this article needs to be deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason the editors at <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> delete links to Lostpedia is, according to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">this discussion</a>, because of all the fancruft. In a straw-poll-like discussion, the consensus seems to have been that Lostpedia does not deserve its own article, and possibly does not even deserve a link from the main Lost article. In that case, why keep? Wouldn't it make more sense to say delete? --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 18:43, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> All the fancruft is hardly an argument. Fancruft is not suitable for wikipedia, yes.

<li>I didn't mean it as an argument to delete. I meant it, in fact, as the opposite: the "gatekeepers" of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> article are probably making a mistake by not including a link.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As MatthewFenton notes above, there is a long history here (largely by people who otherwise participate either very little or not at all in WP) of trying to get a link to Lostpedia on WP, in any way, shape, or form, including bad faith edits and behavior. Especially given the economic aspects (i.e., WP-driven traffic boosting a site's ad revenue, probably by thousands of dollars a year), we have to be very careful about providing such links. There are dozens of <i>Lost</i>-related fansites, too, so this is a slippery slope. See, for example, the LostCasts AfD at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LostCasts_5016.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LostCasts">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LostCasts</a>. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 18:33, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> According to that reasoning we should delete the links to all sites with ads and not link to any sites because it might increase visitors or leads to a "slippery slope". Lostpedia is an honest attempt at building a Lost encyclopedia, not a money making scheme and it certainly doesn't need wikipedia to get visitors. Also, the comments about editors who support inclusion of lostpedia on wikipedia are bordering on personal attacks. I'd suggest you would withold from making such comments.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 19:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nope. Sorry, I won't accept that. The facts (specifically, the WP edit non-history of many of the people voting here for Lostpedia inclusion) speak for themselves, and are well documented in the very lengthy discussion at <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites</a>, which this discussion is threatening to repeat once again, with the same people voting in the same way. And sure, revenue considerations have to be brought into this mix. WP is a powerful traffic driver. The bar of notability has to be kept high; we can't have a site considered notable merely because it has 7000 users, especially when there are very considerable quality concerns about its information and approaches. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 23:09, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Whilst users critique the argument that Wookieepedia and Memory Alpha both have articles, it is a valid point to make, as these articles supposedly passed WP:WEB on the virtue of an article in Sci-fi.com - which Lostpedia has along with much more media coverage to boot. Having been officially recognised by the show producers and company itself on numerous occassions also gives Lostpedia strong notability, as does the response by ABC to set up their own Lost Wiki (undoubtedly in response to the exponential growth the site Lostpedia has experienced in but a year). Thus, Lostpedia deserves to have its own article. And in response to "the slippery slope" I see no real precedence for this, as not to reiterate using the old examples, but allowing other Wikis to have articles did not for instance cause a huge precedent for Star Wars and Star Trek sites being allowed to <i>stay</i> articles on the WP database to my knowledge --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickb123_3rd_b4c7.html" title="User:Nickb123 3rd">Nickb123 3rd</a> 18:36, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see a whole lot of hand waving about "we have other wikis, so we should have this one too." Wrong. A lot of those articles are kind of crappy upon review, and I'd probably express an opinion to delete those if they were to come to AfD; however, that said, the existence of some uncited messes doesn't justify the existence of other uncited messes. We shouldn't lower our standards for inclusion just because some articles inexplicably get kept.

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> Why this had a listing on AfD to begin with is puzzling to me...it's a verifiable internet webpage that's growing exponentially. I think several people have some biases towards wiki's and want this one to not exist.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - i somehow get an overwhelming impression just from reading the upper part of this AfD that some users seem to be simply holding some kind of grudge against it. I don't see Lostpedia as obviously failing either <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and i especially don't see how lostpedia fails them any worse than Wookiepedia or Memory Alpha. Talking about which, i don't see how "unverified fancruft" has anything to do with this. Do people even realize what fancruft means? The opening line of <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> explains it quite well "<i>Fancruft is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question.</i>". There's nothing wrong with Fancruft, it's not bad. It's just not fit for an encyclopedia. But fansites by definition exist to serve the 'small population of enthusiastic fans'. So-called "Fancruft" is exactly the kind of external sites are supposed to provide, since it's information that's not appropriate on our own encyclopedia. Arguments like this "<i>Blatant fail; their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?</i>" is circular. Because even if someone independant added links to lostpedia in wikipedia articles, there is no way to prove who is adding links because they think it's a good idea, and who is adding links because they're affiliated with lostpedia. At the end, it just comes down to the bad faith assumption of "you're adding links to lostpedia, you must be from lospedia and trying to advertise". --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"So far they’ve only really been able to post 'blogs'" Untrue as shown by lostpedia's media coverage page [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia_media_coverage" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia_media_coverage" rel="nofollow">[132]</a>]. References include businessweek, newsday, and wired news (those aren't "trivial" sources, are they?). It is true that there are blogs listed as well, these include ones hosted by sources like the Chicago Tribune, USA today, and the guardian, in most cases written by the TV critic or pop culture columnist for that publication.<br /></dd>
<dd>"No awards cited" SciFi weekly site of the week[<a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" rel="nofollow">[133]</a>]. For comparison, this is the only reference provided by <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>, which has its own page. It should be noted that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says that only one of the three criteria needs to be met to merit inclusion.<br /></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a><br /></dd>
<dd>"Site provides nothing unique, except of course unverifiable fan cruft"<br /></dd>
<dd>A comparison of the two sites shows this to be wrong. For a specific example, compare the wikipedia page <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Experience_b649.html" title="Lost Experience">Lost Experience</a> with the Lostpedia page for the same topic [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lost_experience" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lost_experience" rel="nofollow">[134]</a>]. The wikipedia page is fairly detailed, but it is mostly highlights, while the lostpedia version (as far as I can tell) documents it in enough detail that a reader could access every bit of content in the lost experience. This was particularly significant during the online game, as people trying to figure out the puzzles were able to use Lostpedia as a repository of game information while someone referring only to wikipedia wouldn't have sufficient information to solve the puzzles.<br /></dd>
<dd>Trying to write off Lostpedia as "unverifiable fan cruft" seems like a circular argument to me. It's not a legit site because it has nothing unique beyond fancruft, but the info that goes beyond what wikipedia has is defined as fancruft because it is on a site that's not legit. The info that is on Lostpedia generally isn't any less verifiable than the info on the wikipedia lost pages - the primary source is the show itself in the vast majority of cases. And while "cruft" is generally frowned upon on wikipedia (while there's still a fair amount on wiki's Lost pages), wiki policy doesn't list it as a reason for excluding links to external sites.<br /></dd>
<dd>“Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research, as detailed in Wikipedia:Reliable sources.” I'm not sure what you consider factually inaccurate or unverified. The info that is on Lostpedia generally isn't any less verifiable or inaccurate than the info on the wikipedia lost pages - the primary source is the show itself in the vast majority of cases, and the information can be verified by watching the show. Obviously, the information on a site operated using wiki principles will never be 100% correct or verified, as I'm sure wikipedia editors will readily admit, but I'd argue the vast majority of information on Lostpedia is accurate, and as inaccurate info is found, it is corrected. Lostpedia does contain fan speculation, but it is clearly marked and kept separate from the factual information. Such speculation is certainly not inappropriate for a show that actively encourages it, and as long as it as it is presented as opinion and not fact, I don't consider it unverified or original research, not any more than a movie data site would be disqualified for containing user reviews in addition to factual info.<br /></dd>
<dd>"their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?" In fact, independent parties have added links to lostpedia, here's an example from a user who is a longtime wikipedia editor, doesn't mainly edit Lost articles, and as far as I can tell, isn't a lostpedia participant [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66242554" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66242554" rel="nofollow">[135]</a>]. This link was deleted with the reason given being "rm spam" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=82172252&amp;oldid=80507712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=82172252&amp;oldid=80507712" rel="nofollow">[136]</a>] even though that was clearly not the intent when it was posted, evidence of bad faith editing on the part of MatthewFenton. From what I've seen (and obviously, I admit it's difficult if even possible to find every instance where links to lostpedia have been added) it's entirely possible that links to lostpedia are automatically assumed to be bad faith "spam" edits, whether they are or not. Above is certainly one example of that happening.<br /></dd>
<dd>I'd also like to see a reference to where the owner of Lostpedia has added a link to it. If this has happened, I'd agree that this is a neutrality violation. However, in the case of a site that is open to public contribution, it seems likely that many people who would find the site notable could choose to participate in it themselves, thus disqualifying themselves from writing about the site.</dd>
<dd>Also on the topic of neutrality, if it is a conflict of interest for those participating in Lostpedia to add links to it, I'd argue that it's also a conflict of interest for those participating in Lostpedia to delete links to it as well. Specifically in the case of MatthewFenton, he declared his bad faith intentions on Lostpedia [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=User:MatthewFenton&amp;oldid=103470" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=User:MatthewFenton&amp;oldid=103470" rel="nofollow">[137]</a>], immediately began a major edit that would have had an effect on the entire site, without getting any input from other users [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=MatthewFenton" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=MatthewFenton" rel="nofollow">[138]</a>], and as a result was banned from the site. If the opinions and edits of those involved with Lostpedia are to be ignored (not that I necessarily agree with it, but it has been argued), I'd suggest that MatthewFenton should be included in that group. And after all, if Lostpedia is truly not notable as some argue, wouldn't someone independent remove the link?<br /></dd>
<dd>"adverts are pretty objectionable, imho" Your opinion. There are quite a few similar sites that have pages on wikipedia that have quite a bit more advertising. And lostpedia certainly doesn't "primarily exist to sell products or services", especially since the site doesn't sell things at all - looking at the site, I don't find a way to send lostpedia money if I wanted to.<br /></dd>
<dd>"Website uses CSS incompatible with MSIE." I just looked at lostpedia and was able to access it just fine with MSIE. If you're talking about a cosmetic feature not being supported, that doesn't make the site "inaccessible". If you weren't able to access the site, how were you able to create a user account and edit the site, much less read the site to determine whether it's deserving of inclusion on wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>"Unwilling to fix their blatant violations of GFDL and US copyright even when assistance is rendered." Simply not true. Since MatthewFenton was at lostpedia and edited there, his recommendations for GDFL and copyright notices were taken, and the images he referenced in his comments there now have GDFL and other copyright notices. "Unwilling to fix" isn't the same as unwilling to let a brand new user singlehandedly implement a copyright notice policy with no input from the community (particularly one who had made a public declaration of bad faith).<br /></dd>
<dd>“if lostpedia cant get an article, no one can” While I frown upon Lostpedia users creating AfDs for other articles in "retaliation", I think an argument can be made for doing that in good faith. Articles like Memory Alpha and Wookieepedia have been referenced in comparison, and those arguing that Lostpedia doesn't meet WP:WEB or WP:EL have made arguments that, when applied to those other pages, those pages fail as well. In each of these discussions, there have also been wiki editors who have spoken in favor of deleting Lostpedia references, and have favored deleting the two above articles for the same reasons. If a Lostpedia reference is deleted, and criteria given for the deletion, shouldn't other articles that fall under the same criteria be considered for deletion as well? The question is simply, should a set of standards be applied to one article but not another?<br /></dd>
<dd>"it is pretty obvious to me by the way their sysops have behaved in attempting to get links and an article here that they generally require the traffic Wikipedia would generate (hence a bigger income from the Google ad words et cetera)"</dd>
<dd>Lostpedia sysops don't make money from lostpedia, if any profit is made at all (since obviously hosting a site costs money, and income has to cover expenses first), it would only go to the owner of the site. Such an accusation seems ad hominem and unfounded. A similar accusation could be made of the editors of the Lost pages on wikipedia - that they have been removing links to Lostpedia because they're worried that traffic there would decrease traffic to wikipedia. MatthewFenton has also made accusations that Lostpedia engages in google bombing. Are there facts to back up that accusation?<br /></dd>
<dd>Sorry for the length of this, but I don't want to see a decision like this made based on incorrect (if not intentionally misleading) information. Thanks to all of you who have participated in this discussion - and for those of you have have voted "per MatthewFenton" to be aware that a number of his statements are factually incorrect and that he has shown bias and bad faith in regards to Lostpedia.

<dd>[disclosure: I have participated heavily in the Lost article's discussion on this topic. I am in no way affiliated with Lostpedia, as some have implied. I have occasionally read Lostpedia as a resource, and have been impressed with its scope. In particular, its unfounded speculation has been a source of some entertainment and insight to me. If competing sites meet or exceed Lostpedia in value and/or notoriety, I'd be prepared to support them in addition to, or instead of, Lostpedia.]</dd>
<dd>In the ongoing side discussion of the Lost article <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">found here</a>, the bulk of the arguments against a link to Lostpedia have been around claims that Wikipedia policy prohibits an external link to Lostpedia in any context. That is, according to some, a mere line item in the External Links section of the Lost article pointing to Lostpedia, would be a prima facie violation of Wikipedia policy. The comments on this AfD page expose such claims as misguided at best.</dd>
<dd>Since this is a discussion on whether to delete an article about Lostpedia, and not about whether to link Lostpedia in the Lost article, I am forced to support keeping the Lostpedia article, if only as a means of notifying Wikipedia readers about a valuable Lost resource. A single link from Wikipedia:Lost(tv) to Lostpedia would satisfy all my concerns about offering potentially valuable outside resources to our readers. Failing that, I'll have to support a separate Lostpedia article, since an internal link could not be so mis-objected to, by some Lost article editors.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Lostpedia does not appear to be hurting for findability.

<dd><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Well, what can I say? If it's good enough for Matthew Fenton, it's good enough for me. I'm switching my recommendation to an unambiguous <i>keep.</i> In general, I'd rather we include a page that no-one much is interested in, than to exclude a page that someone might be looking for. Not everyone shares this philosophy, or uses the same threshold of notability, but when in doubt, I tend to go with inclusion. Lostpedia seems to meet the notability threshold of more than a few people who know the ropes around here, and this has influenced my evaluation. In addition, if it doesn't get its page this time, we're likely to be right back here the next time it shows up as a news item somewhere; or worse, we might be too sick of the topic to give it another fair consideration for a while. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 02:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He attempts to imply that he's participated in other AfD discussions, when this is actually the only one in which he's ever been involved.

We want to eliminate a bizarre hypocracy where nearly every other TV show lists notable fansites, while a few self-proclaimed "gatekeepers" insist that the Lost entry be free of fansites.

<li>This is not a vote. Kevincroy has disclosed that he is the founder of Lostpedia. That should be sufficient when evaluating his "keep" recommendation, as well as any comments he makes. Recusal has no meaning here. I must say though, that the Jumbo quote doesn't really fit the topic of whether Lostpedia should have an article. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 03:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. I have removed my vote. The comment from Jimbo is related to listing <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lostpedia.html" title="Lostpedia">Lostpedia</a> at the Wikipedia. Maybe you can ask him to clarify his thoughts. If you want to get the context of his quote read the entry on his <a href="http://lost.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales" class="external text" title="http://lost.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevincroy_aae7.html" title="User:Kevincroy">Kevincroy</a> 06:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't a vote. Crossing out a "delete" or "keep" generally shows the person is changing/withdrawing their opinion, which isn't the case. Really, the creater of Lospedia has as much right as the rest of us to participate in a <i>discussion</i> as long as it's civil and in good faith; especially when he (and others) have admitted involvement in Lospedia. It shows how he is respecting the wikipedia process, and not trying to do anything dodgy (contrast to many people's suggestions that individuals from Lostpedia are puppeting here). Let's just let this be a discussion of the article, instead of about the people who participate. I'm sure the admin closing this will look into it extra carefully, considering how much debate/contraversy it's generating. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 14:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good point, i'm going to restore them. Comments from people explaining their vote (even if it was an abstain) shouldn't be moved.

<li>I can't disagree strongly enough with your assertion "These comments were appropriate to move to the discussion page, as they were exclusively a reply to (and about) MatthewFenton, and did not deal with any actual Wikipedia policy-- instead discuss personal disagreements that would likely be classified under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>." These comments directly deal with Wikipedia policy and more specifically to this AfD. How is disputing the claim that an article cited for notability is a blog (a link to one of the articles in question: [<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" rel="nofollow">[140]</a>]) a personal attack, much less irrelevant to the topic? From WP:NPA let me quote: "<b>Disagreements about content such as "Your statement about X is wrong" or "Your statement is a point of view, not fact" are not personal attacks.</b>" I also made accusations of bad faith, and backed up those accusations with examples and evidence. You obviously feel that the posting record of people voting here and their credibility is relevant because you have made accusations of SPA and conflict of interest. I believe I have made no personal attacks in my comments here; if you feel that something I've said falls under NPA, the more appropriate response is to single it out so that I may either clarify my remark, or withdraw it and apologize for it. In addition, WP:ARCHIVE (assuming I understand it correctly) applies to archiving an entire page, not selectively removing comments, so it doesn't apply here. (not to mention that it applies to talk pages, which I don't believe this is) I'm not sure that archiving an AfD while it is still in progress is even allowed by wikipedia policy. In addition, WP:REFACTOR says; "<b>refactoring of talk pages must preserve the full intentions of the original authors</b>", which you certainly didn't do in regards to my comments. In regard to length, I was unaware that there was a word or page limit on AfD comments, could you point me to the WP policy that spells it out? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is so much about this show to read and investigate it would seem imperative that a resource such as the Wikipedia could provide something of a road map.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I don't see any evidence that the Sci-Fi site of the week award is well-known, but I would still consider the "review", as it's described there, as non-trivial coverage.

<dd><b>Comment</b> WP:WEB says <i>"the subject of multiple non-trivial published works"</i>. If you feel that the wikipedia policy sets the bar too low, the solution is to try and change the policy, not to ignore the policy. There's a more complete list of references at [<a href="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia:Media_Coverage" class="external autonumber" title="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia:Media_Coverage" rel="nofollow">[143]</a>], some of which have been included in previous versions of the article. There are a decent number, although not many are the main point of the article; I certainly feel like there are enough references to qualify as "multiple", especially considered along with the fact that LP was inluded in <i>The Lost Experience</i>. Feel free to add appropriate ones back in. And if you feel that LP doesn't meet WP:WEB, how do you feel about the inclusion of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:21, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As per Milo H Minderbinder, Lostpedia meets WP:WEB, WP:EL and the arguments against its layout, wiki nature or text adverts are spurious. As per Angela and others, the site has a significant number of users, outstripping Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha, and is gaining increasing media coverage. The amount of media coverage it has already attained is enough to be notable. There are many Wikipedia editors who have formed either an outdated or inaccurate opinion about Lostpedia's verifiability and notability, I hope the facts revealed by this discussion convinces them to rethink. 195.173.23.111 10:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC) (if you have a problem with me being an IP address, have a look at my contribs - I have edited under this address since February and edit both LOST and non-LOST topics regularly.

<li><b>Keep</b>, because it is notable, it meets all those regulations people are citing, and... Yeah. What I said. On a slightly different note, it's really silly to be saying that "Wikipedia is afraid of competition" and such, because there is VALID concern for Wikipedia becoming a web directory with this sort of thing being included. So stop using those arguments.--The Sporadic Update 02:05, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think accusing Wikipedia of being afraid of competition is a bit much, I think its more to do with the quite young keepers of the LOST article (I won't say moderators, as none of them are) feeling this fierce pride in their work, and a wish on their behalf not to link to other sites that also cover this content, arguably with better information. Many sites are like this. <a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Digital Spy</a> won't let you do this, and <a href="http://www.lost-media.com" class="external text" title="http://www.lost-media.com" rel="nofollow">Lost Media</a> won't either. Its a shame that something like Wikipedia, and the web in general, which are supposed to be for sharing knowledge and information, can be hijacked by people who are fiercely competitive, rather than collaborative. --217.65.158.91 12:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thank you for all your observations. If the consensus is to delete because it doesn't meet wiki norms then please do so. I thought of adding a note that we have contacted the Director General of SUNFO who has confirmed the following;</p>
<p>Prof.Madurasinghe is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees as well as the Adviser on Human rights and also the Dean of their Centre for full human potential developemnt(CFHPD).Their old free site is still valid and they are in the process of transferring data to the official site .</p>
<p>The Director General himself has been in the Board of Maharishi Univerity Sri Lanka Chapter and is well aware of its operations. It had been having dialogues with the government to allocate land for University buildings which had not materialized hence they had conducted modular units on consciousness conducted by prof.Madurasinghe. A large delegation of scientists had visited Sri Lanka in 1999 and held public sessions. This may be a reason why it is not in the main web page of MUM identified as a fully operational university.</p>
<p>There is with them a document signed by Dr.Bevan Morris addressed to H.E.The President of Sri Lanka dated 3 Jan 2000, in which he says " Dr.Lakshman Madurasinghe is now heading the Mahrishi University of management &amp; Maharishi Global Administration- Sri Lanka , which has been legally incorporated".</p>
<p>The Board of Directors had nine foreigners and six Sri Lankans. Dr Bevan Morris's name is also among them. The offical documents are all available with them for inspection by anyone interested. mahindaintellect 12:12, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, this information should be available with MUM authorities. Right? If you agree, we shall verify this information by sending an e-mail to <a href="http://www.mum.edu/phone/" class="external text" title="http://www.mum.edu/phone/" rel="nofollow">relevant authorities</a>. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 07:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Board of Directors had nine foreigners and six Sri Lankans. Dr Bevan Morris's name is also among them. The offical documents are all available with them for inspection by anyone interested.</p>
<p><b>We Have the names of foreigners as follows:</b> Dr.Bevan Morris; Dr.Nand Kishore; Prof.Tony Nader; Dr.Neil Patterson; Dr.Volker Schanbacher; Dr.Benjamin Feldman; Dr.Hartmann; Dr. W Bosch; Dr.T Eickhoff;</p>
<p><b>Original letter dated 12 Nov 1999 giving the names of the board has been signed by Dr.Bevan Morris;</b></p>
<p>We also understood from Director General SUNFO that the Institution has been in operation since 31 Dec 1999 and still exists as a legally incoporated body with annual returns furnished to Sri Lankan government until last year ,2005. He said he would make available copies of both letters for review as and when needed. The memorandum &amp; articles legally incorporating are also available.</p>
<p><b>He further confirmed that Prof.Madurasinghe visited Vlodrop , Holland in 2000 when he met Maharishi, Dr.Morris and Dr.Tony Nader. His interview with Dr.Tony Nader was telecast worldwide via satellite through their channel. SUNFO has a copy of the interview on CD in which Dr.Nader confirms that Prof.nadurasinghe is the Head of Mah Uni in Sri Lanka and displays the land area photo identified where the university Buildings will one day be put up based on funding.</b></p>
<p>We are sure that Dr.Morris has a copy of same. mahindaintellect 14:36, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>

<li><b>Not sure</b> OK, it's a partially rewritten CV but, on the face of it, describing a notable person. I do have a problem with the educational background though. In 1972 he takes GCE A Levels. Four years later, he's a lawyer, but no mention of any studying/qualifications in between. Could be an oversight.........but he lists son many other segrees and diplomas that he can't have had time to do anything except gather qualifications, or buy them??? The "Open International University for Complementary Medicines" does not look like a genuine institution.

From <a href="http://www.microacupuncturequacks.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.microacupuncturequacks.com/" rel="nofollow">Confessions of a Quack</a>: "The M.D. was apparently bought from Lord Pandit Prof. Dr. Sir Anton Jayasuriya (1930-2005) of Sri Lanka. Jayasuriya created Medicina Alternativa International in Sri Lanka and claimed to be affiliated with The Open International University [presumably to be confused with the Open University of Sri Lanka]. He <b>sold diplomas</b> for various fields. I have a copy of his charge list for 1962. For $3,750 USD one could buy any of the following degrees: M.D. (M.A.), M.D. (T.M.), Dr. Ac., or Ph.D.".

<dd><b>Comment</b>- This is a further biased statement. This University has a record of treating over 3 million patients. It was involved in complementary forms of treatment as such it did annoy drug manufacturers.Many who have found total cure are available all over the wolrd and being in that faculty and also in the CAM faculty of USA seems a worthy effort.

No one should blame him for providing free artricles and downloads in his own sites. He has been in Haggai faculty, had discussions with a known Islamic Scholar, Ahmed Deedat etc. This way of selective reasoning simply tends to leave the truth diluted and the main points missed.

<p><b>Sheikh Mohammed Shakir</b></p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed Shakir b. Ahmad b. ‘Abd al-Qadir was born in 1282 Hijri/1866 CE in Jirja, a city in Upper Egypt. He studied and graduated from Al Azhar University. He died in 1358 Hijri/1939 CE in Cairo. <b>Where is evidence to suport this&#160;?</b></p>
<p>His son, Sheikh Ahmad Mohammed Shakir, wrote his biography in a treatise entitled Mohammed Shakir ‘Alam min A‘lam al-‘Asr. Positions • Sudan's Supreme Judge for four years (1990-1993) • Dean of Alexandria's Scholars • Al-Azhar Secretary General ("Wakil") and a member of its board of directors • Member of Al-Azhar Corps of High Scholars • Member of Al Azhar legislative Society ("al-Jam‘iyya al-Tashri‘iyya") References 1. ^ Works by M. H. Shakir at Project Gutenberg- <b>Gutenburg has no entry in his name. Islam online biography of translator- is just a page -Who created it&#160;?</b></p>
<p><b>Thomas Nedunthally</b></p>
<p>Thomas Harris Nedunthally was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, India on December 12th, 1982. He is in his own little world although well read and socialized. He believes that he would be the divine force in making a change. He is yet to accomplish anything that could affect peoples lives. But if you would like to know more about him do read on. <b>( IS THIS VERFIABLE EVIDENCE?)</b></p>
<p>He moved to Abu Dhabi Indian School (ADIS), where he began his maturing stage. In the 9th, 10th and 11th standard he got the 2nd place in his school for the Gulf Mathematics Olympiad (GMO). That seemed to be the first stage of his growing and keen interest in mathematics due to the relative ease in which he achieved it. <b>WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE&#160;?</b></p>
<p>After an eventful and enjoyable 11th and 12th standard he wrote the SAT II and got into Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras in 2000. He did pretty well in his first year but he was a slacker. He had an attention problem and couldn't attend classes properly. In his 2nd year, after his 3rd semester he didn't write 3 exams due to the boring nature of the courses. He saw the lack of future of the lazy students at IIT, and decided that he had to move on. He knew that the only courses he could concentrate are theoretical ones such as Math and Computer Science. So that seemed to be the best option for him.</p>
<p>Compared to a students entry like Nedunthally do you think the article under discussion has no contribution or unverifiable evidence&#160;?</p>
<p>I am just surprised why we don't look at what is available. <b>I recommend to keep it.</b></p>

<p><b>Maharsihi University Sri Lanka Branch verified</b> We have additional verification about a statement that was in a previous draft that he was the president of Maharishi University Sri Lanka branch and chosen as vice-chancellor of the proposed university. The Government records show a legal incorporation on 31 Dec 1999 bearing number N(A) 817 The memorandum and articles of incorporation filed with the government clearly identifies him as president and has a few other local professionals plus around nine foreign persons as board members.</p>

<p>In an earlier version there was a statement that he had followed therapeutic jurisprudence at Cambridge which may well account for how he is a member of the society which is for cambridge alumni.In one of his web sites he mentions a clear e-mail which is a cantab.net used only by alumni.

<p>You shouldn't again jump to conclusions without finding out what Law college system is .This is very well explained in their site <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm</a> I suggest you study that carefully to understand what happens to those who have completed GCE A/Level exams and how to become a lawyer in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>As regards your personal opinion on CIPD-Lond is another example of a hasty conclusion and a totally misleading comment that anyone can join as a fully qualified professional member.I know many who are membes of CIPD and none of them were ever able to get there without years of study and assessment.I suggest to enlighten others and also add humour that you apply and tell the world what happens.Getting it will be better than simply assuming such falasies.At most you will join as a trainee or affiliate member only.

<li>For your information, I <i>had</i> looked carefully at all of the sites, and others, and I become more suspicious the more I saw. Regarding CIDP London, from their website: Chartered Member (Chartered MCIPD) - "Must demonstrate three years' relevant experience at management level as well as CPD over the last year." Of course, this man is a Chartered Fellow (Chartered FCIPD) - "Available for upgrade from Chartered MCIPD membership" i.e., it is possible to easily progress through the ranks on the basis if experience and accreditation of previous experience, which could include questionable awards from abroad. Regardless, achieving fellowship of the CIDP would not mean notabilty. Regarding IBC Cambridge: No comment from you because it is a paid-to-be-included publication that has no value. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 19:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for visiting CIPD site as mentioned. Here are some details about them and if you are interested you may visit the link to get their annual report which provides more details.</p>
<p>Like any other professional body, members progress over a period of time but as far as we are aware CIPD has assessments and direct supervision of record and work places to verifiy service details and they are not follish enough to go by mere assumptions to upgrade a member.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/" class="external free" title="http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/</a></p>
<p>It has been another successful year for the CIPD. Membership has continued to grow. A 2.3% increase in the last year took total CIPD membership to over 127,500, of whom 47,000 are chartered members. We’ve met all our financial objectives, as well as adding to the range and quality of services we offer to our members – this three-pronged approach underpins our continuing success.</p>
<p>The educational route is the most popular way to become a member of the CIPD. It will help you develop the skills and knowledge you need to launch your professional career. Our Professional Standards govern entry to CIPD membership and form the basis of all our qualifications. They act as a benchmark for the profession. They define levels of knowledge and competence you need to demonstrate when operating in a support role, practitioner or at an advanced level.</p>
<p>To be eligible you must hold one of the following: • a CIPD-approved or accredited qualification • an MBA • a National or Scottish Vocational qualification (NVQ/SVQ) at level 3 or above in a relevant occupational area • a SQA HNC in Human Resource Management or Learning and Development • a Certificate in Training and Development (CTD) • a Diploma in Training Management User:mahindaintellect 13:08, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to quote huge chunks of the CIPD website - we can all read it for ourselves. But seeing as you have, let me take a couple of points from your quotes. (1) "To be eligible you must hold one of the following.... NVQ/SVQ level 3". Not impressive. For people outside UK who do not understand British qualifications, let me explain that NVQ 3 is roughly equivalent to A Levels. It is a vocational qualification that would typically be held by an 18 year old hairdresser, plumber, baker, care worker. Worth having, but NOT impressive. (2) "Last year took total CIPD membership to over 127,500". How many? Not an exclusive club giving notability to its members then. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 10:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> Perhaps initially when our team worked on this biography the noteworthy contributions may not have been adequately captured by our analysts. However at Intellect site a comprehensive account is available which has been backed by readily available evidence.

<p>We have also managed to take a 2 mt video clip out of the 40 mt interview which he had with Prof.Tony Nader , International President of Maharishi University when he visited the campus in Holland in March 2000. This was telecast via satellite worldwide.

This has always been a big topic in science fiction: <i>Star Wars</i> and the writings of Andre Norton, Robert Heinlein and countless others. Some technology beyond rocket ships would be needed for it to be economical to bring back anything from other places in the solar system.

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> <b>Strong Merge</b> A chant about the Yankees sucking does not, I believe, qualify as "baseball lore." It is a mundane chant that could be done by any team's fans against another team that they are playing. The only signifance is that New Englanders in general (Red Sox fans in particular) yell this chant at non-Yankee related events. This suggests to me that, at best, this article should be merged with Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry. The fact that there are youtube videos of other teams chanting it is only significant in as much as that other team's fans feel strongly about the Yankees when in direct competition. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 01:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't feel like I've heard a single convincing argument yet for why this requires a standalone article. Chanting, whether it's "Yankees Suck," "Boston Sucks," or "Cubs Suck" is clearly a part of baseball rivalry. This particular chant would appear to only be notable because it is part of one of the most notable rivalries in all of sports. Include it in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry page. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 22:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll concede that it is a more significant phrase than "Blue Jays Blow" or any other chant directed at a specific team, but it still seems that the main reason for the phenomenon is because of the Yanks/Sox rivalry, and don't you feel that all of that could be covered with a merge into the Rivalry's article? <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 23:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't. The rivalry is well known, without a doubt. The issue is that this phrase itself has taken on a life of its own outside the rivalry. It's referred to in non-baseball contexts, it's cited as one of the more unsavory aspects of sports chants, and it's responsible for a fairly consequential merchandising situation, to boot. If people search for "Yankees Suck," they're not looking for information on the rivalry, they want information on the chant and the things around it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> It is current Wikipedia practice to feature articles grouping like events, situations and individuals. That the article is unimportant to Kenwilliams does not mean it is unimportant to others. That it is poorly sourced, I concede. This, like many other Wikipedia articles could benefit from a thorough documentation effort. But are we now going to delete all insufficiently sourced articles?! That the historical couples are not "real couples" is an extreme and unsupported contention, as well as an indefensible generalization. As for this being said of some people in order to stigmatize them, perhaps, but we will really have to examine each case in question - that is no reason to throw the whole lot into the dustbin. And why assume that this was universally stigmatizing?! That is a pov contention. In many cases, it was seen as praiseworthy. Modern history examples in question?! Such as? What this article needs is a group of interested editors to subject it to the healthy dialectic of Wikipedia editing, pruning and adding as consensus develops, instead of being swept under this or that ideological rug. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 22:01, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For an historican like me it's hard to read such rubbish like this article. Ofcourse they are stigmatized. Maybe you can imagine - not at all times in history it was OK to be gay. Such rumours were used to stigmate people. An other problem I forget - here the authors mixed gay and pererastic "couples". The wohle article from the beginning to the end is pure horror. But I belive the article will be keeped. The en:WP seems to the other WP's like a dustbin/ashcan. Such POV-articles without sources, without using modern literature will keep. And actually neraly the only argument for keeping is the reproach, I'm a POV-warrior. It's funny. But I have nothing against such a list (is not important who with who - but at the end it's also not bad) - but <b>this</b> list is to delete.

<dd>I am sorry, but your vehemence renders your criticism suspect. It is not our concern whether accusations of sodomy stigmatized or not their targets. These people often went to their death, together with their lovers - are we expected to believe that they were all framed and drawn up on false charges?! And then you say that we mixed gay and pederastic couples. But does that statement not refute your contention - that these were indeed pederastic couples? As for the alleged mix, will you now argue that only those who bedded young adolescents were pederasts, and those who loved older adolescents were not? What are you basing yourself on for making your distinction? Sources? You are right, but that was discussed already. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Unimportant</i> is only one point of some. Interesting, that the Keepers try to reduct it to this point. I'm a studied historian (I know, this is in the en:Wiki a bad point, people who are experts are not welcome), with special subject (ancient) culture history. I know, how ta handle the sources. The author of the article seems to have a problem with this. And to the personal attacks: I think it's interesting, why people are for keeping the article. Instead to cry, the main author should work on the list - for keeping the List must be free from any rumours - only couples without any doubt could be list there. And there are much less than on the list. And all must be referenced with serious sources. In my opinion there should be a new start without the actuel main author - he seems to be a POV-pusher in his own way. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwilliams_44c4.html" title="User:Kenwilliams">Kenwilliams</a> 14:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, and attempting to promote an image of being useful and reliable. Having unencyclopedic, unreliable information is harmful. Articles suck up the Wikipedia server's hardware power and bandwith and editors manpower for fact checking.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Per the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> guidelines, all post-secondary educational institutions are inherently notable.

A thorough read through the published, verifiable, independently-sourced articles included in the article regarding the school shows that it is quite genuine. That a new school is not accredited by a national accrediting agency does not make it a diploma mill, nor does the timeframe in obtaining such accreditation constitute any evidence of non-notability. Despite the lack of traditional news coverage, the articles provided and available online provide clear satisfaction of every aspect required by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Baptist publications are independent reliable sources. They are not by close affiliates of the institute. For those who don't follow Christian denominations, baptists are about as unorganized as something can be and still be worth having an organizational label for. Independent for discussing notability and for <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> purposes means just independent of the particular organization/person/etc... under discussion. Religious POV newspapers are just as legitimate as "alternative" newspapers with a politically left POV (which we use as independent reliable sources on politically left topics). The Baptist Standard is a print newspaper/magazine that has been publishing since 1888, see <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" rel="nofollow">[184]</a>. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Baptist_Press_b935.html" title="Associated Baptist Press">Associated Baptist Press</a> is a news bureau based in Florida with offices in Washington D.C. and Texas, see <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/aboutus.page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abpnews.com/aboutus.page" rel="nofollow">[185]</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find the comment by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> that the sources used are "religious publications with obvious strong biases" to be disturbing and confusing. What is their bias? Each of these sources are used to provide factual information, not to offer an opinion. Each source used is an independent entity that covers religion. The implication that these sources are invalid is false, if not patently offensive. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:27, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The issue here is notability. There are <b>two sources</b> tied to churches. That's all there is. Yes, accreditation is a multi year process; Are they a canidate? Can you verify they have applied for accreditation? All regional accreditators require a school have a library, this doesn't even have a campus. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 16:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only one of these points relevant to notability is that the false claim about the independent sources. The sources are not tied to churches. The publishers have near pseudo-denominational affiliations, which is very, very different. (Baptists aren't even really a single denomination; in the U.S. they were for about 50 years, but have been becoming more and more fragmented since they original association broke up due to the same tensions that led to the Civil War.) See the response above for more details about what the publishers are. There have been multiple published, independent reliable sources primarily about them, which is the foundational basis for almost all criteria for notability, and we have no consensus criteria for schools to assert a tighter standard. (The notion of tighter standard for schools is laugahable, given the general AFD discussion about schools.) A trivial google search also produces additional reliable sources. There are 34 articles in The Baptist Standard that refer to the school (natural, given that it covers Baptists in Texas) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[186]</a>. It has been covered by the North Carolina baptist newspaper, which isn't exactly local to the school, <a href="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_7_2003/ne071103carroll.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_7_2003/ne071103carroll.shtml" rel="nofollow">[187]</a> (this also incidentally mentions a near 5,000 volume donation to the Institute's physical library plus a second smaller one, proving from an independent reliable source that the institute does have a library). <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am starting to think that you are either not listening or severely biased. First, "multiple" means more than one. So even if there were only two, which has been false for the entire time this discussion was underway, multiple is met. But we have linked in the article and referenced here, from at least three different independent publishers four different non-trivial published works primarily about the institute. Then I pointed out that one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute. Your arguments hold no water. Plus we have <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>'s statement below that it was covered by the city paper, even though their archives aren't freely available to use it as a source.

<dd>Please try to turn down the attitude and keep your personal observations about other editors to yourself. And as for the other sources, I don't think publications like the <i>Baptist Standard</i> or the <i>Biblical Recorder</i> count, because they violate, at least in spirit, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s dictum that the source be "independent of the company or corporation itself". It's for this reason that we don't give as much weight to articles about Scientology that come from Scientologist news services. Lastly, I think the authors of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> meant "multiple" to be more than just two, because even a hot dog stand in Iowa can manage to get two puff-piece articles written about itself in some paper or other. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First there are no sources. Then the sources are "biased" baecause they're church-related. Now the sources are indeed from widely-accepted news sources, but came out too soon, before the school opened.

<dd>Yes, you did quote me saying "one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute." You apparently didn't notice the immediately prior sentence (which you need to read to understand the quoted one, because the antecededent for "those" is in the prior sentence) that says "But we have linked in the article and referenced here, from at least three different independent publishers four different non-trivial published works primarily about the institute." The bit about thirty-four is for people who don't think four is enough and are willing to look at the evidence that has been provided. I think four that meet every test in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> is enough to defeat the claim about inadequate sourcing, so I'm not going to waste my time looking at the other thirty-two.

Also, GRB as to the matter of introducing a new education methodology, the standard precedent for any other type of article (for example software) is that we only write articles after others have found the introduction of the new thing to be notable. That doesn't seem to have happened yet. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the reminder; I'll try to calm down and focus more on my for pay job. I do think those outside the Institute are already starting to see the new methodology as notable, as evidenced by some of the articles linked in the article. But my keep opinion would stand even if that methodology never caught on elsewhere, because there is more than enough independent reliable coverage, some of it from outside the region, which meets my temporary standards. Also, does your prior opinion still stand given the enhanced sourcing the article now has (significantly expanded today)? <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having independent reliable sources write articles primarily about it means that it is notable to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standard "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." This has been discussed extensively above.</dd>
<dd>In this particular use of the statement, it undercuts the argument that you could create an equivalent school out of your living room, and explains how the hypothetical AFD for your hypothetical school would not be equivalent. This is a real school, not a diploma mill. The evidence on this seems quite clear to me, even looking just at the sources already in the article, never mind the things I saw when I went looking for additional evidence. We have, between the article and this discussion, proof of staff that were college professors before they joined this Institute, a library in excess of 5,000 volumes, a founder that was formerly a college president, and multiple published articles in multiple independent reliable sources that are primarily about the Institute. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said the evidence was in the sources already in the article. But I'll copy it here for your covenience. To quote our article <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> "an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study, <i>and</i> without recognition by official accrediting bodies." (Emphasis added.) At the present they lack accreditation, as everyone knows - Wikipedia even sources the article to their statement that they aren't accredited. However, the other test for being a diploma mill is "awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study". A cursory glance at <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" rel="nofollow">their admission requirements</a> shows that they want students with the ability to do academic study. (This is most blatantly obvious for the advance studies program. <small>"For admission each applicant must submit to the Committee of Senior Fellows for Advanced Studies a research paper either previously prepared (an ungraded copy) or prepared especially for the application on a subject in the student’s chosen major field of study. This paper should be 25-35 pages in length. The paper should represent the applicant’s best quality of research and writing. The form and style should follow the 6th edition of Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. The paper will be graded in terms of form, presentation, and content to determine whether the applicant is capable of doing research and writing at an advanced level."</small> But it is visible in the admission requirements for all three levels of studies.) Since I went to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">a school where the typical course was 12 units of credit</a>, I have trouble interpreting course units as used elsewhere, but I'm sure that 48 units in 24 courses for their lowest level or 78 units for one of the second level programs (<a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> and <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a>), plus a recommendation to take half as many courses per term as one would elsewhere <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" rel="nofollow">(second to last paragraph)</a>, is not "very little or no academic study". See also second paragraph of their statement on accreditation, linked in the article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where the physical library is; I'm not in the same part of the world as the Institute. I just know that we have reliable evidence that they have it. I'd guess it is in Arlington, Texas, given that they have a center there where the professors are.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The standards for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> state that <b>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.</b>, all of which was met with the "church" sources and is more than met with the coverage added based on the items retrieved from the Google News archive. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standards were created knowing full well that any new and growing company will make efforts -- including hiring PR people, whose sole purpose is to obtain such coverage -- to get articles published in the media, the more the better. That these articles cover the subject in a neutral manner, describe teh school in the context of its "competitors" and within the current Baptist theological framework, meets the "multiple non-trivial published works" standard. That the school was covered by papers in the Dallas/Fort Worth area could be chalked up to local religious coverage that spits back the contents of a press release (I'm surprised this charge hasn't been made yet), but newspaper articles in serious papers based in Kansas City (519 miles from Arlington) and Atlanta (a whopping 800 miles away) bespeak a newsworthiness that meets the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standard, using sources that are inarguably valid per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which ergo, by definition fulfil the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standard.

<li><b>Keep</b> (edit conflict) Holy well-poisoning, Batman. Calm down, everyone. Yes, persistent school inclusionists are tiresome and yes this really isn't a school, but the issue is notability and verifiability, as JoshuaZ rightly points out (though I disagree with his ultimate conclusion). Let's look at the sources to see if they establish these. The "church sources" are articles in independent wire services or publications that appeal to Baptists; however, there is no apparent connection with the seminary itself. They are independent and seem credible to me. Also, this has been covered by major daily newspapers. The sources (and, since <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> doesn't seem to be participating in this discussion, let me be the one to point out that you have to actually read the sources) noted the controversy surrounding this organization: it was founded by four moderate Baptist professors forced out of another seminary when it was taken over by fundamentalists (who dispute the propriety of this college using the name of the other seminary's founder). The coverage in the mainstream and religious press generated by this controversy makes this subject notable. (I cannot believe my first edit after coming back from a longer-than-expected wikibreak is to keep a freaking school!) <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 02:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We need to keep cool heads here. I was ready to vote delete right away on this one, but further research bears out. By the so-called "tests" this seems non notable on face value, but deeper digging DOES turn up multiple, independent coverage. The various "tests" we apply for notability are meant to get us LOOKING for notability, but they by themselves do not mean that something fails the primary notability criterion. There is multiple coverage, it is covered in a fairly extensive way, and by independant sources (I know it's "religious" press; but then again you look for music reviews in the music press, don't you???). Just because it fails a guideline doesn't mean it is AUTOMATICALLY not notable. It means we should check it out. When one checks it out, it passes. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Strong Delete</b>. Absolutely no recent GNews Hits (so lack of recency and importance). The only article that links here is about the school's founder. Without accredidation, it's just simply not a school (any more than Catholic diaconate formation programs, which confer tons of knowledge -- and ultimately a ministry on students -- through a rigorous academic experience too). There are plenty of things that meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <s>(which this does)</s> (changed my mind, see below) that are still not notable enough to include in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First off, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a guideline, not the Bible, and not WP policy. There's a gut check about whether something is notable. 400 students? I can name thousands of high schools with more. Coverage in the Fort Worth paper? I can provide tens of thousands of articles if local news coverage is all it takes to be notable enough to be an entry in an encyclopedia. Per your comment, there's also no criteria that says that I can't use a lack of accredidation and any shred of recent coverage to help form my opinion as to whether this Institute matters beyond its own walls. Lack of accredidation means it's not a school that can confer degrees, which means that it's in essence a Bible Study group. Typically, notable organizations will have ongoing coverage <b>or</b> be historically significant. This fails both. And by the way, the Dallas News article cited is future-looking ("hopes to start classes", "will be based somewhere between Dallas and Fort Worth", etc. Both Ft. Worth newspaper articles focus on the four founders resigning their prior posts and joining this new project prior to the Institute ever teaching a class. No secular (i.e. "independent") news coverage exists after the Institute is founded, so I'm not sure that helps the article's case. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 13:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> On what basis are you claiming that the 2006 article from the news bureuae Associated Baptist Press <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" rel="nofollow">[189]</a> is not independent. There is no link between the ABP and the Institute. This independent coverage has been a source for the Wikipedia article since before this AFD began. The claim that both are Baptist is not a serious claim that they are related parties; as reading our coverage of Baptists could tell you. Baptists just aren't as organized or like minded as most other denominations are; they are splintery like the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Catholic_Churches_6706.html" title="Independent Catholic Churches">Independent Catholic Churches</a>. Per <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists_in_the_United_States_5dfd.html" title="Baptists in the United States">Baptists in the United States</a>, there are four separate major groups of Baptist denominations. The ABP self describes in part as "Working out of our Jacksonville, Fla.- based headquarters, and with bureaus in Washington and Dallas, ABP provides daily coverage of Baptist news, news from the nation's capital, and other general news and information of concern to Christians in the U.S. and around the world." <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. I understand how loosely affiliated Baptist Churches are. But the article's author, Marv Knox, is the editor of the Baptist Standard, and the article you cite by the ABP is a <b>direct copy</b> of an article printed by Knox's Baptist Standard <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" rel="nofollow">[190]</a>. Another "independent" article cited (The Biblical Recorder) is written by Mark Wingfield, who worked for the Baptist Standard directly under Marv Knox <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" rel="nofollow">[191]</a>. The third article is by Ken Camp. Camp replaced Wingfield directly under Knox at the Standard when Wingfield returned to ministry. So, although Baptist churches are very loosely affiliated, it seems all three of the authors of the four referenced articles currently work for, or worked for, the Baptist Standard (and they all worked together and know each other intimately). That's not independent. Two of the other references provided are directly from the school's web site. Okay, now deep breath... Take a look at this article <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_General_Convention_of_Texas_9a76.html" title="Baptist General Convention of Texas">Baptist General Convention of Texas</a>.

Why? Because each and every author of every single one of the articles published about the school are all part of the vast right-wing Baptist Cabal. Somehow, despite the fact that the <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram_c51a.html" title="Fort Worth Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Morning_News_212f.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Express-News_0a0d.html" title="San Antonio Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Star_9abb.html" title="Kansas City Star">Kansas City Star</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Journal-Constitution_62d1.html" title="Atlanta Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i> are all independent nationally-recognized publications, with editors and publishers looking over reporter's shoulder's, each member of the cabal was able to pull the wool over their eyes and get an article published. Send your theories to Dan Brown, it sounds like a great plot for a new book. But, other than that, it's pure unsupported original research. You'd be hard pressed to find any group of reporters covering any one industry -- Recording, Iowa Hot Dog Stands or Baptist churches -- who haven't worked together at some point in their career. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I'm sorry, I don't see any citations from the San Antonio, Kansas City, or Atlanta papers in this article. The Dallas and Ft. Worth papers are responding to a press conference covering a notable event (the abrupt resignation of four faculty members at SBTS, as below.) And I searched the papers you mentioned, and they all have articles from (only) November 2003 indicating the same information (faculty resigns, to form new institute - note future tense). <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 17:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further note</b>: Two of the three secular articles cited are from Nov 5, 2003 (Dallas &amp; Ft. Worth papers). These articles were covering a press conference <a href="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" rel="nofollow">[192]</a> on Novemeber 4, 2003 and seem to be covering the abrupt departure of the four faculty members from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary as much (or more) as covering the new school. Of course, both articles are (as mentioned above) future tense, since no such Institute existed yet. I'm not paying $2.95 to see the full text of the third article, but the only visible paragraph just repeats the information already known from the first two. Look, the Baptist Standard is the official paper of the BGCT, and all of the religious articles covering this came from the Baptist Standard or its writers. All but one of the articles was published in the Baptist Standard directly (see my citations above).

<li><b>Almost convincing</b> Where this falls apart is the link between those editors and the Institute. Yes, the Institute is named after one of the founders of the BGCT. But he was also a founder of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, from which the staff broke away. We wouldn't say that the Institute was affiliated with SWBTS because of using one of their founder's names. The argument was enough to go make me look and see if the BGCT supports the Institute. The <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" rel="nofollow">BGCT's page</a> on the schools they support does not mention this Institute. The results of a <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" rel="nofollow">search</a> at the BGCT's page don't show any sort of affiliation. They show trivial mentions a scholarshiop given to a student at the institute, a member of the Institute staff leading a tour group in the U.K, an event being taught by folks from <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_b30a.html" title="Baylor University">Baylor University</a> held in part at the site of this Institute, that the Institute is one of ninety-seven exhbitors at the 2006 convention, and one of nine schools of higher education hosting a special event at that convention. (The policies of the BGCT do allow non affiliated organizations to exhibit, I checked, and the hotel chain exhibiting is adequate evidence of that.) I also checked the Institute's web You've convinced me that a lot of the articles were written by people who know each other. You've also convinced me that those writers are the world experts on what events among Texas Baptists are newsworthy. You failed to convince me that they have any affiliation with the Institute, which is what independence is all about; see <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>. So I continue to conclude that the articles are by independent sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Last one</b> This will be my last post on this AfD discussion, simply because I'm just not that passionate about whether or not this article is ultimately deleted. I'll answer your question and then just let the facts speak for themselves. Everyone is welcome to vote for a delete or a keep. Alas, you asked for some more detail, so I'll respond this last time. Here you go... Check out the BGCT member church web site <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" rel="nofollow">[193]</a> and cross-reference it with the institute's teaching churches <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" rel="nofollow">[194]</a>. A 100% match on all 17 churches. Charles Wade, executive director of BGCT, welcomed the Institute in "...our ongoing effort to train effective Christian leaders..." <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" rel="nofollow">[195]</a>. Dr. Russell Dilday, one of the founders of the Institute was a former president of the BGCT <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" rel="nofollow">[196]</a>. This is the bottom line ... the Institute and the Baptist General Convention of Texas have the same deposit of faith. Their visions are aligned, whether or not BGCT explicitly supports the Institute or not. The Baptist Standard is an official publication of the BGCT, and as a religious newspaper it writes from a certain paradigm. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not unbiased. (If Catholics in Atlanta created a Catholic Theological Institute, the Archidiocese of Atlanta's official paper (<i>The Georgia Bulletin</i>) would cover it (so long as it was in line with Catholic teachings). I wouldn't consider that to be an independent source. Nor would I consider other Catholic publications an authoritative source to help establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So I'm just saying that the beliefs of the official voice of the BGCT and the beliefs of the Institute are 100% on target. As such, the BGCT (and therefore the Baptist Standard) have a vested interest in promoting the Institute. That's all.

<li><b>Keep</b> We are not a regulatory agency, nor are we interviewing graduates of the school as potential employees, so even if it were a giant unaccredited diploma mill, we should only look at notability, not legitimacy. This is the same principle on which we have articles about religions without having to prove the truth of their claimed miracles and the existence of their particular god. Similarly we have articles about hoaxes and pseudoscience, without certifying the truth of the claims. We are not the arbiters of truth, just of verifiable notoriety. The school has faculty formerly with the mainstream Southern Baptist seminary, who were pushed out by the fundamentalist takeover of that denomination. The school is widely mentioned in Baptist publications, has 400 students, and trains them in 15 churches.

However, for a seminary or other "vocational" type schools (perhaps, say, a school of auto mechanics) I think the rule is not always applicable - the students' prospective employers (in this case, Baptist congregrations) don't care if the school is accredited, they want someone educated by a group that they themselves trust, and who can demonstrate their knowledge of the field. So, I think we need to focus on other factors - age, size, prominent graduates, connections with established denominations, press, etc. On another point, there also seems to be a tradition of distance education in theological education - probably because prospective ministers can't afford to attend a college full-time. I agree that this makes the institutions less notable, but I don't think it should disqualify them, just because there are fraudulent institutions that use the same methods. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 20:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It needs some balancing critical viewpoints in the article as it currently exists, but "this organization espouses pseudoscience" isn't a valid reason to delete the article.

If I have broken any policies it was unintentional. As far as I am aware a meatpuppet is a user account created by a member of the public (a non-user) for the purposes of voting, informing other users the article is up for deletion is not meatpuppetry. As far as links, I do not feel I need to spend any more time on this debate as it is clear from the 26 or so wikilinks to the page and the connection to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Radin_6479.html" title="Dean Radin">Dean Radin</a> that the article fulfils inclusion standards. As user ripley mentioned pseudoscience is not grounds for deletion, so your initial reasons for nominating it are in fact dubious. I will not be commenting further as I have other areas to deal with, and I am confident that whatever other users decide will be the right decision. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 23:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia policy also points out that light use of cross-posting is part of common practice, for example there is a debate on whether to delete <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological_skepticism.html" title="Pathological skepticism">Pathological skepticism</a> presently taking place and I happened to notice that a user from that debate posted a notice on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rational_Skepticism_4cea.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism">Project Rational Skepticism</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Rational_Skepticism#Of_possible_interest" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Rational_Skepticism#Of_possible_interest" rel="nofollow">[212]</a>, without incident. I also note that the two users trying to make it seem that I have somehow broken policy are in fact often in email correspondence and have a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> interest in the outcome of this debate, so are far from neutral in the matter. This kind of behaviour towards someone acting perfectly normally within Wikipedia standards seems to me to be little more than a transparent attempt to invalidate the opinions of others in favour of an anti-parapsychology stance.

<dd>The canvassing issue is controversial and you'll get different opinions about whether it's "votestacking" or "informing."

<li><b>Comment</b>. Many people think (justifiably, in my opinion) that all secondary schools are inherently notable. You are perfectly at liberty to nominate them, but endless previous AfDs have shown that this is generally a waste of everyone's time, since they will be kept. But, as long as people continue to nominate them, considerably more people will continue to vote keep. Hopefully eventually the deletionists will realise it's futile and get bored and we can all go back to devoting our time to building an encyclopaedia (that means adding articles, not deleting them!), which is why most of us (I hope) are here in the first place. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:11, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Improving the encyclopedia means <i>refining</i> and <i>improving</i> articles more often than it means creating new ones. Once we have a stub for every secondary school in the world, what will we have accomplished? We'll have a directory of secondary schools, and the handful of articles on <i>notable</i> schools will have suffered as a result. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 00:21, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

What has the news said about him lately? Should we have an article for every person who has been on national television? 15 minutes of fame does not warrant an article.

<p>Non-notable term; Google shows the phrase "pathological skepticism" practically unheard of outside of parapsychology and UFOlogy web sites. Almost all the references in the article point back to a single article written by a sociology professor in a self-published journal, and the few that don't simply show that somebody, somewhere, once used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in print somewhere way back when.

<dd>And is "pseudoscience" also No True Scotsman fallacy, and should be deleted? Obviously not. In my opinion, this whole discussion reeks of double standard. If it's bad for "believers" to mess with the Pseudoscience entry, then it's just as bad if "skeptics" try to censor the Pseudoskepticism entry. I don't believe for one second the listed reasons for deletion. If they were true, then where are all the calls for deletion of "pathological science" and "pseudoscience," on the grounds that these other terms are inherently POV, or are nothing but no-true-scotsman fallacy, or are nothing but smear tactics? Should we delete "Creationism" because the term is inherently POV? Of course not. In fact, NONE of these terms are inherently POV, fallicious, etc., and all are useful and in use. Be honest now, and admit the actual reasons why this term needs to be hidden: Truzzi created a powerful weapon now being used by creationists and other believers, and it can be weilded as an effective rhetorical ploy to make the skeptic side of any debate look bad. This must be stopped! &#160;:) Delete it from WP! (Yet the same issue is true of the words pseudoscience and pathological science. Perhaps a Creationist group should mount an attempt to delete the Pseudoscience entry. Get a big enough group working for months, and they can do it. Heh. They won't have to work very hard, since they can just copy all the "skeptic" arguments being used on this page!) --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 10:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I consider myself to very much be a skeptic, and I defend the inclusion of this topic here. (I happen to be the ringmaster for the <a href="http://l.webring.com/hub?ring=skeptic" class="external text" title="http://l.webring.com/hub?ring=skeptic" rel="nofollow">Skeptic Ring</a> and the <a href="http://g.webring.com/hub?ring=antiquackerysite" class="external text" title="http://g.webring.com/hub?ring=antiquackerysite" rel="nofollow">Anti-Quackery Ring</a>, so I think I have a bit of understanding on the subject.) It is a real concept used in the real world, and therefore Wikipedia should cover it. I really doubt that many skeptics are totally free from occasionally giving way to pseudoskeptic tendencies. Who doesn't get a kick out of an occasional ad hominem attack on true believing idiots? (How was that for an example?....;-) Why do we love Penn and Teller's "Bullshit" program? Because we find it perfectly appropriate, in the name of humor, to make fun of our antagonists. Skepticism and pseudoskepticism abide side-by-side in many of us, and it is only our higher self that intellectually recognizes and attempts to suppress the tendency to sink to the same level as many of our antagonists, especially when involved in serious discussions (which Penn and Teller don't pretend to be doing, although they still are spot on much of the time). The same principle is involved in racism: much as we'd like to think we are totally free of racist tendencies, we actually often harbor them in one way or another. This is human nature. I still support a strong keep, but only after renaming to the much more common expression "pseudoskepticism." -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 11:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak ... whatever</b>. The article was more POV before the layer of edits that I did immediately before the AfD was initated. An article like this should not be written in a way that suggests we support the theory that there is such a thing as "pathological skepticism" or "pseudoskepticism". The claim that this is a real phenomenon is intrinsically POV. However, the claim that such a phenomenon has been <i>perceived</i> by Truzzi and that this pejorative expression has been used by Truzzi and others to label it is objectively correct. <i>If</i> the article is retained, it will need to be policed for POV, and if that doesn't work the inherently POV nature of the article will have been evidenced. For the moment, I have no clear opinion either way as to whether it should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article now cites uses of the term "pseudo-skepticism" from 1869 and 1908, and has consequently grown in size by 40% since the AfD began, and demonstrating use of the term outside of parapsychology and UFOlogy, and its notability in philosophy.

These references could be replaced with a single general reference to the paper, but we'd loose the context.

<li>Comment: Dematt raises a good philosophical point. The phenomenon described by Truzzi exists in the same way that "pseudoscience" does: a pattern that the speaker wishes to highlight by critically differentiating it from another pattern (with which another speaker has perhaps erroneously identified it). There are cases in which some people may not believe that such differentiation is meaningful or important (e.g., <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontheism.html" title="Nontheism">nontheists</a> who don't care about identifying various <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresies</a>).

<li><b>Merge and delete</b>. The POV that "certain forms of skepticism are excessive or damaging" is certainly notable and merits coverage in the article on <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a>. Conceivably, if there's too much material on that aspect to be accommodated in the <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a> article, it could be summarized there and elaborated on in a daughter article, but the latter would be something like Criticism of skepticism.

I agree that Truzzi was notable (there's been no AfD on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcello_Truzzi_a8d1.html" title="Marcello Truzzi">Marcello Truzzi</a>), but that doesn't mean that every term he discussed needs its own article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 11:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> to pseudoskepticism. Merge "abuses of skepticism" into "pseudoskepticism." <b>"practically unheard of outside of parapsychology and UFOlogy web sites."</b> No, I've heard the term commonly used among member scientists at meetings of Society for Scientific Investigation (SSE) and used in their journal, and also used in online and offline discussions of the psychology behind various science controversies. It's a useful shorthand term, same as "pathological science." In my experience, pseudoskepticism is certainly a genuine behavior-flaw analogous to pathological science (also analogous to "flamer" or "troll,") and it's not merely a smear tactic. In fact, is it not a smear tactic if someone labels "pseudoskeptic" as purely POV? Should we also delete the entry for "pathological science" because it implies bad things about certain people? "Pseudoskeptic" is just as POV as "pseudoscientist," the former being coined based on the latter. Both can be used as neutral labels, and both can be hurled as ad hominem or smear tactics during fights. If "pseudoskepticism" should be deleted because some people use it as derogation, then we must also consider deleteing "pseudoscience" and "pathological science" entries as well. And delete "flamer" and "troll" for good measure. The first step in understanding a new phenomenon or concept is to give it a name. Truzzi is not the first to notice it, but is one of the early ones naming it. Others independantly gave the same phenomenon different names currently in far less widespread use, e.g. "pathological skeptic," "scoffer," "skepto-path," and "abuse of skepticism." I've been a member of local skeptic groups and debated on both sides of "believer/skeptic" issues, and over the years I've met a significant number of people both online and off who call themselves "scientific skeptics" but who constantly fall into the misbehaviors that Truzzi points out. Pseudoskepticism is a sort of mental flaw very much similar to "flamer:" there are some people who are unrepentant shameless flamers, and some who are unrepentant shameless pseudoskeptics, and many others covering an entire spectrum. But among the population of skeptics, the habitual pseudoskeptics are certainly not in the majority, yet they certainly have a significant impact. Carl Sagan directly and repeatedly cautioned skeptic groups against pseudoskeptic behavior, but without giving a succinct label to the behavior. And CSICOP split off from JREF partly because of just these issues (today JREF is very pseudoskeptic-tolerant, seeing little wrong with laughter and ad-hominem, while CSICOP has gone far in distancing itself from such things.) Would it have been better if skeptic groups coined the term? They did. Truzzi himself is a long time skeptic, and he debunks irrational beliefs as well as aiming skepticism at Skeptic groups. The term "pseudoskepticism" had its birth in the self-criticism within the CSICOP group, and only later was it employed by Creationists during evolution flamewars, etc. And finally: just as pseudoscientists try to distort or delete portions of the WP pseudoscience entry, the pseudoskeptic fringe would love to see this entry removed. I strongly suspect that this current deletion attempt is no way innocent, and may very well be disingenuous in that the reasons listed for the deletion are not the actual reasons leading to this deletion review. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 09:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could have fooled me. The initial comment regarding <i>simply show that somebody, somewhere, once used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in print somewhere way back when</i> is making an issue of whether the term is in common contemporary use. Perhaps you personally don't see this as an issue, but others here obviously do. If the terms aren't being used in forums, journal papers, skeptic magazines, etc., then deleting the entry has no important consequenc. About Google hits: beware, since a large number of hits are simply mirrors of WP entries appearing on other sites. A better gauge of the level of usage might be to search Usenet Newsgroups at groups.google.com. About Truzzi: this WP entry started out referencing other websites and not Truzzi's paper, and was tarred with the brush of being unprofessional. Now that it references an actual publication, it's tarred with the brush of being Truzzi-centric. Damned if you do, damned if you don't (the important thing to those disliking its use is that it remain tarred, eh? Stigmatize it so it may be ridiculed and dismissed without fair consideration and without their needing to leave the political-emotional-beliefs mental state.) And shouldn't we be deleting "Cargo Cult Science" too? It's obviously just a Feynman-centric conceit and a ploy to sell Feynman books. And about SSE: the membership of that group is professional scientists. Unless things there have changed, members of the public cannot join as members, but may subscribe to the journal as "associates." The SSE is "fringe" to the extent that the group is in the business of giving fair invesigations of odd phenomena, whereas skeptic groups make the assumption (usually unspoken) that paranormal events, alien visitation, etc., aren't occurring. To a staunch disbeliever, the SSE certainly looks like a bunch of idiots --67.136.141.97 05:44, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pathological skepticism: "I am a scientist and I know the truth, so don't try to change my mind with facts," is seen in many scientific fields, not just applied to pseudoscience.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Information on him may be minimal right now, but he's still the CEO of a fortune 500 company.

<li><b>Keep</b> No mere individual has instrinsic noteworthiness. I submit that his status as the CEO of a Fortune 500 company makes him noteworthy. I could understand if it was my second cousin who runs a small local grocery store or something, but this is a CEO of a publicly-traded Fortune 500 company. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkr731_2e87.html" title="User:Berserkr731">Berserkr731</a> 02:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I wouldn't support a redirect to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autozone.html" title="Autozone">Autozone</a>. I would think that he is certainly notable enough by virtue of his position.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not every fortune 500 company CEO has their own page, and the page on Autozone itself is very small.

<p>This is a perfect example of an indiscriminate list of information, so it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Also, the guidelines in <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> recommend incorporating relevant trivia into the article rather than making a list.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> The article <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moloch.html" title="Moloch">Moloch</a> is substantially related to the historical deity while this list is a deviation <u><i>away</i></u> from that; a separate sort of thing. While popular culture references are also interesting and in some cases important in their own right, they deeply distract from the scholarly content of the original article. It was previously the one of the most frequently edited sections of the article and most of the time, the additions to this section are related to video games and monster movies. So it seemingly has a high interest area as a <i>separate concept</i>. As part of the article I agree that it may violate WP:AVTRIV, but rather than delete the items of interest to some, I felt that it would be good to give it its own list article. We have articles on all kinds of "crufty" sorts of things like video game details, so this list should not be that bad. I see no harm in having separate articles with links to each other and while I feel that both articles are improved by being separated, I think this is particularly true for the article relating to the cainanite deity. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 00:42, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are right, but my views that it is useless information may not be shared by everyone. I find it especially bad in the article, but perhaps not so bad in a separate article by itself. I do not want to deny others an opportunity to add to the knowledge base, but I also do not want to adulterate the article by keeping it there. Does that make sense? (But yeah, I think some of this is really crufty and I accept your criticisms). --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 02:10, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for the reasons Pavel Vozenilek gave. But anyone who studies popular culture (or has an interest in it) might find some use in it.
