<li><b>Keep</b>. Website is valuable resource for history of Hawthorne, California, especially of items related to surf culture, car culture, and 60's pop culture vis-a-vis notable musical HHS alums, the Beach Boys. (Viz. non-trivial ref. <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/articles/1558991.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/articles/1558991.html" rel="nofollow">Daily Breeze</a>, etc., now deleted but in Google cache). One of the most active high school-centric sites on the web, nearly a decade old, the site has 700 pages of feedback from its vibrant user community, services alums spanning five decades, and also has served a notable role in establishing and preserving landmarks within the school and the community. Alexa ranking is poor because site users generally do not fit (decidedly narrow, I must say) demographic of those using Alexa toolbar; also, many of the heaviest users are on Powerbooks. Having deletion discussion on Feb 24, George Harrison's birthday, is an additional cruel irony to those who know Hawthorne High alumna and occasional site correspondent Olivia Harrison, HHS '78, George's widow.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_mailander_da2f.html" title="User:Joseph mailander"><b><font color="#0000FF">Joseph Mailander</font></b></a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe some clarification is in order. Cougartown focuses on Hawthorne High School but it is dedicated to discussion and preservation of the history and culture of the entire region. There are many Courgartown participants from the surrounding communities that make up the greater South Bay and Airport area of Los Angeles (Inglewood, Manhattan Beach, Westchester, etc.). Many of these people worked (or their parents worked) in the aerospace/national defense industry (e.g., Boeing, Northrup, Rockwell, TRW) This site captures "oral" histories similar to those captured by Studs Terkel and other writers devoted to reconstructing history and culture from the vantage point of ordinary people. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel" rel="nofollow">Wikipeida Entry for Studs Terkel</a> The Cougartown reader is able to trace the evolution of the national and Los Angeles area media from the 1950s through the present (radio, television, etc). Events, significant and ordinary, are viewed through the prism of generations of a working class community. Literally, there is no other site on the internet that can convey this unique, generation spanning perspective. To my way of thinking, this makes Cougartown not just significant but important.

<li>It's hard to believe people put any credibility in Alexa numbers. I don't see any reference whatsoever to basing deletion on Alexa numbers in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Secondly, there's good reason for that: Alexa is incompatible with Mozilla and Safari browsers, which account for a higher percentage of traffic in certain communities. I've been actively using this site for eight years, and every time I've used it, it's had three-figure traffic that day at very minimum. I have no stake in the matter other than as a longtime user of both Wikipedia and the site in question, but this seems to me a generational thing. Because forty-, fifty-, and sixtysomething people use a site more than younger people doesn't mean the site's less valuable or even less tech-vibrant. This site's navigation and posting is made entry-level deliberately, to encourage the maximum participation across the widest swath of people, technophile and technophobe, web-sophisticate and newbie alike. It's really a remarkable environment, very unique. Aside: if you're measuring your own blog rankings by Alexa, you're blowing your time. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_mailander_da2f.html" title="User:Joseph mailander"><b><font color="#0000FF">Joseph Mailander</font></b></a>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>. As an official Alumnus of Hawthorne High , I wish to offer my opinion on the deletion of Cougartown from your encyclopedia. I strongly caution you against such an illogical &amp; hasty action. The idea of deletion brings to mind the thought of censure and other forms of social control. To delete a factual reference to an actual website suggests there is fear of truth. We are not seeking a referendum to place Cougartown on Wikipedia; someone has already established that it already exists. An attempted deletion is an attempt to re-write history, or conceal an established fact. The senior graphic illustrator/draftsman at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii regularly references Cougartown because of its powerful value as a social tool. Although he attended Pasadena High School he finds Cougartown to be an accurate and important website.<br />
<br />
Where will you draw the line in regard to "deletion"? History when studied truthfully, accurately and completely is priceless, but a watered down, whitewashed &amp; censured version of history is the product of fear. More than this is the very idea of what Wikipedia is designed and created to accomplish, the dissemination of information. To delete the reference to CougarTown in Wikipedia contradicts the core principle what it’s "founders" set out to accomplish. My I remind you that allowing someone to edit is altogether different than allowing anyone to delete! I would like to erase some things I do not like but it is far more important in this free society to equally regard opposing ideas. I have the notion that those who wish to delete Cougartown from Wikipedia may be attempting to cleanse their little cyber-world in order to create a perfect cyber-Eden. I suggest you leave well enough alone in the matter of deleting Cougartown, remember the moral of the Aesop's fable of Sour Grapes? Those wishing to delete Cougartown may simply be upset they did not attend such a "prestigious" run of the mill middle class high school that remains part of history.

<li>As JiFish has tried to explain, "importance" is in and of itself not a criterion of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As a website, this topic is subject to different inclusion metrics. The comparison to Studs Terkel (who most certainly meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) is moot, as people and websites have different standards. The three criterion are listed on that page. Please read and explain how this site meets them, and we will consider that information. Also, your assertion that <i>"importance" to "certain people" argues strongly in favor of retention</i> is false; most if not all websites listed on AfD are obviously important to some people, but whether they are encyclopedically includable (again, if they meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) is crucial. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 07:41, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: You missed the point of the reference to Studs Terkel. So let me try again: Studs Terkel revolutionized historical scholarship by writing "social history" Cougartown captures "social history" I was obviously not comparing the Cougartown website to any Studs Terkel entry as a "person" or a "website." You've taken my "assertion that <i>"importance" to "certain people" argues strongly in favor of retention</i> out of context. For your convenience, let me repeat the full context (which was in response to the "delete" vote cast by Jay who said (paraphrase) that importance to some people does not justify rentention):</li>

Thus my assertion regarding "importance" to "some people" was COMBINED with an assertion of a more generalized "importance" of the site as a unique repository of "social history" This discussion was directed to the "importance" criteria only. I am not qualified to address the other aspects of "includability" but to this admittedly uneducated point of view, it seems like several others have addressed those elements effectively.

<li>No, that's not what I am saying at all. I'll try one last time. We don't have articles about websites just because the site exists. They must meet an inclusion criteria.

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> Author is in the process of creating 40 separate articles, one for each year, regarding the New_Zealand_Music_Awards.

<li>As it happens the name is a little misleading as well. The awards were originally the Loxene awards, then the RATA awards, then the RIANZ awards, then the Tuis. The later articles should be a lot longer than one line, but keeping them is notthe best solution nonetheless. Deleteion is not a good option, since these are New Zealand's premier music industry awards. There are two reasonable possibilities here: Three options: 1) <b>Merge</b> into one long article; 2) <b>Rename</b> to cover all of New Zealand's music awards, on a year-by-year basis. Adding in the APRA silver scrolls and NEBOA Music Entertainer of the Year awards would lengthen the articles considerably; 3) <b>Rename</b> them further still to "Music in New Zealand in 19xx", allowing far more information, with timeline, awards, top singles and albums etc. Ovrall, I'd prefer option 3. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So, 40 different articles on years in new zealand music. Why only go back to 1965, then? Why not stubs reaching back to the 1800's or 1700's? Should we then have hundreds of thousands of similar articles, so that every country has one for each year reaching back for centuries? Unless there is actual significant content to put in these xxxx in New Zealand music articles, I can't see the logic in having them. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 00:10, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike>Thanks for asking, it's a common mistake to not understand what we're actually doing here. If you want the closing admin to take your recomendation into consideration, yes you must be explicit. You might, for instance, be basing you "keep" on it being the first sprite comic. Then if evidence comes up that it's not, and you don't revisit the discussion, we wouldn't know that the rational no longer applied. It takes very little extra effort to say <i>why</i> you want to keep, and far less to say "keep per foo" than to say that you won't do so.

However, you can't ignore the fact that NC is, if not the first, then at least the longest running sprite comic. When I first created the NC wiki page last May, I only wrote it as a short little history of NC (look at the archived page in the history for proof). I never intended all the bells and whistles that were added in the next 9 months. I did not ask for there to be a separate page created for cultural references. I did not ask for a wikiquote page. These were added by fans of NC, who felt like they should be part of the article. Me and <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptHayfever_007c.html" title="User:CaptHayfever">CaptHayfever</a> have been trying to clean up the page, so it will be a good median between the simple article I started with and the overblown article it had become.

<li><strike>I don't want to vote, but I have some thoughts:</strike>
<ol>
<li><strike>Being the first sprite based comic would seem to confer a certain <i>de facto</i> notability on the subject.</strike></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><strike>Can we deem something notable ourselves in this way, by looking through the internet archive and comparing dates? Is this original research? I'm not sure what I think about that, but it is a point that stands out to me. How does this mesh with the idea of direct observation?</strike></li>
<li><strike>Is it reasonable to expect that if the strip is truly notable, we would have some decent sources to inform us about it? At present we seem to have only a brief mention in a VG website article about the early history of webcomics. I am confident that, if we decided to keep this article, this would probably be one of the very least notable topics we have officially approved for inclusion on Wikipedia.</strike></li>
<li><strike>I am impressed by the commitment involved in writing the article and fighting to defend it. Sometimes, when I am on the borderline between voting to keep or delete, that will push me just slightly onto the keep side. I figure: you know, I really don't want to be wrong about this, if we have somebody here wanting to develop our content on this subject, and committed to it.

<li><strike>Mr Brenneman, it's already established verifiably and through a process very much not original research. I would hope the closing admin will take a note of that. Webcomics historian T. Campbell has cited it as the first, as has a column on a major publishing companies website. It seems redundant not to note those claims, which are verifiable and are not original research. Since those claims are citable, it is now up to those seeking to disprove those claims to cite otherwise. The burden of proof is with those disputing the sources. Any decision on those sources should be made consensually, not by a closing admin. No-one as yet has addressed those sources in great detail. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 14:48, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</strike></li>

I'm rather frustrated with the degree of histrionics that occur whenever a webcomic with a fervent fan following gets nominated for deletion, which often spills over to the wikien-l mailing list as well as discussion pages within Wikipedia itself. People, it's <i>not</i> the end of the world if this gets deleted, or kept. The AfD process makes mistakes sometimes, but the eventualist position holds that, in the long run, notable stuff will get articles and non-notable stuff will fade away, no matter what happens in the short run. There's no need to get all pouty and start screaming about how you're starting a forked site and abandoning Wikipedia... go ahead and start specialized sites on different topics if you want, but Wikipedia will stay around no matter what happens elsewhere, and bashing and sniping at it does no productive good. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 01:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</strike></li>

Likewise, the "Burning of Rom" means nothing to me. Rome? Or are we talking about ROMs? This is not encyclopedic, it is a list of things that happen in a possibly nonnotable film, and even if it were to receive the huge amount of cleanup that it demands, I seriously doubt whether the result could ever be appropriate here.

<li>What I guess that it would really need to be encyclopedic would be reactions to the film from both supporters and detractors of Jones.

<dd>Hello, I'm Alex Jones, a syndicated radio and television host based in Austin, Texas. And for many years I have been exposing the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order. And this collection of power mad megalomaniacs has been using a successive string of terrorist events to usher in their corrupt world government. A world government where populations (their own documents show) will be herded into compact cities, will be issued national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips. But in this film we are first going to look at some historical examples of tyrants and governments and oligarchies alike using crises, in many cases terrorist events that they themselves perpetrate against their population ...</dd>

<p>Judge notability for yourself. His primary claim to fame is his self-proclaimed directorship of the "Star Wars" program under "Republican and Democratic" administrations, when in fact he headed up a space defense program under Presidents Carter and Ford, prior to the proposal by President Reagan in 1983. We do not need a page for every program administrator, particularly as the program was non-notable prior to Reagan's 1983 proposal. On the basis of military service alone we also do not need a page for every person who attained the rank of O-5; there are Generals and Admirals who may not be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 03:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How would this article be expanded? The autobiographical info on the link is heavy on non-notable details "In his wife's chancel drama ministry, Dr. Bowman has portrayed Peter, John the Baptist, and Caiaphus, among others." The preponderance of information on google about him is autobiographical, and outside of a few articles quoting him or his appearances, no one has seen fit to write about him.

<li>I'm not familiar with the Eisenhower Medal, but there appears to be a prestigious one awarded by the Eisenhower Foundation, starting in 1988. I find no indication he received one from the Eisenhower Foundation. Other recipients of the Dwight Eisenhower Medal from the Eisenhower Foundation are <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Annenberg_418e.html" title="Walter Annenberg">Walter Annenberg</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_HW_Bush_9b49.html" title="George HW Bush">George HW Bush</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Shultz_369a.html" title="George Shultz">George Shultz</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>. Does Robert Bowman's resume compare in any way to the other recipients?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Most likely he received another award (e.g. Johns Hopkins has a Milton S. Eisenhower medal) but did not cite the organization that gave it.
<ul>
<li>Google for the George F. Kennan Peace Prize only turns up Bowman's own sites and articles quoting that bio (bad sign).</li>
<li>Republic Aviation Airpower Medal, I imagine, would be from the firm Republic Aviation.</li>
<li>The President's Medal of Veterans for Peace is an award from a PAC, given by the President of Veterans for Peace, not the President of the US.</li>
<li>SAME is a professional organization like ACM or ICEE</li>

<dd>He is still a recipient of the Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters, which is unusual for a professor (note. the awards do not have to be for academic achievement). Other than that he is running for congress. That is notable in and of itself. I know, I know the WP:BIO page specifies <b>holding</b> office, but it also says that the list is not exclusionary. I think that a decent article may come from this, but I agree with you that what is there now serves no encyclopedic purpose. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 05:40, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Come on, you're going in circles here. Elsewhere you claim this is a notable supporter of the 9/11_Bin_Laden_conspiracy_theory, then you claim he is notable because he is a supporter of such a theory. You want to know what he is? He's a retired Air Force administrator trying to prop up a mediocre political campaign with exaggerated claims about working on "Star Wars" and grossly inflating his awards. Claiming by ommission to have won the Eisenhower Medal when in fact he did not win the prestigious Dwight Eisenhower Medal to me constitutes borderline fraud. It's akin to the doctor in the Schiavo case claiming on his resume to be "Nobel-nominated" to try to hitch on the prestige of the Nobel when in fact the phrase "Nobel-nominated" is complete bunk (nominations are never disclosed and can be submitted by anyone)--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:22, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The other issue I have is that when I went out and independently tried to source and verify the claims in this article, I found his autobiographical site. He makes a bunch of claims there, but as Mmx1 and Cdcon have pointed out, these claims cannot be independently verified. As for running for congress, he has declared himself a candidate and anyone can do that. He doesn't even have the requisite signatures to be a primary candidate at this time. Until that has happened, IMO he is not a serious candidate.

<p>There you go, a second source that proves his notability. I am starting to get a bit cranky about seeing a whole army of people yeling "no notable" as soon as they step out of the box and question say USA did it. How is that NOT censorship?</p>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> You have mentioned two sources. Let me go over them with you:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rmbowman.com/catholic/bio97.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rmbowman.com/catholic/bio97.htm" rel="nofollow">Autobiography</a>. It is a posting from the United Catholic Church. It has roughly the same worth as the biography of the CEO of a company posted on a company's website, which is approximately zero.</li>
<li><a href="http://bowman2006.com/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://bowman2006.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Biography</a>. It is a posting by Bowman for Congress. The same rationale as above can be applied here, rendering the value to this source as approximately zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>They're ALL autobiographical. Every bio of COL Bowman online is sourced from his autobiographical page(s). Note in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> the section "Self-published sources". If I put up a page saying that I'm the Queen of England does that make it a source? My god, do you know how many Tom, Dick, and Harrys run for Congress in the US? ~500/2 year term * average 2 candidates per term. Five hundred candidates a year.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Striver has a point. When people say that somebody is not notable, sometimes I think they mean "not notable to me." I have seen articles on this list who are notable in fundamentalist Christian circles, which apparently some people think disqualifies them for notability. I have seen musicians listed because they are "not notable," even though they may be the principal player in a well-known orchestra and have several recordings. Because they are not pop singers, they are "not notable" to some people. Let's be careful. On the other hand, I would like to see the information verified. If it isn't, then the article should be highly revised or scrapped. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 11:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Mentioning the obvious motivation behind the AfD has little or nothing to do with whether or not the nominator is acting in good faith, as everyone is entitled to their own pov on what falls within the bounds of good faith.

<p>Ok, ill start again. Basicly, he is among the people holding my view of 9/11 that has the highest social status. Sure, anyone can run for congress, but not many that hold my view of 9/11 do. Also, he is a member of <a href="../../../s/9/2F/S9_11T_8864.html" title="S9/11T">S9/11T</a>. So, by deleting this guy, you are in fact shrinking some of "cabal" that hold my view of 9/11, and right now, they arent all over the place. So, based on this, i argue he is notable.</p>
<p><br />
I mean, how many other people with like him do you find that hold that view?</p>
<p>He might not be notable in the big world, but he is notable among people that hold my view of 9/11. Comments? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:41, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You see, i view my self as a representative of the people sharing my view, at least here in WP. I belive the policy you are mentioning is about not using Wikipedia to gain personaly from it, for example, selling a product one has created, or further some theory i have inveted.</p>
<p>But that is not the case. I do not try to sell anyting, or make comercial for anyting, or further any theory i have invented, neither partialy nor completly.</p>
<p>My personal interest is comparable to the personal interest a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> has in trying to keep a prominent mormon from bein excluded from wikipedia. The only argument he can offer is that the person in question is a prominen mormon.</p>

<p>Please dont delete my "Mormon". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Bowman</b> is to those of my view. Still, nobody is suggesting to delete his article. And this is not a anomaly, the rule is that people corresponding to minorities are compared to others in their own group, not to everyone else.</p>
<p>And <b>Robert M. Bowman</b> is very notable AMONG the people holding my view. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:11, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Soapboxing is <i>"something that provides an outlet for delivering opinions"</i> (Webster). You've said you want your opinions represented on Wikipedia via this article.

<li>Which conflicts with the Wiki contention that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Rosin_8b4c.html" title="Carol Rosin">Carol Rosin</a> originated the term "Star Wars". I'll pull his 1985 book from the library and see what it says. Would like an SDI expert to weigh in on who was more prominent at the time, Bowman or Rosin and where the term originated. Maybe I'm cynical, but since when did news stories plug the subject's website? Mr. Bowman has pushed a lot of propaganda about his involvement in the SDI, but he was apparently never worth a mention on the SDI nor does his ISS appear to be any more than a one-man press release machine.--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 17:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought we was quite notable in the Canberra area. He is a regular figure in the busking scene, and can be found busking daily at the major shopping centres. He's also noteworthy because he has cerebral paulsy and is quite well known Australiawide in the CP community and a number of other disability circles. In my opinion this is enough to be noteable... how many people are there worldwide with CP who derive the majority of their earnings through musical performance, writing and publishing?<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrade_d3e1.html" title="User:Frade">Frade</a> 01:59, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally nominated this article for speedy deletion as nonsense. Unsourced, I can't find any relavent Google results. At best, it's an over-done dictionary definition of a new word (as the response seems to claim). At worst, it's a general attack page. Note that I copied the creator's talk page response below.

<dd><i>Response from Talk:HOFUS</i>: "To all the hardworking Wikipedia staff who are so discriminately judging this page after a mere three minutes of its existence, please be informed that this page certainly does not discuss meaningless nonsense. The HOFUS is a rapidly-spreading term used to describe a kind of classroom problem throughout the United States as well as possibly other nations. This article gives its reader a detailed description of the HOFUS, as well as select methods with which one may rid oneself of its presence. By not reading this article, certain unfortunate individuals may not have the opportunity to learn about and rid themselves of one of the primary reasons they fear the arrival of the school bus each morning. One such encounter has happened to us, and we would regret missing the opportunity to alert the world to the presence of this nuicance. Please consider the value of this article more carefully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After looking over your criteria for patent nonsense(ie: Total nonsense - i.e. text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all. This includes things like "1`- 5bl[9 1vn]304 0=10am[0v9a1 7", where random keys of the keyboard have been pressed. Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever), it is obvious that we do not fulfill these standards at all. First of all, our writing is a completely, fully-constructed work that an intelligent human being can comprehend. Included in this article, you will find no random strings of random letters and numbers punched into the keyboard. Secondly, as we have stated in our discussion topic, the information clearly illustrates an inherent problem and is in no way confused, discombobulated, or written in an unintelligible manner. Although words such as HOFUS may seem strange at first, once you begin to accept different ideas, a piece of information that seems useless may soon become a masterpiece. A word such as fnord, for example, may at first seem like complete garbage, but your article about that term has shown there is a great well of knowledge to be found in that uncommon word (see wikipedia article on fnord). Please consider this as you edit and reconsider your descision to delete our article."</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As I placed this article and I am new to wilkipedia I feel it is unfair of me to get invloved in your process of voting. However I definately feel aggreived that other schools are listed and deemed to be more important than a Nursery. Early years education is carried out during the most informative years of any childs life and as such a high priority should be placed on it. For anyone to say it is less important and therefore non-notable is taking quite an uninformed view. Iaingm 12:43, 26 February 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm inclined to vote keep on this because schools are notable, yet this is a part of a grey area (i.e. nursery schools).

<p>This seems a vanity page. On a question for references on the talk page: no answer. More then 10 languange wiki were flooded around the same time by a few Belgian IP's with the same (translated) article.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is true that this article and the subject of the article are mostly (but not solely) the work of a single Belgian. However, that does not qualify it for deletion. Neither does any action that the author has taken on other wikis. The fact is that High Icelandic qualifies for a wikipedia article as the subject is notable and the article is balanced and well written. On the issue of notability and references you can for example see the newsgroup is.islenska <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/is.islenska/search?group=is.islenska&amp;q=h%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska&amp;qt_g=1&amp;searchnow=Search+this+group" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/is.islenska/search?group=is.islenska&amp;q=h%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska&amp;qt_g=1&amp;searchnow=Search+this+group" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> where the subject <i>Háfrónska</i> (High Icelandic in High Icelandic) and <i>High Icelandic</i> have dosens of posts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 12:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The Háfrónska movement is being watched with some interest in Iceland and many of the words they create are very interesting and would do well to replace older borrowed words. The head of the movement is a notable Icelandic priest, known for his creative use of language himself and for creating words (known as pétríska). That Braekmans seems to behave irrationally at times and not corteously shouldn't deter from the actual content of the articles, once it has been cleaned up to remove obvious bias. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalfur_f063.html" title="User:Stalfur">Stalfur</a> 16:23, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>. Before simply voting, we should notice a few oddities about all this.
<ul>
<li>First of all, in a relatively short period of time, articles have been added to the wikipedia versions in over twenty languages, all by the same person, or at least by the same small group of people.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, in all probability most (all?) of these articles have been written by Mr. Braekmans. That is not a ground for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>All these people, mostly anonymous IPs but also a few registered users (in all probability, sockpuppets), are from the same part of Belgium. Despite the fact that he/she/it/they call themself Icelandic hyperpurists, he/she/it/they seem to be able to communicate in any language except Icelandic. See <a href="../../../../is/h/%C3%A1/f/Talk%7EH%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska_156c.html" class="extiw" title="is:Talk:Háfrónska">is:Talk:Háfrónska</a> and <a href="../../../../da/h/%C3%A1/f/Diskussion%7EH%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska_31e7.html" class="extiw" title="da:Diskussion:Háfrónska">da:Diskussion:Háfrónska</a>.
<dl>
<dd>Yes it is doubtful that Mr. Braekmans speaks Icelandic. On the other hand he knows a lot about Icelandic words and their etymology and also about the history of the movement in Iceland to create new Icelandic words instead of borrowing foreign words. Of course he has taken this to a ridiculus extreme with the creation of High Icelandic and that is the impression that the article gives, of course without the use of such loaded words. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>All this creates a quite strong impression of a campaign, no, a propaganda offensive, in which several unacceptable methods are being used.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, many of his actions stink of propoganda, including his insistance to place a link to High Icelandic in the article on the Icelandic language. Still, that does not say that we should delete this article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The vast majority of messages to the Usernet group in question seems to have been written by the creator of Háfrónska himself. Quote: <i>"A loan-word in Icelandic sucks. every Icelander who accepts a loan-word in his language is a coprophiliac. He likes to swallow shit. It is about time that this is going to end. [...] Every Icelander shold stay in a camp for half a year when he is eighteen, he has to wear a device. When he pronounces a loan-word, he shouls get an electro-shock."</i> This is not exactly in line with the moderate language used on the language's homepage.
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Braekmans has repeatedly shown himself to be capable of writing very different style of text and some of his writings can be considered inappropriate. But the text in the article is appropriate and even acknowledges that Mr. Braekmans has made himself unpopular in several places with his work. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>One question I've asked at several occasions: who is the creator of this language. Well, let's look at the following apology he wrote for the words quoted above: <i>"I came home early in the morning and I was under severe influence of drugs and alcohol, I head-banged all night on black metal music and I was extremely frustrated and foamed of anger."</i> This gives me the impression that Mr. Braekmans is an angry teenager rather than a mature, professional linguist.</li>
<li>Yet, it has to be admitted that some of the arguments used by the supporter(s) do make sense. Indeed, there has been a TV programme about it, and the language seems to have been written about in the Icelandic press.
<dl>
<dd>This is the main point I am making, despite anything, Mr. Braekmans has managed to make High Icelandic noteable and therefore the article should be kept. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The supporter(s) of the language claim(s) that the language is véry well-known in Iceland, and that there are lóts of people over there who support it. If so, why are there so little Icelanders involved in these articles, and in the discussion about them? Note that even the article on wikipedia.is about this so-called "President of the High Icelandic Language Association", <a href="../../../../is/p/%C3%A9/t/P%C3%A9tur_%C3%9Eorsteinsson_11c6.html" class="extiw" title="is:Pétur_Þorsteinsson">Pétur Þorsteinsson</a>, was entered from a Belgian IP.
<dl>
<dd>It is an overstatement to say that the "language" is very vell known, but it is known. The Icelandic wikipedia is small and therefore it is not surprising that nobody other than Mr. Braekmans has written the article on Pétur Þorsteinsson but he is infact a minister in an independent congregation in Iceland which has official status.

<li>All in all, I don't have the faintest idea what we are dealing with. It could very well be a case of <b>six bored teenagers</b>: one Belgian who together with his Icelandic pen-friend created a list of Icelandic loanwords, substituted them with native equivalents, and subsequently started pushing it all over the Internet. Gosh, I could do something similar for Dutch in two days! And who knows, perhaps suddenly somebody will turn up and say: "There, you see how easy it is to stuff Wikipedia with nonsense?" But on the other hand, perhaps we are dealing with a phenomenon that is notable indeed. Who knows? I'd like to hear some input from Icelandic wikipedians before issuing a vote. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 12:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes if somebody were to do something like this and two days later write a wikipedia article about this then that article should be deleted as non notable. But since High Icelandic has been discussed both in print and TV media in Iceland it has become notable and therefore should be kept. This is my personal opinion as an Icelandic wikipedian. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm an icelandic wikipedian and personally voted for keep. It is a very interesting linguistic movement and one which icelandic linguistics have noticed, many judge it to be irrational (such as translating every name in the world) but they do admit that it contains various gold nuggets which in time might find their way into the language. That the original creator of the language is doing his best to push it forward into the limelight shouldn't be seen as deterring, the articles should be cleaned up (as was done on the icelandic entry) to remove obvious bias on his behalf (and we even had to remove several later of his edits) but the overall impression of Háfrónska is interesting and we will be keeping it. Icelanders care a lot about their language and we have committees who do wordsmithing as we are loathe to copy words from other languages (even if it does happen). --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalfur_f063.html" title="User:Stalfur">Stalfur</a> 16:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear People,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am the neologistic skáld Timbur-Helgi Hermannsson. I have indeed 'dumped' 8 articles at once on various wikipedias. I wanted to have a small version on other wikis. That has been interpreted as using wikipedia for the spread of ideas. And I can understand this argument. Many accuse me of fascism and manipulation. I am not like that at all. Read the preface of the High Icelandic language centre.</dd>
<dd>The truth about High Icelandic is that I work 14 hours a day (with Icelanders like Pétur Þorsteinsson, the president and many others) on creating killer-neologisms and I have a lot of Icelanders who support me in my neologistic endeavours. The hreintunguþingið, a forum for Icelandic language purist will come on line next month in order to speed up neologistic endaevours and the development of High Icelandic as a solid language variant</dd>
<dd>There has been an article in the newspaper DV in the early nineties (written by Sigurður Hreiðar). Ari Páll Kristinsson, a former linguistic advisor of the Icelandic broadcast service wrote a column in Tunguatak (1996?), a paper about Icelandic language use. I have done 2 radiointerviews in the late nineties, the first time with Ásgeir Eggertsson, who has been working for the, I don't remember the name, it was "Tölvuverkfræðiþjónustan", I visited the building of the Icelandic language commission at Aragata, Reykjavík twice in the 90's and had a chat with Baldur Jónsson, the president of the commission. But these records can't be found on the net. This was long before Háfrónska.</dd>
<dd>I choose the name High Icelandic in 2003, because it is the most logical name for a purer form of Icelandic (think of High Norwegian (høgnorsk) the most conservative form of Norwegian, or Tolkiens High Elfish (Sindarin).</dd>
<dd>The pictures are important because High Icelandic is also a subculture, the nýyrðaskáldshúfa, Fjallbarnið (I added the webpage of the Mountain child as a link on the English wiki page. It is under construction. It showes that High Icelandic is more than a language variant, it presented as kind of life-style, a fashion and art.</dd>
<dd>A lot of Icelanders do like my project and many Scandinavists in the world love studying the word-list.</dd>
<dd>Two Ductch wikipedians Mig de Jong and Bessel Dekker have pushed other people to remove the article based on their own aversion of the phenomenon. Mig de Jong has send a message to other wikipedias to influence the people to delete the page. Before it was decided whether or not the page should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd>Will you please stop accusing people? Nobody is "pushing" anyone, and the claim that Mig de Jong and Bessel Dekker act out of some kind of aversion against this phenomenon is merely your speculation. If you say that others try to influence voters, you're doing exactly the same thing with your statements - it's called 'discussion'. <a href="../../../x/y/b/User%7EXyboi_c5a6.html" title="User:Xyboi">Xyboi</a> 19:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only thing I ask here is: listen to the facts and make an objective, neutral judgement. Mig de Jong and Bessel Decker are pushing aside evidence (like the TV program) and the statement of Icelanders on this discussion that High ICelandic is a known phenomenon in Iceland along with reference value of the work with regard to etymology, neologistic work.

<dd>It is not completely my own invention. I compiled neologisms that have become obsolete during the last 200 years. This is almost 40% of the vocabulary. My contribution to the whole thing is maybe just 20% of all 12000 neologisms of the High Icelandic word-database. I just made a compilation of words that have existed, work of other neologists (sources added) and words created by myself during the last 15 years. When you add the pure part of the ICelandic vocabulary to these words it is called High Icelandic. So it is a compilation project based on the work of many people and has a high value as a neologistic reference work. It is noticed in Icelandic to an extent significantly enough to deserve a wikipedia entry. Maximiliaan</dd>

<p>"Killer neologism" is a term used in the following sense: It is almost impossible to create a neologism of such a quality that it will uproot an inveterate loan-word. This is called 'the blocking principle'. It is hard to break habits, especially in the spoken language. A killer neologism is a neologism of such a quality that it can break this habit. I was told about this term by some of the Icelandic neologists I'm in touch with. I don't think it can be found in terminology lists. But it expresses the phenomenon well.

<dd>The pictures are necessary to give people people a graphic example of the 4 most important symbols of the High Icelandic subculture: the Hammerflag (Þorsfrónvé), the Armoured Egg of Life (brynfjöregg), the Woman and Child of the Mountains (fjallmæðginin) and the cap of the neologistic poets (nýyrðaskáldshúfa. I disagree with the opinion that it is a vanity page, because I have clearly mentioned the fact that I'm inpopular as a person with many Icelanders because of my behaviour on usenet. Further more, the word 'one-man project is no longer appropriate. The project started out as a one-man project, but now it's a different scenario. I haven't created the High ICelandic symbolism alone. So the text 'Braekmans also created High Icelandic symbolism is wrong.

<dd>Just a little anecdote as input into this discussion, although it seems exhausted at this point: Braekmans' work looks to me like art - an art of parody of Icelandic linguistic purism, along the lines of some other recent Icelandic artists who have challenged the distinction between "art" and "real life". One should not forget that until a few years ago there was a radio program on the Icelandic state radio that specifically and categorically criticised certain developments of Icelandic as being "foreignisms" and suggested "good Icelandic" alternatives. The line between "good" and "bad" Icelandic has indeed been drawn on the basis of the concepts of "pure" and "original" words, vs. the bad foreign loan-words and loan-structures. This is also by no means a peculiarity of the Icelandic language establishment but can be seen in some other recently independent states as well - especially those that promote the idea of "one language - one nation - one state". Braekmans work (especially the images) are attempts to bring these ideas to their (absurd) logical conclusion. Also, his wordlists demonstrate how infinitely poorer and uglier Icelandic would be if it were truly devoid of loan-words. The wordlists are also, as stated here by Braekmans himself, very useful. Myself, as a contributor on the Icelandic wikipedia, have often been able to find there old Icelandic words for historical things, that are nowhere to be found elsewhere on the Internet or in modern dictionaries. Just recently I was able to retrieve there the Icelandic version of the word "carrack" (a type of ship), which I had been looking for all over the place (in specialised literature as well as in dictionaries and on the Net). It is, of course, a foreign loan-word, like most Icelandic words that have to do with ships and sailing, but Braekmans had found the specifically Icelandic version, and suggested a High Icelandic neologism for it that I would never dream of using. But... thank you Braekmans for finding this word for me. In my mind there is no doubt that these word-lists are important and impressive as Icelandic lexicographical work. I cannot, of course, judge whether High Icelandic is relevant on other wikipedias, or how it should be presented as I feel that it is intended to defy classification, but as a contributor I have found it very interesting, funny and also practically useful. -- <a href="../../../../is/a/k/i/User%7EAkigka_0192.html" class="extiw" title="is:User:Akigka">Akigka</a></dd>

<dd>Well Akigka ... as far as I read wikimedia's goal ... it is a goal to produce an encyclopedia about all human knowledge in all languages. So our endgoal is that all lemma's will have equivalents in all other languages. Will this ever happen ... no because it is to much work. But if the Iceland wikipedians judge this article to be worthy I feel that it means (because it is a subject with regards to Iceland) that it has to be placed in all language wikipedia's eventually. As the only way to make all human knowledge available to everyone is to have it in all languages! <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 23:16, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't read Icelandic papers since many years so I have no knowledge about the recent articles in newspaper. I do have the first mentionings in the press of my early work in the 90's, when the word háfrónska didn't exist and my work still qualified as a solo-project<br />
These are the only articles from that time I know about.<br /></p>
<p>- A page-long article in DV, one of the four main Icelandic newspapers (edition of Januari 30, 1999, page 51)<br /></p>
<p>- An article in Tunguatak (late 90's, I can't remember the date), a paper about language use for the people of the Radio broadcast service (Ríkisútvarpið), written by the language advisor (málfarsráðunautur) of the service, Ari Páll Kristinsson, a later president of the Icelandic language committee (Íslensk málnefnd). Ten of my neologisms were mentioned in that article.<br /></p>
<p>- In the late nineties Ásgeir Eggertsson had a interview with me on the national radio ( ríkisútvarpið) about my neologistic work. This program was called 'Samfélagið í nærmynd' (May 13, 1996). In the interview the opinion of Baldur Jónsson, the then president of the Icelandic language committee was asked about my neologistic endeavours and said that some of my neologisms were impressive. Ásgeir Eggertsson left the radio broadcasting service short time after. I don't have Baldur Jónsson's e-mail address, but here's Ásgeir's. <a href="http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13" class="external free" title="http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13" rel="nofollow">http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13</a> you can call him on this number: 003545159112</p>
<p>But I can't find the edition of tungutak anymore. Can the Icelanders on this page could help me and search the archives for me? Because some Dutch wikipedians are convinced that I'm a sockpuppet and a manipulator, the above mentioned records are but bullshit for them until evidence is presented. I will scan the DV artcle tomorrow and put it on a page. But Icelanders need to help me find the article written by Ari Páll Kristinsson. These records should shed a disambiguating light on the nature of High Icelandic. For the time being, I added the link to an article about High Icelandic in Birtir, the local paper of Akranes. I happened to find this. Maximiliaan</p>
<p>This is the article in DV, one of the four main Icelandic newspapers (edition of Januari 30, 1999, page 51) <a href="http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf" class="external free" title="http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article and this hafronska linguastic movement seem to be a kind of concept art or a joke and in Icelandic it is very witty. Not untrue but an art of parody of Icelandic linguistic purism like Akigka has noted. There has not been much media coverage about háfrónska in Iceland, I searched through the database of the main Icelandic newspaper and found no occurences of this word. The websites of the movement are like parodies or art and make totally no sense to me but many other movements are the same - strange and unlogical. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvor_b62b.html" title="User:Salvor">Salvör</a> 03:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Madam, the High Icelandic Language Movement is a srious movement. No humour or jokes, but serious neologistic work. Everything that is pronouncable with human sounds must be translated in Icelandic: 50 million place-names on earth, millions of names of organic compounds, all personal names of 6 billion people. With the aid of artificial intelligence this job can be done in one day and low cost by 2070. Now it is still an absurd project in the eyes of most Icelanders. Paying a team of 1000 toponymologists appointed by the ministery of culture would mean that taxes would have to be raised in Iceland. Icelanders would never accept this. So it is up to the High Icelandic language movement to lay the foundations for these projects now so that the first computer expert systems can easily built further on our lists. We have started the fjörgynjaráætlunin, the translation of the earth's place-names into Icelandic. At the end of March the first part of a list with the place-names of Britain (a 5000 names), names from A to E will be published on the net along with information about the etymology of the English place-names and the choice of the Icelandic equivalents.

<dd>Ahoy. This evening I mentioned this debate to a couple of coleagues of mine, who notified me that a certain Icelandic radio show holds regular vocabulary competitions, in which there are typicly five or so words mentioned that people are asked to define; according to my sources said radio show has during recent months had one or two words from Háfrónska per week, which I'd say is a definite reason for there to exist such an article on Wikipedia. Like it or not, Icelandic vocabulary is taking a few words from Jozef Braekmans invention - heck, I even use a few myself. --<a href="../../../s/p/m/User%7ESpm_3fa8.html" title="User:Spm">Smári McCarthy</a> 00:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Retain</b> This is a most interesting and well researched article on the varied phases of the life of a centenarian who clearly influenced so many people, particularly through his action in the First World War and as a teacher of rare quality who is still remembered favourably on the Harrow County website by so many of his former pupils who are still alive today. It would be nice if the article stimulated further detail on the award of his Military Cross of which he appears to have been so reticent to speak to his pupils in later years. Philip J. Levi.</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> , Original research, vanity page, nonsense, false, take your pick - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonLyall_811c.html" title="User:SimonLyall">SimonLyall</a> 11:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article does provide a more insightful representation of what bluffing entails, perhaps the 'coining by Yazza' part could be removed but the examples allowed to remain.</p>
<p>Although there isn't perhaps a major difference between bluffing in this context and in the more familiar context of playing cards, there is a subtle difference between the two and the article makes it clear that this type of bluffing, to use the author's wording, is not quite the same as the more familiar term. The article could be a fake; however there is no real evidence for that. According to the article, the term has only recently come into use and it would take time for it to be widely accepted and even widely heard about. As a local article it might not fit the criteria necessary but if it does extend more widely than that, even if it isn't well-known, it should perhaps remain. It is at any rate an extension on the term bluffing and that is what wikipedia is about: extending people's understanding of a word or topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not a vanity page, nonsense, false and i'm not sure what you mean by original research. The name was included merely for background knowledge as names are often included on wikipedia articles, <i>where relevant</i>, and here I would have thought that applied; however it is open for debate. I myself know of several people across the country who understand bluffing in this context so don't consider the article of local interest only as has been postulated. Equally, because the term is known <i>across the country</i> it can hardly be a nonsense page or false, surely! - Miniyazz 17:39, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I work in the legal profession in Montreal and I can assure you that Mr. Zamprelli is a well-known and well respected lawyer in that community. While it is true that there aren't really any hits for him on google, that's because most of his work is recounted in small trade journals or word of mouth. Still, I feel that there is a certain bias on wikipedia towards including people who are "famous" in the sense that they have lots of links on the internet. It's not like Mr. Zamprelli's stub is taking up a lot of bandwidth. Leave it up. By the way, the legal precedent he set was not reported in an official reporter, though it was widely talked about in the legal profession... many important canadian legal judgements are never formally reported.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. To the anon who posted the comment: content on Wikipedia is required to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, i.e. published in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 16:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unless verifable independent sources can be provided. Saying that <i>important</i> legal judgments are often not formally reported sounds <i>very</i> dubious too, if it's so important, wouldn't there be some verifyable records? If some links to independent news articles, or on this precedent were brought to light, or citation in a legitimate legal archive were provided it would be highly relevant. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 04:43, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, this article looks like a good candidate for deletion. We aren't given a reason to care about the group, other than as advertising copy. It's potentially a speedy delete as an article about a group which doesn't assert notability, but there <i>is</i> arguably such an assertion there, and that's not why you argued for deletion anyway. By the way, I note that your speedy argument was <i>better</i> than your AfD argument.

<p><b>Delete</b> Star Wars cruft. Obviously some work has gone into this and I feel a touch guilty but this doesn't belong. It's a meandering series of thoughts and comparative observations on a person that doesn't exist. "Certain of his superiority and merit, Palpatine lost no sleep over various massacres"; "Needless to say, all these facades merely masked Palpatine's ultimate goal: eternal life and power"; and later "Palpatine wrote extensively on political theory, military strategy, publishing them to considerable acclaim and circulation. Few realized that these writings would prove to be a roadmap which Palpatine himself would follow to gain and maintain his empire (in an eery parallel to the scant heed paid Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf)." Uh, no. I particularly dislike the precedent of "...as a ruler." I suppose I could live with "Churchill as a tactician" but in terms of fan-cruft it's just not encyclopedic. The main article on <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> may absorb some of this but it's already 66k. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize if my def of fancruft is overbroad. And I do realize the page has many cites. But "official canon material" on any fictional topic does not in itself accord notability. Palpatine is not a person. This level of detail would be questionable for any subject. This page consists in large part of derivative observations on a movie character. If the main article can't accomodate this then you may have to consider whether it belongs at all. We have 66k on Palpatine to begin with. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The three pages on the two people named Roy Gardner had got very confused. The text on <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_092b.html" title="Roy Gardner">Roy Gardner</a> was quite extensive and referred to the 1930s mail train robber; the text on <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_%28bank_robber%29_5501.html" title="Roy Gardner (bank robber)">Roy Gardner (bank robber)</a> was very short (a single paragraph) with a 'merge' tag dating from June 2005; there is also <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_%28football_chairman%29_8edb.html" title="Roy Gardner (football chairman)">Roy Gardner (football chairman)</a>. I suggest one of two actions; EITHER, delete <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_092b.html" title="Roy Gardner">Roy Gardner</a>, and put an 'about' tag on <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_%28football_chairman%29_8edb.html" title="Roy Gardner (football chairman)">Roy Gardner (football chairman)</a> OR Move the text on <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_%28bank_robber%29_5501.html" title="Roy Gardner (bank robber)">Roy Gardner (bank robber)</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_092b.html" title="Roy Gardner">Roy Gardner</a> and change <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gardner_%28bank_robber%29_5501.html" title="Roy Gardner (bank robber)">Roy Gardner (bank robber)</a> to a redirect.

<li>Even so, Uncle Jemima still merits his own article. Links to other SNL skits are included, as well as other information about his life. The article is detailed and accurate, and thus <b>should not be deleted</b>. I'm glad to see that people are using Google to determine Uncle Jemima's popularity. I think a better way would be taking a poll of members, rather than basing your false assumption on the number of websites devoted to Uncle Jemima.

<dd>If I may interject some (hopefully) constructive criticism, the article as you had originally written it did not make any mention that this was an SNL character and seemed to try to pass the character off as a real person, making it appear to be a blatant hoax.

What is claimed as "published works" are articles about acting posted on his own website or as paid advertisments in other websites. Google searches only bring up WP mirrors, or commercial listings to his acting schoool but no third-party sources that speak to his notability. He does have an occasional column in a popular casting website, but I don't think this counts as notable enough.

<li><b>Delete</b> For all the reasons you listed here. Mr. Bennett is not an important acting teacher in the New York acting scene. His school has existed just a little over a year. He is well know on acting message boards and websites for his aggressive, and sometimes disruptive, Internet marketing style but for little else. Perhaps he will someday be a notable in the New York acting scene but he has not earned that distinction yet. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 17:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I've stated elsewhere, Tree Trimer joined Wikipedia to try and stop Jason Bennett's work from being included in any page about acting. He is currently removing any reference to Jason Bennett, over and over again, calling it "advertising," even though comments about Jason Bennett and/or his school are often found among lists of many schools on Wikipedia pages, or among lists of many teachers whose work is being discussed in those pages. Tree Trimer is also urging other Wikipedia users to "vote for deletion," for example, Tree Trimer wrote on someone's user page: "Hello, I am a New York actor...Jason Bennett does not belong in the lists with famous actors and acting teachers.... Would you please go to his page (Jason Bennett) and vote for deletion? Thank you. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 07:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)" Tree Trimer is not interested in Wikipedia. He is interested only in trying to stop a colleague or former teacher of his: Jason Bennett. Think the book 1984. Remove the content you don't like, and hope the person goes away. If you doubt that Jason Bennett is well known in the professional acting community, all you have to is look at the testimonials on his web site of Broadway actors and Tony-nominated directors. Even Tree Trimer admits he knows who Jason Bennett is, that's the whole reason he came on Wikipedia. His whole campaign is an acknowledgement of the importance of Jason Bennett, he just doesn't like him. Sgactorny 13:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is not appropriate for you to put Jason Bennett's name among acting greats, and I am removing your ads. Both are true yet they are not evidence that you should be on Wikipedia. Even if the website testimonials that Jason Bennett is a great guy are true, that does not put Bennett up in the ranks of Konstantin Stanislavski, Lee Strasberg, Uta Hagen, Stella Adler, Eric Morris, Michael Chekhov, and Sanford Meisner. People seeking information about acting should not be deceived. I left a message for Whatcape because he commented on the inapproprateness of your insertions before I did. Check Whatcape's talk page. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Trimer_c911.html" title="User:Tree Trimer">Tree Trimer</a> 14:27, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> He isn't deleting "ads." He's deleting objective statements about Bennett's work. Calling them "ads" is just double-speak. Anything that mentions Bennett is an "ad" to him. The accusation that I'm Jason Bennett shows everyone just how personal this person's campaign is. Also, Whatcape inserted "Laura Esterman" and "Susan Batson" into pages. Are you on a campaign against them? How about Eric Morris? How about the Atlantic Theater School? Any others? Or is your campaign only limited to Jason Bennett? My point is rhetorical, there are many schools, books, articles and teachers listed on all the pages you keep singularly deleting Bennett from. It's like Orwell's "1984."

<li><b>Keep</b> The reasons listed here are incorrect or personal attacks by Tree Trimer communicated to Marcuse in talk pages. Tree Trimer does not want Bennett's views about acting seen by Wikipedia readers. Tree Trimer signed up on Wikipedia just to try and get rid of Jason Bennett's page, look at his history. He is perhaps a former student or a competing acting teacher. Bennett's school has existed for many years, not one, and Bennett himself has been teaching for over 12 years. Tree Trimer himself created the controversy on that other web site, then came on here and pretended a controversy existed that actually doesn't. If you click the above link, put there by Marcuse to reference that conflict originally created by Tree Trimer, you will see that Backstage (the nation's largest acting industry weekly), which supports Bennett's work and has profiled his school, has removed the libelous posts from their web site. I am the person who made the page for Bennett, because I am a working actor in New York. Most everyone I work with and know knows and respects his work in the professional acting community in New York. If you look on his testimonials page, you will see endorsements from Tony-nominated directors, psychologists from around the world, and all kinds of professional actrs. Just reading his biography is a powerful testament of the work he does. The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, one of the schools he went, is the best musical theater school in the country. Eric Morris is a Master Acting Teacher who trained Jason Bennett. Bennett's extends his legacy with his work, as well as the legacies of the other Master teachers whose pages he was linked to in the "see also" and "External links" section. That's why I put his work there, to educate the readers because it's perfectly appropriate and correct. Nothing I wrote ever said Jason Bennett was the best around, or anything like that. I wrote facts about him. Readers deserve to read the facts about Bennett. Bennett has had articles on Playbill.com, a major web site for performers across the country; in "The Soul of the American Actor," a national newspaper devoted to actors; on NYCastings.com, a web site that distrubutes his articles to 15,000 actors and performers every two weeks. Backstage.com has profiled his school and faculty numerous times. Bennett's faculty is composed of five famous teachers, one of which is a professor at New York University, one of which is on the board of one of the most famous dance companies in the world, one of whom has been teaching actors in Los Angeles for over 30 years, one of whom has been trained by many well-known New York acting teachers, and the other is a well-respected Master Voice teacher. Bennett's web site is listed on web sites of prominent acting schools all over the country. A school devoted to former Master teachers Lee Strasberg and Michael Chekhov both point to Bennett's work and his school. It is a personal mission of Tree Trimer to censor Bennett's page. That's all he came on here to do, and that's what he's doing. We shouldn't go along with it. Sgactorny 20:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is by the original author of the Bennett article. As far as I can tell he is the only one who attests to Bennett's notability but has not been able to provide external references. I cannot judge his claims since I am not an actor, however I have not found any third-part material about Bennett, that was not written by Bennett himself. I have also not found any material by Bennett that is not a paid advertisment except for the column in the castings website. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 22:30, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it looks like advertising to me. I can't see any difference between his acting school and any others that we might, but should not, advertise here. Furthermore there is a huge copyright violation with the entire "Professional experience" section being cut and pasted from <a href="http://www.jbactors.com/actingcoachesnewyork/jasonbennett.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jbactors.com/actingcoachesnewyork/jasonbennett.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, which states at the bottom of the page that "all content is C. of the Jason Bennett Actor's Workshop".

<li><b>KEEP</b>, don't merge/redirect: All information is relevant, notable, and encyclopedic. Who says what is and why can't you people realize this information is? Learn to think relatively. You acknowledge EEP but only a few acronyms. Why? <b>ALL</b> acronyms are valid; if one company/organization is listed, all should be--whether or not they have a Wikipedia article. The "Wild Eep!" Apple Macintosh system sound is public domain (I don't see Apple taking down <a href="http://sagefire.org/C1009907506/E1311212715/" class="external text" title="http://sagefire.org/C1009907506/E1311212715/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> which provides many classic Mac OS sounds and which many Mac software websites link to). The "funny web page" link relates to the sound's history which IS silly but still applies to the history of the "Eep", as it refers to the sound. <a href="http://mac.wikicities.com/wiki/Wild_Eep" class="external text" title="http://mac.wikicities.com/wiki/Wild_Eep" rel="nofollow">WikiMac</a> also acknolwedges this and other links I added to THIS Wiki's page... The "weird song" link is about the sound too and demonstrates the quirkiness of the sound and what some people think of it--enough to compose music to it! The link to the Road Runner is valid, too, since both sounds are similar, are expressions/interjections, and I think makes for an interesting comparison/relation. While I'll budge on the Albanian "shqip" pronunciation, drinking game sound, and even the Google "eep" search link (I was simply being concise), I <b>DO</b> believe the Star Control II Yehat Veep-Neep clan is valid. Why does it include "eep"? Is it because it sounds like a bird (which is what the Yehat race is)? The reference IS encyclopedic even if you people can't (or won't attempt to) understand why.</li>

<dd>Ha! "Community" my ass--more like LYNCHMOB. The "community" that voted to delete the page was short-sighted, narrow-minded, and ineptly lacking in relativistic critical thinking. The Wikipedia IS a compendium of information found interesting or encylopedic and, guess what? EACH AND EVERY SINGLE WIKIPEDIA PAGE WAS CREATED BY A <b>SINGLE</b> PERSON WHO FOUND THE INFORMATION INTERESTING AND ENCYCLOPEDIC. What is interesting and encylopedic to one person may not be to another person. The Wikipedia is big enough that it can have a LOT of information not all will agree on being interesting/encylopedic. It's called information diversity. When would you like to start thinking relatively, Mark et al? Why don't you get over your little crusade here and go back to your <a href="../../../t/l/a/TLA_0bd4.html" title="TLA">TLA</a> page (which is ALSO a page YOU find interesting and encylopedic--oops).

<li>The "popular culture" section is extreme trivia, and should simply be deleted.</li>
<li>The article title itself should be redirected to <a href="../../../e/e/p/EEP_7bab.html" title="EEP">EEP</a> or changed into a disambiguation page.</li>

Note that LiteratePrograms does not use the GFDL and so we can't transwiki there. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 18:50, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to wikisource or wikibooks. We should come up with an explicit policy for where to send useful source code which has reference value. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 18:14, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>WikiSource has an explicit "no original writings" policy, which makes it inappropriate for most of the source code proposed for deletion from Wikipedia. So I think WikiBooks is the only appropriate place for it to go. See <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:What_is_Wikisource%3F" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Wikisource:What_is_Wikisource?">Wikisource:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?</a> for relevant discussion, including whether material should to go WikiSource or WikiBooks. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">bmills</a> 18:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>WS explicity takes source code in the public domain or under the GFDL (as WP's articles are licensed under). Other source code has been transwikied there (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transwiki:99_Bottles_of_Beer_computer_program" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Transwiki:99_Bottles_of_Beer_computer_program">WikiSource:Transwiki:99_Bottles_of_Beer_computer_program</a>). I'm not satisfied that source code fits (or was intended to fit) under the "original writings" exception at WS. As I said, there is a discussion to be had here, but I don't think AfD is the ideal place to hold it. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 19:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also see <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Source_code" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Source_code">WikiSource:Source_code</a>. They actually request an entry on these sorting implementations (though they also request Quicksort, which didn't get transwikied to WS). --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 19:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Since when was notability a requirement for Wikipedia entries, or number of articles? Here's notability for you, he's been a powerful influence in the US due to his fight against what he calls "harmful influences". It's rather difficult to condense his past actions into a single article, because he's done so many varied things, from threatening newspapers, to suing companies, law firms, politicians, and court officials, to getting kicked off court cases, banned from websites, and various other things. The sub-articles are an attempt to shorten the main page, while still providing insight into his many different activities. If you want to help shorten and condense them, fine, but I object to you deciding that any articles connected to him are "not notable" and worthy of deletion.

<dd>I disagree. How do you know how <i>Strickland vs. Sony</i> related to his investigation by the Florida Bar if you have no idea what happened in the case? Or his video game proposal, how do you make it NPOV without showing the proposal, and his reaction to those who tried to satisfy it? The problem we're facing is that Thompson has done so many diverse things, and yet it's very hard to summarize all of it while being NPOV. You almost have to let his actions speak for themselves. The other problem is that we were trying to make the main page shorter and easier to read, while still allowing detail about specific actions. So we could either have a TOC that was longer than most articles, due to the amount of sub-headers, or we could try to break up the article into sub-articles. How do you put in titles that don't show up in the TOC? AFAIK, you can't, so the only way to clean it up is to either remove the titles, and make it harder to read, or put the top header in the article, and the sub-info in a seperate article.

<dd>Please see my comments above about the problems we're facing, namely article length. This is the reason the sub-articles were created in the first place... Jabrwock 20:03, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You don't have to include a lot of the information, because several sections deal with relatively minor cases involving Thompson. You can, instead, include only the most important cases Thompson has been involved in, and also include external links to other sites that contain more detailed information about the minor cases he has been involved in. That's one reason why many articles include an External Links section. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 20:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The major problem is that all the information is spread across many different websites. The current set of info spans over 170 links. So how do we condense it all into a few sites so that we can shorten the wiki entry without loosing all the gathered info? Isn't that what the wiki entry is for? You see what our problem is. We almost need a sub-website to gather all this info together, so we can summarize the important stuff. Jabrwock 20:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any way we could make a "research collection" page so that we can keep track of everything (major and minor), and then summarize the important bits on the main page. Because it's really hard to keep track of everything he's done, it's so spread out all over the place. Jabrwock 20:38, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think you're right about needing some sort of research collection page. I see that you are passionate about this subject. You can make a personal webpage about it, and link the WP article up to your site. The articles in question go into too much detail (imagine if every U.S. Supreme Court case article had an entire transcript included in it) and should be posted elsewhere on the internet. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 22:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Could we use something like the talk page instead of a seperate website? Just so that everyone can keep contributing as events happen, but only after they are deemed "important events" will they be added to the entry itself. Essentially like the talk page, only organized. Jabrwock 22:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> all the articles for now. We can't merge all the articles at the moment; the original one was too long when it was one article. I agree a lot of it may be excessive detail, but not if we're splitting it into separate articles like we did. I brought this up before (that the article went into a lot of detail). But many other articles go into a lot of detail too. If we end up merging, we'll have to summarize what we have (which would be more ideal).

<li>"Keep" I think that the Flowers for Jack article, especially, needs to be kept. There is no such thing as too much information, and regardless of how well known or esoteric the content is, it has a right to be posted. I for one know that Wikipedia was the source that got me far more interested in the video gamin questions being posed right now, and I see no reason why any of these articles should be deleted. In fact, I question the reasoning behind the nomination for deletion. Just because you haven't heard of the pre-martial sex rituals of a South Pacific group of natives, does that mean that there doesn't deserve to be an article on it?</li>

<li><b>Relist separately</b> - Some of the articles there are unencyclopedic Jack Thompson fetishisation, like the one detailing his livejournal exploits, but there's some decent stuff there. And the non-event of the Computer games Jack Robida article? The press said that they weren't going to cover this angle because it didn't exist, Wikipedia shouldn't either.

<dd>The Robida sub-article wasn't actually focusing on the game angle, which turned out to be a non-event. It focuses on Jack's behavior after the police &amp; news refused to acknowledge the non-existent game angle. He was trying to get the DA arrested for "impersonating a police officer", and was threatening the newspaper with legal action... I do believe it could be trimmed down, but I think it's still an event worth noting, simply because of the lengths he went to try to make the game angle the centre of attention.

<li>I know I just jumped on somebody for this a day or two ago, but please remember that AfD is a discussion, not a vote. You need to give a reason for your opinion, and "per nom" isn't one in this case, because all I said was that it was an insurance company that had been prodded. Are you implying that being an insurance company means it has to be deleted, or that being prodded means it should be deleted? Because either way, your argument so far is pretty unpersuasive. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 11:36, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good Lord, man. <i>At most this article has to be modified, but certainly not deleted.</i> A really simple search on the Net from the comfort of your own computer chair will show <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a>'s high Alexa rating, and the print publications in which it's been featured. Not that the Alexa rating is all-telling in itself, but given the number of times I've seen it used as proof of a site's non-notability recently, I think it's worth mentioning. If you want to show notability, <i>first say the article needs it, but don't assume it's non-notable simply because you haven't heard of it personally and the evidence isn't immediately apparent on the single page you're reading.</i></dd>
<dd>Can you please stop calling for an article's deletion before you've done basic research on it? Can anyone reading this with more Wikipedia experience than myself tell me if there's any way I can highlight this user's behavior on this front, as a warning to other AfDs in which he is involved?</dd>
<dd><b>Comment to future admin</b>: due to the site's popularity, I fear an influx of just the sort of bad "keep" votes one usually gets for a popular website.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The articles referenced above are all print and therefore unlinkable (though I have physical copies and scans of all -- I still don't know the protocol for referencing print articles that don't otherwise exist on the internet). PCGamer UK - March '06 issue, 3/4 page article, Computer Gaming World -- January '06 Issue, 3/4 Page Article, PCZone - January '06 Issue, sidebar. Other possible reasons for considering Concerned notable -- it's the first and only, to my knowledge, Garry's Mod-created comic to reach and surpass 100 comics. Though, I imagine it's really a matter of opinion whether that is truly notable.--<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">Notmydesk</a> 22:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whups, sorry, forgot some details. The article in CGW included two three-panel Concerned comics made exclusively for the magazine, and included the first sixty comics on their coverdisc for the January issue. The coverdisc for the March Issue of PCGamer UK included the first 100 Concerned comics.</dd>

<li><b>Improve Notability or Delete.</b> I'm looking around for some measure of notability. I found one: <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" rel="nofollow">thewebcomiclist</a> has a viewership ranking, and Concerned ranks 258th. Seems NN to me. Since Concerned is primarily a webcomic, comparing it to something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondocks_9b6d.html" title="The Boondocks">The Boondocks</a> (which ranks 168th on this list) would be irrelevant as Boondocks is paper-based, and only recently adapted to the web. On the other hand, I think this article would be a great addition to <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a>. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcon_c4ed.html" title="User:Cdcon"><font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>&#160;Cdcon&#160;</b></font></a> 23:49, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Out of 5752 comics, I'd say that 258th is a respectable ranking, especially for a strip less than a year old. I can't find the methodology used to generate that list, though. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 23:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The measurement used by that site is a measurement of how many people click through to the comic in question via that particular web page. I don't think it has any more significance than those "Top 100 Sites" pages that people nominate themselves to and have a click war. At any rate, it's immaterial. The site clearly qualifies under criterion 1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Lore Sjoberg 00:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may be right, on the other hand, we would benefit from having something more tangible. All in all, aside from the hlcomics forums, you'd be hard-pressed to find information on this comic.

<li>I don't understand the significance. Why would whether an article would be good for Comixpedia affect whether a site is notable?

<li>It doesn't. I made the suggestion so that it would be absolutely clear where I feel this article (which I had previously argued would be unsuitable for wikipedia) should eventually go.

<li>I saw that prior to writing the response. I'm not convinced that two 3/4 page articles and a sidebar are non-trivial.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>annoyed</b>. When you say to merge to an article, will you please make sure the article exists?! This is articles for deletion, not "articles I think the closing admin should make but I don't care about nearly enough to make the article myself and then recommend a merge there afterwards". So I'm not going to make the article. Reading the debate and observing the near-total lack of support for outright retention, I'm going to delete 4DL and leave Beatnik and HQ9+ alone.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO RESULT</b>. This is such a mashing together of multiple articles that each plainly warrant their own discussions that it is impossible to use this debate to produce a meaningful result on any of them. Most of the comments do not deal with more than one or two of the articles, and few deal with the same as other comments. The only one that is often referred to is Ook!, which appears to be a keeper. I think a better formulated set of AfDs are needed if deletion is really warranted for these. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Keep COW". - M. Williams - This programming language is part of an important collection of esoteric programming languages. I am a teacher and use COW (amongst other things) to demonstrate the principles of programming to my students - beyond just how to program but to explain to them that they truly need to understand the concepts of programming. COW is even better than BF for this as the instructions in COW bear no relation to the tasks they perform. Students ahve to decide what they want to do and then go away and figure out how to do it and then work out how to express that in COW. I don't care about the Sean Heber article, but the COW article should stay. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 82.10.197.188 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.10.197.188_58dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.10.197.188">contribs</a>) 15:56, March 2, 2006.</small></li>

<li><b>Not Fair at all</b> I guess Wikipedia rules are best understood by those who drafted them.

<li><b>Not a valid reason for delete</b> What does constitute as encyclopedic. Does the advertisement above on Kosmix (which is in alpha stage) constitute as encyclopedic? I can give many more such examples
<ul>
<li>Nobody said that every other article in here is okay. That's like saying one criminal shouldn't get locked up simply because another went free. If you would like to propose the other article for deletion, you have that ability. It's silly to accuse them of paying to put it here--anyone can edit articles, and there's plenty of bad ones that just haven't been deleted yet. Alternative to internet is being discussed for deletion because it is not encyclopedic, it draws on your own conclusions and stuff. If you're not disagreeing with that, then you're not opposing the deletion based on pre-existing standards, but instead just your feelings.

<p><b>Delete</b> Non-encyclopedic. Author deleted all citation-needed tags, so I reinserted them. Article tries to define acronym but reference sources are a school parody and chat room banter. No reliable sources provided that actually use the term 'm7'. Slippery slope: accepting this wiki "informal" definition opens door to endless stream of rumor-mill vanity definitions such as "E6 (economics schools)", "Magnificent 11 (business school)", "F9 (fashion schools)", etc. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 17:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, disambiguate and categorize</b> M7 appears to be a legitimate shorthand term for the 7 largest business schools, used in ranking and recruiting, as in "Did you graduate from one of the M7?" Compare to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Four_auditors_7890.html" title="Big Four auditors">Big Four auditors</a>. At this point there is nothing useful or extra in the article except the names of the schools. Recommend creating a category "M7 business schools" and linking to each of the schools, and adding M7 business schools to the M7 disambiguation page (giving a brief definition and linking to the seven individual schools). Then delete this page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:33, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Recommend against Thatcher131's new suggestion above to create a "7 largest business schools" category and add new school links, and against the related suggestion to add a new link to the M7 disambig page. (See "slippery slope" discussion in nom.) Also disagree with Thatcher131's contention that m7 appears to be a "legitimate" term - those aren't even the 7 largest business schools nor the highest ranked (Dartmouth's business school is ranked higher than several of them). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 23:16, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Save</b> The term M7 is used by publications such as the 'Economist' to discuss these schools. There have been in the past M7 career forums. While its not as prevalent a term as say, Ivy League, it is a fairly well known concept for those at these schools, and for those that recruit from them. It rather should be cleaned up along the lines of <a href="../../../t/1/4/T14.html" title="T14">T14</a> for law schools.</p>

<li>Response to wunschha's assertion that a Google search gives "130,000 results": That's just totally abusive to this process. A Google search on "m7 business schools" gives less than 80 results, virtually all of which appear to be copycat entries on shaky-looking advertising websites. What the anonymous voter (who voted Save above) refers to as a "fairly well known concept" seems anything but, according to Google search results. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 16:54, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Searching for "m7 business schools" is unneccassarily restrictive as the term "m7" doesn't appear before the term "business schools" all that often. Searching for [m7 "business school" -wikipedia] gives me 12,100 hits, including businessweek.com, answers.com, and ivyedge.com. It's difficult to restrict those to cases where M7 refers to the idea we are discussing here as it's somewhat generic, but it does appear in this usage on a number of sites I looked at. I think the better idea is to keep and expand possible, though I'm not strong in either direction. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreznor_d894.html" title="User:Treznor">Treznor</a> 03:48, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Response to Treznor's assertion that a Google search gives "12,100 hits, including businessweek.com, answers.com, and ivyedge.com." To reiterate, virtually all of those "hits" appear to be copycat entries on shaky-looking advertising websites. As for the Businessweek.com "hit," the mention of the term is not in an actual Business Week article, it's in a chat room post from an anonymous person. The Answers.com "hit" is just a carbon copy of this Wikipedia article. The Ivyedge.com site is an admissions advice site that appears to be legitimate. So maybe we can agree there is one legitimate Google "hit" here .... not 130,000 or even 12,100. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 19:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - They are hardly an important part of American consumer culture. A abandoned mall is either a nostalgic memory for some or tax-eating real-estate for others. The story behind why a particular mall has been abandoned in a given community is far more important and telling to local history than the mall itself. Thus abandoned malls may be considered important part of local consumer culture but not national or even international culture. Further, the term "dead" should be replaced. Mall are not living beings and therefore cannot die. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 13:46, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Non-notable article. an open classroom can be a lot of things. I hardly think that this article sets the definition for the phrase or that the phrase is a popularly used one. Rather, it seems that the phrase is one used only by a small community of individuals. The article seems pointless as the idea of an "open classroom" is open to interpretation.

<li><b>Keep</b> The open classroom was a very specific organizational concept in the '70s.

<dd>We don't put redirects in categories, and when I look at Britannica's index <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/index" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/index" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>, it seems pretty nicely annotated to me. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:42, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're searching by category, redirects are unnecessary (the redirect target should be there anyway); if you're searching by name, redirects are automatic (and categories are more or less unnecessary — all you need are disambig tags). The annotations in the Britannica index are precisely those two forms: redirects to other articles, and disambiguation tags — both of which are already present in Wikipedia without some difficult-to-maintain list. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">bmills</a> 17:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be assuming that users know all names/spellings for the target, so they will recognize the one we happened to choose. Also you seem to be suggesting that we should add disambig tags to every article, whether they need them or not, which is a radical change in policy. Futhermore lists allow different annoation depending on the context, while disambiguated article titles are invariable. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:29, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The arguments of people saying delete is because its non-notable. Maybe it should just be merged with Funge and given an entry of example Fungoids there? Its a real language, and its a great example of non-turing complete language. Why not delete Brainfuck as well? It's non-notable, and nothing serious has ever been written in it, and it fits all the same criteria that you're applying to Argh! Whitespace is the same way.

<li>As it is almost a trivial task to create an esoteric language for any computer scientist or skilled programmer there are hundreds of them out there and there is no way we can include them all in Wikipedia while upholding our article quality standards and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, therefore we should only include the notable languages such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercal.html" title="Intercal">Intercal</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainfuck.html" title="Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/f/Befunge.html" title="Befunge">Befunge</a>.

<p>This newly created article is a hoax slavishly styled after <a href="../../../m/e/n/Meningitis.html" title="Meningitis">Meningitis</a>. Please have it eradicated or possibly consigned to BJAODN. The membranes which are inflamed during meningitis are found in the spinal cord and the brain; maybe this disease afflicts those who think too much with their genitals. The article crowns its own absurdity in the final paragraph when it recalls the famous victims who suffered the disease and the bizarre prosthetic methods of "treatment" some of them refused out of national honor. If humanity is threatened with a malady of such cataclysmic proportions, Google should be flooded with hits from the medical literature, but at the moment, "testicular meningitis" seems only to be an imaginary curse some people wish upon or fear from their enemies <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22testicular+meningitis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22testicular+meningitis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefrosted_5367.html" title="User:Defrosted">Defrosted</a> 23:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
