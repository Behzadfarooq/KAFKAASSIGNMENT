<li><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Everson_e5bd.html" title="Michael Everson">Michael Everson</a> himself reverts any modification to the page from his own personal writing, be it addition or subtraction, even when factual information is added. He will most predictably be a part of this discussion and the greatest opponent to deletion. His username is <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a></li>
<li>Autobiography is highly frowned upon and sets a poor example to other editors</li>
<li>Since Everson himself states he is one of the numerous co-authors of the Unicode standard, maybe he should be merged with a small portion of a larger page listing all of the Unicode authors.</li>
<li>The links at the bottom of the page to evertype.com are a commercial site where he is advertising products, so by definition, him writing his own article about himself and his products on Wikipedia is nothing more than thinly veiled spam</li>
<li>This article is a fine example of what user pages are for, and all of its content should be on User:Evertype instead of here.</li>
<li>This article does not cite any sources that are not primary. He has a source cited of his own personal website and two links to interviews with himself.</li>
<li>While this article has been vandalized numerous times by trolls, it is also important to note that reverting vandalization is not justification of content and we can't turn a blind eye to the fact that Evertype has made a mockery of Wikipedia not only in his original violation by writing the article himself but through continued reversion to this vanity page to this very day. He is not remorseful in action despite numerous "apologies".</li>

<p>One more thing, since Everson would always rather waste time addressing the author than the issue, I would like to state ahead of time that I'm not a sockpuppet and that I nearly never contribute anything to Wikipedia whatsoever, which doesn't make any of the above points less valid.

<dd>Why does he need a biography? All he's ever done is make a few fonts for Unicode. Big deal! He didn't invent Unicode, he's not the sole contributor, and if it weren't for Michael Everson's vanity, this article would never exist in the first place. He's worthy of maybe an extremely brief mention in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">Unicode</a> on what fonts he's made, but why does anybody at all need to know all that about him, why do we need a picture of him looking very color-coordinated in front of a landmark in Iran, or have a seperate page for him whatsoever?

<li><b>Keep</b> He's done more for Unicode than simply make a few fonts, and the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Everson&amp;oldid=64882373" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Everson&amp;oldid=64882373" rel="nofollow">as it now exists</a> strikes me as a starting point that could use the inclusion of some counterpoint about his detractors and the messy falling out he has had with some of his business partners, but that's a question of article content, not whether there should be an article about him at all.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Michael Everson is a very well-known and influential expert (I am tempted to write "celebrity") in the world of coded character sets and typography. I have known about his work since the mid 1990s, i.e. long before Wikipedia was conceived. There can be no doubt that he clearly deserves an article in Wikipedia, an encyclopedia with a readership that has showen a particularly keen interest in matters related to computers. This includes important specialist technology leaders such as Michael Everson. I cannot find anything in the article that would seem out of place in a detailed encyclopedia article and I very much welcome Michael's contributions to keep the article accurate, authoritative and up-to-date. Most importantly, <b>I</b> found reading this article most interesting and insightful. Should it be deleted, I will not hesitate to rewrite from scratch an equivalent article, which is likely sound very similar. This 2nd vote for deletion is entirely unfunded and a petty and disappointing vendeta against a notable Wikipedia contributor. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Kuhn_4bd1.html" title="User:Markus Kuhn">Markus Kuhn</a> 18:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your suggestion of rewriting the article yourself would, for once, actually be a step in the right direction to obeying the rules and making the article up to some sort of NPOV. If one is to base judgement of Everson's notability by the entry he wrote, he is like a God, the master of letters and linguistics who all but invented Unicode. Anybody who checks up on the facts finds this to be embellished and inflammatory. He won't link to Unicode.org because that website shows he is less of a contributor than at first it may appear, and joined the project at a later date than many. --<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay_9627.html" title="User:SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay">SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay</a> 21:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your last remark indicates to me that you have very little first-hand familiarity with the history and evolution of both the Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 project, that you have not been for years on the relevant internal mailing lists and committee meetings, that you are not a regular reader of the countless very well researched documents that Michael Everson has contributed to the working groups in charge of ISO/IEC 10646 over the past decade, but that instead you are quick to form strong opinions after a very superficial search on a few web sites written for lay audience. With regard to rewriting the article from scratch, well, I am to a first approximation as lazy as anyone else and am certainly most happy to let the man himself provide the raw material to get started, which I am then most happy to trim and extend in scope and language as I see fit for an encyclopedia entry. Just like with any other Wikipedia article. Please work a bit harder on finding a pragmatic balance between treating the no-autobiography policy as a strict and irrevokable religious dogma, and the practicalities of getting high-quality and authoritative biographic information into Wikipedia. Did it never occur to you, that the vast majority of biographies out there of living people written by others are relying almost exclusively on raw information provided by the person concerned? Most dispicable of all, you have so far been only some anonymous coward. Show at least some face, contribution, and personality, rather than a sock puppet created obviously for the sole purpose of deleting this article! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Kuhn_4bd1.html" title="User:Markus Kuhn">Markus Kuhn</a> 23:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was wondering when you'd show up, John Cowan. The very fact that the page has not changed at all and is not *allowed to be changed at all* through you and Everson's (is he your friend or something?) reverts is further proof that this page does not belong on Wikipedia.

Even if he has started or edited this article by himself, anyone was alaways/anytime allowed to rectify/correct, with a reference/proof, if there is/are any mistake.

<dd>My response to that: There's been a whole lot of talking about how notable he is. If there's so many institutions verifying all of this information how come links to unicode.org keep getting reverted, how come ON unicode.org he wrote his own bio as well, which echoes this article, and how come he only references his own website and interviews about himself? Could it be because if you research the issue, Everson is a much more minor contributor than you think he is to Unicode? Tell you what, why don't you give me some sort of number here on how much he's done vs. total number of typefaces and we'll see how notable he really is. --<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay_9627.html" title="User:SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay">SayWhatYouMeanAndMeanWhatYouSay</a> 06:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In 1986-1987, At Xerox, Huan-mei Liao, Nelson Ng, Dave Opstad, and Lee Collins begin work on a database to map the relationships between identical Japanese (JIS) and Chinese (simplified and traditional) characters for quickly building a font for extended Chinese characters. Xerox users (e.g. Nakajima of Toronto) were in fact using JIS to extend the small Chinese character set. This leads to a first discussion of Han Unification, the pros &amp; cons of which are written up by Eric Mader. At the same time at Apple, discussions of a universal character set are sparked by the Apple File Exchange development. Mark Davis begins Apple's participation in ANSI X3L2. From February 1989, working group meetings starts more frequently, starts the foundation of Unicode Consortium, (which formally founded in 1991). (At this point, most probably less than 25 active founding members). November 1988, Lee Collins begins building the Unicode Non-Han database and defining the initial repertoire, the first database for the Unicode names and mappings. The Unicode Standard was first published in October, 1991 (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-56788-1</a> ). Unicode 1.0.1 (Volume 2)(June, 1992)(<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-60845-6</a>). Unicode 1.1 (June 1993)(Previos 2 publications and Mark Davis' Unicode Technical Report #4:The Unicode Standard, Version 1.1) is actually known as real Unicode. UTF-8 borned in 1992. Even in June 1994, Michael Everson was Irish representative (official member CEN/TC304 and ISO/JTC1/SC2/WG3). I've found Michael Everson's papers (Unicode related N956 at JTC1-SC2-WG2 archive) from March, 1994. Michael Everson released "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everson_Mono_Unicode_5d3d.html" title="Everson Mono Unicode">Everson Mono Unicode</a>" font in 1995, After more than a year in development. Which is world's 3rd Unicode font. Before him, first was Charles Bigelow &amp; Kris Holmes' "<a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucida_Sans_Unicode_1e4a.html" title="Lucida Sans Unicode">Lucida Sans Unicode</a>" font in 1993 (Shipped in Win NT 3.1). Second was, "Unihan" font by Ross Paterson in 1993. UTF-8 was formally adopted in ISO 10646 in 1996. Unicode 2.0 (August 1996)(ISBN: 0201483459 . 9 major authors). Unicode 2.1.2(May, 1998. Prev 3 publication and paper of Lisa Moore, Unicode Technical Report #8, The Unicode Standard, Version 2.1). Unicode 3.0(Sept, 1999, published in 2000. <a href="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/book/u2.html" rel="nofollow">ISBN 0-201-61633-5</a>). Since 2000 (from the version 3.0), He is one of the Co-author of publications of Unicode Standards, out of total 12 (principal) authors (Joan Aliprand, Julie Allen, Joe Becker, Mark Davis, Michael Everson, Asmus Freytag, John Jenkins, Mike Ksar, Rick McGowan, Lisa Moore, Michel Suignard, and Ken Whistler). Unicode standard is now going under very important changes (ie <a href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/index.html" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a>) to enhance the standard for applied fields, based on the papers, where Michael Everson is one of the co-author, out of total three authors.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would have written pretty much the same substance as currently in the article. By the way, we should have an article on Ken Whistler. – <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> 19:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why don't we just make articles for the other 10 out of 12 primary co-authors as well?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Feel free to rewrite and lock, but deleting is plain wrong. Michael Everson is definitely worth a page at WP, or are we running out of space? —<a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehdad_93e3.html" title="User:Behdad">behdad</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/h/User_talk%7EBehdad_50a6.html" title="User talk:Behdad">talk</a>) 19:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (1) Notable author of the Unicode Standard. Suffice it to say without his contribution (among others'), we wouldn't have Wikipedia in all of these language editions we have today. (2) Neither autobiographical authorship (in part) nor a scarcity of verifiable sources are reason enough for deletion, especially given a prior "keep" vote. <a href="../../../a/-/g/User%7EA-giau_1480.html" title="User:A-giau">A-giau</a> 20:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If being the subject of a profile article in the <i>New York Times</i> doesn't make you notable enough for Wikipedia, then there needs to be a Great Purge of thousands of biographical profiles of people with fewer claims to public fame. Any specific problems with the article can be addressed in the proper place. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 20:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
