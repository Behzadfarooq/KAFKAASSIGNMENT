<dd>The <i>New York Times</i> may not be in the same category as a small town local newspaper, but it is STILL a local newspaper when it comes to covering its own town. And as for <i>A company that shut it's [sic] doors when the internet was still in its infancy cannot be judged on google hits</i> -- well, I can't imagine anyone who would call 2002 a year when the Internet was in its infancy -- but even that's immaterial, as as the massive numbers of Google hits for "Joseph Papp" (excluding hits for some nutcase inventor of the same name) and "Federal Theatre Project" would show, given both predate Google entirely. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. per nom. Although there has been much dispute, which I have been involved in, over this article, the added references are regarding shows that took place at the theater, mostly by other production companies who rented the space. There are still no references for numerous points in the article which the creator and her sockpuppets are not allowing others to edit, even when there have been references (including the New York Times, which the creator now agrees is a reputable source). Based on these actions of the creator, it remains a vanity article.--<a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENYTheaterHistorian_5ef1.html" title="User:NYTheaterHistorian">NYTheaterHistorian</a> 06:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Grove Street Playhouse, originally the Courtyard Playhouse, is VERY NOTABLE for being one of the very FIRST and longest surviving Off-Off Broadway theatres. the "small NYT blurb from 5 yrs ago about an obscure zoning dispute" which Merzbow cites on the Marilyn Majeski project page, is actually a full 1/2 page article on page 3 of the NY Times, complete with photo of Ms. Majeski, which details a much longer and richer history of this theatre, which dates back to the days of Cino's Cafe. ("Making It Work: Serial Drama at Grove Street Playhouse", Corey Kilganon, NY Times, 01/24/99). I also found an article on Backstage.com ("Miss Majesty's Licked: Grove Street Shudders) which also chronicles the 49 year history of this theatre. Perhaps for vanity reasons, Majeski has limited the editorials exclusively to the period after 1994 when she changed the company's name.</p>
<p>I trust the NY Times fact checkers, according to Wikipedia's standards this is considered a highly reliable source. Likewise, Backstage is equally reliable as the #1 trade publication for theatre. Grove Street Playhouse is an important part of theatrical history and should not be deleted, but kept and cleaned up.</p>
<p>I think that NYTheatreHistorian should be blocked from editing this page, because clearly he has some sort of personal vendetta against this woman. The edit history shows a clear pattern of vandalism on his part. Most disturbing aren his repeated attempts to reveals her current place of employment. My understanding is that divulging personal information is strictly against Wikipedia policy. Although, I disagree with Ms. Majeski's use of socks, if she is being "stalked" as she claims, perhaps she is doing this out of fear. Irregardless, the history of this organization should not be deleted because of it's former artistic director's bad behavior.</p>

<p>- Minor editing and multiple references added including Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, and People Magazine article featuring Marilyn Majeski. Also a quote from the ever quotable Quentin Crisp has been added. In an interview with the Off-Off Broadway Review's Marshall Yaeger he said: "I'm not famous - I'm notorious.

<p>Once again, NYTheatreHistorian has deliberately introduced false information into this article. The primary reference material which is cited as the source for his most recent edit, Playbill October 1, 1998 is readily available on line at <a href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/41186.html" class="external free" title="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/41186.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.playbill.com/news/article/41186.html</a> and makes no mention of the statements included in NYTheatreHistorian's most recent contribution to this article. In fact, the article gives a very different reason for the litigation. NYTheatreHistorian has continued to use Wikipedia as a vehicle for stalking and harrasssment as defined by the law. This indidvidual's activities extend beyond the pages of Wikipedia into the real world. Wikipedia's Administrators have provided no assistance to the victim in this matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 164.82.84.3 (<a href="../../../1/6/4/User_talk%7E164.82.84.3.html" title="User talk:164.82.84.3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_164.82.84.3_6d6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/164.82.84.3">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
