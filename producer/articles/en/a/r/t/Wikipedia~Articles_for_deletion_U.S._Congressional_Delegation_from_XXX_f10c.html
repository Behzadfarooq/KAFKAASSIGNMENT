The ones in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_Congressional_Delegations_by_state_ec2d.html" title="Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state">Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state</a> are large, detailed articles, includeing history of the delegations. The ones listed above are all little better than stubs. They basically each include a template detailing the state's current delegation, and little else. Some of the big articles use these templates, some do not. I plan to add the templates to those that do not yet use it. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 20:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - In the <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">Project Congress</a> article scheme, I understood the scope of the AfD articles to be the current delegation and the articles in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_Congressional_Delegations_by_state_ec2d.html" title="Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state">Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state</a> to be the historic delegation articles. It's true that the historic delegation articles are indeed large and detailed -- and that is my fear: they are already too big and could not adequately absorb additional information that focuses solely on the current delegation. When the current delegation information is developed, it will most likely have to be split out into a separate article anyway. On the other hand, <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">Project Congress</a> has expended alot of effort to standardize and conventionalize article names for each state and territory and be comprehensive for each and every state or territory. Since the article names in this AfD series of articles don't fully comply, it may be best to delete all of them and then, when we are ready to expand the 'current delegation' information, we can start over.--G1076 17:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this AfD succeeds, this template (Template:Current congressional delegation article) should be considered for deletion--G1076 17:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> -- What is the actual reason to delete these? If they're duplicates, then merge and redirect. These article have many incoming links.

<li>These may go but definitely keep template for use on individual congresspeople's pages.

So yeah, as the original submitter, Merge/Redirect is acceptable to me. As for the template, IMHO that would have to go through a separate <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a>, rather than being deleted by this article AFD. Finally, as for the merge, I did about 1/3 of the pages last week, and am hopeing to get back to doing more today. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 13:02, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To clarify, the templeates TL:XXX-FedRep will remain and be merged into the existing articles <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_Congressional_Delegations_by_state_ec2d.html" title="Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state">Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state</a>. The template (Template:Current congressional delegation article) should go through a separate <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> following the close of this AfD.</dd>
<dd>Suggestion: if a merge is decided upon, I would agree that the AfD articles should point to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_Congressional_Delegations_by_state_ec2d.html" title="Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state">Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state</a>; however, I would suggest that a comment line be added to the redirect page to alert/direct would be editors to Wikipedia:WikiProject:U.S. Congress/Congressional delegations, a standard/boilerplate page that will be developed by <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">WP:USC</a>.--G1076 14:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>&#160;: This page list only the "current" members of congress. This is a very relevant piece of information. If a person is interested in finding this the only other resort he/she has is to go to the page with list of congressmen from the last 200 or so years and scroll through the pages looking for the details. Also, I believe this page is a frequently used and linked page from other websites. If you search for say, 'U.S. Congressional delegation from Arkansas' in goggle <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=u.s.+congressional+delegation+from+arkansas&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=u.s.+congressional+delegation+from+arkansas&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> this would be the first page to show up. This attests to the importance of this page. I would definitely vote to keep this page.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - interesting. However, I don't think that these results reflect the importance of the article rather it is caused by a combination of Google's bias towards WP and the effect of an uncommon search term fitting exactly the article title. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC) --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuKot_a5c7.html" title="User:DuKot">DuKot</a> 20:34, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep or Merge</b>: These pages allow to hop conveniently from say, a senator's page, to the delegation list of another state. This is particularly helpful if you are interested in identifying a member of Congress. If you do not know a Congressman in question, these pages let you easily identify him or her. Because of its inherent convenience, these pages should remain on Wikipedia Another option is to merge all of these pages into one, but keeping the same template which appears on Congressmen's pages currently. <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorvida_9bd8.html" title="User:Porvida">Porvida</a> 22:53, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Isn't it a little risky to keep a page that says "current" but not the year? What if once the year roles over somebody forgets to update it? I think if would be easier to just merge it with the other years that state the date, then people don't have to worry about whether the page is actually up-to-date or not. I don't think it's too difficult to scroll through, and also you can see if the past history of the delegation. If it gets too unwieldly perhaps the pages can be broken down into half-centuries. --134.174.21.2 23:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In the past these templates / pages get updated within minutes of changes in congressmen / senators. This has happened when people like Duke Cunningham and Mark Foley resigned. Lots of editors are actively keeping track of these pages. So I do not see any risk in these pages going out of date. Also, if you think that way any page in wikipedia could go out of date. For example if you say ABC is the current governor of XYZ. The day somebody else is elected this statement becomes outdated. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuKot_a5c7.html" title="User:DuKot">DuKot</a>----</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay, there's basically no satisfactory way to close this at this point, no one is willing to touch it. Personally, unless I'm missing something here, I think this should be relisted to get more input. I'll do that today if no one objects. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> - this is a case where the categories do a way better job. Not only to they provide the same information as do the templates, they provide chronology and history. A concern expressed above is that you have to scoll through 200 years of history to establish the current incumbents. This can be dealt with, <i>if</i> it is considered to be a pivotal problem, by putting the categories in descending order. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:21, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This may be the first time I've ever written this phrase, but wouldn't these work better as lists? It seems odd to just have the templates making up an entire article.
