<p>When I first started reading this, I thought it was an ad, and was about to list it for vfd for that reason. But as I read more, it seemed to turn into an attack article.

<dd>Hi Rick,</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me see if I can defend this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) There is no point of view being expressed here. I have aimed to write a factual article on Penta water, with fairly extensive references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) I have not proposed any original research in this article. All of the science is present in peer-reviewed literature. Is there anything specific you wish to question here?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) The subject is notable. Firstly the number of newspaper reports and discussions on the (highly accredited) James Randi page show that it is of outside interest. There are an enormous number of hits for Penta on Google.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I reject all of your points, but I of course welcome your views on the page.</dd>
<dd>Thanks,</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> debunking false but popular beliefs seems to be a reasonable task for an encyclopedia, as long as it can be verified (and a major news source like the Guardian is good enough. I wouldn't mind seeing it toned down so as to be a little less rantish, and perhaps with some sort of voice presenting the other side of the story.

<dd>Thanks for your responses. I'm not an expert Wikipedian and I agree that the artilcle may come across as a little strong in places! I agree that more effort needs to be put into this article to calm down the tone of it. I would greatly appreciate assistance from other members here.</dd>
<dd>I have a PhD in physics and have worked for 10 years doing research into water and water clusters (search for christian burnham on <a href="http://scholar.google.com" class="external free" title="http://scholar.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://scholar.google.com</a>). As far as I am aware all of the science on the Penta page that I have written is non-original and accepted by mainstream scientists in the field. There does seem to be a little confusion sometimes- even though the claims of 'clustered' bottle water manufacturers is often in the realm of pseudoscience- water clusters are completely well established mainstream science that <i>nobody</i> challenges the existence of (in the mainstream literature). Papers on water clusters have appeared in Nature and Science, arguably the two most prestigious scientific journals in the world. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianjb_bc9d.html" title="User:Christianjb">Christianjb</a> 01:23, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just cleaned up the nobel prize section. I agree that sounded quite subjective and speculative. I've toned it down, but maybe it needs to be removed altogether? The Randi Prize is not speculative, because James Randi has stated that Penta would be eligible for the prize<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianjb_bc9d.html" title="User:Christianjb">Christianjb</a> 02:13, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have also just added a section titled "Positive Reviews of Penta Water" in order to reflect that Penta has had many people testify to the benefits of their drink. I think this helps to counter the perceived negative tone of some other parts of the article. Unfortunately I will be in the process of moving over the next few days and so I will have very limited time in which to further improve the article. I hope that others will help to improve this article into something much better. It would be unfortunate if this article (still in its infancy, I only began writing yesterday) were deleted before we have had the chance to improve it. I would also like to thank the Wikipedians on this page who have provided very useful criticism, that I hope should make this article better. This has been an educational process for me! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianjb_bc9d.html" title="User:Christianjb">Christianjb</a> 03:52, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. About 99% of the Google hits are marketing hype, this may serve as a dose of reality against all that nonsense. Positive reviews?? - we don't need to hype it with celebrity raves. There is a need for genuine scientific information. It may need some cleanup and also careful watching to squelch any attempts at advertizing that may <i>show up</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Secrets previously had a section in the main Halo article, but it quickly grew unmanagable and was spun off into a separate article as a form of damage control. The separate Secrets article helps keep "l33t d00ds" from mucking with the main Halo article (which is quite coherent and fairly well written). While I tend to agree that Wikipedia shouldn't be a repository for secrets and easter eggs, there are plenty of people that feel this info should be present, and keeping it separate from the main Halo article works well with regards to organization and article content. A merge would be very bad for the main Halo article. - <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormanEinstein_d22c.html" title="User:NormanEinstein">NormanEinstein</a> 13:56, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Rob Fleming is encyclopedic: a prospective article on the indisputably encyclopedic incumbent Sheila Orr should include that she's facing him in this election, and an article on the past holder of the seat, the prominent Steve Orcherton, definitely should mention his defeat by Fleming in the current nomination. Add his existing career as a city councillor in the capital of B.C., and I think he passes the bar. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 03:41, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This one should be <b>Kept</b>. Polak has attained national notoriety as an extremely socially-conservative school trustee (ie. getting her name in the papers by opposing literature that portrays same-sex couples in a favourable light). She's also notable as the governing-party candidate who lost the only by-election that took place in the parliament now ending. I don't have a *strong* opinion about the NDP pages that I voted to keep a few moments ago; Polak, however, is clearly over the bar in terms of notability. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:52, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is about using biodegradable plastic bags in India. First, the article has a wrong and misleading name, second, the article as it stands has no potential to become encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> I too frequent the forum and before that I used to visit the website that birthed it, <a href="http://dbzuncensored.dbzoa.net/" class="external text" title="http://dbzuncensored.dbzoa.net/" rel="nofollow">DBZ Uncensored</a>. You have to realize that you guys that are voting against it live in a vacuum. The fact is, DBZU has had an enormous impact on the anime community. If it weren't for that site, we wouldn't have edit lists. We wouldn't have uncensored DVD's. That site got the ball rolling. Companies began to realize anime wasn't just for children. It was no longer possible to keep anime fans ignorant. And many others copied his example. Even animenewsnetwork. Psaros has since retired from his website but the web forum still thrives. So of COURSE that's why it was mentioned before the actual website. We probably should have created an entry for the website first. Of course, anime haters would be trolling that entry just as you're all trolling this one. I only visit GameFaqs for the combo guides but I still found the wikipedia entry for their messageboard interesting. I guess the fact that none of you knew George Washington personally makes his life boring and unimportant. Same mentality here. Utils 18:30, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oh, interestingly enough, I happened to run across the defintion of sockpuppet voting, and it's used quite out of context here. Thanks guys.</p>
<p>KEEP-Yes this is a user vote. Since you are looking for arguments allow me to present one.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious argument that Wikipedia has far more obscure entries, and may be in fact what Wikipedia is all about, there is also the fact that this is (or was) in fact the message board of a popular website (DBZ Uncensored). While it was not as popular as Planet Namek(which, as well as its messageboard has its ownt entry), any regular visitor to Planet Namek in it's heyday has heard of this site, and was in fact how I came across this messageboard. Secondly, while you may argue the obscurity of this board, the board is a fact of life. It has been in existance in some form or another for 5 years and will continue to exist for sometime. So it's not like this is really an advertisement or anything. And never, ever during this period has it been "dead".</p>
<p>Not only that, but I feel this entry will more interesting to the reader because pretty much anyone can be welcomed, and is allowed to post anything they want. It should be emphasized that most messageboards can not honestly claim this, as the vast majority of messageboards are far more strongly moderated, although few will admit it to being so(much as Wikipedia claims any article can be posted, but the existance of this page shows that in practice it doesn't). -Piccolo48</p>

In short, I feel this is a solid article.</p>

</ul>
<p>--response: The reason this wasnt done in the first place is because we felt the messageboard had it's own culture, even if it was part of a Dragon Ball Website at one point. Frankly, I do NOT think "obscurity" is a reason to disclude something from here, paricularly when the site this originated from was not "obscure", and is about a culture that \ has and will exist on the internet for a long time. The board WILL eventually get its own domain name, and unless you can name some SOLID AND FAIR GROUND RULES on why this article should NOT be included(ground rules which you feel apply to all Wikipedia articles, which i trust only a webmaster on this sight to make)</p>
<p>To say this article should be voted off because some random people feel it should is, at best, an ad-populum argument that shouldnt apply to an encyclopedia of all places. Place some ground rules, and then explain from there. Piccolo48Piccolo48</p>

<p>This page is pending donkeys but it should not be deleted, because it contained useful, encyclopedic content (albeit short) that is not in wiktionary: "<i>It is often associated with nativity scenes where the baby Jesus used a manger in place of a crib (Luke 2:7)</i>. In addition, this is a very important element of the Christian <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity.html" title="Nativity">nativity</a> and has potential for expansion to cover construction, and history of use. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:11, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It shouldn't have been flagged as pending deletion - as far as I can see, the pending deletion tag was only added because somebody added a speedy delete tag with a reason of "already in Wiktionary" (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">not a valid reason</a>), after another user had added a "move to Wiktionary" tag. I've backed the article up to before all the tags, so it's a perfectly harmless substub again. Nothing to see here, move along. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">→•←</a> 13:40, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>While I agree with this particular case, isn't deletion of the Wikipedia page a normal part of the Transwiki process? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 15:09, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Certainly, but I was under the impression that dicdefs still had to go through VFD - to establish they <i>are</i> dicdefs - before deletion. This case shows how careless or overenthusiastic tagging can bypass that process. In fact, I now notice that <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Rector_8ca0.html" title="User:Kevin Rector">Kevin Rector</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Rector_6fbd.html" title="User talk:Kevin Rector">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevin_Rector_637c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevin Rector">contribs</a>) has tagged a bunch of these, several (but not all) of which seem to be more than simple dicdefs. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">→•←</a> 16:09, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At least two different people look at articles for transwiki (one to nominate, another to process it). And some other people, such as Kappa above, check the articles as well. I don't think we should list <i>every</i> transwikied article on VfD, because there is a present backlog of about a <i>thousand</i>, and for the vast majority the VfD vote would be <i>transwiki</i> (thus resulting in the article being labeled for transwiki, ensuing in confusion since it's already there, and warranting a re-listing on VfD). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:06, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Proof that all integers are interesting (and should be kept?):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>1 is intersting and notable, OK</li>
<li>Assume k is interesting and notable, need to prove that k+1 is interesting and notable.</li>
<li>If n is interesting and notable, then n+1 is interesting and notable for being one higher than an interesting and notable number.</li>
<li>So k+1 is interesting and notable.</li>
<li>By principle of induction all numbers are interesting and notable, but we do not have space for that unfortunately. But then again Wikipedia is not paper; and someone has expanded this from being a silly joke article to a proper article on numbers.</li>
<li>Conclusion: <s>This article should be <b>deleted</b></s>. 138 is a notable number, not merely notable for not being notable, which would really not be very notable, but since this <i>is</i> notable I will notably change my vote to a notable <b>keep</b>. When someone now makes the <a href="../../../1/3/9/139_%28number%29.html" title="139 (number)">139 (number)</a> article, please do not let it be a silly joke however. <s><a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:26, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</s> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:42, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it is noteworthy of keeping. I mean it might not be as good as some other numbers, but compared to some articles, this is more noteworthy and should be kept. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWater_Bottle_595b.html" title="User:Water Bottle">WB</a> 01:43, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> - any number you pick out of a hat has an infinite number of "interesting" properties. Doesn't make it notable in any way however. <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> 22:56, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that hat has only numbers between 1 and 1024, then you're absolutely right, that number will have "an infinite number of "interesting" properties." Let's say the hat has numbers between 1 and 4294967296. The probability of picking a number with interesting (i.e., non-obvious) properties decreases dramatically. You can probably name lots of interesting properties for say, 123. But how about 123356779? 123 deserves its own article. 123356779 most likely doesn't. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 22:36, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm glad Dbpsmith cannot be implicated in inserting <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> into this article. I would also note that this series of articles extends to <a href="../../../2/5/6/256_%28number%29.html" title="256 (number)">256</a>.

<li>The nomination was not ridiculous; look at the first version where the only notability was "138 is the smallest number not having a separate article in Wikipedia".

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a member of this organization, and I see no reason why it should be removed from Wikipedia. You can't construe this as a promotion, as the organization is only open to students of Seton Hall University.
