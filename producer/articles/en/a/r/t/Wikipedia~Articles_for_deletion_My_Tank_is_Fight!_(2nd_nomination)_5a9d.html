<li><b>Delete</b>, significantly-selling books are <i>not</i> inherently notable (though many are).

<li><u><b>Speedy</b></u> <b>Delete</b> A book about non-notable inventions, many of which didn't get off the drawing board. Amazon.com Sales Rank: #27,583 in Books. Not bad, but not so good that I'd support a keep vote without some other claim to notability. Besides, the current article is little more than a list of the chapters of the book. If the book does turn out to be notable for some reason no-one's noticed, the article should be trimmed right back to a stub.

<li><b>Comment</b>, these are <i>not</i> non-notable inventions. Many (possibly all) already have a page here on wikipedia. It is <i>not</i> a listing of chapters, but instead stating what inventions it covers. A perfectly reasonably thing to include in the article. Also if you look at the inventions you will see many of them have a wikilink to their own article page like I said. Thus obviously <b>not</b> non-notable inventions. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Largely irrelevant-the notability of a book's <i>subject</i> has no bearing on the notability of the book. Nor does sales (notability is not popularity). If and <i>only</i> if reliable non-trivial secondary source coverage exists is the subject notable. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 09:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know that a book being about a notable subject doesn't mean it is notable. Likewise the reverse is also not automatically true. Thus is why I was replying to <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a>'s delete vote where it was stated "<i>book about non-notable inventions</i>". Probably could have stated it better, either way the combination of your statement and mine I think now makes my point clear. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 12:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>. What I was saying was 'non notable book about non notable things'. Most of them never got off the drawing board, or past the prototype stage. That doesn't mean they aren't interesting, but it does make it less likely that they have impacted the universe in any noticable way. And per everyone, we need to establish the notability of the book. The only argument presented on this page so far is sales, which aren't bad, but not, I think, good enough. Currently #9,283 - a problem with Amazon rankings. It does seem to have been #6 at one point <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22My+Tank+is+Fight%21%22+amazon&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22My+Tank+is+Fight%21%22+amazon&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> , but I'm not planning to change my vote unless the article explains why the book is notable. Currently, it says "Parsons describes the work as "pulp history" given its nature of combining technical details with a more action and humor-focused writing style. The book was published mainly because of Something Awful's huge popularity as a humor website, with many people interested in purchasing a book by one of its contributors. It is based on a series of columns for the site." BFW. The bulk of the aricle is a list of chapters, followed by apparently OR observation that "Many of the inventions are of German origin because ...". Actually, I will change my vote. See above.

<dd><b>Comment</b> in the last debate Night Gyr said "significantly-selling books are generally considered notable, and WP:BK is still only a proposal. There is also coverage of this book, but it's buried under all the listings of retailers selling it. I've seen a scan of a newspaper article about it, documenting that it sold out its first printing (over 10,000 copies total), but I don't have it on hand right now.
