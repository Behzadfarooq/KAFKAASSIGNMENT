<p>Leaving aside for one moment the dodgy capitalisation of the title, which could be easily fixed, I'm not sure about this article as it currently stands.

<p>(<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Santorum_cc75.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Santorum">1st AFD</a>) The information in the first five sentences of this article is already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_Controversy_5577.html" title="Santorum Controversy">Santorum Controversy</a>. The "References in the media" section is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> unless it can be shown that sources independent of, say, the <i>Economist</i> took note of its reference of "santorum." Everything else in the article is unsourced and unsourceable by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources that are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">independent of Dan Savage or those working to popularize this neologism</a>. "Santorum" itself fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, which requires reliable sources <i>about</i> the neologism. I didn't wade through all the Google hits, but a cursory look shows lots of unreliable, POV sources like blogs, and I found zero sources in a Lexis-Nexis search (even in local Pennsylvania sources) that discuss "santorum" beyond a dicdef or verify the material in the article beyond the first five sentences. The ADS award,<a href="http://www.americandialect.org/2004_Words_of_the_Year_Final_Vote_.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americandialect.org/2004_Words_of_the_Year_Final_Vote_.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> of which so much was made in the first AFD, is trivial, and the ADS source provides only a dictionary definition, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">nothing we can build a Wikipedia article on</a>.</p>
<p>I'm puzzled why the first AFD resulted in keep. The closer said there was "substantial support among established commenters that this word has now reached encyclopedic notability." But, assuming "encyclopedic notability" refers to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">the primary notability criterion</a>, I think the closer's conclusion is untenable, given that the first AFD produced, and the article right now provides, no non-trivial, reliable, external sources of which "santorum" is the subject, which we could use to write a verifiable article. Many keep voters in the first AFD cited "widespread use," but again, at Wikipedia we need reliable sources about the term, not sources that use the term, because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people who will come to participate in this AFD are shocked that anyone could think this term is not notable. To them I would emphasize that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability has an objective meaning on Wikipedia</a>: if someone can find multiple non-trivial reliable external sources about "santorum," then that would establish notability. Otherwise, not.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <b>delete</b> for failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article meets all content policy and criteria. The article itself includes references to independent non-trivial coverage in the media and elsewhere - I don't need to repeat them as they're there for the reading. It's a bit tenuous to say that there must be multiple references then dismiss out of hand the multiple references. Just because one says they are "trivial" does not make them so. The term has been around long enough that the "neologism" label is starting to wear thin.

There is also no evidence to show it fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, etc. It appears the strongest reasoning against the article is that it's not "notable", relying on disputed <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">disputed policy</a> that is still under discussion. It strikes me that the other key reason this is up for nomination is because it is "disgusting" or offends someone's political point of view; however, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>. The term has clearly taken on a life of its own and is certainly more "notable" (if relying on that alone) than many of the other pop-culture terms or memes that have articles. Nothing has changed to alter the reasoning for "keep" from the prior AfD. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was the proposer of the original AfD. I became convinced that the political act by Dan Savage was notable, but it seems clear to me that the term itself is not a successful neologism. There are no citations in durable media by independent sources. Savage's use of the term as a political stunt (not intended as a pejorative term) was very successful, and that act needs to be recorded in WP somewhere. I would be happy to see the article changed to "santorum (sexual slang activism)" or something that ceased to imply it was a successful neologism.

<dd><b>Comment</b> As became apparent in the last AfD, there are certainly people who dislike the senator who nevertheless voted Keep, so I don't think we can assume an agenda beyond what's in the nom. With regard to the American Dialect Society: the nomination of a word for one of its categories requires no documentation at all; the words voted on are (per an ADS member) typically "stunt words".

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually I did read your comments. Frankly I'm confused by your call for sources about the term rather than those that use it. Those are what are provided. Neither the Daily Show nor the Economist were describing fecal matter and happened to use the word 'Santorum' in that context. But were concerned by the fact that the word <i>Santorum</i> was coined in notable circumstances and is now in use. The Daily Show is admittedly a satirical programme, but one with a considerable world-wide viewership. The Economist however is a totally serious economic and political journal dating back to 1843. That the term has become notable enough for it to be mentioned by that paper in an article about the Senator shows that it is notable not only in the US but also in the UK. Such coverage seems to me to satisfy Wikipedia's objective notability criteria. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 02:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm still reviewing your revision, but what I see so far looks like more of what there was before: OR, primary sources, and unreliable POV sources. The one exception seems to be the Slate source, which is no more than a paragraph about "santorum" and the ADS award. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 09:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have used primary sources to demonstrate the timeline of creation (which was vague and incorrect before), not for notability. I have tried to make every thing I added a cited assertion, and several of those citations are print media. I'm sorry they are not to your liking, but there is no prohibition against what you call a "POV source" (since all sources have POV). Wikipedia policy requires us to cite POV assertions, but does not prevent their use in articles. I didn't have anything in particular I could do about the website section right now, so that's still unreferenced. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry for coming off so harsh before. Your revision is exceptionally well-written and well-organized, I'll give you that, but still problematic, I think. First, as to POV sources, when the only sources on a topic are POV, it's impossible to write an NPOV article. (I also think that when the only sources taking note of a topic are on the same page politically, the topic's notability should be questionable, but that's open for discussion.) Now let's go over the article. The lead and background are already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a>. The "Contest" section, as you acknowledge, is only verified in a primary source, so the propriety of having that material in Wikipedia is questionable. The first paragraph of the "Popularity" section uses one sentence in one source to establish a tenous (at best) connection between "santorum" and Santorum's iconic status as a social conservative. The "Web activism" section, as you acknowledge is unsourced and, I think, is likely sourceable only by primary sources. Now we come to the only material in the article that I think may be appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia -- the Slate reference. The POV problem remains however. Slate is a reputable source, but its bias is well known, and in the absence of other sources covering the ADS award, I don't think inclusion is appropriate in the final analysis. In any case, this source yields only 4 sentences about the term -- fairly trivial (though not totally, I'll admit). Finally, the rest of the article, is, yes, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, as a synthesis of various media references of the term. Most egregious is the hint, every so subtly dropped, without the support of any reliable source, that the term may have contributed to Santorum's defeat. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 09:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(further comment) So, the big picture, in my view (fwiw): The term itself fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The ancillary material about origins and repercussions is not reliably sourceable -- except for the material you added that's based on the 4 sentences in Slate. I wouldn't object to a merge of this material to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a> and/or <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. (Or you could insert it yourself so a merge is unnecessary.) However the Slate reference cannot by itself sustain a stand-alone article, because it's brief (wrt the term) and because there are no other sources to balance the POV. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 10:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re: "good quality" -- I think we can all agree that Dhartung's rewrite is of excellent <i>copyedit</i> quality (I wish I could write and organize as well as that). The problem is that everything in the article (except for the 2nd and 3rd sentences in "References in media" section) is either (1) verified by a primary source, (2) original research, or (3) already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a>. Moreover there is still no sign the term itself passes <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<li>I'm not sure what you mean by <b>POV source</b>. There is no requirement that sources be neutral, most will be advancing a point of view. The usual response if one feels a source is partisan is to counterbalance with another source that shows the opposite point of view. In this case, one that claimed the word had seen little use out of the Dan Savage context and had failed to become part of wider popular culture. AfD is not the place to address problems with NPOV or lack thereof- that should be done in the editing of the article. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 16:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point about the POV source is somewhat trivial as it only concerns those two sentences, as the other sources are all either unreliable or primary. But as to the POV issue itself: you make a good point -- "the usual response...is to counterbalance" -- but, I'm afraid, you reach the wrong conclusion: "AfD is not the place to address problems with NPOV." In this case, there is no sign that it is <i>possible</i> to write the article using counterbalancing sources, because those 4 sentences in Slate are the only (even slightly) non-trivial source anyone has found. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> I couldn't care less about politics so I feel fairly neutral when it comes to political-based articles like this. Anyway, my thoughts are theses:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) The TERM itself must be the subject of mulitiple, non-trivial, independent, Reliable, Reputable, third-party sources. What that means is that just like any thing else, the sources have to be reporting on term, not using it. Non-Trivial means that the news/magazine/web/tv/radio article must be completely about the term and nothing else. A sentance or paragraph in a news/magazine/web/tv/radio article talking about a different or slightly related matter does not make that source non-trivial. It's a mention in passing and disqualified as a source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Many of the keep votes here are not baseing their arguements on policies but rather their POV. "simply because there's no consensus", "[the] effect that this term has had on pop culture", "per last afd", "[because] no one uses wikitionary". Many of the delete opinions have been made using the wikipolicies to back their comments. I argue on policies, not POV thinking.</dd>

<li>I have to agree with Uucp, unless I am completely misunderstanding guidelines this does seem like a textbook neologism article and, to repeat a comment I made above, I am not sure what further sources people could be demanding - it occurs to me that this article is being held to an <i>exceedingly</i> stringent standard re: debates about the validity/primacy/notability of every source and statement.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with Pan Dan. I DO NOT think that Slate reference as a non-trivial coverage. My requirements are the same as wikipedia's. Articles must be about the term itself and nothing else. They should talk about the term, it's uses, history and such. A paragraph in an article about the senator or about the senator's comments are not what I call non-trivial sources for the TERM. However if I am over-ruled in this case by the closing admin, then I wish to point out....that's only ONE non-trivial coverage. Multiple (and in practice, admins usually hold articles to an unwriten 'three sources' rule) sources do not exist.

<dd>(1) "If that isn't a pretty POV statement in itself" -- did you read the Phil. Weekly source? My statement is completely justified.

<dd>Arrggh, you got me! &#160;:-) But no, in this case the Phil. Weekly is a left wing paper. Plus, I just found out that Dan Savage writes a weekly column in the Phil.

<dd>The paper is independent of Savage in the sense that he doesn't work directly for them. However the fact that the Weekly syndicates his column does raise questions of non-independence as the paper benefits from promoting its readers' interest in Savage's columns. And, the left wing-ness of the Weekly is unquestionable, and the POV of their write-up on Savage referenced by Dhartung is unmistakable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:07, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I find this nomination fundamentally flawed on numerous levels, not to mention a troubling indicator of the mis-application of WP guidelines. I do understand that the article has changed since the original nomination, but there are a number of lingering issues which should be discussed. However, first let's look at the merits of the nomination arguments themselves. The issue of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> has been, for the most part, resolved with the current rewrite, as have the arguments concerning <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_Dictionary" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a Dictionary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The issue of reliable sources is perhaps the most troubling part of the nomination for me, and I find it to be completely unfounded. Dan Savage sources are used to identify the term and chronicle the events surrounding its creation, precisely as a primary source must be used as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As it was once put to me: "<i>In the absence of a secondary source, we use a primary source for uncontroversial claims about the subject. Such primary sources can't establish importance, but they can be used for simple, uncontroversial claims in the absence of any alternative secondary source.</i>"</dd>
<dd>Moving on, I fail to see how this article "fails" <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, as it (#1) does not use the term in the article except by way of definition or example, (#2a) is an article <i>about</i> a neologism, not just a definition, (#2b) is backed up by verifiable sources, such as <i>The Economist</i>, <i>Tuscon Weekly</i>, and the <i>Daily Show</i>, concerning both the nature of the word as well as the use thereof, and (#3) is supported by the same secondary sources listed previously. The assertation that the article does not meet some arbitrary "minimum secondary source count" such that it still does not satisfy <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> #3 is another fundamentally flawed argument, attempting to create a requirement where there is none. While it is true that there are not an <i>overwhelming</i> number of secondary sources to support the article, the permience of the term in common sources is naturally limited due to the fact that it is a <i>sexually explicit term</i>; as such, any expectation of finding secondary sources should be adjusted appropriately.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the issue of notability should be no issue at all; though the appearance in common or popular media is spotty, the term has nonetheless been used in a major magazine as well as a major and significant nationally broadcast cable news/comedy program at least twice.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, I find the nomination fundamentally flawed from another significant point: <b>the criterea used to nominate this article for deletion are all <i>guidelines</i>, not policy</b>. Guidelines are either suggestions on how Wikipedia articles generally should be constructed, (e.g. the <a href="../../../m/s/_/WP%7EMS_6031.html" title="WP:MS">Manual of Style</a>) or they are synthesized suggestions on how to interpret Wikipedia policy. (e.g, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) If an article can only be nominated under the justification of guidelines but <i>not</i> the underlying policies upon which the guidelines were constructed then the most one should justifiably expect to happen to an article is that it be rewritten. Guidelines <a href="../../../g/u/i/WP%7EGUIDELINES_2048.html" title="WP:GUIDELINES">by definition</a> are more flexible and likely to have exceptions, and as such should not be used as a rigid measure of whether or not an article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 00:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, regarding your point that it's OK to use Dan Savage as a primary source for the circumstances surrounding his coinage of the term: The problem here is not just the reliability of Dan Savage as a source, it's that the efforts being described are those of Savage advancing a POV about Sen. Santorum, and these efforts cannot be described in an NPOV fashion because no external reliable sources have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">taken note</a> of these efforts. It's really a failure both of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I would further say that in the absence of external sources that have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">taken note</a> of Savage's efforts, it is unwarranted to use Wikipedia as a platform for advertising these efforts.
<dl>
<dd>That brings another point to mind: <b>there is no policy prohibiting the use of POV sources, only prohibiting the creation of POV articles</b>. Just because an article is dripping with personal opinion and the like does not, under any circumstances, necessarily mean that there are no facts which can be extracted or otherwise referenced from that source. Had the Dan Savage references been used to assert the <i>notability</i> of the topic there would be a serious argument. As it is the references are only used to 1) define the term, 2) show that he held a contest to determine the definition, 3) show that he set up a website to promote the popularity of the term, and 4) provide a quote as to his response to certain key events. Again, these are all perfectly permissiable uses of a primary source. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"there is no policy prohibiting the use of POV sources, only prohibiting the creation of POV articles" -- would you not call this section of the article POV? It's about Savage's efforts to advance a POV about Sen. Santorum, and these efforts have been been non-trivially noted by no mainstream media source. It thus calls attention to a negative aspect of Santorum with no possibility of counterbalancing sources. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By itself the section would appear to promote a POV. However, the section is in relation to the <i>origin</i> of the term and is simply detailing the history, the facts behind the origin. While there was a POV behind the term it is nonetheless a relevant piece of information concerning its origin. While no currently cited secondary sources have specifically covered the topic of Savage's efforts, secondary sources <i>have</i> covered the term itself and briefly touched on its origins. The expansion or augmenting of this information with more detailed information from the primary source is perfectly acceptable. I hate to <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin</a> myself here, but would you cite an article on the Nazi party for POV issues because it mentioned their hatred of the Jews? You would not, because the article does not advance that POV, but rather mentions it as a relevant fact about the Nazi party. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 06:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bad comparison. The Nazi party, and its hatred of Jews, is well covered by many, many sources inside, outside, supportive of, and opposed to the Nazis. Savage's campaign was covered only by himself and non-independent sources. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second, regarding your points about <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>: The problem is not that the <i>article</i> fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>; only neologisms can fail WP:NEO. The article fails <i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a></i> for synthesizing information about "the nature of the word as well as the use thereof," as you put it. Your point that the refences are verifiable is irrelevant in the face of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Moreover, the <i>term</i> itself does fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, because there are no non-trivial reliable external sources about it.
<dl>
<dd>You're splitting hairs here; it applies to the article, it applies to the word, whatever. The point is that it does not apply here because each one of the provisions the article/word supposedly fails has in fact been met. As to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, there is no synthesis of information done on the article side, beyond the mere collection of information. Each statement is clearly referenced and directly reflected in the sourced material; there is no conjecture, assumption, or any drawn conclusions present in the current version of the article, and <b>I challenge you to explicitly cite any statements you think are Original Research</b>. The most you can argue is that there are some weasel words present, which is an issue for the article's talk page, <i>not</i> AfD, but on the offchance I'm wrong I think it is highly likely that any OR could easily be removed, leaving the article intact. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"no synthesis of information done on the article side, beyond the mere collection of information" --"Collection" <i>is</i> "synthesis". We cannot at Wikipedia take note of media references of a <i>term</i>, unless those references have been noted by other media. This is because Wikipedia is not a dictionary. The entire section titled "References in media" is thus original research, except for the 2nd and 3rd sentences. Note, that if this kind of synthesis were permissible, there would be no point to <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>'s requirement of sources that <i>discuss</i> a neologism as opposed to sources that just <i>use</i> it. As for <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> itself, the term fails it because <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> requires that "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term." I'm not sure what #1, #2a, 2b, 3, refer to in your original comment -- those numbers are not in <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but you're wrong. Check <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:OR">WP:OR#What_is_excluded?</a>: none of the article content falls into any of those categories. The closest you can come is the section which first defines the neologism itself, which as we've already determined meets the qualification of having a reliable source: the primary source. (Though notability is not established by that source) Collection of information is <i>never</i> Original Research unless it directs the reader towards a particular conclusion; collecting information, after all, is the very core of Wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>Wrong. You appear to be unfamiliar with what dictionary entries may contain. Entries in Wiktionary, for example, may contain <i>far more</i> than "the raw definition of the term with, at most, a one sentance mention of the term's origin". That is a <i>stub</i> dictionary article, as far as a dictionary like Wiktionary is concerned. <i>Full</i> Wiktionary articles may also contain usage notes, translations, pronunciation guides, inflection tables, synonyms, related words, antonyms, homophones, alternative spellings, and multiple quotations demonstrating the word in actual use for each meaning.

<dd>Again, <b>Collection of information is <i>not</i> synthesis</b>. Synthesis would be creating new information or conclusions from existing information.

<dd>The requirement of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> that their exist secondary sources about the term in question does not specify that those sources be <i>exclusively</i> about the term, and there are not one but four separate secondary sources (if I count right) listed which talk <i>about</i> the term. It would be counter to logic to assume that there is such a requirement, as I can think of no neologisms (with the possible exceptions of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiality.html" title="Wikiality">Wikiality</a>) which have ever had entire articles from reliable sources devoted exclusively to the term.
<dl>

<dd>Third, regarding your point that my nomination relies on guidelines, which you say are "flexible and likely to have exceptions," unlike policy. You're right that the difference between policies and guidlines is that the former may never be overriden, while the latter may. Still, there has to be a good <i>reason</i> to override guidelines -- especially dealing with <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which are directly based on the policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. You have given no good reason to override guidelines in this case. Besides, as I explain above, the article in its current form blatantly violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One more comment: Your speculation that the term is less likely to be found in printed sources because it's sexually explicit is both irrelevant and unsubstantiated: irrelevant because sources are a requirement at Wikipedia, and there can't be any "excuses"; and unsubstantiated because the term, its effect, its origins, etc., could be discussed in print without explicitly rendering the definition. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ; the fact that we are talking about a guideline specifically <i>qualifies</i> the use of "excuses", as you put it. The issue of notability to which my statement was concerning will be <i>directly</i> influenced by the relative vulgarity of the word, as it precludes its appearance in certain groups of media. You would not, for example, expect an article on the term <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felch.html" title="Felch">felch</a> to appear in the Christian Science Monitor. As for my argument being "unsubstantiated": this is an argument, not an article. I don't need sources for my arguments to be valid; common sense works just fine. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, we need non-trivial sources to write the article. As for your argument being unsubstantiated, perhaps I used the wrong word. I should have said, maybe, unconvincing. The reason it's unconvincing is, as I said above, that the term, its effects, origins, etc. could be discussed in print without ever rendering the definition. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have non-trivial sources. Obviously you disagree on this point, but I've pointed out, repeatedly, major and significant sources which have discussed or used the term.

There are several separate issues here that are not fully teased apart in the discussions on this page. This is a long entry; sorry about that but it's a complicated discussion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Is it the coinage a notable political act?</i>. I think the answer is absolutely clear; yes, it is. The citations in durable media that have been given (without any exceptions that I can see) attest to the political act's notability.</li>
<li><i>Is the coinage successful in that it has entered the language in a permanent way?</i> The article rightly says that this is unknown. The burden of proof is on those who would argue that it has. There is a long list of usage citations on the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:santorum" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:santorum" rel="nofollow">talk page at Wiktionary</a>; these were all assessed (by an editor there) as failing to come from independent sources. Several people above have made comments to the effect that it has entered the language, but no evidence has been presented beyond the citations which (I would argue) only show the effectiveness of the political act. It also needs to be acknowledged that part of the political action that Savage and his readers are engaged in is explicitly to make the word appear to be in general use. I'm not criticizing this, just commenting that it's evidently so, and that this makes the need for citations in independent sources paramount before any assertion can be made (on WP, at least) that the term has real currency. Without independent evidence, WP should not state that the term has entered the language. We clearly do not have that evidence.</li>
<li><i>Should the political act (and hence the coinage) be mentioned in Wikipedia?</i> The answer is pretty clearly yes; the citations make a strong case.</li>
<li><i>Does it need a separate article?</i> This one seems trickier. Although I don't suspect any particular editor here of not acting in good faith, I have to say that if I were one of the people who followed Savage's exhortation to "get the word out there", I would argue strongly in favour of keeping this as a separate article. That's because that would in turn lend support to Savage's stated goal of having an established word out there to outrage the Senator. However, given that AfD is not a vote, I don't think this is too much of a concern; the closing admin is going to look at the arguments, not the votes.</li>
<li><i>What should the title be, if it's a separate article?</i> I could support a separate article if it were (a) clearly titled in a way that made it about the political action by Dan Savage, and not titled in a way that makes it appear the word has gained real currency, and (b) made clear in the title that the content would be offensive to some. This latter criterion is important for the following reason. Suppose that we title this article "santorum (political act by Dan Savage)". Then on the dab page, someone might click on the article who might be very offended by the content. This is precisely the goal intended by Savage's campaign: to present Santorum's supporters with this offensive material as a jolt. We should present this information in such a way as neither to further nor unfairly hinder Savage's campaign. WP is not censored, so that's not the issue: the issue is that we should not mislead viewers with the title. The current title accurately meets criterion (b), but not (a). A title such as "santorum (political act by Dan Savage)" meets (a) but not (b). The only way of ensuring both would be some title such as "santorum (sexual slang term coined as political act)". That would work for me, but a merge back to <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a> seems more sensible, because given that the entry is really about a political act, it fits naturally within that article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 16:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Pan Dan: at this point, can you honestly say that there will ever be consensus for this AfD?

<li>Well, as for consensus, the closing admin will determine that. As for the arguments themselves, yes, some of them have been going around in circles. However Mike Christie has just come in with what I'd call a middle position; I will be curious to see what folks think of his views. As for <i>political</i> polarization, I have to disagree with you there, I don't see any evidence of that, although I anticipated that many Wikipedians, who travel in liberal social circles, would weigh in with comments like "of course this is notable" -- see 3rd paragraph of my nom. I don't suspect anybody here of bad faith, I just think many folks have an inflated view of the notability of this term because of their social circles. Sort of like movie critic Pauline Kael (a liberal living in New York City) exclaiming after Nixon's 1972 landslide victory (he won every state but Massachusetts), <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_6_39/ai_104517836" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_6_39/ai_104517836" rel="nofollow">"<i>I don't know how Richard Nixon could have won.

<dd>You <i>think</i> it's notable? As in, "it's notable because all my friends have heard of it and use it"? That's exactly the point I was making by saying Kael lived in NYC -- she had a liberal social network and her view of what was going on in the country was badly skewed for that reason. Had she been a liberal living out in rural Missouri, she would have had a different social network and therefore a different view. In addition, what you say makes me suspect that your concept of notability may be subjective, and, as the venerable <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> said to me a while back, <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability is not subjective</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So because I'm from a blue state I'm unfit to evaluate the notability of this article? As for my "liberal social network", when I said I was a fascist that wasn't a euphemism. I genuinely believe people aren't fit to democratically govern themselves (this debate reminds me why). As to the "subjectiveness" of notability, don't be silly, of course it's subjective. The fact that it's based on "non-trivial" sources, with "non-trivial" left nebulously defined, pretty much assures at least a degree of subjectivity. Clearly the disagreement here is that you believe the article's citations to be trivial, while a good number of disagree. Objectivity, on Wiki as everywhere else, is a goal to be striven for, not something that is ever actually accomplished. Just because the venerable <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> says a thing doesn't make it true. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 04:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both of you are making my point beautifully. You heard of the neologism "santorum" because you probably have friends who are fans of Dan Savage (or friends who are friends of fans, or, etc.). You never heard of "drive-by media" because you probably don't have friends who are Limbaugh fans.

<dd>This is a fair point. I also think that we could have a very lively discussion on why some users do/don't find this notable.

However its popularity among liberals may -- just may -- help explain the views of some people in this debate.

He lost considerable credibility within his own party at being the...um, "butt" (HA!) of a national joke.

<li><b>Comment</b> I live in Pennsylvania and voted for Casey myself, and the slang terminology 'Santorum' had no impact on my decision. Pennsylvania voted him out because they were tired of him mimicking Bush's views/votes. The sexual slang played little, if any role at all, with his defeat. And, hypothetically, if sexual slang unseated a senator, our nation is very sad. -Yours truly, the voice of reason -<a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverHockey_3a2d.html" title="User:RiverHockey">RiverHockey</a> 01:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Regarding both above comments, I have no trouble at all understanding the arguments for deletion, particularly Pan Dan's. I just disagree on a perhaps philosophical level. I truly hope that the tangential injection of an essentially non-partisan politically-oriented discussion above doesn't taint editors' impressions of the good faith in which the delete&#160;!votes are being made. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 19:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not as familiar with American politics as most Editors, I imagine, so I'll steer clear of that - specifically, the more I read the relevent articles, the more Santorum seems to be a more important politician than I had guessed. That said, I also <i>understand</i> Pan Dan's argument for deletion, but it's factually incorrect in a number of regards. Tangential discussion of politics + lots of delete&#160;!votes on a article no reasonable editor could&#160;!vote delete for is a highly suggestive situation - I was hoping editors would take a reminder to be objective. I think WJB's noting that:

<dd>I'm happy to give you credit for noting it first. I mentioned WJB because I stole his phrasing. Apart from which, you accuse the article of failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which is patent nonsense - lots of reasonable coverage have been noted here. Your nomination also says the article fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> - again, patent nonsense. Third party coverage has a sort of weird quality to it. Most of the references aren't quite trivial, albeit they are fairly shallow. A lot more comes directly from Dan Savage (which I suspect you'll argue is not a third party source - a position I'm not convinced either way on). Apart from which, as low as my opinion about <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten.com.html" title="Rotten.com">rotten.com</a> is, it's almost certainly a reliable, third party source (ugh!). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

The references are trivial, because they are nothing to build an encyclopedia article on without conducting <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. However, even though I disagree with what you say, I'm not going to call it "nonsense" or "factually incorrect."

<dd>You're being far too generous in what you're calling <i>Trivial coverage</i>. <i>Trivial coverage</i> is of a fundamentally differnt nature from <i>Shallow coverage</i>. A large number of shallow sources can be used to build an article, a large number of trivial sources can't. '<i>Duplication of information</i> is also not a criterion for deletion - lots of articles duplicate information found elsewhere, if only for readability's sake.

Many of the words we select, esp. for categories such as 'most outrageous', are stunt words with no real currency. The nomination or election of a word in one of the ADS words-of-the-year categories has nothing to do with whether the word is truly current."

I don't see anything really bad enough to warrant deletion. The irony is still existant and I could understand why some people may want to delete the article. Take for example Newsweek, New York: Jan 3, 2005.Vol.145, Iss. 1; pg. 89, 3 pgs states "As the third-ranking Republican in a majority soon to expand to 55 members, Santorum is close to the White House, operates one of the largest personal campaign funds and is a point man on hot-button issues ranging from gay marriage to Social Security." I haven't read through this vulgar wiki article but I bet you anthing it is the anti-thesis of Rick Santorum.</dd>
<dd>The debate will probably continue on for a long time. And I believe it is related to the person Rick Santorum. Newsweek has even said:
<dl>
<dd>“[RICK SANTORUM] had better get used to it. Attacks-from right and left-are sure to rise as he juggles the sometimes clashing roles of Senate power broker and cultural militant.

Yet he can't do that too often or he'll lose what is distinctive about his political persona.”<a href="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=772615531&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" class="external autonumber" title="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=772615531&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li>1) Yes, you're right. It's not a vote. Poor choice of wording on my part, though I think it makes my point (which is the important part). 2) The AfD discussion for "idiotarian" was just closed a few minutes ago. Perhaps if people were more consistant, that article wouldn't have been deleted. 3) "Idiotarian" is far and away better known and more widely used than "santorum" or even "fitzmas." That much is obvious. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 21:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My bad for not checking the closure time. But to say that <i>Idiotarian</i> is obviously more widely known than Santorum is clearly false. I, for one, have heard Santorum in my real life, never Idiotarian or Fitzmas. This may be a regional or political or social or economic thing - as people, all we need to have in common to be here is a basic grasp of English - so what seems obvious to you may not be obvious to others, or even true. That said, I've little doubt some a few "voters" used to <i>Do I know about this in real life test?</i> that although unsanctioned, I see applied often (and have probably applied once or twice myself). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

This makes it an odd case, because it seems to me clear that the term has no real currency, and nobody has presented any evidence that it does -- just assertions. So we have a term that is <b>not</b> a demonstrably successful neologism, but clearly <b>is</b> a successful <b>something</b>.

<li>Wikipedia has no "policy" on neologism. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is a guideline, not a policy, and I find it distressing how many people treat guidelines as Holy Writ: that which passes the guidelines deserves to stay, that which fails them must go. This is not the case and never was, nor should it be. This is a term that was coined as a political attack, and I doubt (despite WilyD's undoubtedly good-faith assertion) that there are any reliable sources that have used the term without the underlying political intent. In a few years, after Rick Santorum has faded into obscurity, if the term is still in widespread use, by all means create an article on the subject, but for now the article is premature at best. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 06:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The word is a neologism, and the article provides no evidence that it is "sexual slang" rather than a representation of the controversy which Dan Savage created in protest of Rick Santorum's statements. My personal rule of thumb is that if people feel the need to popularize a word, then said word is still a neologism, and shouldn't have its own article here. In the absence of Dan Savage's efforts to popularize the word in a <i>political</i> context, rather than a <i>common use</i> context, this word would be completely non-existent except as a surname.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am surprised there is even a debate about this article - I never usually intervene in these things nor am I too familiar with the Wikipedia policy regarding the notability of articles but I strongly believe this article should be kept. Strangely enough, as a foreigner studying in North Carolina, I heard several people use the term and I even saw someone wearing a t-shirt with the definition on campus. Only months after having first heard the term did I realize Santorum was in fact a senator in PA, as I am not too familiar with American politics. I know my example is a bit extreme but I think it reflects how much the term has infiltrated subcultures on US campuses and in the LGBT community. I think articles detailing the origin of such terms are exactly what make Wikipedia so unique and interesting - which is why I believe, whether you agree with the term or not, these are quite important to keep. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVincentl_7002.html" title="User:Vincentl">Vincentl</a> 18:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>As myself and others have noticed on the talk page, the only reference to it on google is the page itself. There are some references on google to a <i>four state area</i> that is a broad region, whose metropolitan center is not Joplin, Missouri. However seeing as how the article is serving basically as the Joplin Metropolitan Area page, and contains nothing in its title to distinguish itself from other four state areas or even to locate it in Missouri, its validity is in question as well as its purpose. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrey_Wanderer_3f39.html" title="User:Grey Wanderer">Grey Wanderer</a> 00:41, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The phenomena of "Four State" isn't exactly a common one that every person grows up experiencing. Growing up in central Virginia, I'd never heard any other state referenced. Nor did I experience it in Southern California or later in the D.C. Metropolitan area. Rather than rashly delete this article, I suggest that it be modified to include other "Four State" areas. However, I can attest and a smart Google search can reveal, that the "Four State" slogan is very strongly followed in the Joplin region. With little effort on the Joplin talk page, I threw out three links to two major tv affiliates and a national restaurant chain that identified the area as Four States. Thus, I don't think it'd be hard to verify it. So keep. Modify. Expand. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelAt_3723.html" title="User:RebelAt"><font color="#3333CC">~ <font size="1" color="red">(The Rebel At)</font> ~</font></a> 05:26, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s> for now... simply because the term is used regionally does not make it the basis for an encyclopedic article. There are similar regionalisms for "tri-county", "tri-city", "quad-county", etc., and to have lengthy articles (or one article with multiple definitions) on each similar non-politically demarcated term would border on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. However, if possible, the presentation at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tri-state_area.html" title="Tri-state area">Tri-state area</a> or something like <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark-La-Tex_1e01.html" title="Ark-La-Tex">Ark-La-Tex</a> could be used as a basis for a simpler article that does not essentially repeat the information found in the Joplin city article. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 06:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>DELETE</b> I love these AFD's simply because they are easy to defend. First, the World Of Warcraft game has over 7.5 million users world wide. The World of Warcraft english forums have over 2 million registered users. Eve:Online has a userbase of just under a million gamers, while the Eve:online Forums have just over 190,000 registered users. Just because these forums are part of a notable game, it doesn't make them in-and-of themselves notable. The Sci-Fi.com offical forums are often visited and posted on by people such as Ronald Moore (the creator of sci-fi's battlestar galactica) some of the BSG cast and the many writers of the Stargate series. As of today they have 60,162 registered users.

</ul>
</li>
<li>ok, lets break down <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and this article...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Web-specific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) <i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Not that I can find. It has been mentioned <b>in passing</b> my newspaper articles, but a couple sentances or a mention of the BBS in an article talking about saving the "Enterprise" tv show does not qualify as a valid source.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations. except for the following:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a) <i>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.</i></dd>
<dd>b) <i>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A mention in passing is exactly what the article on the "save enterprise campaign" was, hence...trivial. I was mentioned (actually quoted) in a newspaper article about a local 300 person LAN party. Does that mean I mean <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and deserve a wikipedia article of my own?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2) <i>The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>No, it has not. Examples of such awards: Eisner Awards, Bloggies or Webby Awards. See <a href="../../../a/w/a/Category%7EAwards_ea71.html" title="Category:Awards">Category:Awards</a> for more. Being nominated for an award in multiple years is also considered an indicator of notability. This site has not won any.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>3) <i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, No it is not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well it doesn't provide such proof and as far as I can see, does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Those arguing it does, please point out how.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The published works must be someone else writing about the company, corporation, product, or service. (See Wikipedia:Autobiography for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>

<p>– No, you don't get an article of your own, any more than Bonnie Malmat would. But if you were part of a 6.000 person group that helped start a LAN party that was reported on throughout North America, then yes, maybe that group deserves a mention. TrekBBS was the place where those groups began, where their founders came from, and it's still a place where published and established writers and many other Trek notables have joined and participated, and continue to participate. <a href="../../../e/l/h/User%7EElHoserGrande_6e70.html" title="User:ElHoserGrande">ElHoserGrande</a> 05:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The burden of proof is on those who advocate retaining this article, not on those trying to ditch it. Proponents of keeping this article have yet to provide any affirming evidence that TrekBBS meets the notability standards, in particular an independent source making significant reference to/commentary upon the site. So far, the strongest contention I've seen for notability is the TrekBBS-UGO connection, i.e. #3 under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>: site is published by well known folks independent from site's creators.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The word "notable", at Wikipedia, means nothing more nor less than "there exist sufficient reliable sources to write a verifiable encyclopedia article about this topic." His being the first to do this or that might make him <i>significant</i>, in some sense, but that doesn't help us unless it's published somewhere. The only correct way to argue "notability" is to cite sources. This idea that, because we don't have much on Australian wrestling, we can apply IAR and ignore Verifiability.... I don't think you'll find there's consensus for this idea, but rather that it flies in the face of Wikipedia's basic mission, which is to provide verifiable information on every topic for which that is possible.

<dd>I neither voted delete nor made any claim about this article, did I? I simply suggested that ivoking WP:IAR to bypass WP:NOR or WP:V - even in special cases - is a bad argument, without consensus support. I haven't looked at this article; I'm just saying that IF it should be kept, it'll be because of sources, and not for any other reason. You said, "<i><a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> also applies in this case due to the limited size of the Australian database.</i>" That is not a good argument, and I suggest you'll have more success arguing from sources than claiming that anything justifies going without them. If "flexibility on verifiability" means anything other than going without sources, you've yet to make that clear. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:18, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bacchus if you'll just look at the article and see what I've done with the notes, you'll have a better idea of what I'm talking about with "flexibility of verifiability". The original line as I understood it was that sources had to be online. My point is - and always was - in Australia that's not always possible. Hence, if anyone tries to say "if it's not online it fails verifiability", that's when I'll apply <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>.

<p>(deindent)It was one of Booyaka's key argument points, and the lack of objection at the time led me to believe it to be the case. OK, Booyaka's completely unreliable when it comes to policy (which is why I wish I'd known about <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> at the time) but the lack of reaction to his hard and fast view re proof was not helpful. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurse_of_Fenric_f242.html" title="User:Curse of Fenric">[[User:Curse of Fenric/sig</a>]] 08:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure exactly how you're finding IAR relevant here. There's no rule that says print sources are bad, so I'm not sure what you're wanting to ignore. The best way to know what <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> say is not to take Booyaka's word for it, or mine, but to read them. Anyway, I'm glad we seem to be coming to an understanding, and I'm sorry it took so long to work out why we were disagreeing. I didn't see Booyaka saying sources needed to be online, or I would have said something sooner. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 12:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> As of right now I would vote delete, as the article seems to have no relevant contribution to professional wrestling. At best, I consider this article a stub with little to validate.

<p>This page is mostly a summary of what happens in both Twilight and New Moon.

<li><b>Delete</b>, better to start from scratch. This is apparently an "article" about a fictional character that appears in two novels, and its only content is a summary of that fiction with no real world facts. In this form, it's merely a copyright violation, as the academic context of real world description and commentary is what allows us to make a fair use claim to summarize fiction. It would have to be completely rewritten to be acceptable. Perhaps more to the point, the two articles on the two novels are already in an encyclopedic format and contain summaries of their stories. This is therefore completely useless <i>and</i> redundant. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 02:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Originally, the article was a redirect to <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Peter_Cullen_ad42.html" title="Edward Peter Cullen">Edward Peter Cullen</a>, a bishop who has nothing to do with the current subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate people editing the article, but its <i>really</i> making it alot worse. The article SHOULD look like a fictional character 'biography' (if thats even the correct word to use), I would do it, but I have little experience in doing such things. If someone wants to try and tackle this article, take a look at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter (character)</a> or any of the HP character articles. Those are well done, and what an article like Edward Cullen should look like. I love Stephenie Meyer's series, and this article does not do it justice. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinclination_d9e1.html" title="User:Disinclination">Disinclination</a> 02:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> ironosora I created a much different article when I first wrote it. People have changed it so much that I think its gotten a bit ridiculous. The article should be more like the Harry Potter one, but to make it that detailed I'll need more people to help and fewer people to change the content that drastically. None of my actual original writing has even been left there. I think that the actual content should be deleted, but the article itself should remain. If there's anyone out there to help me make a better one, message me and we can make a truly worthy article. I felt it necessary to give him his own article as he is such a fascinating character. So, message me if you want to make this work.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> CrazyDaisy1444 I think that with some editing and cleaning up, this article could work. It's not just a summary of Twilight and New Moon, since it includes outside information about the character's past and family that is not included in the novels. I agree that it should look like a fictional character biography, like the Harry Potter articles, and I don't think that this article should be deleted yet.</li>

<dd>According to the article, he is ranked 237th in the world. None of those ranked 1-236. appear to have Wikipedia biographies.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Worldwide, he may be 237th, but he's best in Canada. As far as I could figure out, he's playing the variant of paddle tennis that's also called padel. The variant invented in 1969, not the variant invented in 1898. Padel doesn't have its own Wikipedia article, but it's quite possible it should. They seem to have professional leagues in Spain and Argentine, possibly Mexico, but alas, I cannot read Spanish. I'd really prefer the article about padel to be made first. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecateur_0e1f.html" title="User:Secateur">Secateur</a> 00:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My fault, Wikipedia does have its own Wikipedia article, but it's called padel tennis. That article has problems of its own, but it seems like padel tennis is a huge thing in Spain and Argentine. I'll leave that to editors fluent in Spanish. I found some international ranking at <a href="http://www.padelfip.com/rankingM2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.padelfip.com/rankingM2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.padelfip.com/rankingM2.html</a> which ranks him as 114th in a 33-way tie, together with three other Canadians. And, by the way, this article is about the Canadian padel player, not the Scottish badminton player with the same name.<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecateur_0e1f.html" title="User:Secateur">Secateur</a> 01:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are using 1 source to write an article on all Islams view of the bible? That doesnt strike you as a PoV problem when the entire article is written from the view of that one author? You havent addressed the original point again, how can an article attempt to list the views of "Islam on the bible", when there are so many different sects, groups, extreme views, individual beliefs etc. The religion itself cannot have a view on a different religious text, unless it says it in the Quran, and the entire Quran is accepted by all Islam to the same degree, then its inherently PoV. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 23:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I recall an article along the lines of Atheists' view of Jesus - which makes as much sense as Left-handed bus drivers' view of cowboy hats. Atheists as a group don't <i>have</i> a organized views of each religious figure. Individual atheists might have personal opinions but portraying that as an organized view is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> at best. Does Islam have an organized view of the Bible? The article currently has two sources; any evidence that those are Islam's view as opposed to the views of the authors of the articles? Surely if a group of 1.4 billion people has an organized view it is widely documented in a large number of reliable sources that largely agree with each other.

<li>As far as I know, it is possible to talk of a general orthodox "Islamic view of the Bible", so I don't think NuclearZero's worries are particularly well-founded. Muslim scholars have been engaging with their Christian and Jewish counterparts in controversies about the Bible and the Koran since the Middle Ages. If the views of certain Islamic sects diverge from mainstream Muslim theological opinion on this issue, it should be possible to cover them too. But I agree with Zunaid that this article should be deleted and recreated from scratch when someone turns up who is willing to put the effort in to write a decent page (ideally using reputable scholarly sources - e.g. the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>?).

<li><b>Comment.</b> Nice work on the sourcing and rewrite, Bwithh. On the face of the information it still however does seem to me to be a legend or tale of more contemporary provenance, than something which is explicitly documented for the pre-Columbian Aztec. A pity the exhibition and those guidebooks don't seem to say anything more than "according to legend". So perhaps the article could be recategorised/annotated as a more general/recent legend, but anyways granted that there are sufficient references to these particular versions.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 08:19,</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> As long as the story is called "mexican folklore" and not "aztec mythology" I don't have a problem with it. It certainly is well known both in Mexico and in guidebooks. I have asked a wide forum of nahuatl specialists and while all of them know the story and some of them know it from modern nahuatl communities none of them know anything that might suggest a precolumbian origin of the story.

<p>Reason <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 05:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reason got omitted, so I add: Non notable author. Writer of several books, but with almost no reviews, none for most of them--and none at all in mainstream media. Ditto for video interview. Article pushes POV of the subject. I realize this is not an autobio, but it certainly reads like one. If non-verifiable material were removed, if there would be nothing left. Listed for prod, but tag removed.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Keep</b> First, let me state that I removed the tag and was in the process of adding sources when you nommed this article here. That is perfectly fine, but I wanted to make sure you and the other editors understand that my removal of the prod tag wasn't in bad faith. It was just my first step in working to add sources and clean-up the article, as per the tag's instructions. With that stated, I would note the following about DGG's edit summaries' claims and those he notes above in the nomination:</p>
<ul>
<li>On notability: Vance's work has been published in either electronic or hardcopy format by <a href="../../../l/e/w/LewRockwell.com_6ae0.html" title="LewRockwell.com">LewRockwell.com</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiwar.com.html" title="Antiwar.com">Antiwar.com</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mises.org.html" title="Mises.org">Mises.org</a>, <a href="../../../i/h/s/IHS_Press_3894.html" title="IHS Press">IHS Press</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_Economic_Education_07ea.html" title="Foundation for Economic Education">Foundation for Economic Education</a>. Notability here may be drawn from the fact that he has been published in numerous sources which have thus far been deemed by the community to be notable.</li>
<li>On POV-pushing: I certainly share many of Vance's views, but I wear them on <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">my sleeve</a> and try to comply with WP:NPOV. Now, I am not sure which parts DGG considers to be in non-compliance because DGG has not discussed them on the talk page or corrected them himself. I would invite other editors to determine whether the verbiage constitutes POV-pushing.</li>
<li>On vanity: I am not and have never been Laurence Vance, nor have I been asked by Vance to write/edit this article. I believe that other editors will vouch for the fact that I exist!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 06:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never thought you were, nor that you had been asked to write it. Just that he was presented in a way that is normally associated with vanity. An uncritical admirer often does that, even without intending to. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 23:49, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>DGG: Again, I am not claiming to be perfect. I think every contributor's work, including my own, can be improved by input from others. If you think the style of the text is in conflict with WP:NPOV or some other Wikipedia policy, please make it compliant. Thus far, I'm still not sure of the specific problems that you are seeing, and without specific examples it is hard to make things better. I'm also not sure that simple NPOV compliance issues are germane to an AfD, especially since you seem to indicate that you don't believe I am acting in bad faith. I suppose you won't want to do this till after this current AfD finishes out, but if the article is kept I hope you'll collaborate with myself and others on the article talk page to make the article better. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 01:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't think Dick is doing wrong here, the subject has some external currency and appears to be getting better sourced with each edit, so I'll go with a <b>weak keep</b> for now, revisit in a month or so to see a more settled version. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Lexis/Nexis has a few hits for him, but they almost admit "this guy means nothing." For example, the following, from a wire service called Inter Press Service that I had never heard of before, in September,</li>

<dd>I'm sorry, what in that statement "almost admits" that "this guy means nothing"? It is common for editorials to give information about the author (i.e. "the author is currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution and was U.S. Secretary of State from 1971 to 1977."). Oh yeah, <b>Keep</b> per Dick and the publications he lists. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 02:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi

This is good enough to convince me that the existence of this group is not a hoax. Monastic orders may not have big Internet footprints. I must admit I was suspicious, mostly because of the name: why would a Ukrainian order have a Latin name?

<li><b>Keep</b>. External links have been added to the Autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America of which Solus Christi Brothers is a monastic community, and the link to the Solus Christi website has also been added. Why a Latin name for an Eastern community? Well, a Latin name is more understandable and, therefore, more universal, in the United States and in Latin America than a Ukrainian name would be.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Thaurisil has misread the notability claim. The house is not a museum or conserved, it is just well-kept and has been added to a LOCAL listing of structures with historic ties. It is not a designated landmark (by the same entity) as are several other sites in the town, nor does it seem to have been given any provincial or federal designation that would be the equivalent of the US <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> or the UK <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_building.html" title="Listed building">Listed building</a>.

<p>I'm not quite sure what makes a radio program notable or not, so I don't have any policy to go on here. Truthfully, it looks to me like advertising especially considering phrases like "wildly popular". I'll <b>abstain</b> as I don't know what the official policy on this type of thing is. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small> 14:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>this is from the talk page:</p>
<p>this seems like an accurate discription of the show, how else would you suggest to fix this problem? Ryn2me 14:30, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>also 'wildly popular' would be an accurate discription, seeing as they lead the ratings in the markets in which they broadcast Ryn2me</p>
<p>is the advertising tag going to be addressed or not? —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Ryn2me (talk • contribs).</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep, I just came back to look at the talk page now. Generally, adverbs indicate a non-POV article. "Wildly popular" would be better served by actually stating the specific numbers. I'm going to try and hunt down the notability requirements for a radio show. I'll reply here within 24 hours as to what I've found. --Brad Beattie (talk) 06:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>also...i think you missed a step with nominating the article, you did not notify me like you were supposed to, since i am the creator Ryn2me 14:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i think this is a good quality article that should remain and just should be edited to make it better Ryn2me 18:47, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>keep Ryn2me 21:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If this article gets deleted then you should look at deleting all other syndicated radio shows and even look at TV shows because, seeing as how having something that is broadcast across such a large market doesn't make it notable and having formed a nationally recognized charitee, then what will Ryn2me 22:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - syndicated radio program. Multiple award nominations (but where are the refs?). It's notable in my book. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a> 07:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I am not convinced on the notability issue as the syndication is, currently, 8 local markets - clearly Ace &amp; TJ are not in the same league as Howard Stern. The article itself is very weak and reads more like advertising copy than a serious enycylopaedic srticle.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote this article as best I could being a listener to the show...I present facts from the show, controversies that have surrounded the show and connections to other articles. I can try to fix it as best I can and, if someone wants to actually edit it like what Wikipedia is meant for, they can do that for. Also, if you want to take a look at other radio show articles, like Bob and Tom, they are not much different from this one. Ryn2me 02:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Doesn't appear to be notable and the <i>total lack of sources</i> means that no notability has been established nor has the show even really been verified.

Article does not cite "multiple third-party reliable sources" indicating its notability or verifying its content.

<p>I'm nominating this material because I think that it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The exact same material was added to the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11%7E11.html" title="11:11">11:11</a> article a day or two ago, and I removed it for the same reason. I offered to discuss my reasoning with the editor who created it, to see if we could reach a consensus, but no reply came. So I am bringing it to afd, to reach consensus. The original 11:11 article is in the state it is in, because of several afd's also. Basically my reasons are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of the word "phenomenon" in the title and throughout the article is inaccurate and misleading. What this article purports to describe is a belief held by some people that there exists a causal relationship between the number 1111 or the time of day 11:11 am or pm and events in the world. For this to belief to be even considered a phenomenon, we would have to include material from reputable journals in which investigators were performing experiments to determine whether or not the relationship exists and its nature. No such sources were cited in this article to lend creedence to this causal relationship.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I provided no sources because there are none. I don't believe that there is a link between the number 11:11 and anything in nature. What I have observed (and provided many cites for) is that many people *do* believe that there is something special about 11:11, many notable people have claimed as such, and thus the claim itself has become notable enough to warrant it's inclusion. I noticed you deleted the list to songs and albums entitled 11:11, did you do that because you honestly believe it's some big cosmic coincidence that people are entitling these things "11:11". Wouldn't that be funny if you did? Basically you'd be admitting to the fact that YOU see 11:11 everywhere!
<dl>
<dd>That does not necessarily follow. I deleted the list because it already existed on <a href="../../../1/1/_/11%7E11.html" title="11:11">11:11</a> and I saw no reason to include it in this related article. My personal beliefs about numerology, numbers or this number in particular are not relevant to the discussion. As you say, "I have observed..." but you have not published your observations in a reputable source, and that's one of the reasons why I think this is original research.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 05:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That there is a seperate list on a seperate article does not preclude the information from being included in this article. (Of course I think the articles should be outright merged!) I put the list in in an unbiased manner by using a qualifying word "may". I don't think it is unfair to allow the reader to at least speculate that there is a connection between more than eight songs, albums, and movies named "11:11" and this (perhaps totally unrelated thing) people just happen to know as "11:11". I don't see how you can disallow the information to co-mingle on the same page unless you honestly believe that there isn't a reasonable chance the two might be related. If there is such a chance then I think we have a responsibility to craft and article that at least presents that information together. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I do not like the usage of the word "phenomenon", and I am quite open to the idea of that part of the article being changed. In fact I think this content should simply be included in the 11:11 article. I see no point in having two articles since the "phenomenon" or whatever you want to call it is almost always simply refered to as "11:11". Instead of deleting the content outright maybe you could take a moment to edit the content to make it better. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again why I don't work to improve this article is not relevant to this discussion. However, I will simply say that I don't because this is not an issue of quality but whether or not the material is original research. If I can I try to help with articles that I feel I can improve, but I feel no obligation to improve articles that are o.r since <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is one of the pillars of wikipedia. I have endeavored to make it very clear that is my only reason for nominating this article. I outlined all these reasons simply to make my reasoning clear and impersonal.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 05:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article claims that George Noory popularized this belief. Since popularize can mean either to make popular, or to explain in a simple manner, the article needs to cite sources and expand and clarify the statement. The only other statement regarding Noory, is that some people appeared on his show, to discuss their belief. There are 3 links given as references for that. 2 are brief blurbs that do not mention a specific person or persons. The third is a brief announcement about an upcoming show. The material on that does not really explain the person's beliefs. It's my opinion that nothing in the article supports the claim about Noory, so the claim is original research.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My appologies. The content actually being cited is the radio programme itself. The interviews on the show are quite long and in-depth, usually about three hours long. If the citation needs to be done differently to refelct that it is the content of the program itself, and not the website being linked to, then so be it. I just figured it was obvious in this case. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What seems obvious to me is that Noory has had one or two people on his show to talk about their beliefs. To me, this does not support the claim that he "popularized" the belief. I need to see more links, from someone other than noory before I can understand how this conclusion was arrived at.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 05:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it still seems like a lot to me, considering the plethora of other subjects that are given a three-hour spotlight on this or that night. I mean if it were two articles in the Washington Post, those would be okay to cite. But being featured on a radio show that is listened to more people than any other in that time slot, that doesn't rank. I wouldn't argue that the source is reputable, but I do believe the source is quite notable and that in turn makes the subject notable, and I believe that is enough to warrant it's inclusion in wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Another sentence reads "Another common claim...". This sentence is another assertion that is not supported by anything else in the article. The sentence then points to a self published website (the link is broken) that is very confusing and simply seems to represent one person's belief. Since the website appears self-published and has probably not been peer reviewed or fact checked, it probably does not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">wikipedia's guidelines for reputable sources</a>. It's the equivalent of adding the following line to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_cat.html" title="Black cat">Black cat</a>.

<li>Uri Geller seems to be used as some sort of expert on the subject. Although why Uri Geller is considered an expert on what people do and do not believe regarding 11:11 is not made clear. I visited this link, and I believe the statement is incorrect. The only thing Uri Geller says about September 11 is "I believe that those who died on September 11th did not die in vain." The sentence is an inaccurate representation (and confusing) of the material on that page.</li>

<dd>Uri Geller is a notable person making an extraordinary claim.

<li>The use of the word skeptic in the last line is both non neutral and misleading. Since the article is primarily talking about a belief that people might share, then there are only people who believe and people who don't. Only in the context of discussing a theory that has been proposed and/or tested is the word skeptic meaningful. So the last line only really describes one possible reason why some people might not believe, and ignores all the other reasons why people might not believe.</li>

<dd>"Eleven Eleven" is without a doubt a theory that has been proposed many times by some fairly notable people, but it has never been tested (how could it be?). I think the word "skeptic" can be used in this case, and if not then I invite you to change it. And why don't you add more reasons people don't believe instead of complaining about the lack of reasons? That an article is missing some information doesn't make it a candidate for deletion, it simply makes it a stub. This section is something I would like to expand, and at the time I had intended to include a link to comment James Randi had made on the subject but at the time I could not find that information. -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's the rub for me. There is a difference between belief and theory. I think that editors in an encyclopedia should be very careful about their wording. To me, a theory is an explanation that I develop about a phenomenon that I can observe, repeat and reproduce. I develop a theory, to explain why the phenomenon that I observed happened the way it did. A theory is then something that I can design tests to disprove. If I can disprove my theory, I go onto another one. A belief is slightly different. A belief is an explanation for a phenomenon that I (or anyone else) might never have actually observed but I may consider to be within the realm of possibility. As an example, let's say I chose a large sample of songs from all of the songs ever written. I then analyzed those songs to determine the frequency with which those lyrics or titles included a number or numbers. Further suppose that as a result of my calculations I concluded that the number 1111 occurred more frequently than any other number to such an extent that made it statistically abnormal. Now I've observed something. I now develope theories to explain it. I could develop theories that would be impossible to test (cosmic rays caused the anomaly) to relatively easy to test (my sample was biased). My long point, I gathered data, and then developed theories. As an example of a belief, as a kid I believed in the Loch Ness monster. I had never seen it, never been to Scotland, never met anyone who had encountered the creature. The only "evidence" I had were fuzzy photographs and stories that would now be called urban legends. I still held out the possibility that the lake might contain a creature. My belief was not a theory. If you read this far, good for you.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 05:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The article clearly needs a lot of work, but I think it's noteworthy how many people have some belief in this. For example, last year there was a local controversy in <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a> when the area manager for <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knology.html" title="Knology">Knology</a> wrote some letters to the editor about his beliefs on the subject, which eventually resulted in an <a href="http://www.rinf.com/news/nov05/newworldorder.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rinf.com/news/nov05/newworldorder.html" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with him by a <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville_News_Sentinel_a428.html" title="Knoxville News Sentinel">Knoxville News Sentinel</a> columnist (the original seems to be broken on the knoxnews.com website, but that's a copy of it), and finally his being fired by Knology for the negative publicity. I've found other non-local websites (on conspiracy theories, freedom of speech, religion, etc.) that picked up on this (<a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1520667/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1520667/posts" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> and <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/bbs/message.php?messageid=182351&amp;mpage=1&amp;showdate=11/14/05" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/bbs/message.php?messageid=182351&amp;mpage=1&amp;showdate=11/14/05" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, in addition to the above site with the copy of the interview). Also, a quick google for 11:11 turned up a number of pages devoted to the phenomenon: <a href="http://www.the111experience.org/index_01112007.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.the111experience.org/index_01112007.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://www.1111spiritguardians.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1111spiritguardians.com/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/11coin.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatdreams.com/11coin.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://www.1111angels.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1111angels.com/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://www.1111progressgroup.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1111progressgroup.com/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. All that, plus the long page by Uri Geller on the subject and the mentions on Coast to Coast (both prime sources for those inclined to such beliefs), makes me think that this is at least as significant as a lot of other paranormal theories we have pages for. (No, I'm not a conspiracy type myself, and I think this is probably is a case of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">confirmation bias</a>, but it's something that seems sufficiently notable to warrant a page.) <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 17:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I took a brief look at the links regarding this topic, they all seem to me to be self-published websites. I don't think that they would meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">wikipedia's guidelines on reliable sources</a>. Regarding controversis, if there has been a well publicized controversy, in reputable sources, regarding someone's belief in this synchronicity, then yes, that might make a notable article. Once again, Uri Geller seems only tangentially related to this topic. His views on it are only his own. I think the current material in this article mischaracterizes his statements and belief. I scanned the material on his website and believe that the one line summary presented here is inaccurate, confusing and misleading. It might be better to simply have a list of famous people who share this belief. Relevant links that might be useful for this article would be ones that supply information on when/where the beliefs originated; how widespread they are; different variations on the beliefs, etc. In which case, the article might be better titled "Beliefs regarding 1111". My main point, is that this article is non neutral and inaccurate in that it is presenting people's beliefs as actual verified facts. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 17:49, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I just meant the websites to be evidence that there are a fair number of people who believe it, not reliable sources for evidence of its truth. I envision the article as a description of the idea, with, as you said, explanations about its history, variations on the idea, and notable believers, just like any article about a non-provable concept. (Links to such sites are probably thus relevant, not as sources for the factuality of the concept, but as examples of the belief in it -- the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> article has a link to the Vatican's web page, but obviously the article doesn't attempt to present <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">Papal infallibility</a> as a fact). Clearly the 11:11 article is in need of a lot of work to make it an objective description of the concept and beliefs on the subject, but I think much of what's discussed is relevant (for example, the fact that Uri Geller has a page about it is significant, since he's famous because of his belief in paranormal phenomena), just in need of being expanded, better presented, and documented. This is an AfD discussion, though, so the important question is not whether the current article is good, but whether there should be an article about this in the Wikipedia; based on the reasons I originally listed, I think there definitely should be, though clearly it should be tagged for cleanup. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 18:44, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the reply. I'm not convinced that a few self published websites indicate that a fair number of people believe in it, that's an assertion that needs to be addressed. I also am not sure I agree that an afd has to be concerned with whether or not a topic should or should not exist on Wikipedia. That kind of discussion seems more appropriate on the pages that deal with requests for article. But I could be wrong, if you know of any policy discussions that would help make it clearer to me, please feel free to leave the links here or on my talk page. The current debate is about this article. According to the criteria for deletion, original research is a valid criteria for deletion. One of the problems I see, is that if the article remains, and interested editors place the appropriate citation and cleanup tags on it, there is no guarantees that the article will actually be cleaned up. Unless, we are going to place the burden of cleanup on the editors placing the tags, which is ultimately unworkable. Take a look at the backlog of all articles needing wikifying or cleanup. I see nothing wrong with deleting the article as is and if the contributing editor wishes, they can create an article in their user space, clean it up, get help with it. Then when they believe that it satisfies all criteria for inclusion, they can transfer it to the article namespace. This seems to be accepted procedure.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 19:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, not to sound too argumentative, but after reading your comment I decided to take a look at <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> again. I found the following statement:
<blockquote>
<p>Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position</p>
</blockquote>
. It's simply my opinion that statements like: "George Noory popularized this belief" or "Another common claim..." represent unpublished analyses. In the second phrase, that documents one person's claim the thing that makes it original research is the word common. From the weblink we know the person is a believer, but how are we to determine that amongst all of the believers his viewpoint is common. Perhaps, even amongst it's adherents, this person is considered to be "out there" so to speak. Take away the word "common" and the editor is simply giving one person's opinion, without establishing the notability of that opinion. Also to talk about what "skeptics" might or might not believe, without mentioning who they are and where their viewpoints were published represent unpublished arguments. It's just my opinion, but those statements seem to me to fit the definition of original research. Also to call something a "phenomenon" is to inherently imply that it is something that has been observed, studied and researched.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 03:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I looked over your history with this subject and I can see why you killed some of the older articles, they really were rubbish and biased towards one side. I really do want to present this issue in an un-biased fashion, but I can not do that if the article is killed before the article is improved by other people, one does not step on a seedling because it bears no fruit. References to obscure (but notable) things take time to collect and accumilate. An article on 11:11 is not to be written in a few days or even a few years. My motivation for writing the article in first place is revealed in the last sentence of the article. As a skeptic, I think it is important to recognize the *facts* of things like this, and there aren't that many facts to be had in a case like 11:11, as so you have a pretty short article, but you have an article nonetheless and those seeking information on the subject are thus better informed on the reality of the subject. Wikipedia is an excellent place for stuff to filter down and distill in to a good chunk of useful information, but sometime that takes time, but you at least have to give it time. In the long run, looking at the history of the article, that people are going to keep making new articles about 11:11 not realising someone else already had. So which is easier? To kill it each time? or to simply maintain a good article on the subject? Anyway, that's all I want to do, write a good article *with* my fellow wikipedians. So, TheRingess, you seem like a very good writer, having read your point-by-point reasons for killing this article, why don't you put some of that talent to improving the article? I mean I don't want to have any bad blood with you since we basically agree on the nature of this "phenomenon"&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 05:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment'</b> No problemo, there was never any bad blood, nor was this ever personal. You are correct, some things take time. This is why many editors create subpages in their user space. They work on them there until they are satisfied that their work will satisfy Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion. They move them into the article namespace. That's a good way to avoid these types of discussions and a good way to avoid having fellow editors question the content, and stick cleanup tags, or wikify tags, or source tags in the article. You can of course clean it up even while this discussion goes on.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 06:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> or <b>rewrite and merge</b>. I was the editor who recreated 11:11 article (its third recreate, I believe) before it was redirected and turned into a disambiguation page. As such, I have read several websites on the so-called "phoenomenon", and while the numerous websites, songs, and other media which reference 11:11 appear to reinforce its validity as a "phoenomenon" (or at least a common experience), I have never found any credible second-hand sources that have discussed the issue. Therefore, I believe that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> is correct in labelling the current article <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Remember that simply reading something and recounting what it says without opinion isn't OR (check <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). In researching a little more about this, it seems that there are several different theories people have as to the meaning of noticing 11:11, including that it's a sign for <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightworker.html" title="Lightworker">lightworkers</a> or a message from the Midwayers of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Urantia_Book_1493.html" title="The Urantia Book">The Urantia Book</a>, both things we already have articles about (in the case of the Urantia book, multiple extensive articles). There are also at least two books specifically about 11:11 for sale on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-11-Journey-Spirit-World/dp/1931254117/sr=8-7/qid=1166624309/ref=pd_bbs_7/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Search-11-Journey-Spirit-World/dp/1931254117/sr=8-7/qid=1166624309/ref=pd_bbs_7/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/11-Inside-Doorway-Solara/dp/1878246054/sr=8-4/qid=1166624309/ref=pd_bbs_4/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/11-Inside-Doorway-Solara/dp/1878246054/sr=8-4/qid=1166624309/ref=pd_bbs_4/104-6419583-7369527?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Also notable, I think, is that all but two of the first page of ghits are separate sites devoted to this idea (the other two are the Wikipedia page for November 11th and the IMDB page for the movie 11:11). A search for "John Gilmore" Knology yields several pages of articles about his firing for talking about his beliefs (which, in his case, involve the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminati.html" title="Illuminati">Illuminati</a>, another topic we have many pages about). It seems to me that this is significant, if for no other reason than its relation to so many different popular paranormal topics. If you want to rename this page to something like "Beliefs about 11:11", or if someone wants to take it into their userspace and work on it based on this information, that's fine, but I'd really like to see it stay as an article to inspire group collaboration. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 14:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that we are in basic agreement on many points. I do understand that reading something and recounting it is not OR. One of the basic pillars of Wikipedia is that material added can only be something an editor read in a reputable source. So instead of just saying "Fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>" I listed the specific material that I felt was not already published somewhere. (The most notable statement that I believe represents OR is the claim that Noory popularized the phenomenon. I believe that the links cited do not make this claim. Since no source was provided, and a brief search on google turned up no sources for that claim, I feel that it does represent OR). One other simple example was to classify one person's viewpoint as common. Since the beliefs have not been listed, nor clearly defined, it is difficult to establish from the context of the article, whether this person's belief is common, or merely their own. Don't get me started again on why the word phenomenon is inappropriate for this article. To me, the issue in this discussion has never been about whether or not an article about this number should exist. That is simply way beyond the scope of this discussion. The results of any afd do not seem to be permanently binding (nor should they be). It does seem to be a common occurrence on Wikipedia, that as a result of an afd, an article is deleted and interested editors take up its cause, rewrite it to address the concerns expressed in the discussion and then once again move the article into the article namespace. (Excuse me if I am stating the obvious). I have also noticed that articles are often edited while a discussion is ongoing, and as a result of those edits, some editors will change their opinions. I'm actually wondering if we as a community ought to start actively encouraging fellow editors to create articles in their user space, seek peer reviews, and then when ready, put them in article namespace. It's just my observation (hence my own original research) that a lot of articles in the namespace are "rough drafts". I think that in the future when I participate in discussions, I'm going to stop using the words <b>keep</b> and <b>delete</b> and replace them with <b>ready</b> and <b>not ready</b>. I agree that "Beliefs about 11:11" is a much better title. Another title might be "11:11 (numerology)".<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 16:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, this is really getting more involved than I think is necessary, but there are a couple of important points of Wiki-philosophy here. You write, "One of the basic pillars of Wikipedia is that material added can only be something an editor read in a reputable source." This is a more complicated statement than it appears, and goes to the heart of the point I'm trying to make. Let's go back to your black cat example, just for simplicity. There's a drastic difference between the two statements "There is someone who believes that black cats bring bad luck" and "Black cats bring bad luck." For the first, a webpage that says "I'm Joe, and I think black cats bring bad luck" is a a perfectly valid source. It shows that such a person exists, in a way that is verifiable by anyone who reads the primary source, as mentioned in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The same webpage, though, is not a valid source for the second statement, since the fact in question in that statement isn't Joe's belief, but a fact about the actual nature of cats and luck, for which Joe isn't known as a reliable source. I think you probably understand, and agree with, this point, but I wanted to be sure that we're on the same page. I agree wholeheartedly that, with the evidence given, the claims that George Noory popularized (in any sense) this concept, or that belief in it is widespread, have not been sufficiently supported. (Support for the second is what I've been trying to provide in my previous posts.) In their current form, these claims may represent original research, in the sense of creating synthesis or opinion from primary sources. However, since they may also simply be inadequately referenced, I don't think claiming use of OR as a basis for an AfD is appropriate. I think the intent (other Wikipedians, feel free to argue) of the listing of OR as a potential reason to delete an article is meant for not this possibly-OR grey area, but for, as is described in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, egregious OR of the "here is my new theory of gravitation based on the motion of hamsters" type. Hopefully, in cases like this one, the appropriate action is to improve the article, find a basis for any apparent OR, and remove anything that can't be substantiated. If you feel some of the current claims are too vague to remain standing, <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and remove them. Cut the article down to a stub, put the disputed bits on the talk page, tag for cleanup, and let the Wiki-magic work. Based on something else you've said, I'm inclined to think you agree, in principle, but perhaps are using the wrong means to the end: "To me, the issue in this discussion has never been about whether or not an article about this number should exist. That is simply way beyond the scope of this discussion." Unfortunately, by creating an AfD, the existence of the article is exactly what you've opened a debate about. No, the results of an AfD are generally not permanently binding, but a delete result will certainly cast a shadow on any future version of the article that may be hard to escape. For that reason, I find leaving a stub more appropriate than deletion in any case where people believe a subject may be sufficiently notable for an article, even if the current article is not up to par. In addition, I think people are much more likely to work on a stub article they find than to simply create a new article, so deletion may make it less likely that the article will exist again. As for the idea that articles should be kept in userspace until they meet some standard, that seems to me to go against the entire point of a wiki, which is collaboration. Whether there should be separate levels of "doneness" is of course a much bigger question, but I believe collaborative effort needs to be available at all levels to make articles the best they can be, and in the current Wikipedia model, that means putting them out in the general space as soon as possible. Sorry for the length of this post, and no, I don't think this article is so vital to the Wikipedia that the world will end if it's gone (I do think, based on the research I've done, that it's sufficiently notable, though), but I think the ideas of how things should work that are at question here are pretty important. -- Pinball

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for giving a well thought out and courteous response to my thoughts. Yes, we are in agreement on many points. Including that I may have used the wrong means to an end. Now that I look at thoughts regarding notability here; I used inadequate language. I think now that I misunderstood your comments regarding notability. What I really meant to express is that an afd should never be used to determine whether or not a subject (as opposed to an article) is notable enough to belong to wikipedia. This is a good example, a well researched article, with reputable sources, that fits all of the criteria for inclusion, deserves to exist, simply because this is Wikipedia. The argument should never be based upon "how far out" we think a belief or theory is. I do not agree that this process makes it less likely that the article will exist again. But I suppose we simple should agree to disagree. It seems that I misunderstood your original comments. Regarding doneness, it's simply my opinion that a valid process for creating an article is: 1) create the article in your user namespace 2) When you are satisfied (or even before), seek out fellow editors who share your interest (project pages are a great place to start) 3) request peer reviews (it's a good idea to actively seek out reviews rather than wait for someone to volunteer) 4) collaborate and repeat the steps 5) move to article namespace. I am not suggesting that this is the way we have to do things, or the way we should do things, I am simply expressing my own opinion (and this might not be the appropriate place to do so) based on my own OR. I believe that one underlying assumption of the Wikipedia model is that some editors will always step forward to improve an article. I'm not convinced that this is the case, or that it is even a workable assumption. Finally, it boils down to asking editors to actively seek out collaboration, rather than waiting for it to happen. (Take a look at the list of all articles needing wikification. The backlog seems quite large to me). Nor am I suggesting that we actively discourage editors from adding articles to article namespace first and then seeking collaboration. To me, that would be completely against Wiki philosophy. My points are probably better suited for a policy discussion page, or just a general philosophical discussion page, so I apologize for making this discussion lengthier than necessary. If you wish to discuss this further, at this point, our talk pages might be more appropriate venues.

<dd>I have to go with Pinball on this one, I say skip to step 5. and get everything out in the open fropm the get-go. There are far too many people who have esoteric knowledge locked up in their head, and when they go and search for something and they find it on wikipedia, they are much more likely share their bit of knowledge with us if they are invited to simply edit an open wikipedia article, rather than some page that is filed away under some user's page. The process you describe relies far too much on the fellow wikipedians. The birth of a new article should be out in the open for everyone to see, the more people that see it, the more people will contribute *good* information to it. This is the whole point of having a stub! Again, Pinball is right on the money with so much of what he said, I'm quite glad really, he said so much of what I want to say, and in such a great way, I don't have to say it, so I can go watch that episode of Torchwood I've been saving up&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGIR_a9d7.html" title="User:GIR">GIR</a> 04:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC) p.s. sorry I messed up the formatting up top, I didn't notice until now I had turned all the numbers in your numbered lists in to 1's, my god, I see 1111 everywhere!!!&#160;;) just kiddin'

<li><b>Comment</b> In my relatively short time participating in AfD discussions I have seen a lot of grief come from these mass nominations and not once have I seen one result in a well-organized, thoughtful debate that came to any sort of conclusion. No offense to the nominator. Maybe this is a strategy that needs to be rethought or retired?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 08:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would note that the majority of the articles nominated, aside from <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan_Wendel_90df.html" title="Johnathan Wendel">Johnathan Wendel</a>, have been created solely by one user, in an act that appears to be promotional intention. None of the other persons, or teams, appear notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> at the current time. Perhaps in the future - but right now, this appears to be simply an attempt to drum up publicity for Major League Gaming. <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 08:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Partial Delete</b> In the electronic sports circuit, the Major League Gaming is regarded as being non-notable, or only minor at best. The same goes for its players and teams. It seems that these articles were mostly created by people from the MLG in order to extend its playerbase onto WP. There are three articles here nominated however, that are not linked to the MLG and that are actually on top professional gamers/teams. These three being <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_NoA_65ed.html" title="Team NoA">Team NoA</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan__Fatal1ty__Wendel_a91e.html" title="Johnathan &quot;Fatal1ty&quot; Wendel">Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel</a>.

I may be wrong, but I believe that they have been discussed on the gaming channel G4 multiple times. They are #1 and #2 in the MLG league, which I do not believe is non-notable or minor (what other leagues have a TV spot on USA, a channel carried in most homes across the country?) According to Wikipedia notability standards, they belong. They: "are competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable" "have a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" I could add more sources, more, better arguments, but I hope that will suffice, as I don't want to spend way more time on this than necessary.

I have put in the rest of the references, cleaned up the first paragraphs in each electronic sports team wikipage and removed all the nonsense. Since all the team pages are clean, all the members should be clean as well. These pages are significant because all the players and teams have been shown on television from November 2006 to the end of December 2006 on USA Network on the weekly basis.

<dd>Trivial being the publishing media not falling for something that's more of a facade than the actual real thing? Any media publishing on the MLG with the claim that this is 'the real thing' have no idea what they're talking about and just fell for the MLG money-generated PR-machine. As said before, within the global e-Sports circuit, the MLG is regarded as non-notable, only minor at best. This being due to all kinds of factors, such as the competition model, the platforms being chosen, and so on. But most importantly, the lack of competitive nature and skill curve in the games being chosen. These players and teams should not have an article.. Players like Johan "Toxic" Quick, Paul "czm" Nelson, Xiaofeng "Sky" Li, fnatic, Pentagram, etc. should. Wikipedians should not forget being on the lookout for companies like these that are trying to re-invent history.. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 03:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Show me some proof that the "global e-sports circut" considers MLG non-notable, for I've never heard of this. This just sounds like your opinion, which group would you rather push? Even if MLG's "PR machine" is "trying to re-invent history" , they're succeeding, because many people, even non-gamers and casual gamers have heard of MLG, and its members get widespread media attention, making them notable by Wikipedia's standards, which is all that matters. This AfD debate is not about whether you like MLG and their set-ups and gametypes or whether or not they're overshadowing "better" leagues, but whether or not they meet Wikipedia standards to deserve an article, which they clearly do. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 03:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, MLG is only featured on websites and other media that have no target of covering e-Sports. You will mostly see MLG featured in either business media or mainstream media, while both are obviously not knowledgeable of the field of e-Sports (yet). Sure, there will be articles on e-Sports websites, but only sporadicly. Though, you're pointing out an excellent flaw here in the Wikipedia standards, basically that journalists can invent history, or worse, that vampire corporations can use media as a tool to do so. That being said, regard the following sentence from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level.". Now regard that most of the references made in player articles are from the MLG's own website, or from MLG affiliates, like "USA Network". That aside, I'm not involved in any crusade against the MLG, on the contrary even, but I just think that there needs to be some counter-pressure against the way it currently operates and tries to position itself in the media. It's dangerous in a field that is relatively young, is the lastest buzz, and where media have no background in the subject yet. Yes, the MLG should have an article, but the players should not, whereas they have only played in one single, minor, national competition, and only have for a short period of time (apart from some participating in WSVG). Using money as the only motivation just harms the sport and the truth. If you are able to look at the whole field objectively, whether you are related to MLG or not, you will have to come to the conclusion that WCG, ESWC, CPL, WSVG, WEG, KODE and so forth are all more notable than MLG, definitely on a global scale. This all being said, multiple people suggest that this AfD will never reach any consensus and I think so too. So let's leave this for what it is and close the listing. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 14:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm familiar with e-sports. And whereas I consider the CPL and WCG to be of vastly greater importance than childsplay on consoles like the MLG, the mainstream press sees no different.

<p>Please do not even comment on this board unless you have a good understanding of the leagues. Why would WCG even take Halo off of their list of competitive games if MLG is so small? In addition, why would any organization broadcast for a non-affiliate anyway? How is USA Network different than any other US cable channel? Don't avoid answering the question directly anymore, why do you believe MLG and their top three teams are non-notable?</p>

<p>Okay, I've got the same universal disdain for mass listings as anyone else, but I think the case for packaging here is open-and-shut. All of these articles are a massive walled garden of game-guide information, including extreme details about the specifications and statistics of individual ships. There is <i>zero</i> information from an out-of-universe perspective. Were that not enough, they are in fact specifically targeted for one <i>version</i> of the game. The article for the game version itself (<a href="../../../t/r/a/TradeWars_2002_540a.html" title="TradeWars 2002">TradeWars 2002</a>) is not included in this AFD, although it probably should be merged with its parent <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Wars_6646.html" title="Trade Wars">Trade Wars</a> article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It should be pointed out that one of the articles for an individual ship already <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Missile_Frigate_14fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Missile Frigate">failed</a> an AFD with a <i>merge</i> determination on 29 November that hasn't happened, and there was already <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETradeWars_2002_08e8.html" title="Talk:TradeWars 2002">talk page</a> discussion of merging <i>all</i> the ship articles into a list on 6 December that hasn't happened either. However, since there is nothing to merge except highly detailed in-universe statistics and strategy (i.e. game guide content), I fail to see how that would solve the problem at hand.</dd>

<p>I initially put this on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a>, but the template was removed by <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> citing that he wasn't familiar with precedent in this area. Looking at the article, it appears to be just a message bank service for telephone companies in the UK. I don't think any country's message bank service is notable and worth having a wikipedia article on because not much can be described about it beyond its features (which are generally the same everywhere). I note, however, that we have other phone number articles; <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a>, <a href="../../../0/0/0/000_emergency.html" title="000 emergency">000 emergency</a> and <a href="../../../1/-/1/1-1-1.html" title="1-1-1">1-1-1</a> come to mind, while we have articles on all the <a href="../../../n/1/1/N11_code.html" title="N11 code">N11 codes</a>. I think emergency services and many of the services provided by n11 numbers are more important than voicemail, though admittedly some of the articles for the individual n11 numbers could be merged. As for this case, the article should be deleted as it is a message bank and not much can be said about it. <b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a></b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87"><font color="green">87</font></a> 11:20, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> My, my, looks that was an unpopular call, on my part.&#160;:p Mainly, prod was backlogged by two days and nobody else seemed to be looking at it. I've deleted over 200 pages, over the past two days, if it makes anybody feel better -- not having been to Britain, and not ever having seen something like this at AfD, I figured it couldn't hurt to get a little more input. Looks like people want to <b>delete</b>, although I'm not sure that there would be any harm in leaving a <b>redirect</b> (what else could someone possibly be looking for, after all?). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 21:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> - a page on Telco "Call minder" services and redirect to, they differ from Answerphones, and it's questionable if they are fully featured enough to be considered as true voicemail.

<li><b>Redirect and merge</b> as per the way that <a href="../../../1/-/4/1-4-7-1.html" title="1-4-7-1">1-4-7-1</a> does to what the service is i.e. a class of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_office.html" title="Central office">central office</a> based <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voicemail.html" title="Voicemail">voicemail</a> services, and tone down the blatant advertising for BT. Compared to the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voicemail.html" title="Voicemail">voicemail</a> article though it is well written so be shame to lose its contents. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 01:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Those looking at the article and this AfD debate might want to consider that it's been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1-5-7-1&amp;diff=95331597&amp;oldid=95286235" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1-5-7-1&amp;diff=95331597&amp;oldid=95286235" rel="nofollow">majorly rewritten</a> with the rewrite starting at 15:34 UTC. I too think it would be a shame to lose the article as it is now, so I wouldn't be voting delete. If I had just encountered the article as it is now, I wouldn't have marked it for deletion, now that I know that 1-5-7-1 is not just some random phone number but it's actually a class of voicemail-type services in the UK. I think the article is now large and comprehensive enough that it can stand on its own; if it was merged to a generic article like <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voicemail.html" title="Voicemail">voicemail</a>, then the voicemail article would put too much emphasis on UK services. At this stage my recommendation would be to <b>keep</b> or <b>merge and provide less detail somewhere like</b> <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_telephone_numbering_plan_5edd.html" title="UK telephone numbering plan">UK telephone numbering plan</a><b>.</b> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham87_fa35.html" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a><b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraham87_9542.html" title="User talk:Graham87"><font color="green">87</font></a> 03:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Its a step above a personal essay, as there are four journal references (easy to miss, the refs are malformed). The article tone is immensely OR, however, so I don't think its salvageable. Also, I'm nervous about most of the cited sources. <i>Journal of Teacher Education</i> has a 2005 IF of 0.5. <i>Equity and Excellence in Teacher Education</i>, if it exists, has absolutely zero web imprint (no viable Google hits). <i>Radical Teacher</i> does not appear to be a scholarly journal; it is, by its admission, a "socialist, feminist, and anti-racist journal". <i>Teacher Development</i> appears to be an actual peer-reviewed journal, although I cannot find an impact factor stated anywhere (and conflicting info about whether it is still in publication). It might be possible to write an article on this topic starting with these sources, but this one isn't it, and won't help anyone who would try. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 14:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: feudal baronies have now been completely abolished by Act of Parliament (2004). They still had some serious meaning prior to 1747. It was always the case until very recently that the feudal baron would own a reasonable acreage of the original barony which included the ancient caput. With the recent adoption of the English "paper" baronies and Lordships the entire thing has become a fraud. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 15:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree with the nominator. Although it appears that this website/company is quite notable from all the press mentions, if you dig down a bit deeper all you'll find is the initial press release of the launch. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 15:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The page was originally created by Jacoplane as part of the WikiProject Computer and video games articles, after press coverage of the company's original launch in September under the name SparkForge. The article refers to press coverage of at least three separate announcements. Nor is the company simply a "website," it is a company developing technology of interest in the computer game industry. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 15:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Other comment--the original creator of the page, Jacoplane, is listed as on vacation according to his user page, but it would be helpful to get his reaction as well. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The coverage listed doesn't seem to be anything other than rehashing of the press release. Do you have some other coverage that isn't listed there? A quick google search didn't reveal anything but more of the same. How would Jacoplane's input be anymore helpful than any other editor? If editors can't find evidence of notability that is hidden so well that we need someone specific to show it to us, it isn't likely a notable site.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A quick google search reveals in excess of 40,000+ hits, and as with anything that has received significant interest within an industry, there will be a lot of duplicates. However, looking through some of the higher ranked items one finds a number of articles with editorial commentary, as well as mentions in prominent industry sites (beyond computer gaming) such as Mashable and O'Reilly Radar. One also has to consider the 2,000 Ghits related to the company's former name, SparkForge (the original name under which the article was created under in September), which turns up some other media coverage of the company within the gaming industry. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 13:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, no evidence of notability in terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And yes, most of the articles are rehashes of the press release. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 23:37, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wholeheartedly disagree with the petition to delete. To delete Guild Cafe, you would then have to delete all other online communities listed in Wikipedia, including: MySpace, Classmates and YouTube. The website is a tool that helps people around the world share similar ideas. Unless there are existing regulations on how popular, large or well known an online community is, I do not see how you can delete this article. Does an Wikipedia entry now have to be an award winner to be listed in Wikipedia? I do not see that requirement in any wikipedia guideline that says a website has to be in the top 100,000 rankings. If you can specify where these guidelines are, then yes I would agree with deletion. There are nearly 1,000 people using Guild Cafe and is an open AND FREE public service. On the other hand, however, there is an entry for a video game that is currently PRIVATE and in CLOSED beta, will have a purchase price and a monthly charge that you have not petitioned: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_Saga_of_Heroes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_Saga_of_Heroes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_Saga_of_Heroes</a> That product has not yet been released. So according to your newly devised standards, any wikipedia entry that relates to an online service must meet the following criteria:</li>
</ul>
<p>A top 100,000 website An established product with X amount of users Must have won notable awards Must not be in Beta Must not be "brand new" - Wikipedia only allows entries of Old Items and dated information</p>
<p>Wikipedia "GUIDELINES" state that an entry must meet 1 of 3 requirements to be posted. A person writing a press release does not make something notable. What makes it notable is who thought the press release was worthy of re-publishing. 99% of press releases wrote are trashed by the receivers. In this case, relevancy and notability prevail as this press release was picked up, published and/or edited by major influences in the industry/field it relates to:</p>
<p>IGN - the leader of online gaming felt it was important and relevant Warcry - One of the top 10 MMORPG gaming sites felt it was notable Stratics.com - A leader in delivering MMORPG industry news felt it was notable TentonHammer - Another industry leading website picked it up and reported on it.</p>
<p>If anything the entry should be re-edited for neutrality, but definitely not deleted.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.82.230.25 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.82.230.25.html" title="User talk:67.82.230.25">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.82.230.25_2fe0.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.82.230.25">contribs</a>) 21:10, December 22, 2006.</small></p>

<dd><i>What makes it notable is who thought the press release was worthy of re-publishing.</i> Actually no. Re-read the guideline. Reprinting of the press release doesn't make it notable, regardless of who picked it up. It doesn't satisfy a single of the criteria listed and until it does, it doesn't qualify for an article here. If you feel there are other websites which don't meet the criteria feel free to create an account and nominate them for deletion, we're here to discuss this article though.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:04, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is all fairly longwinded, but I think the point he may be making that *is* generally regarded as relavent in terms of both <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is the extensiveness of coverage and/or linkage, i.e., 40K+ Ghits. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 13:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Two of those links are blogs, and not meaningful in terms of measuring the notability of a site, and the other once again qualifies as a trivial mention per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li>Very good point. Too many company press release AfD discussions have turned me into a real Genghis...

<li>I agree that's a good point, I wasn't thinking of that. However, it's good to actually have a moderated discussion prior to what amounts to blanking an article, isn't it?

<li>The previous version of the article was based solely upon one single person's submission to another wiki. (The URL for it is in the earliest version of the article, q.v..) The current version of the article is based upon computer science books, <i>which all agree</i> on what computer organization is — as, indeed, does the university course summary that you have linked to. That the person who submitted the content to that other wiki got what computer organization is egregiously wrong, and indeed, completely the opposite of what it is, is not a reason to dispute the necessity for this article. It's simply yet another demonstration of why wikis, with no peer review or fact checking processes, are not good sources. It's also a good demonstration of how a few minutes' work with Google Books would have found the books that were being talked about on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:34, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think we have consensus now that there is something called "computer organization", that it's to do with building and designing computer hardware (i.e. what is commonly known as "computer architecture"), and that it involves box diagrams, and implementing a computer architecture (note article). In any case, the article is now not exclusively about terminology (if only through mentioning the box diagrams) and should thus be expanded and possibly merged with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_architecture.html" title="Computer architecture">computer architecture</a>, not deleted. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomP_ea0d.html" title="User:RandomP">RandomP</a> 11:02, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Harvest was influential, stable, and well-known in the neopagan community of the time. Remember, this was before the internet and zines were often many people's sole link to the neopagan community.

The question is whether there is notability. There is no doubt that he has written books (although arguably none from major presses or with significant sales). He appears to be a pretty determined self-promoter, which makes notability a bit difficult to judge. And a number of supposedly different people, but with nearly identical unorthodox punctuation in their posts, have been arguing for a keep. It was apparently determined that this could not be speedied as a re-creation because it is somewhat different than before, so we need to discuss it again. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> The reason to allow re-creation was the added succession of links at the bottom, but none of those proves notoriety, IMO - they are merely evidence of self-promotion. Aside from two minor articles in journals, all of those seem to be easily accessible for posting and/or highly sympathetic to Cerin's persistence (diaspora "deploring" that Cerin was "denied a place in Romanian culture"). There is no accessible and neutral criticism of his work, there is no comment on it from a professional source, there is frankly no material that would prove not to have been written or ordered by Cerin himself. With a little perseverence, anybody can have his or her name flashed around on the www. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion, and wikipedia should not help someone achieve notoriety - it should base itself on acquired notoriety. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 17:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> per nom. Browsing through the links to his works on the current version, and old versions, it seems as though many are the rambling gibberish of a schizophrenic. I know that sounds very harsh, but I say that based on the several schizophrenic friends of mine and the kind of material they produce when motivated. I do not think a judgment of notability can rely on the existence of published works in this case, and it just seems as though Mr. Cerin is not a notable author at this point in time. - <a href="../../../s/d/o/User%7ESdorrance_f27f.html" title="User:Sdorrance">Sam</a> 18:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

To paraphrase <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sorin_Cerin_ca52.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorin Cerin">what I said before</a>, evidence of notability would include:
<ul>
<li>Being taught in the curriculum of at least one major university?</li>
<li>A review of one of his books in some reputable publication, either a significant specialist publication (for example, one of the many listed at <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~worc0337/phil_journals_paper.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~worc0337/phil_journals_paper.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) or a generalist publication (<i>New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, etc.) or even a review in a significant newspaper in almost any language.</li>

<dd>Also, I am sure I am not the only one who has noticed that virtually all support for having an article on this person seems to be coming from people who create somewhat similar (or no) user pages and have the same oddly punctuated English. If these were not all the same person as 89.114.26.107 (<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User_talk%7E89.114.26.107.html" title="User talk:89.114.26.107">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.114.26.107_f24e.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.114.26.107">contribs</a>), the IP that was briefly blocked for spamming user pages on this matter (and is now spamming again), I'd be very surprised. A usercheck might be in order. Voting more than once on the same AFD is pretty serious sockpuppet abuse.</dd>
<dd>I find this all a bit bizarre. I originally (in July) came into this with a pretty open mind that this might prove to be a notable person, but I increasingly find that unlikely, and the conduct of his "supporters" has been such as to make me increasingly skeptical of anything other than very solid evidence. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I understant it right, his "real notability" consists of 1) publishing a few lunatic books in obscure publishing houses without any significant echo in academic journals or in really important newspapers; 2) sockpupetting on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with Thomas here. Being a student at Priory School (not taking sides) I beleve that everyone should have a chance to improve the article. Ok there maybe some problems with copyright, thats fine to take off it but there is no need to delete all of it for the sake of a few copyright issues R27smith200245 23:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - While I personally don't agree with the idea that every secondary school is inherently notable, there seems to be a consensus that they are, and I don't find an argument that we should delete a page because of the actions of someone who's opposed to deletion particularly compelling. On the other hand, looking over the talk page I think it would be helpful to point these people to Wikia, if it will prevent them from trying to turn this article into their school's private wiki. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 20:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See, the issue with schools being inherently notable is through their very existance. Herein lies a problem. I exist, I am pretty productive irl, I'm an admin on Wikipedia, do I garner an article? And if so, I demand that someone here writes it. Flatter me, please. &lt;/bad humor&gt; <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 21:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>. There are secondary schools that are notable. There are others which are not. The only thing possibly notable here is the good results on a standardized exam. If that is to be a criterion, let us get the list, and start adding from the top and eliminating from the bottom. In any case, even that is unsourced.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 00:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>When i made the page, i only made it as to inform people of our school and to give people information about it. Other schools have articles so why shouldnt we, if you gave us a chance to build it up yanksox instead of deleting something everytime its put up there, perhaps the article could become a much better one. in a democratic world we do not work off one mans opinion, we work on the factor that if someone wants something to be seen or heard, they are given this opportunity, they are not told to back down. I feel we should be given a chance to build up the article before you delete it.Thomas Murlis 10:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tagged as speedy A7 (no asseriton of notability) but there is an assertion of notability. Whether it's credible is another matter. An artist getting exhibitions in art bars can be significant or insignificant, it depends on the context, and without secondary sources we can't really judge. The author has no contribs outside this subject and makes the usual "delete this and you must delete all these others" argument, but that does not <i>necessarily</i> mean this is bunk. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's nothing to do with age, the criterion for notability of football clubs is based on the level in the "pyramid" at which they play (or have played in the past) - see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html#Criteria_for_clubs.2C_societies.2C_and_organizations" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP#Criteria for clubs, societies, and organizations</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - looks like Gabbiadini joined York City by the age of 16. I don't see how him spending time with a junior team contributes to the notability of the main club. Even on Gabbiadini's article, it states "Poppleton Juniors" which I see is now a redirect to the Poppleton United page. Nothing on the main page mentions any junior sides etc. at all. I still think personally this is quite a long way from meeting the criteria as defined by guideline and precedent. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 12:40, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> - Again, HTS has its own page, mostly because of the Jeremy Hammond going to jail thing, does it take a webmaster's incarceration to be notable? it's looking like that's going to happen to HBH, and then it'll have plenty of sources. It's probably the biggest, most well put together hack challenge website. Sometimes information can be useful without meeting sources requirements. If those awards that they give to websites that make them notable like Webbies or whatever were given to these kinds of websites, it'd have one. Sometimes slightly subversive sites like these can lack sources but are still popular, and therefore useful to Wikipedia. (this next part is just meant to be funny) As the old argument goes, if all the freaking 200 Pokemon have a page, why not this? <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 03:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</strike></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to admit I was wrong about this one. Originally, I thought this was a salvageable, worthwhile article about a topic that I felt was important but hindered by lack of sources due to its subversive topics (regular media would never cover anything like this unless <a href="../../../h/a/c/HackThisSite_0abc.html" title="HackThisSite">someone's being arrested</a>). But then I tried to improve the article and make it more encyclopedic, and it just continued to become a self-serving mess. I realize now that without sources to pull from (though sadly, there probably never will be, no matter how popular it gets, as these types of sites shun press for obvious reasons), it will always fall into the mess that this article is now. I retract my keep. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 02:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a mess. First, it's three different topics: a <i><a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons.html" title="Simpsons">Simpsons</a></i> reference, an improv comedy troupe with at least a claim to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, and an apparently non-notable indie band. It's easy enough to delete the band info, but what of the other topics?</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the <i>Simpsons</i> reference notable enough for its own article or perhaps a merge into <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culturally_significant_phrases_from_The_Simpsons_9794.html" title="Culturally significant phrases from The Simpsons">Culturally significant phrases from The Simpsons</a>. There's hardly any material here...</li>
<li>Is the troupe sufficiently notable for Wikipedia inclusion? They've played some notable clubs and had a single short presented at a minor, notable <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_Film_Festival_d6f7.html" title="Beverly Hills Film Festival">film festival</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the whole lot should be deleted as all topics lack sufficient sourcing and notability. Perhaps this article should simply become a redirect to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_vs._Thanksgiving_c2f4.html" title="Bart vs. Thanksgiving">Bart vs. Thanksgiving</a>, the episode on which the reference was made? <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 20:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There never was a character named Nathan Winthrop. It was a name that a character had wanted to use for a child that was miscarried. The show doesn't acknowledge the existence of the character, so there is no strong need for a page devoted to a potential name that may never have been used. <a href="../../../d/27/a/User%7ED%27Amico_ffe2.html" title="User:D'Amico">D'Amico</a> 21:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> any police officer killed in duty is notable. Otherwise you may as well get rid of the whole police killed in duty categories. These officers slain are more notable than most of the minor athletes who have articles on wiki and there are hundreds of them. This article has been here for over year.

<li>I'd strongly disagree that "any police officer killed in duty is notable"...One can make an individual case that the circustances surrounding a police officer's death while on duty might make a stronger <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> case that is otherwise weak, but <b>inherent</b> notability does not, nor should not, exist for a single class of persons. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>, so the merits of a subject's inclusion should be weighed independent of how one personally feels for the subject in particular of fallen police officers in general. Furthermore, the presence of "minor athletes" on Wikipedia has little bearing on this individual case—nominate <i>those</i> articles for deletion if you don't believe they belong. Also, the attack on "deletionists" is a tired ad hominem that implies that those that support deletion are somehow less interested in making quality contributions to Wikipedia than "non-deletionists." -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 23:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say I wanted the minor athletres deleted. I'm pointing out the double and inconsistent standard. If you want them deleted, go ahead. I don't make a habit of deleting other people's work.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you want to propose a guideline WP:COP that every officer killed in the line of duty gets an article, then propose it. Some of us might agree, but others might feel that any worker killed on the job is just as dead and just as sorely missed by co-workers and family. Farmers die in tractor rollovers. I think they are heroic to go out everyday knowing the risks. Same for utiility linemen, ironworkers, roofers, and miners. How about all soldiers killed in all wars? Way more heroic. The question is notability: was the death noted in multiple independent reliable verifiable sources in more than a passing reference or a listing like an obituary? More than a person who was a victim of violent crime?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And as an aside, I'd like to agree with the editor above (but in less strident language) how disheartening I find it when articles that perhaps fall short of global significance but still are miles away from vanity page or indulgent frippery get knocked off Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> I voted to delete for lack of notability, but I would rather have an article for every police officer, construction worker, or soldier killed on the job than for every episode of a game show, every subway station, TV mast, 2 lane state highway, video game character, un-famous kid band. middle school, or city street, which some people love to create. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that virtually all municipalities have laws designating violence against an officer as a separate category of offense, and that the epithet 'cop killer' exists and has such cultural currency is fair evidence that society treats the murder of a police officer as fundamentally different from, say, the murder of a teenage gangbanger. Both actor and victim become at least worthy of consideration for an article in my eyes. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 05:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and Deizio, with whose observation that <i>to say "any police officer killed in duty is notable" makes most rabid deletionists look decidedly moderate</i> I concur entirely (to be sure, the putative notability of the subject is not exclusively the fact of his being killed whilst on duty; were, for instance, Fallen Officers Remembered to be understood as a notable/prominent group, it's likely that notability for Pocceschi would entail). I am, as others, altogether unhappy that we might lose an exceedingly excellent contributor in view, inter al., of this AfD (and I'd join in their entreaties that he stay), but this seems a pretty clear case. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 07:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Being killed in the line of duty does not automatically confer notability, and nothing in the article suggests that this individual did anything notable (in the Wikipedia sense) during his lifetime. News coverage seems mostly local (correct me if I'm wrong?). Article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Note: around the world there are literally 1000s of officers who are killed in the line of duty every year. Does this make them non-notable?

Furthermore, "It was the first felonious killing of a Virginia Beach police officer in twenty-two years" and "founded an organization named Fallen Officers Remembered" make it more noteable still.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies).</dd>
<dd>People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them."</dd>
<dd>2) "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</dd>
<dd>This article satisfies NPOV, verifiability, does not suffer from OR, and there is public interest. Non-uniform application of the notability concept seems to be a recurring problem. Articles on video game characters, comic book characters, etc. exist to fill in information of interest to "special interest" groups. Likewise, this subject is of interest to a different "audience". The added fact that his death has inspired a grass roots effort to supply police officers with needed life-saving equipment adds to his interest. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 15:09, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This and other articles nominated are biographical entries about (alleged) concentration camp guards with no sources. They were subject to an earlier AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wilhelmina_Sadrinna_6bf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wilhelmina Sadrinna">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wilhelmina Sadrinna</a> here and kept. Since then, our policies have moved much more towards deleting unsourced biographical articles like this (they could possibly even be speedied under <a href="../../../c/s/d/Wp%7Ecsd.html" title="Wp:csd">CSD G10</a>). Alleging that someone is a concentration camp guard is a serious matter, and it essential that articles like this should be sourced or deleted. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 23:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC) I am also nominating the following other pages on the same grounds:</p>

<li>'<i>delete</i> but for not notable. Some guards have been particularly horrible, or newsworthy otherwise, or used as examples in historical or biographical works, and if they have been discussed in several sources they should go in. I see no evidence of any of that here. I would support ifsources showed her as specially notable. She was born in 1917.

<li><b>Speedy delete all</b> The articles do not present any sources to back up the statement that the subjects were Nazi concentration camp guards. It is Wikipedia policy that "Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous." After the John Siegenthaler incident, we have tried to be careful to delete all articles or content in articles which contain defamatory material. If they are so notorious, then cite the books that document their crimes. Otherwise the articles are a clear violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:05, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - These articles were created 2 years ago and if nobody has found a source in that time, it seems unlikely that they will any time soon.

Even so, regardless of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, if an article (living person or otherwise) is unsourced and seems unlikely to ever be sourced, it doesn't belong here.

<li><b>Delete</b> — would appear to be `original research'. At any rate, a person is not notable simply for being a concentration camp guard (otherwise how many thousand biographies would we have to handle?); the article, moreover, states that she was neither arrested nor charged nor convicted of war crimes — probably because if she exists, and did what the articles says, she nonetheless didn't commit war crimes — guarding a camp isn't a war crime. But even mentioning the term `war crimes' in the article is disgusting, since it obliquely raises an entirely unfounded allegation in such a way as it is a non-allegation, but tacitly implies that she `got away with it' and is living somewhere happily, unpunished. No, this is filth. I haven't looked at the others, but trust they will be the same.

<p>you dont understand anything - maybe you would if you take a minute and read the article instead of typing up total nonsense here. house of pain is history, la coka nostra has nothing to do with them. it is a whole new thing. 87.186.12.193 23:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> We DO understand wikipedia policy and guidelines. From that, we see that the 'band' has published no albums (myspace doesn't count). I did read the article or I would have never known the 'band' was made up of the members of HoP and a few other misc artists. Hop may be history, and this may be a 'whole new thang' but if you would like any information kept on wikipedia, the band needs to release at least to release at least one album. If they don't then the logical thing to do is merge them into the Hop article until they do. If la coka nostra has nothing to do with HoP besides it's members, then perhaps you would prefer we change our minds to delete? Those are the only two options available right now. Either we merge this information in the the HoP article and redirect any quereis made for la coka nostra to that article, or we removed the la coka nostra all together. That's it. They don't pass wikipedia policies, but they do make it on one count of WP:WEB, so I was trying to help SAVE the information in some form and I liked HoP as a kid. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe this article should absolutely not be deleted. La Coka Nostra member ILL BILL's recently released CD "ILL BILL Is The Future - Vol. 2 - I'm A Goon! - Hosted by La Coka Nostra" is available in stores worldwide and has been available on iTunes as of Dec. 19. It contains three proper LCN songs along with LCN interview soundbites. A search of iTunes for "La Coka Nostra" will yield these three songs available for purchase. I think this and the history of the group's members alone warrants the existance of this La Coka Nostra article. The accurate nature of this article and the amount of interest and acclaim already garnered by the group from the La Coka Nostra myspace page and various other interviews/articles easily accessed through a Google search of "La Coka Nostra" further cements the legitimacy of this article. --Strong Management - La Coka Nostra's offical representation.

<li><b>2 Cents</b> - Lady Sovereign had a wikipedia page before her official album dropped, aswell as many other artists. I could understand if this was a local group, or something, but since they have fans from CA to NY, and sell out huge name venues, the page should stay. Ill Bill and Slaine have released two IN STORE albums, both with La Coka Nostra songs on it. Does that not valid the group? Theres no reason the page should be deleted or merged, if Mr. T left the A-Team and did a new show, would that wikipage have to be merged with the A-Team, even though its a whole new show all together? No, it wouldn't. Stop complaining people, its valid and check information.

<li>La Coka Nostra is its own project, and constitutes its own page on this website. I've seen this get merged with House of Pain, I'll tell you now, this is NOT House of Pain. This group is rapidly expanding, and deleting it now or merging it again is going to be a waste of everybody's time, since La Coka Nostra WILL be very popular in the very near future.

As of today, LCN does not live up to those standards. In the future, if they can pass the pillars of wikipedia, then they certainly should have a page, but not now.

<dd>The "500 officers" statistic is misleading. The overwhelming majority of those deaths are accidental(mostly traffic accidents). Outright murder represents a small portion of that figure. And of the small minority of police officers who are murdered in the line of duty, Bosak and Schaik are further unusual in that they didn't die as the result of a struggle with an arrestee, but at the hands of an assassin who deliberately <i>targeted</i> police officers for murder. Highly unusual. As a reader of Wikipedia (and true-crime nerd), I personally have no interest in guys who accidentally shot themselves while wearing the uniform, or housing cops who slip and fall off project roofs. But I generally find murder pretty fascinating, regardless of any consideration of a more global notability. As a kid I always read encyclopediae for articles that interested me; I don't think it's unreasonable to assume I'm not alone in that. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 05:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
