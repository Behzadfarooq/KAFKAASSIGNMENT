<li>This is my first article, so I don't really know completely how the site functions. I got all of my information about the band Rainwound at the official websites. There are samples on the internet and a thousand views to the MySpace page alone, which is a pretty new page. It is not an article to promote <i>my</i> band, because I am just a fan providing this for informational purposes. I would appreciate any help you would be willing to give, but please do not delete this speedily for it was a lot of work, typing, and figuring out how to work this system. Thanks!</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oinkness, since you say you don't know how the site functions, I have taken the liberty of putting a short welcome message on your talk page. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 18:06, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you MisterHand! Now I just must figure out how to get there! ;) As far as notability goes, there are a few things <i>notable</i> which I will list for your viewing pleasure, and you can decide from that wether the article may stay or not. I understand it is up to you and I will hold nothing against you for doing your job, for you seem to do it honestly and very effectively!</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Has been prominently featured in any major music media.</i> - Rainwound has been featured in some internet magazines, and participated in interviews. You can't quite call that Major media, but it is underground media... Rainwound is an underground band working it's way out into the public musical conciousness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i> - Brandon S. is a member of a local band called Terranova, and also a band called Harvist localed in West Virginia. Harvist is distrobuted by a label called "Dark Horizon Records". Their work can be purchased from Amazon.com apart from other various locations. A side-project by Brandon S. called Satanic Dirge is to be featured on a <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a> compilation sometime in January and also recording a full-length debut for label Appalachian Stronghold. It's not extremely notable as far as <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> or the current popular superstar or whatnot, but as far as <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_music.html" title="Underground music">underground music</a> goes, it's probably somewhat notable. :)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</i> - ...I think the style is unique, but I don't want to toot my own horn here.. It's a mixture of progressive rock and black metal, and video game music.. something that is not commonly done, so it may be prominently representative of a notable style. Rainwound and <a href="../../../t/e/r/TerraNova_0791.html" title="TerraNova">TerraNova</a> are both located in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgettstown.html" title="Burgettstown">Burgettstown</a> (City) and are the most varied as far as musical content (rather than the basic <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> that dominates the area).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</i> - Radio appearances are currently in negotiation and being sorted out. I think there is an internet radio that already plays songs, and also songs by Satanic Dirge. Still, not major radio network, but depending on who listens it may be heard nationally since it's on the internet and available for anyone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here's one more, I don't know if it applies - <i>Has been a significant musical influence on a musician or composer that qualifies for the above list.</i> - I was notified by a member of Mourning Glory (note: not the wikipedia one) that they were influenced by Rainwound, and wrote a song called <i>Raven Dawn</i> which was more progressive than their usual material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, and I hope this helps out a bit. Of course the band is working to become more notable, I think that is the goal of most bands, if not all. Everyone wants to be heard! When the final recording is finished, it will be sent to a major record label like <a href="../../../i/n/s/InsideOut_Records_24f4.html" title="InsideOut Records">InsideOut Records</a> (Prog label), Nuclear Blast America, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century_Media_d920.html" title="Century Media">Century Media</a>, or <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a>... pretty much the top heavy labels at the moment. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 19:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge difference between sending a recording to a major label and having it released, especially for a band's first release on the label. "No contract" usually means no release, especially so on the major national-level labels. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 20:20, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Errr ok just a quick clarification here, when I say <a href="../../../u/s/b/USBM_4cfa.html" title="USBM">USBM</a>, I am referring to United States Black Metal. Sorry about the confusion. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 19:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Withholding "vote" 48 hours</b> in light of above assertions.</s> However...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) All of these assertions would be more effective if they can be distilled into the article and documented with appropriate references. It may be difficult for underground bands, but then again, notability is a part of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and that means demonstrating notability is difficult for groups in this genre of music. Underground media by its nature precludes this as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Notability is not based on what a band (even a one-person band) is <i>going</i> to do. It's "What has it done?" or "What is it doing now?" If you're conceding that it hasn't been discussed in major music media yet, that hurts the article's case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>So I just need to add all the accomplishments of the band into the article? --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) If the band has not yet made a release on a nationally-distributed label or charted on a national sales/airplay chart, notability cannot be attained on this count.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Does it count if the release is distributed nationally by the band? CDs have already been sent to all corners of the U.S., and overseas! --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) A one-person band reflects the notability of the person who is it. To assert notability of the band is to assert it of the member as well. This has yet to be demonstrated here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) Harvist is equally difficult to demonstrate meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as you can't use yourself and your connection with Rainwound to satisfy the notability criterion when you're using your membership in Harvist to establish notability of Rainwound. At least one must stand by itself in order to use that provision of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The same is true of Satanic Dirge.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6) Your article doesn't demonstrate that your act has become "the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city" - and, again, the city itself must be considered. If the city is New York City or Seattle or Miami, it would have much more weight than Huntington, West Virginia, or Chillicothe, Ohio... or Redding, California.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) Negotiations for radio performances are different from actual performances. "Major radio networks" must be at least regional, not local, in scope... and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> specifically mentions "national."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Wouldn't internet radio count as national if the stream is viewable from any country or area? --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>8) As for the last category that you cite, since Mourning Glory's article has yet to demonstrate that Rainwound is one of its influences, this cannot be applied... yet. Also, I am not sure that the Mourning Glory article would survive an AfD vote should one come up... yet. I'll leave that issue for others.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Mourning Glory</b> The Mourning Glory I speak of is not the one featured on Wikipedia, but one from Texas. All I have is a quote from the songwriter saying he was influenced by Rainwound's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>. --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkness_409d.html" title="User:Oinkness">Oinkness</a> 02:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> can be demonstrated in the article with the appropriate references, I'll be returning in 48 hours to urge a speedy delete as a vanity article written by the one member of the band. I wish you the best in trying to get the article encyclopedic, and I hope this commentary helps. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 20:16, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The band was formed less than a year ago and has yet to release a recording. Unverified claims to satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> are meaningles and in this case implausible.
