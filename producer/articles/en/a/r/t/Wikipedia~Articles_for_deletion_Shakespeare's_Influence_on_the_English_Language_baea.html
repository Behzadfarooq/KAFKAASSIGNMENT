<p>This is an essay, not an encyclopedic article - it's drawing original conclusions.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Rework to remove OR if neccessary but nearly the whole thing is sourced. The format is horrible, but the attribution is there.

<li><b>Delete</b> The format is indeed horrible as it's quite clearly an academic essay. Yeah, it is sourced... in the way one would source and academic paper. The way it's written makes it appear to be largely original research, with proper citations.

<dd>Too subjective? There are plenty of scholarly works on the topic. If an expert whom we can cite wrote about it, its a fit topic. Do you know anyone who denies he had an influence? We don't delte that which can be fixed here. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:35, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Even then, though, the article would surely have to be "Shakespeare's <i>Perceived</i> Influence on the English Language". I'm not saying I disagree that WS was the most important and influential writer in the history of the English language (as someone who studied him at Oxford, I'd be a fool to do so), and no, I don't know anyone who denies said influence (save for those who don't believe he was the sole author of his works, and that's a sufficiently large and significant debate that it can't be ignored). Even so, however, that doesn't mean that such people don't exist - and concepts such as "influence" are too abstract and subjective to ever be considered truly <i>factual</i>. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 13:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <i>title</i> is neutral, since it doesn't claim that Shakespeare has a large influence on the English language, or that he had minimal influence on it. The title merely announces that the subject of the article is whatever influence Shakespeare may have had on the language, without passing judgment. It's the article that needs rewriting. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 08:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm in the "if it's too unsalvagable, delete and start over" camp I think, most of the time. But I think there's enough goodness here (yes, it's an essay from school) that it's worth a <b>keep</b>. Failing that, userify it and work on it more. But not an outright delete I don't think. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:34, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there's the germ of a good article here, on an important topic but I agree in its current form it is weak. Improve the structure, remove rhetoric, develop some more depth in the ideas. Linguistically, Shakespeare used about ⅔million words. Something like a third of them are first (recorded) usage. He also developed some important elements like metaphor and its generative capability (extension). It's an important topic. Someone does need to do a number on it, though. Don't delete it before I've read it fully! <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 13:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Will keep this on my watchlist and reconsider if there's a lot of cleanup and some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sourcing</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 13:53, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also needs to conform to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (Favorite example: "William Shakespeare, the mastermind behind the English language, reformed it into the potential it has gained today.") <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 14:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting article. If it need cleanup, then <b>edit boldly.</b> Can anyone seriously deny that Shakespeare greatly influenced the English language? Do you want 100 citations that he did? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, it needs editing, but as noted several times above, the subject is important, and the content is not entirely useless for later editors who wish to improve it. <b>Move</b> to a title with standard capitalization if kept. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:22, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Does resemble an essay, but on a notable topic and well-referenced.
