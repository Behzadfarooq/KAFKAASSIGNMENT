<p><i>Delete.</i> Is this guy REALLY notable? - <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdie_9cbf.html" title="User:Mrdie">Mrdie</a> 19:49, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Do not delete.</i> Hello. I am themanwhofellasleep's sister and I wrote the article. Notable? Well, fairly. He's written for radio in Britain, and as the article mentions, he is about to have his first novel published (hopefully with a foreword by Julie Burchill). As the article states, the website has been covered in large chunks of the UK press: the Guardian, the Sunday Times, Independent on Sunday, San Francisco Chronicle, Zoo Magazine, Word Magazine and he has a regular column in Time Out London. The reason I added him was that I saw Rob Manuel of B3ta on here, and I figured that if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for Greg. Surely the point of Wikipedia is that it can be far more exhaustive and detailed than other, offline encyclopedia? <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDis_embodied_723c.html" title="User:Dis embodied">Dis_embodied</a> (UTC), author of the article}}</li>
<li><i>Do not delete.</i> I'm a big fan of Greg's work, and know many others with similar enthusiasm for it. He is referred to surprisingly often on the internet, occasionally without a link to his site; the page here is useful for more detail. Greg may currently be a somewhat obscure artist, but this will in all likelihood change in the near future with the launch of his book and his continuing media contributions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jackjordan334 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackjordan334_fe88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackjordan334">contribs</a>) 18:32, 5 October 2005 (UTC), his only edit.</small></li>
<li><i>Do not delete.</i>The question of whether the article falls foul of Vanity Information guidelines has been raised (whether the subject is "Typical" or "Noteworthy"). I would suggest that the subject's activities as outlined are atypical and known to a sizeable community on the web as well as a more general audience via growing media exposure. The subject is therefore "Noteworty". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.13.69.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.13.69.170_eff7.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.13.69.170">contribs</a>) 18:51, 5 October 2005 (UTC), his only edit.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> despite the socks. Yes I am a fan of the site, but I certainly think he/it is notable enough. He has had plenty of press coverage, I can vouch for having seen many of the ones mentioned. See also <a href="http://www.themanwhofellasleep.com/aboot.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themanwhofellasleep.com/aboot.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and the section "What plans does themanwhofellasleep have for the future?"

<li>Please find the press articles and add <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Sources_of_articles_Generic_citations_2876.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles/Generic citations">press citations</a> for them to the article. The subject's own web site does not link to them, and a quick search of the on-line versions of the various publications listed turns up no articles. (The only thing that I did find was two sentences about the web site, not the person, in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1424449,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1424449,00.html" rel="nofollow">a roundup of events in <i>The Guardian</i></a>. That's far from the "feature on the site" that the subject says was published.) So far we only have the words of the subject and of several anonymous and pseudonymous editors that such articles exist. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:11, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aside from the one from the <i>Chronicle</i>, those are <i>not</i> the press articles. They are images from the subject's own web site, which could have been made up using <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoshop.html" title="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> for all that we know. They are <i>not</i> from a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a>, being provided by the subject xyrself. (One only has to remember <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a> to realize that one cannot trust purported press coverage the only evidence for which comes from the subject's own web site.) For similar reasons, "scanned in clippings" from the subject's "sister" are not from a reliable source. I ask again: Please find the actual press articles and add citations for them to the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:28, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. Why would anyone go to that much trouble to fake those press clippings? I personally remember seeing the Grauniad one, and the regular appearances in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Out_dcb6.html" title="Time Out">Time Out</a>. Plus remember not everything is available online, and I doubt these scans will be found anywhere else. In the case of websites I personally believe offline coverage implies greater notability. As for the sockpuppets, you aren't helping. If you want to provide evidence/reasons to keep then please sign up and do so from <b>one</b> account. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?!"</font></a> 13:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assuming good faith has no application here. Please read the page that you are referring to and refamiliarize yourself with what it is actually about. It deals with editors contributing to Wikipedia, <i>not</i> with people publishing stuff out in the Big Wide World. <i>That</i> is dealt with in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:reliable sources</a>. Your question was already answered in what I wrote above. I once again point to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a>. Anyone who always uncritically assumes supposed third-party coverage, that is supplied by the subject of that coverage xyrself on xyr own web site rather than from an independent source or the actual third party, to be true, is being far too credulous. Anyone who thinks that people don't make up things and post them on their own web sites is being naive. Looking for <i>multiple sources that are independent from the subject</i> is as much good encyclopaedism as it is good journalism. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:39, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
