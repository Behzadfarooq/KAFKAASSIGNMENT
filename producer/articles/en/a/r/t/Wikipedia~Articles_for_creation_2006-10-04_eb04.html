<p>Steve Campbell - Steve is a well-known freelance director with years of experience of communicating to children. He has directed commercials for clients such as Dairylea, Huggies, Childline and the British Dyslexia Association, as well as trailers for CBeebies He has recently completed several commercials for McDonalds helping children to curve obesity by trying to persuade them to eat 5 fruits a day. The programmes, based around simple songs, were repeated a number of times over a period of days to encourage children to learn the songs and respond to the messages conveyed. The Director Steve Campbell commented:</p>
<p>“We know that having fun is a number one motivator in getting kids to learn and therefore singing and dancing is a strong, and proven, method of educating children, particularly about topics which don’t carry as much immediate interest for them. Learning comes through interaction not lectures, creating the ‘YumChums’ and using them in conjunction with a character as popular as Ronald McDonald will help parents as they try to communicate these messages themselves in a relevant and fun way.”</p>

<p>An <b>erectometer</b> is a device that transforms the circumference of the male <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> into a documentable value. Often that value is documented as a graph, so that changes over the time are can be evidenced.</p>

The Forty-ninth Spirit is Crocell, or Crokel. He appeares in the Form of an Angel. He is a Duke Great and Strong, speaking something Mystically of Hidden Things. He teaches the Art of Geometry and the Liberal Sciences. He, at the Command of the Exorcist, will produce Great Noises like the Rushings of many Waters, although there be none. He warmes Waters, and discoveres Baths. He was of the Order of Potestates, or Powers, before his fall, as he declared unto the King Solomon. He governes 48 Legions of Spirits. His Seal is this, the which wear thou as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Emitex was a vinyl record preservation product designed for use on records to preserve the quality of the analog signal stamped into the vinyl. The system consists of two parts, a liquid and a soft fabric. To use the system, the liquid was sprayed onto a cloth and then the cloth was lightly hand rubbed onto the record. The bottom right hand side on the reverse side of some record covers from the 60's and 70's have an endorsement to "Use New Emitex to keep your record clean and dust free." This endorsement was absent from most record sleeves by the mid 70's.</p>

<p>The marriage plot is a term used, often in academic circles, to categorize a storyline that recurs in novels most prominently and in films most recently. Until the expansion of marriage rights to same-sex couples, this plot centered exclusively on the courtship ritual between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptual payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the bourgeois novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters.</p>
<p>Deconstructionist criticism of the last thirty years has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the bourgeoisie. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the medieval romance, which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberalize romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the bourgeoisie and to some extent, the working classes, who are relegated to comic relief in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's Pamela, wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent chastity and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B.</p>
<p>Film, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the "romantic comedy." At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film You've Got Mail, which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss Tom Hanks and bookshop-around-the-corner owner, Meg Ryan, by uniting its lead characters in a saccharine union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.</p>

Michael Clayman is the lead singer of the ska group Ill Humour. The main writer for the group, their songs focus mostly around corruption, and government (commonly found relating to each other). Born in 1989 he grew up in Southeast D.C. Michael was forced to learn about life the hard way. After becoming notorious for his song writing, helping his friends in the rap group Duck Butter write songs for their Black Panther Movement album. After working with the ska group Reel Big Fish in the movie Baseketball, Michael devolped an infatuation with ska music. After moving to the town of middletown, MD (also known as "the bubble" for its close-mindedness and rascism)</p>
<p>Michael created a band with his friends Andrew Gumas, Merrick Smith, and Eric Norris. Michael on guitar and vocals, Merrick on bass, Andrew on trumpet, and Eric on drums. They soon become town legend under the name Ill humour. After becoming famous for their use of trumpets in their music they were asked to play for the prime minister of New Zeland, Tyrone Jones. Soon Michael converted to Buddism and became infatuated with the monkey god. Along with Michael's change, the band went to a socialist retreat in the city of Munich. During the retreat the KGB took over and held every one hostage, brain washing them into insanity. After the event, in 1999, Ill Humour came out with their first album Time's End. Later in 2001 their 2nd album, Meow, came out smashingly. In 2005 the prime minister of New Zeland came to the US and hosted a ska/indie concert featuring Ill Humour, and Interpol.</p>

<p>Virginia Piper, a Minneapolis socialite, was kidnapped from her Orono, Minnesota home on July 27, 1972. She was found unharmed and chained to a tree in Jay Cooke State Park on July 29, 1972 after her husband, Minneapolis investment banker Harry Piper paid a million dollar ransom in marked $20 bills. Some of the ranson money was passed in the fall of 1972, but the individuals who passed the bills were not apprehended. In 1977 the United States Attorney charged Donald Floyd Larson and Kenneth James Callahan with kidnapping Ms. Piper and briefly taking her across state lines into Wisconsin. Callahan and Larson were convicted in federal court of kidnapping Ms. Piper, and they were sentenced to life imprison by Federal Judge Edward Devitt. However, their conviction was overturned and a new trial was ordered by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. At the retrial in 1979 Callahan and Larson were acquitted. Kenneth Callahan lived in Wisconsin until his death last year. Donald Larson is incarcerated in a Minnesota State Prison for the murder of his wife, his wife's lover, and for one or more of his children. He was convicted of murder in the middle 1970's, after being acquitted of kidnapping Ms. Piper. He is one of the oldest inmates alive in a Minnesota Correctional Facility. Virginia Piper died of pancreatic cancer in 1988 and Harry Piper died of prostrate cancer in 1990. Harry Piper,Jr., Virginia Piper's oldest son is writing a book about his mother; he lives in Oregon. Ms. Piper's other two children, David and Addison, live in Minnesota. The Piper kidnapping is considered one of the nation's most famous unsolved kidnapping. The Virginia Piper Cancer Institute in Minneapolis is in honor of Virginia Piper. Ms. Piper was the first female chair of the Board of Directors at Abbott Northwestern Hospital, now affiliated with the Allina corporation.</p>

<p>Numerous newspaper articles, particularly in the Star Tribune (Minneapolis) have been written about the famous 1972 Virginia Piper kidnapping. It is referenced in "All the President's Men," by Woodward and Bernstein. The reason it is referenced is because Kenneth Dahlberg, a republican fundraiser for the Nixon 1972 re-election campaign from Minnesota, was contacted by Woodward or Bernstein, but said he was too upset to talk because of the Virginia Piper kidnapping. It is also referenced in the book "Along Came a Spider," as a famous unsolved kidnapping.</p>

<p><b>Description</b> Maraq is a small Middle-Eastern state that borders Iran, Pakistan, and the Gulf of Oman.</p>
<p>Maraq is currently ruled by King Zafar Akbar III who has ruled since 1990, his brother Feroz is next inline for the thrown and is currently the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p><b>History of Maraq</b> Modern History of Maraq (1900-2006)</p>
<p>Zafar Akbar II (1912-1999) was crowned King in 1926 at the age of 14. Like his father before him, Zafar II was a deeply religious man. The country of Maraq prospered under his rule (1926-1992).</p>
<p>Maraq joined the United Nations in 1957 and established diplomatic relations with the United States in 1981. It was at this meeting in 1981 with President Carter that Akbar II rejected the idea of a military alliance with the United States. The King explained that while diplomatic relations were considered within the nation’s interest, a military alliance might destabilize the Maraqan efforts to remain at peace with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>The United States asked again in 1983 to build a military base in exchange for weapons and an economic package. Zafar II refused, stating that while the country of Maraq wanted the United States as a friend, he did not want to be beholden to Western powers.</p>
<p>In 1992, Zafar II relinquished his throne and was succeeded by his son, Zafar Akbar III.</p>
<p>Akbar III is crowned in an era of continuous strife within the Middle East. In an effort to maintain stability within Maraq, he asks his father’s advisors to remain.</p>
<p>In 1993, the foreign policy of Maraq and Akbar III changes from isolationism to globalization. A new U.S. President (Clinton) approaches Akbar III to again propose a US-Maraqan military alliance. Akbar III, considered to be less conservative and religious than his ancestors is welcome to westernization and begins to discuss a U.S. military base along the north-eastern border of Maraq, near Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>In April of 1994, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aleser al Coman, resigns his position. A long-time friend of the royal family, it was a surprising move by the Foreign Affairs Minister. Local press reported that the Minister’s resignation came after his vocal disagreement with the King and was meant to shown his disapproval of U.S. involvement in Maraq. A month later, the United States is granted the right to build a military base along the Iranian border. The King’s brother, Prince Feroz Akbar is named the new Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>To further United States-Maraqan relations the King sends his son, Prince Qadir Akbar (1979-) to school within the United States.</p>
<p>In November of 1994, a portion of Aleser al Coman’s memoirs are leaked to the local press. In his writings, the former official spoke of his close relationship with Akbar.</p>
<p>“…the king spoke before his ministers today. Declaring that Maraq must steer clear of western alliances and that the sword of religion, and not the weapon of a U.S. dollar, should dictate Maraq’s future.” (1973)</p>
<p>“…the king was again approached by the western super-power. Zafar did not hesitate to refuse what he deemed would be the beginning of the end. The westernization of Maraq. I remember the talks and honor them still.” (1983)</p>
<p>“…and today I watched the son ignore the father’s advice. Never in my day did I expect to see a King of Maraq kowtow to the West. I have advised Akbar against this military base and made it clear my intentions to leave my position if he continues what I deem an injustice to the people. Many agree with me but are afraid to lose all they hold dear. But I am prepared to resign.” (1993)</p>
<p>Zafar Akbar II, while in the United States visiting his grandson, Prince Qadir Akbar, at Philips Exeter Academy, was questioned by the foreign press, about Coman’s memoirs. Zafar II responded to questions from the American press with the following statement: “I hold the former Minister of Foreign Affairs’ opinion in high regard and would hope that my son would listen to someone of similar persuasion.” After this, a few protests of U.S. involvement begins in Maraq and opposition to the King grows in the north-western provinces of the country, but most protests are quickly quelled.</p>
<p>In August of 1999, the beloved King Zafar Akbar II dies at the age of 87.</p>
<p>On September 1 1999, two weeks after his father’s death, Akbar III replaces all the remaining Ministers from his father’s government. In an effort to create a more secular government he abolishes the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, instead choosing to create a Division of Islamic Affairs within Ministry of Culture. This was a drastic move for the King that destabilized the government. Many of the former Ministers, appalled by the King’s lack of tradition, join the growing opposition to his rule.</p>
<p>In February of 2000, a bomb explodes outside the U.S. military base. There are no casualties and no one accepts responsibility for the crime. The King dispatches the Maraqan military to the northern provinces to quash any rising tensions. Maraqan intelligence agents begin to suspect that it is the former Minister Aleser al Coman’s son Tariq, who is stirring the rebels. There is no further intelligence to substantiate these claims at this time.</p>
<p>In March of 2000, Prince Qadir Akbar graduates from Saud Islamic University. The royal family and friends travel to Saudi Arabia. There, Tariq, a long time friend of Qadir’s and former graduate of Saud Islamic University, makes a toast at an event sponsored by the Islamic Culture Group on campus (in which Qadir was an active member.) In the toast Tariq condemns his King’s relationship with the United States and congratulates Qadir on his loyalty to his grandfather’s [Zafar II] memory.</p>
<p>In late July 2002, Tariq moves to Zàhedan, Iran accompanied by members of a Maraqan resistances group known as “Al Seif,” which promotes and follows the anti-western beliefs of Zafar II. In June of 2003, reports begin to circulate of Tariq’s movements and regular meetings with other members of “Al Seif” and well-known Middle Eastern terrorist groups. In early December of 2003, phone calls between Tariq and Prince Qadir are intercepted.</p>
<p>When questioned by his father about his involvement with the resistance group in April 2004, Qadir abdicates from the throne and moves to Zàhedan with Tariq. His uncle Prince Feroz Akbar replaces Prince Qadir in the order of succession.</p>
<p>Beginning in January of 2005, the country of Maraq suffers a significant recession. Angst against the government grows and a few skirmishes take place around the country. In June, the King lays off 10% of the military forces due to the recession. By the end of the year, the parq [Maraqan currency] has fallen from 2 parqs to the dollar to 16 parqs to the dollar. In August, the King forces two high ranking and well respected generals into early retirement after they speak out against the forced reductions.</p>
<p>In January 2006, the U.S. Secretary of State travels to Maraq to offer economic aid. Throughout his visit, the Secretary is met with protests and violence. The Secretary of State and King Akbar III begin discussing plans for a long-term loan from the United States to revive the Maraqan economy. The Secretary of State further vows to help secure an IMF loan for Maraq in April. A meeting of the IMF is to be held in Washington DC in March and the King agrees to send his Minister of Economics and Trade to give a speech on international development.</p>
<p>News of a potential western loan has spread through the country. The political arm of Al Seif, led by Prince Qadir, has been holding demonstrations in Fajar, Denat, Dubaly and Kasheram.</p>
<p>On September 15, 2006 three U.S. marines were accused of beating and raping two women in Kasharem. Two days later, Maraqan officials placed U.S. Majors Jason McDonald and Daniel Brown under arrest after capturing the soldiers at a local café. The soldiers are currently being held in a Maraqan prison in Kasheram. U.S. Ambassador Franers has been negotiating their release. Local and foreign press have covered this story continuously for the last week. Protests have escalated outside the prison, the military base in Kasheram and the U.S. Embassy in Fajar.</p>

<p>Sky Vineyards is a fourteen-acre vineyard and small family winery nestled between the crown of Mt. Veeder and the expansive sky. Planted at an elevation of 2100 feet and on the eastern-facing hillside, the Zinfandel and Syrah grapevines ripen under full sun and fog-cooled evenings into intense berries. The reddish volcanic soil and unique physical characteristics of Sky produce a unique wine that reflects where it was grown and the care and attention it receives at every step of the process.</p>
<p>Sky Vineyards strives to incorporate sustainable practices into the cultivation of the vines and operation of the winery. Responsible practices include use of permanent cover crops, dry farming, promotion of bird and beneficial insects, and use of organic or low impact pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
<p>The resulting intensely flavored fruit is then hand-harvested and fermented in open top one-ton bins. Punch down is performed by hand three times per day. After fermentation, it is pressed in a traditional basket press and aged in French oak barrels. Lore Olds designs artwork for each new vintage.</p>

Daniel Whitehead Hicky was an American poet of the 20th Century. He seems to have lived in Georgia. Amongst others he was friends with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mitchell" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">Margaret Mitchell</a> (author of the enormously popular novel GONE WITH WIND (1936)). A letter between them is available online. Various sources quote his works, but there does not seem to be a coherent biography about him anywhere.</p>
<p>Amongst others he wrote the following poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who pilots ships knows all a heart can know of beauty. and his eyes can close in death and be content. Who pilots ships, when life's last heartbeats stop, has drained the cup of beauty drop by drop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem appears in the closing scenes of a documentary about the 2002-2003 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VELUX_5_Oceans_Race" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VELUX_5_Oceans_Race" rel="nofollow">Around Alone Ocean Yacht Race</a>. The longest solo race in any sport. One of the competitors, Simone Bianchetti, died shortly after finishing 2nd overall in this race. As a tribute to him (and other yachtsmen) this poem appears in the closing scenes of the documentary.</p>

<p>2.3) He seems to have been publishing from 1928 through to 1950: Source: <a href="http://users.ev1.net/%7Ehomeville/fictionmag/d618.htm#A29397" class="external free" title="http://users.ev1.net/%7Ehomeville/fictionmag/d618.htm#A29397" rel="nofollow">http://users.ev1.net/%7Ehomeville/fictionmag/d618.htm#A29397</a></p>
<p>2.4) Several books by him are listed on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-8820204-9467354?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Daniel+Whitehead+Hicky&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-8820204-9467354?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Daniel+Whitehead+Hicky&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>2.5) Other people have also been searching for him: Dear Burning Questions, A favorite author is Daniel Whitehead Hicky. He wrote a book of poems entitled Bright Harbor, copyrighted 1932 and 1960. As a poet, he wrote "A Ship for Singapore," "Polo Player," "To an Aviator," and "Who Pilots Ships." His poem about the polo player was published in Polo magazine. That and other poems were published in an anthology called All the Silver Pennies. It was edited by Blanche Jennings Thompson and copyrighted in 1967. Have you ever heard of him?</p>
<p>Sandra A. Merlini Marlborough, MA</p>
<p>Atheneum did publish the children's collection of poetry in 1967, but it is now out of print. Cherokee Publications published Poems of Daniel Whitehead Hicky in 1975, but I'm afraid that, too, is out of print. Has anyone seen or heard of this guy? Come on, there has to be a chapbook or obscure anthology out there somewhere with his name on it.</p>

<p>Joe Taylor, Jr. (born December 8, 1944 on the Isle of Wight, England, to Jenny Rose Taylor and Joseph Taylor).</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor is the subject of a Canadian federal court decision regarding citizenship of offspring of Canadian soldiers serving overseas.</p>
<p>His father and mother met during World War Two. He was born out of wedlock but his parents married in England on May 5, 1945. Jenny and Joe, Jr., were patriated to Canada during the great war-bride migration in 1946.</p>
<p>After the marriage failed, Jenny returned to England with her son in the late 1940s. They returned to England on a Canadian passport which Mr. Taylor continues to have in his possession.</p>
<p>Assuming that he was a Canadian citizen, Joe years later returned to Canada to retire, residing in Victoria, British Columbia. In 2002 Canadian officials informed Taylor that he has lost his citizenship on his 24th birthday by failing to fill in form requesting retention of his status. Immigration officials forced him to leave Canada.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2006, Mr. Justice J. Martineau of the Canadian Federal Court ordered that the Canadian government reinstate Joe Taylor as a Canadian citizen.</p>
<p>On September 29, 2006, the Canadian government appealed Justice Martineau's order to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_%28The_Venture_Bros.%29_9f69.html" title="Monarch (The Venture Bros.)">The Monarch</a></b> (voiced by Christopher McCulloch): Dr. Venture's self-styled archnemesis. He is obsessed with <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_butterfly.html" title="Monarch butterfly">Monarch butterflies</a>, which he claims raised him as a child. In fact, he only spent a few months unsuccessfully imitating them before returning to the city, and still seems to have almost no understanding of their biology or behavior. Though he frequently describes himself as Dr. Venture's nemesis, their rivalry resides almost completely in the Monarch's imagination. In reality, Dr. Venture considers him more a nuisance than a genuine threat. His plans against the Venture family are usually bizarre and fail for a number of sad reasons. At the end of season one, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison after being framed by the Phantom Limb. However, in the second season, he escaped and began trying to rebuild his criminal operation.
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_henchmen.html#.2321" title="Monarch henchmen">Henchman 21</a></b>, whose real name is <b>Gary</b> (voiced by Doc Hammer): an overweight pop-culture geek. He is always accompanied by Henchman 24. Wrote (or at least provided the cover-photo for) "Flight of the Monarch", a tell-all that starts the chain of events ending in the Monarch's incarceration. In the first episode of season two, being without costume for the first time, he is described by 24 as resembling Kevin Smith. He briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a supervillain himself, "the Viceroy." When he isn't with the Monarch, he lives at home with his mother and runs a comic book hotline.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_henchmen.html#.2324" title="Monarch henchmen">Henchman 24</a></b>, (voiced by Christopher McCulloch): a tall, thin man with voice characteristics resembling comic Ray Romano. He and Henchman 21 frequently have arguments about unusual hypothetical situations. Is described by 21 in the first episode of the second season as resembling <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> with a unibrow.</li>

She bears a remarkable similarity to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis_980e.html" title="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a> and shares her <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> accent. Her comically deep voice (the character is voiced by a man) is a parody of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis_980e.html" title="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a>' relatively low voice for a woman, and rumors that she is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexual.html" title="Transsexual">transsexual</a> have been dispelled as a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring_%28plot_device%29.html" title="Red herring (plot device)">red herring</a>. After being thrown out by the Monarch, she has moved back in with Phantom Limb, although she seems somewhat torn between the two. She is currently single and seeking out new hench-partners.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Werner_%C3%9Cnderbheit_308f.html" title="Baron Werner Ünderbheit">Baron Werner Ünderbheit</a></b> (voiced by T. Ryder Smith): A noted member of the Guild of Calamitous Intent and former tyrant dictator of Ünderland. He wears a prosthetic metal jaw and speaks in a thick, pseudo-German accent. He blames Dr. Venture for the loss of his jaw; as he says, "In my country, a lab-partnership is a sacred trust. One is always supposed to look out for one's lab-partner! Venture did not..." Baron Ünderbheit is a parody of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Doom_2ca9.html" title="Doctor Doom">Doctor Doom</a> and has been jokingly identified as such in the context of show (e.g. The Monarch referred to him as "that dime store Doctor Doom"). It's worth noting that Ünderland resides within the borders of Michigan as a sovereign nation.
<ul>
<li><b>Manservant</b> (voiced by Christopher McCulloch): Baron Ünderbheit's long-time personal servant, given to him as a birthday present from his mother while he was in college. He is so completely devoted to Ünderbheit that he almost seems to have no will of his own; he speaks in a zombielike monotone, and always appears to be staring into space. His fate after the deposition of Baron Ünderbheit is unknown.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantom_Limb_9656.html" title="Phantom Limb">Phantom Limb</a></b> (voiced by James Urbaniak): A villain with invisible arms and legs. He is arguably the most competent villain seen thus far in the <i>Venture Brothers</i> universe, although he seems largely indifferent to the Ventures themselves. He framed the Monarch for murder and attempted to foil the Monarch's escape plot, ostensibly because he wants Dr. Girlfriend all to himself. His name and invisible limbs are references to the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantom_limb.html" title="Phantom limb">phantom limb</a> syndrome experienced by amputees.

<li><b>Watch</b> and <b>Ward</b> (voiced by Christopher McCulloch and Doc Hammer respectively): Two Guild operatives who work directly with Phantom Limb.

King Gorilla was a member of the Guild of Calamitous Intent until his imprisonment for brutal murder and rape (in that order) of <a href="../../../m/%C3%B6/t/M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe_9fb0.html" title="Mötley Crüe">Mötley Crüe</a> lead singer <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Neil_c8aa.html" title="Vince Neil">Vince Neil</a> during a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_TV_3699.html" title="Reality TV">reality TV</a> show. Because of his high-profile crime, the Guild turned its back on King Gorilla and has led to the villain becoming bitter and cynical towards the Guild. After kidnapping and attempting to rape the Monarch, he was moved enough by the Monarch's quest to regain Dr. Girlfriend's love that he assisted in the fellow villain's escape from prison. His ability to talk and walk upright is not explained, and he has an obsession with <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> (Jackson Publick has suggested that he somehow houses and raises multiple Tarzans in his cell or the common area of the prison).

<p>oops</p>
<p>only made another one cause i didn't see the 1st one</p>
<p><b>Monty Halls</b> is the new face of adventure. A former Royal Marines Officer and trained marine biologist, Monty has led teams through some of the most demanding environments on land and at sea. His adventures include discovering a lost Atlantis in the Indian Ocean, exploring pre-historic underwater cave systems off the Cape of Good Hope amid great white sharks, avoiding the bullets of poachers in Africa, and photographing a dangerous and rare crocodile underwater for the first time. His recent TV series ‘Great Ocean Adventures’ on Channel 5 received rave reviews.</p>
<p>Monty excels at entertaining his audience. He has an engaging personality and it is no surprise that the man who has been called ‘the new Cousteau’ and ‘a cross between Indiana Jones and a male model’ is increasingly in demand for TV presenting work.</p>
<p>Monty has presented several television programmes including Great Ocean Adventures (C5, 2005) Journey to the Centre of the Earth (C4, 2004). He also won Superhumans - Channel 4’s competition to find the ultimate human performer in Britain in 2004!</p>

<p>During this period of time he was found to be dyslexic through varyous tests by the school. this promted his mother to quit her job working in a nursery. she applid for a job in Moor Park privet school, this funded Tobys brief two years in the same school in which his dyslexia was attened to. Toby later said "the two years at moor park gave me a real insight into how people of a higher class live altough I was young I always thought why am I here with these snobs"</p>
<p>Toby then attended Wigmore High School and met up with old freinds from luston toby said "it was good to be around what i considered to be normal people however i found i missed the freinds i made at moor park, the same freinds i had looked down on" toby soon over come his fears of wether his years at moor park had changed him and made lots of life long freinds.</p>
<p>In his final year at Wigmore he took up the sport he is famous for. during the begining of the summer holidays in his 4th year he attended a local music festivel; Sheep Music in local town of prestine. he commented later:"it was the drunkest period of my life" here he met lots of new kinds of people and inspired by "a load of hippys" bought a diablo (circus impliment) he mastered this in the weeks of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>From here a passion grow and he contined to collect different skills, one being juggling. toby now at the age of 16 has been awarded the title of juggling master by the IJA (international juggling association)he now travels all around the worlds teaching children in schools how to juggle and said "teaching kids to juggle with the IJA in Afganistan with the MMCC has to be one of the highlights of my life".</p>
<p>Toby now wants to contine working for the IJA, but in the meantime lives with his family when he isnt away with the IJA. "juggling is my life, theres nothing like performing or watching a first timer get there head around the basic cascade!"</p>

Geographically located at the south of the Margaret River region in the Western part of Australia, Leeuwin Estate has been founded in 1972 by Denis Horgan. Before taking a crucial decision to build a winery, Mr. Horgan had bought 300 hectares of land with the only intention to grow cattle. Consisting of two founding members; Denis Horgan and Robert Mondavi, the very first vinery was established in 1974, when the vineyards had been deep-ploughed, deep-ribbed, emptied of stones, planned, pegged, measured, marked and finally hand-planted. It was finally launched in 1978, due to the success of its trial vintage. (Adapted from Hutchings 2006)</p>
<p>In 1979, Leeuwin Estate reputation was propelled to the international level by the “Decanter Magazine” from the United Kingdom. The prestigious magazine had given its highest recommendation to the Leeuwin Art Series Chardonnay in a blind tasting done in 1980. At this point, it can be said that the Estate was not at the peak of its surprises, as their international reputation was further enhanced in 1985 through the staging of the very first Leeuwin concert, which featured the London Philharmonic Orchestra. According to Denis Horgan, “It was one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world.” (Leeuwin Estate Winery 2005). Incorporating a state-of-the-art technology with old world techniques to develop world class wines, Leeuwin Estate is one of the most advanced wineries which exist in the Southern Hemisphere today.</p>
<p>This business report has been requested by the managerial team of Leeuwin Estate, in order to analyse their current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, which they are currently secured into. The report will also examine the areas where further effort will need to be laid emphasis on, so as to make the Leeuwin Estate a more profitable organization. The main purpose of this report is therefore to analyse the projects to be established, such as the proposal by the external business consultant for the purchase of the coach, as well as to determine the minimum price that can be quoted for the dinner, through a series of workings.</p>
<p>In pinpointing the different areas where more emphasis will have to be laid, the management team of Leeuwin Estate will be able to determine and to take appropriate measures which are required to operate in a more profitable framework, and this will benefit the Estate in a large extent in its long-run operations.</p>

The Woodberry Hello is a term commonly used to describe male on male genital rubbing, often known as "The Princeton Rub" or "The Ivy League Rub" due to the history of these early schools having all-male students. It is a means of engaging in sexual activity for gay men without running the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. It is also commonly referred to as <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frottage.html" title="Frottage">frottage</a> The term was originally coined in Lexington, Massachusetts, where two gay men (whose names are not being used to protect their identities) met on Woodberry Rd., a small alley on the West side of Lexington. When the two men went to embrace, their penises touched, as they both happened to have erections at the time. One remarked to the other, "Well, that's one way to say hello!" Seeing the humor in the situation, they coined the phrase "The Woodberry Hello," and have spread its use well beyond Massachusetts. Now, it is a commonly used phrase in pop culture throughout the nation.</p>

They began to raise cattle along the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina_River_df73.html" title="Medina River">Medina River</a> and were involved in the cattle trade bettwen Spanish Lousisiana and South Texas. Notable among these were the Ruiz and Casillas families. Early records of Von Ormians can be found in the baptismal, burial and marriage records of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_San_Jose_dc69.html" title="Mission San Jose">Mission San Jose</a> and Mission Espada; they are usually listed as living "on the Medina" or simply "Medina."</p>
<p>By early 19th century, Von Ormy was an established community, serving as the crossing point of the Medina along the Camino Real. During the Mexican War for Independence, the "Battle of the Medina" was fought nearby. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Ana_43a3.html" title="Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana">Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana</a> served as a Lieutenant and became familiar with the area during this campaign.</p>

<p>During the War of Texas Independence, Mexican General <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Ana_2c83.html" title="Santa Ana">Santa Ana</a> camped in Von Ormy prior to making his final march on the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamo.html" title="Alamo">Alamo</a>. The spot is marked by the Santa Ana Oak, a large <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_oak.html" title="Red oak">red oak</a> under which the General encamped. Blas Herrera, the "<a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Revere_ebd6.html" title="Paul Revere">Paul Revere</a>" of the Texas Revolution rode his horse from Von Ormy to San Antonio to warn the town of Santa Ana's approach. After the war, the doors to the Alamo were taken to the Herrera ranch were they stayed until the <a href="../../../d/a/u/Daughters_of_the_Republic_of_Texas_8571.html" title="Daughters of the Republic of Texas">Daughters of the Republic of Texas</a> brought them back to the Texas shrine during their restoration of the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamo.html" title="Alamo">Alamo</a>.</p>
<p>The Ruiz-Herrera family <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery.html" title="Cemetery">cemetery</a> located in Von Ormy is the burial place of Blas Herrera and Jose Antonio Ruiz, who was <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcalde.html" title="Alcalde">alcalde</a>, or mayor, of San Antonio during the seige of the Alamo.</p>
<p>Following the war, Texas poineer Enoch Jones built a fortified ranchhouse, locally known as "the castle." Jones soon sold the property to famous Texian spy "Deaf" Smith, who lived in the house for several years. In the late 1800's the "castle" was sold to Count Adolf Von Ormay, a <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussian.html" title="Prussian">Prussian</a> count, for whom the city was named. Count Von Ormay arrived with his wife and servants from <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>. He registered a cattle brand at the <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexar_County_Courthouse_0d29.html" title="Bexar County Courthouse">Bexar County Courthouse</a>, but little else is known about him and he disappeared soon afterwards. The castle remained abandoned until the 1990s.</p>
<p>The first Catholic Church in Von Ormy was estabished by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianist.html" title="Marianist">Marianist</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionaries.html" title="Missionaries">missionaries</a> in 1836 on the Herrera Ranch. It soon became known as Santisima Trinidad Mission and was located at Garza's Crossing on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina_River_df73.html" title="Medina River">Medina River</a>. Ruins of the Church can be seen today and the historic cemetary is being eroded into the River. Santisima Trinidad burned in the late 1890's and a new Church was built by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionaries.html" title="Missionaries">missionaries</a> about a mile upstream along the new Laredo Highway's crossing of the Medina River in the 1910's. Against much local protest this rock Church was destroyed when the Laredo Highway was widened to created Interstate 35 during the 1930's. The current Church was built in the 1960's and renamed <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_Heart_of_Jesus_df82.html" title="Sacred Heart of Jesus">Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1920's, a TB sanatarium was built in the city that subsequently killed 20 percent of the population, who were infected after working in the facility.</p>
<p>The Von Ormy school operated from the early 1900's until 1956 when it closed after the creation of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Independent_School_District_1f2c.html" title="Southwest Independent School District">Southwest Independent School District</a>.</p>
<p>The town's Post Office opened as GARZAS CROSSING 16 Jan 1872 under postmaster Willian. G. M. Samuel. It was discontinued 7 May 1874 and was re-established 10 Jun 1875 under postmaster Robert. J. Sibert. It was discontinued again 16 Aug 1875.</p>
<p>On 14 Jan 1879 the town's post office was opened under the name MANN'S CROSSING under postmaster Anton F. Krause and was discontinued 9 Nov 1880. It was again re-established under postmaster Branson Bywater on 13 Sep 1886.</p>
<p>On 4 Dec 1886 the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_office.html" title="Post office">post office</a> changed its name to "VON ORMY" and the town has since been known as Von Ormy.</p>

<p>In 1914 the town had two grocers, a general store, a cotton gin, and a population of 350. In 1946 the population was still 350. After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> the community declined; in 1965 nine businesses and 100 residents were reported. Since that time the population has grown slowly, and in 1990 Von Ormy had 264 residents and twenty businesses. Currently, there is a strong movement to incproporate Von Ormy into a municipality led by the Committee to Incorporate Von Ormy (CIVO).</p>
<p>Today several poineer families who settled here prior to the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_revolution.html" title="Texas revolution">Texas revolution</a> still comprise a large percentage of Von Ormy residents, including the Ruiz, Herrera, Vara, Flores, Mann, Reyes and Quintana families.</p>
<p>Von Ormy is served by the Jarret <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteer_Fire_Department_f9aa.html" title="Volunteer Fire Department">Volunteer Fire Department</a>, which was established in 1975 in order to provide fire protection for the upcoming bicentenial celebrations.</p>

Lendell Jones II (born October 20th, 1988 in Chicago, Illinios) is an up-and-coming R&amp;B singer/artist, dancer, and songwriter.</p>
<p>Early Life</p>
<p>LiL' Mann was influenced at a young age. Present to the sound of his parents' (Lendell Jones, Sr. and Ethel Jones) ideal music, he tuned his ear to artists like: Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, Ronald Isley, and Michael Jackson. He then started to listen to those particular artists on his own and practice in front of family. Paying very close attention to his singing, his mom felt that it was time to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Career</p>
<p>LiL' Mann began doing shows and performing at local venues within' his city of residence. But it wasn't until he attented a Patti LaBelle concert that he found out what performing was all about; he was allowed on stage to sing with the legend herself! Then and there he realized that singing was his true passion and that he wanted to do it for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>While continuing to do shows, LiL' Mann began experimenting with the use of words and rhymes. After having his father to show him how to structer a song (i.e. Intro, verse 1, chorus, etc.), he began writing whole songs. He then entered the studio with a local producer to record his very first song. After becoming accustomed to the recording process and consistently recording, he took his originals to the stage performing them at major events in Chicago such as: the Jet Magazine Showcase, the 23rd and 24th Annual Chicago Music Awards, the J Records Showcase (1st Place Winner), etc.</p>
<p>He shot a video for one of his original songs which was featured on his 1st demo entitled "Don't Go". The song itself received a decent amount of spins at local radio stations while the video got an emorous amount of play on local cable channels in Chicago.</p>
<p>After recieving a hefty amount of exposure and gaining notarity, he soon decided to go regional. He traveled to St. Louis, MO where he was featured on KMOX CBS News. Then he headed to Kaukauna, WI where he opened up for R&amp;B group (which R&amp;B Hitmaker R. Kelly is formerly a member of) Public Announcement. A year after returning home, he was a runner-up in the Fox News' 2006 Chicago Idol Contest.</p>
<p>Prior to that mere accomplishment, he had some other highlights such as: performing at the 14th Annual WGCI Music Seminar, winning his first Chicago Music Award for Most Talented Teen (after being nominated 3 stright years) at the 25th Annual Chicago Music Awards, performing at the Today's Black Woman's Expo (2006) along side R&amp;B Talent Trey Songz, and being one of the midwest semi-finalists in the Disk Makers Independent Music World Series Contest which is most recent.</p>
<p>Currently</p>
<p>LiL' Mann recently completed his 2nd demo and is currently shopping it for a major record deal.</p>

<p>Alot of the other characters included in Kougo Myǘu Myǘu think that Peridot is nothing but hyper, wierd and....stupid. Most of them don't really take her all that seriously, and CAN be mean or cruel to her. Here's a quick rundown with each character:</p>

<p>Likes: Cake, Oreos, Shrimp and other things that cats like. (Yes, even catnip.)</p>
<p>Dislikes: <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> (From <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a>, copyright <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and gamefreak), Very spicy food</p>
<p>Her dislike for Pikachu is very strong. She hates this because he's the main character in Pokémon, meaning that he gets all the attention. This reminds her that she has to be the leader, so nobody will leave her alone, in this respect she gets too much attention. It's not a big deal to any of the other characers, but Peridot tends to over-react.</p>
<p>Her love for Cake and Oreos is pretty much rediculus. It's unknown why she likes these things so much, but she does. If oreos or cake are given to her, she will be extremely happy. But, she almost fears the "Uh-Oh" oreos. They are oreos that are opposite of the real ones. There is chocolate cream and the cookie part is vinilla. (Oreos and "Uh-Oh" <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oreo.html" title="Oreo">Oreos</a> are copyright <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabisco.html" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a>)</p>

<p><br />
BadPong is a new sport that has been created by two Australian teenagers, Alastair McLeod and Lachlan Morris. Upon the creation of the sport it has rapidly gained popularity and started somewhat of a cult following, particularly in Cairns on the north-eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>The sport is a mixture of Table Tennis or Ping Pong and Badminton, hence the name 'BadPong'. The game follows the same structure as a game of ping pong however badminton racquets are used and the playing table is larger than that of a ping pong table. The game is exceptionally difficult to master as it's creators have but an hours practise should be enough to allow anybody to have a decent game. Due to the use of badminton racquets there is less control when hitting the ball. A careful and calculated approach is appropriate when playing the game.</p>
<p>The sport of BadPong is still in its early stages but its creators are hopeful for the sport to catch on in the mainstream public. Creator Alastair McLeod stated recently, "I really hope BadPong will catch on, it is a sickly sick game and I think the public deserves to play a sick and safe game."</p>

<p><br />
belief in Ras Tafari (Haile Selassie) as the Messiah and that Africa (especially Ethiopia) is the promised land</p>
<p>The Rastafarian religion originated in Africa. It is often associated with the poorer black population of Jamaica. It is not just a religion, but a way of life. Rastafarians speak out against; poverty, oppression and inequality.....not just religious ideas but global problems. Rastafarians will use the Bible for guidence.</p>
<p>The prime basic belief of the Rastafarians is that Haile Selassie is the living God for the black race. Selassie, whose previous name was Ras Tafari, was the black Emperor of Ethiopia. Rastafarians say scriptures prophesised him as the one with "the hair of whose head was like wool (the matted hair of I black man), whose feet were like unto burning brass (I black skin)".</p>
<p>Selassie was not a Rastafarian himself. He was a devout Christian. In fact, no one is really sure what he thought of the whole Rastafarian movement. When a group of Rastas went to Ethiopia to honour him, an official of the palace told them to go away! This did not make the Rastas question their belief, it only made it stronger. God is not supposed to know he is God.</p>
<p>When Haile Selassie was reported dead, Rastas would not believe it. They believed that it was a trick of the media to try and bring their faith down. Rastafarians believe that Haile Selassie I has trodded on to the perfect flesh, and sits on the highest point of Mount Zion where He and Empress Menen await the time of judgement.</p>
<p>The Rastafarian name for God is Jah.</p>
<p>The Lion of Judah represents Haile Selassie, the Conqueror. It represents the King of Kings as a lion is the king of all beasts. Selassie wore a Lion of Judah ring that was given to Bob Marley at the time of Selassie's death.</p>
<p>Babylon is the Rastafarian term for the white political power structure that has been holding the black race down for centuries. In the past, Rasta see that blacks were held down physically by the shackles of slavery. In the present, Rasta feel that blacks are still held down through poverty, illiteracy, inequality, and trickery by the white man. The effort of Rasta is to try to remind blacks of their heritage and have them stand up against this Babylon.</p>
<p>Ethiopia, specifically, Africa in general, is considered the Rastas' heaven on earth. There is no afterlife or hell as Christianity believes. Rasta's believe that Jah will send the signal and help the blacks exodus back to Ethiopian, their homeland. Any news from Ethiopia was taken very seriously as a warning to get ready to leave. The belief stems from Marcus Garvey's theme, "Back to Africa". Although Selassie's death came before this was possible, it did succeed in turning blacks desire to look towards Africa as their roots.</p>
<p>One of the more obvious symbols of the Rastafarians are colours. These are red, gold, and green. These colours were taken from the Garvey movement. The colour red stands for the Church Triumphant which is the church of the Rastas. It also symbolises the blood that martyrs have shed in the history of the Rastas. The yellow represents the wealth of the homeland. Green represents the beauty and vegetation of Ethiopia, the promised land. Sometimes black is used to represent the colour of Africans, to whom 98% of the Jamaicans are descended</p>
<p>Ganja, is used for religious purposes for Rastafarians. Its use is written in the Bible in Psalms 104:14, "He causeth the grass for the cattle, and herb for the service of man". The use of this herb is very extensive among the Rastas not only for spiritual purposes as in their Nyabingi celebration, but also for medicinal purposes for colds and such. The following are a few of the many Biblical texts that Rasta embrace as reasons Jah, gave for the use of the herb:</p>
<p><br />
". . . thou shalt eat the herb of the field " (Genesis 3:18)</p>
<p>". . . eat every herb of the land " (Exodus 10:12)</p>
<p><br />
"Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith" (Proverbs 15:17)</p>
<p>The true Rasta eats only I-tal food. This is special food never touches chemicals or is natural and not in cans. This food is cooked, but served in the rawest form possible; without salts, preservatives, or condiments. Rastas are therefore vegetarians. Drinking preferences rest with anything that is herbal, such as tea. Liquor, milk, coffee, and soft drinks are viewed as unnatural. The term I-tal food is rapidly taking hold in the consumer industry in Jamaica.</p>
<p><br />
The dreadlocks on a Rasta's head symbolises the Rastas roots, contrasting the straight, blond look of the white man and establishment. It not only shows their roots, but it is supported in the Bible: Leviticus 21:5, "They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh". The way the hair grows comes to represent the symbol of the Lion of Judah. This has also come to symbolise rebellion of the system and the "proper" way to wear hair.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-04_eb04.html" title="Edit section: Cole Classic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cole Classic</span></h2>
<p>The Cole Classic is one of Australia's leading ocean swims. It was first run on the Australia Day long weekend, January 1983 and attracted 189 entrants, ranging in age from 13 to 60. In 2006 the event attracted over 2,000 swimmers, ranging in age from 12 to 80.</p>
<p>The race was started by Sydney solicitor, Graham Cole. Originally a country boy from Moree in the north west of New South Wales, Cole began the race after feeling that Sydney's most famous beach was sorely neglected. Cole said:</p>
<p><i>"There is no other city in the world which has a surfing beach with the dimensions and assets of Bondi Beach within minutes of its business heart...It annoys and saddens me to see vandalism and graffiti at Bondi...The problem is how to create a social conscience in people, how to make them proud of this natural heritage and how to instill a sense of responsibility towards it."</i></p>
<p>For all the pleasure and good times that Bondi has given to people, Graham Cole simply wanted to give something back. He instigated the Cole Classic so he could share his love of Bondi with others. In establishing the race he wrote:</p>
<p><i>“The event is not a race but a challenge to all persons to stretch themselves in body and mind to swim a reasonable distance through surf. It will I hope, be an incentive to persons to involve themselves in the self discipline required to get fit; to obtain confidence in their ability through swimming, to achieve a pride in having performed something that is, perhaps slightly above average, and finally; to receive (in the form of an appropriately prepared Certificate or medal) some recognition of their accomplishment. “</i></p>
<p>The Cole Classic is an event that supports the community values of Friendship, Support &amp; Encouragement for each other. The Cole Classic is a not for profit Incorporated Association with proceeds raised going to the Manly Life Saving Club.</p>
<p>In February 2005, after twenty two years at Bondi Beach, the Cole Classic moved to Manly and now offers three unique challenges to ocean swimmers:</p>
<p>1km. Nippers &amp; Novices Challenge – an entry level swim for budding ocean swimmers in two categories 9 -12 yrs and for older swimmers taking their first steps into the world of ocean swimming .</p>
<p>2km. Cole Classic Challenge – the traditional course around the buoys, open to all ages from 13 – 75+yrs.</p>
<p>10km. North Head Challenge - a challenge for elite competitors who swim from Manly Cove, through Sydney Heads and then to Manly Beach.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty years the Cole Classic has grown into one of Australia's larges rough water swims. It attracts Olympic and Commonwealth Games Medalists', as well as a large and loyal community based following. Each year it provides the focus and incentive for people to train and attempt to better their time from the previous year.</p>

Imaging extrasolar planets is currently out of reach as shown in the first part, but subtle consequences of their existence can be detected. Bodies orbiting a star, induce wobbling movements on it that when measured, not only betray their existence but also their orbital period, distance to the star and minimum mass.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Measuring wobble Not that this wobble can be seen directly, much less measured by observation through a telescope from Earth, but fortunately there is a trick that comes in handy for the job, the Doppler effect. When a light source - the star in this case - approaches the observer, its emitted light wavelength gets "compressed", meaning colors are shifted towards the blue, while when it recedes, an opposite shift to the red occurs. You can witness this effect with sound waves, for if you stand by a railroad crossing and a train is approaching, you will hear the siren pitch change from high to low when it passes by. The underlying physical phenomena is the same, the sound wavelength shortens (higher pitch) during approach, and lengthens (lower pitch) when receding.</p>
<p>The starlight is split in its different color components with a special instrument called spectroscope. This is something like the prism used in school to decompose sunlight in a rainbow, only it uses a diffraction grating to achieve much better resolution and precision. Within the generated "rainbow", appear narrow dark bands corresponding to atoms and molecules present in the star's atmosphere that absorb certain very precise light wavelengths. This is how we got to know that oxygen, helium, hydrogen, calcium and many other elements are present in celestial bodies like stars and nebulae. By the way, this is the same principle used by Edwin Hubble decades back to detect galactic motions leading to the discovery of universal expansion.</p>
<p>The first team to announce the discovery of an exoplanet was led by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz from the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. The system found by Mayor and Queloz in 1995 does not look much like the Solar System, for it consists of a 60% Jupiter size or larger body orbiting the sunlike star 51 Pegasi at a 5% the Earth - Sun distance, implying a 4.2 day orbital period and a day temperature of about 1000 oC.</p>
<p><br />
To detect and measure the Doppler shift introduced by planetary tugging is tricky, and the spectrographic sensitivity available for Mayor and Queloz was good for a 13 m/s. (29 mph) or higher speed variations. This was enough for 51 Pegasi at 53 m/s. but should barely miss something like Jupiter in the Solar System, for its tugging on the Sun is just 12.5 m/s.</p>
<p>Geoff Macy from San Francisco State University and Paul Butler from the University of California at Berkley for their part, had been working on the same idea with a slightly more sensitive spectrometer on the Lick Observatory telescope since 1987. Their resolution was good for detecting 3 m/s. and up velocity fluctuations, and their observing program covered about 120 sunlike stars. Oddly enough, they did not expect finding planets this way due to the former failure of Canadian astronomers Campbell and Walker to get results in a survey or 21 selected stars.</p>
<p>They assumed much better sensitivity should be required before going for it, and concentrated on improving instrumentation, with the result that the 70 Virgin's planet unknowingly sat on their computer hard disk …. for 10 years. Not out of laziness for sure, to recover the telltale signature of a planet induced wobble, they had to obtain computer access to process enormous amounts of spectral measurements for the 120 surveyed stars.</p>
<p>When they got notice of Mayor and Queloz 13 m/s sensitivity in October 1995, the suddenly realized they could have already exoplanets waiting in their old data and went to work frantically so as to announce results - if they were lucky -in the American Astronomical convention to be held in San Antonio, January 1996. Fingers crossed and holding breath, for Mayor and Queloz had advanced they should announce new discoveries in the same convention and had not disclosed the monitored stars. To be fair, news of the first extrasolar planets, was received with skepticism by some renowned scientists who held suspicions other type of phenomena like periodic variations in the star's atmosphere could be masquerading as planetary perturbations. Eventually matters were settled by overwhelming evidence derived from a plethora of new discoveries, and the confirmation in some fortunate cases with independent clues like minute coincident eclipses.</p>
<p>The exoplanetary zoo</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom derived from the only known planetary system - the Solar System -, supported a certain model for the aggregation and evolution of bodies in the primeval dust and gas solar nebula. Discovery of not one but multiple examples of giant planets orbiting at impossibly close distance to their stars, turned this wisdom on its head, opening new venues for theoretical speculation. Certainly the very method of discovery leads to a selective bias which favors early finding of just this type of system, big planet in close orbit, and only the accumulation of data along the years it takes to determine and characterize smaller and farther ones, has now begun to balance the inventory.</p>
<p>Giant Jupiter size or larger planets orbiting very near, preclude the existence for smaller more Earth like ones beyond, for they could not form in its actual location but farther out, and migrated inward because of friction and tidal energy loses. This should have the effect of tossing away any smaller body in their path. At last, in June 2002 a team led by Stephane Udry form the Geneva Observatory, reported the discovery of a roughly Jupiter size planet orbiting the star Gliesse 777A at about 3.7 A.U. minimum distance (1 Astronomical Unit or A.U. is slightly less than the average Earth - Sun distance, about 150 million km or 93 million miles). The fact it looks stable and there are no other large planets closer in, leaves open the possibility of Earth like planets to be discovered in this promising system. Thus far, discovered planetary systems are quite bizarre, hinting that ours is probably an unlikely outcome, a fact that strongly bears on the abundance of extraterrestrial life.</p>
