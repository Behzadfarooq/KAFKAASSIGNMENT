<p>As the article defines itself at the top, it is "a partial catalog of...recurring segments, running gags, catchphrases, quotes, and other miscellany." I've had a {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">primarysources</a>}} tag at the top for over three weeks now, and a note on the talk page for a few days, and absolutely nothing has been done to improve this article over that period of time. To repeat what I said on the talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article is full of unsourced original research and speculation (everything colbert "seems" to be), and I doubt sources other than the show itself can be found for 90% of what's in the article, and even many of those things would count as excessively in-depth plot summary. It reminds me of the sort of excessive cataloging that occured for <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestar_runner.html" title="Homestar runner">Homestar runner</a> before we banished such research to their own wikis. Now that Stephen Colbert has <a href="http://wikiality.com" class="external text" title="http://wikiality.com" rel="nofollow">wikiality</a>, I think we can transwiki most of this over to there and get all the original research out of wikipedia.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Colbert has become quite the phenomonon in popular culture, Stephen being listed as one of the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Top_100_2e0c.html" title="Time Top 100">most influential people in 2006</a>.

This article serves as a great reference point for anyone know wants to know more about the show, and personally, I can say that have in the past found the article useful when wanting to learn more about Colbert. Please don't be <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="meta:deletionism">deletionist</a>, this article could definitely use a lot of citations, but under <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, television programs can be used as primary sources. The statements about the recurring themes <i>are sourced</i> - the source is the show itself. Generally, Wikipedia doesn't explicitly cite the subject of the article in cases where the subject is also a primary source - it's considered to be implied. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 22:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The claim that you can cite a source to establish recurring themes within the source has been proven false before, as demonstrated by the deletion of the slashdot articles. Your claim that Colbert is more important than those sites, so we should relax our standards, is not true at all either. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Themes_in_Star_Wars_e18d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Themes in Star Wars">Themes in Star Wars</a> was deleted because it was a pile of original research (someone went and documented all the coincidences they saw between the movies), and star wars is more important culturally than colbert and all these others combined. I'm not deletionist, I only believe in deleting articles when they fundamentally fail policy, and this article absolutely does so by being impossible to verify without redoing all the research yourself. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 00:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just wanted to point out that the above user (Cielomobile) had striked out some of my vote. That's pretty cold and I think their vote should be thrown out. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 00:34, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is not a vote, this is a discussion, and people strike out comments once they have been addressed all the time (see RfA discussions). Notice that I did not actually delete part of your comment; I just striked it out (because it was complete rubbish). You are supposed to strike out a comment once you rescind it and then add the new comment (and thus, I am adding in your previous comment, with a strike through it, to note your original resoning, for context). -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 05:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Users may strike out their own comments, but modifying those of another user is generally frowned upon. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 22:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Night Gyr, I'm sure there are a number of websites that document some of the recurring themes (see <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com" class="external text" title="http://www.colbertnation.com" rel="nofollow">colbertnation.com</a>). Furthermore, <b>as described in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, television programs are acceptable as sources.</b> My fingers are getting tired from echoing myself now. Also, you can view all of Colbert's episodes on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml" rel="nofollow">comedycentral.com</a>, so the themes are easily verifiable (and the episodes could be cited, if someone were to put the work in). -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 05:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then cite them.

<ul>
<li>Like I said elsewhere in the article, I don't really have the time at the moment to undertake such a task. Right now, I'm just trying to make sure the article isn't unjustly deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> Stephen Colbert has a multitude of information about him necessary to the internets. Unlike most television celebrities, he is not one-sided. Therefore, multiple facets of him came be expressed through this article. In addition, the sorry display of naysayers in this discussion is sickening. As a roving gang of disaffected morons, the above wish to express the power they don't have by deleting information.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.82.118.77 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.82.118.77.html" title="User talk:71.82.118.77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.82.118.77_3fe2.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.82.118.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Stephen Colbert is a well-known public figure, and his show <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a></i> is watched by millions. That said, I agree that the recurring segments section needs a good overhaul. I agree also that the article should be edited and elements moved to wikiality wiki. There is a need to keep this article but in a heavily modified form. I object to unlisted Tony Fanta's comment about trashing most of Stephen Colbert as this sounds like complete biase against a popular figure. I further suggest that his vote be disregarded for that reason. We must be objective about any decision to remove content.<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerojack_0009.html" title="User:Kerojack">Kerojack, Argenta</a> 22:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've had cleanup and sourcing requests on the article for a while. Nothing has been done for weeks. Even if it was improved, I doubt there'd be enough left for a separate article. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 00:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Complaining about OR in this matter is bogus, the only "research" that really <i>can</i> be done is watching the show (or is there a book or website cataloguing this stuff that I'm not aware of?), the information is useful and fairly important, given that the Report has a disproportionate amount of influence on American mass culture. On top of that, including even the barebones of the information in this article in the main <i>The Colbert Report</i> article would put that article far over the limit, so merging is, I think, out of the question. Furthermore, I suspect that if this AfD were a little better-publicized, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> would apply, though of course that's just a sneaking suspicion rather than a well-reasoned opinion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand the need of Colbert-fanbois trying to sabotage every relevant discussion about the articles that are involved with him or the show. I will not deny that he is a somewhat popular figure, but he is not a phenomenon, his show has been on the air on cable for 1 year, and there is no guarantee that he will be on more than another, possibly likely, but WP is not a crystal ball. I don’t see how he warrents as many articles as he has. Just because a small handful of editors like the show does not mean that there is a place for all these articles. WP will not make any sense in the future if all this fancruft is contained. And I don’t see where a single one of the keep votes should have any weight to them. They just say NPOV things like “He is a phenomenon, we must worship him and add every detail about his show possible.” I don’t like or dislike him, but please, let’s just keep things simple and not spread every reference or so-called facts all over. And why would SNOW apply here? That's just a really blantant comment to make, you just assume if I advertise this AFD (which is not the point, we are discussing, hopefully among editors with concerns over notability rather than if they like something) that everyone would vote keep? A lot of valid votes are made for delete, and that is just fine. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_fanta_fe6f.html" title="User:Tony fanta">Tony fanta</a> 23:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

The Wikiality.com site makes no attempts at keeping the information on the site to any kind of standards. The pages are filled with made up facts, and the owners of the page encourage the editors of the site to make up outragous claims about Colbert on the site. That's the whole concept behind "wikiality" to begin with. While Wikiality.com can be a very entertaining site, it was never intended to be any kind of actual fact-based encyclopedic-style page. It is, point blank, a parody site. These Wikipedia wiki pages do have integrity and are documented as much as possible. This page is the only site on the web with information like this about <i>The Colbert Report</i> that is well-maintained and held to some kind of standards by a community of people with fluent knowlege about the subject (i.e. the fans who watch the show). <a href="../../../n/o/f/User%7ENofactzone_f761.html" title="User:Nofactzone">Nofactzone</a> 17:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>As said above, even if no other place currently exists to hold the information, that's not a reason we need to keep it here. If it's only at its current level because it's written by expert, then it fails the requirement that articles be written by citing sources, rather than experts spouting their opinions. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There are multiple places that the information could be housed - but not in a Wiki format. For example, I could easily put this information on my Stephen Colbert fan site, where according to discussion here it may be a better place for it to be, but I choose not to because I realize the benefits of having multiple editors maintain the information. Instead, I simply link to this page when using information from it. Keeping the information here on Wiki helps it to be monitored and edited more frequently and by more editors, which keeps it more accurate and relevant. Banishing the page to Wikiality.com virtually ensures its demise and its accuracy due to the fact that it will receive many less hits and will not be maintained to the accuracy level that information is maintained here on Wiki. It is hard to cite sources for information such as this television show, since the primary source is the show and since attempts to cite mainstream news articles and blogs as sources tend to be rejected by the administrators. This page gets updated on an almost daily basis due to the fact that relevant information from the show can change the status of different recurring elements so quickly. It's hard to cite sources when the information is so current that there are no sources to cite. It has been mentioned that the show is only one year old. Any books that come out within that short of a time period about virtually any pop culture phenomenon would be geared towards fans anyway, and not have much historical significance (or much documentation), and anything with true historical weight will not appear until long after the show has made its impact.

According to NOR, it's acceptable to use television shows as a primary source, as long as one is only making purely descriptive claims and not including original analysis. The fact that Colbert does a word-of-the-day segment in every episode, for example, is descriptive, and not original analysis. <span style="font-family:monospace">-- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 18:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The page needs a lot of work, and is currently mostly based on primary material (the show itself), but that's not to say that it can't be improved. The show has gotten a ton of press coverage, and I'm pretty certain that some of that coverage has at least mentioned, if not discussed to some extent, the various recurring elements. In particular, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Know_a_District_03b6.html" title="Better Know a District">Better Know a District</a> has been discussed in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-fi-colbert22oct22,0,3608221.story" class="external text" title="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-fi-colbert22oct22,0,3608221.story" rel="nofollow">LA Times</a>, for example, and "the Word" is discussed in most interviews/articles on the show itself and the news coverage regarding Truthiness and Wikialty. There's plenty of room for improvement with appropriately sourced, verifiable, and non-OR content. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">Schi</a> 18:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Better Know a District has its own article? Wow, that's news to me. But nevertheless, respectfully, I think you're oversimplifying a bit, Night. There's a lot of original analysis and speculation in that article which needs to be dealt with, but the lists of recurring segments and characters are fair. Lists of minor characters are explictly permitted by our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">deletion policy on minor characters</a>. Recurring segements, on the other hand, can form the basic anatomy of a variety/comedy show like Colbert's, particularly when these segments are specifically denoted by onscreen titles. This is still far less detail than having an article for every episode, which has been upheld in the case of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">Category:Simpsons_episodes</a>, or List of vehicles in The Simpsons, which survived three nominations for deletion, or the individual articles on every recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live (see list <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurring_Saturday_Night_Live_characters_and_sketches_3845.html" title="Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches">here</a>). As for the examples you list above, lists of Slashdot jokes and the like are inherently different, because we allow using TV shows as a primary source but not forums and social networking websites. "Themes in Star Wars" probably should have been rebuilt from the ground up rather than entirely nuked -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/Themes_in_Blade_Runner_8147.html" title="Themes in Blade Runner">Themes in Blade Runner</a> is decently referenced, and quite a good read. Again, I suggest renaming this or possibly splitting into multiple articles in order to tighten the focus and avoid attracting cruft. <span style="font-family:monospace">-- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 20:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Precedence I have seen, such as articles related to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, is that information taken from simply watching the show is acceptable, while information from behind the scenes and out-of-universe must be sourced. The article is not analysis and speculation as claimed by the user who wishes to delete the page, but a recording of notable recurring elements, nothing more. What work could be done is specification, possibly in terms of instances a subject is mentioned, to be deemed a recurring element. Also, just because no one has attempted to improve it does not mean no one will. In the vein of Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, you cannot predict that no one will make an effort and nominate it based on that prediction. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 23:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's ridiculous, Night. If we used that logic, all lists that involved any amount of thinking to create would be deleted.

<li>No, there is a difference between original research and thinking. If you're implying that we're just supposed to copy other sources, you are mistaken (that would border on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>). A number of lists involve more than just looking at secondary sources, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_calypso-like_genres.html" title="List of calypso-like genres">List_of_calypso-like_genres</a>, the creation of which without a doubt involved some level of thought.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but trim down to the more noteworthy elements. The article is verifiable (by watching the show). I agreee that it pushes the boundaries of NOR, but the nature of all these articles, once they get past a very basic summation of the television show (or other media), fall into that category. A list of characters, if there is no other references than the show, could be construed as OR.

There's my bio and there's my character's bio, and then there's my character's history, which is slightly different than my character's bio."
