<li><b>Keep</b>, and keep up the good work Quadell! I can see how, with the original title, it may have seemed appropriate for VfD, however. The factual accuracy tag... well I see what you mean listing the EU under an article titled "countries", but it's interesting to include for comparisons, and changing the title would make it a lil long winded.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Does the UN have certain benchmarks for population numbers? Otherwise, sorting country populations in ranges like "Over 500 M" and "50M to 500M" is very arbritrary to say the least.

<li>Let me get this straight - you're voting to delete the article because grouping countries by size is "arbitrary"? That's a rather odd outlook. By the way, a put the articles in three groups, because if they were all in one group with a standard scale along the bottom, most bars would be so small that they would be nearly invisible. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_sleuthing_a075.html" title="Wikipedia:Image sleuthing">sleuth</a>)</sup> 23:26, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. You should be creating charts that are of equal interval sizes, say every hundred million or every five hundred million. Right now, the presentation is skewed, b/c it's set at an arbritrary scale that you decided was convenient. One grouping contains samples with pops less than 50 M, and another contains a much larger interval, between 50-500 M. It just doesn't make sense. I recommend that or creating charts for each continent.</dd>

<li>If you can think of a way the data can be better presented, you're welcome to make your own charts. That's the beauty of Wikipedia. I think if you tried it yourself, though, instead of just criticizing the efforts of others, you'd find that separating them into sections with equal numbers of countries would leave many countries with bars so small as to be uninformative.
