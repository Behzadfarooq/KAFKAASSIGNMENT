<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b> Racial slurs may constitute encyclopedic topics; however, because of their sensitivity, they must be extensively referenced by verifiable sources before they can be included in the encyclopedia. There is a consensus here that this article does not meet that requirement. I will not merge and redirect to "list of ethnic slurs," but I will be happy to help any interested editor do so, if he or she comes forward with adequate reliable sourcing. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article is most appropriate for Wikipedia as it is serving the important purpose of providing information on a racial slur, which is gaining prominence. The article is far from being a dictionary definition. The editor goes on to criticize the English of the author. The article was written in simple English in line with Wikipedia policy.

<li><font color="#000000"><b>Delete</b>. Number of problems - (a) no evidence that the term is in actual common use. For example, the url refers to just another racist comment. The emphasis of all the articles is not on the term <i>in particular</i>, but on the discrimination towards mainland chinese <i>in general</i>. Hence, it is far more appropiate to have an article discussing say, Taiwanese-Mainline antipathy, with this as a possible redirect, than focus on a single obscure term which has no verifiable origin and so on. (b) If the term is to be noted at all, it belongs in List of Ethnic Slurs. It doesn't deserve an article of its own, because it's just a dictionary def. (c) Assume good faith. List of Ethnic Slurs has a detailed verifiability criteria that needs to be satisfied, to stop people from putting in any old phrase. Further, do not use the vandal template in the middle of an article! It's meant to be used for userpages. (d) The article in question does have a POV problem. As an encyclopedia, we should be stating matters of fact. We should not be imploring our readers to be nice to each other and not be racists. Wikipedia is not a self-help guide.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 13:03, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000"><b>Comment</b>. (A) Common use of the item is evidenced by authoritative newspaper reports and they do indicate that the term is being used openly in public. Common use of the term is evident. The term being discussed in the legislative assembly (equivalent to the US Congress) is more than sufficient evidence that term is gaining prominence and continued use of the term is expected, otherwise it would be treated as an isolated case. The article focus finely on the term itself and explanations related to the term only. There is no emphasis on racial discrimination. Origin of the term is not important considering that the purpose of this article is solely to provide encyclopedic information on a racist term. (B) The list of ethnic slurs is a list and not intended for extensive information. If all articles of this length were "listed", then the list would be too lengthy to serve any useful purpose, especially as an online encyclopedia. It is hard to see how a detailed article such as this can be considered as a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolie.html" title="Coolie">Coolie</a> and the "N" word all have articles of their own so why would this term not deserve a page of its own? (C) Verifiability has been satisfied as stated above. Sorry about the vandal template. (D) Something that has happened in public and reported in newspapers is a "fact". There is no intention is not to guide anyone on anything. The sole intention is merely to provide encyclopedic information on a racial slur. --Chungkwok 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000000"><b>Nominator Comment.</b> Verifiability has hardly been met in reference to the article. The sources mentioned in the article do nothing more than use the phrase "Chinese pig" in terms of the differences between Taiwan and mainland China. If you are trying to provide a definition for Chinese pig, then you are doing nothing more than providing a dictionary definition, which is unacceptable for Wikipedia. The articles asserts no importance or notability for this phrase. The one isolated incident of the Canadian teacher is not notable enough to support the need for the Chinese pig article. The article itself is strongly POV, and it does nothing but use an ethnic slur to further the differences between Taiwanese and Chinese people. I am not even sure if this article qualifies to be merged with the lackluster <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">list of ethnic slurs</a>. The first sentence of the article even humorously states "Chinese pig is an racially offensive term," yet one of the sources even mentions how the term Chinese pig denotes social and not racial discrimination. And, if the difference is of nationalities, then it certainly is not dealing with racism. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolie.html" title="Coolie">Coolie</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> are amongst the most widespread derogatory terms in existance. Their articles can expand a lot further than a mere dictionary definition, to which Chinese pig cannot. —<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotorious4life_30dc.html" title="User:Notorious4life"><font color="#19 19 70"><i><b>№tǒŖïøŭş</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotorious4life_3a21.html" title="User talk:Notorious4life"><font color="#80 00 80"><i><b>4lĭfė</b></i></font></a> <font color="A5 2A 2A"><big><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Notorious4life_400a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Notorious4life">♫</a></big><font color="00 64 00"><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">♪</a></font></font></font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000000"><b>Strong Keep.</b> What is important is whether the term "Chinese Pig" exists, has been actually used as a racist term in daily life, has racial slur significance and can be substantiated or verified. All these requirements have been met. Evidence of public usage of the racist term alone is sufficient to qualify it as a racial slur. The existence of the term has been demonstrated and verified by credible newspapers reports of an incident involving two unrelated individuals of different races exchanging racial slurs in public. Public transport can be taken as a miniature of society culture and usage of racial slurs on public transport indicates common usage. Use of the term in public by ordinary folks has been established. The victim was upset at the use of term to demean him racially. If a white person calling a Chinese person a "Chinese pig" is not racially injurious or discriminatory, then what is it? The Taiwan link shows that the term is also used there. Justification for inclusion of a racial slur in Wikipedia is not by the number of times the term has been used or its rank in popularity. It is not necessary to demonstrate the number of times it has been used or how common the term is. The term when used by Chinese to Chinese is ethnic or social discrimination because of the many different ethnicities among Chinese. A foreigner to Chinese is racial discrimination which is the case here. The core of the matter is whether the term exists and whether it can be verified. How can we say that the article cannot be expanded like the one for Coolie? Are we going to eliminate everyone using the term hereafter so that the term will never be used again? The arguments supporting deletion seen so far are weak and unreasonable. A black person being called a Nigger could go to Wikipedia to locate detailed information about the term and a Chinese person being called a “Chinese Pig” could do the same. Why should there be a difference? I strongly recommend keeping this article.--Dragon Descendant 03:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</font>

<p><font color="#000000">In the absence of valid arguments, I suppose I would have to assume that and the reasons behind all these objections could lie in the embarrassment of having an article about this derogatory term in Wikipedia and the worry of the undesirable effects of mentioning the term.

<p><font color="#000000">I suppose I would have address the concern of these individuals who might be uncomforatable with the derogatory term.

I have to state the term is not being broadcasted to people on national TV new s or carried in newspapers or any other mass media.
