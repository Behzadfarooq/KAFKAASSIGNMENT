<li><b>Delete</b> the very concept implies original research and it is made express on reading it. I believe there may be a similar Aus/Can page somewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'll just quote from the first nomination: "This is interesting, useful, quite well-written, and <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>. JRM · Talk 00:36, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC)". That's over a year ago and it hasn't gotten any less original. There is some stuff that can be salvaged from the article and incorporated into other articles, but that does not mean this article shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:57, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To "salvage" parts of it, don't we have to keep a record of who contributed which bits to abide by the GFDL? It's much easier to do this if the article is moved rather than deleted. I'd be happy to give it a temporary home in my user space while we figure out what can be salvaged. -- <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenue_4731.html" title="User:Avenue">Avenue</a> 15:14, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By "salvage" I mean extracting whatever sourceable and relevant facts are in there (which are <i>not</i> all that many) and add them to whatever article is most appropriate for them. That doesn't mean the wording has to be preserved. If it did, this would be a more general problem, since we can't really maintain articles that should be deleted because someone copied a sentence from it to put in another article. In short, I propose that we salvage facts (such as there are), not the words. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep/split/move</b> - as per Avenue. This isn't entirely original research, it's a more than occasional subject of news articles in NZ. The fact that new Zealand is more frequently compared with Canada that with Australia in itself says something about the strength of the similarities - I doubt it would lead to a rah of other "comparison" articles. The fact that it has been here over a year with remarkably few of these other articles appearing is also indicative of this. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's been a whole year since the last nomination to improve the article. Not much seems to be happening. If it's so easy to remove all the original research, stick in references, and obtain a respectable article, why hasn't it been done?</li>
<li>"If this article is deleted so should X, Y and Z be" has never been a valid argument for preserving an article (or for deleting one, for that matter). It's rather more instructive to see why the articles you mention are not in danger of deletion while this one is. The issue is not that we can't have articles which compare things-of course we can. We just have to report on comparisons <i>as made by others</i>, with proper references. "Similarities between Canada and New Zealand" is way too general a topic, and the original research runs rampant. Comparisons between politics, health care systems and economies of countries that can be meaningfully compared are much more concrete topics, and if you'll care to look, the articles you mention are much better referenced. "Similarities between X and Y" is a non-topic. If there were lots of scholarly works specifically comparing George W. Bush and Tony Blair, then that would make it a valid topic, and we could have a "George W. Bush and Tony Blair compared" article. But it's not very likely that there are credible sources doing that, and that's why it's not an article. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
