<p><b>Delete</b> - actors play dozens or hundreds of parts in the course of a career. There is nothing so significant about playing Elvis Presley that warrants an article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_actors_who_played_President_of_the_United_States_8656.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of actors who played President of the United States">List of actors who played President of the United States</a>, this has nothing to do with importance of the role within listed actors' careers. Like the U.S. President, Elvis is a cultural icon and it is notable which actors have seriously portrayed him in notable films and television series. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 07:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>See, this is <i>exactly</i> why the rationale given for keeping the POTUS article is bogus. There is nothing culturally significant about playing either Elvis or a president. People advocating to keep the POTUS article did so on the basis of the POTUS being such a special case. Now here's another such article and the arguments about <i>this</i> being a special case start up. If every case is a special case, then there doesn't appear to be anything all that special about any of them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 11:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Two</i> cases in which a rationale <i>may</i> apply does <i>not</i> make "every case a special case". As I've said before, I believe in judging each case on its merits, and accepting the consensus of the community. I do not see one or two AFD keeps as setting a precedent, or violating policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 13:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>All well and good to say, except that you cited the POTUS article being kept in your opinion to keep this article. You know as well as I do that people look to similar closed AFDs in evaluating new ones, and should another of these lists come up for deletion then just as sure as God made little green apples this AFD will be pointed to just like you pointed to the POTUS one. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fair point, I was actually citing the POTUS example because I believe that your deletion rationale there was equally as questionable - that playing the President is not an important acting role out of many - not because it was kept. As you've correctly pointed out though, it looks like I'm citing a precedent and saying it's not a precedent! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 21:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Which points out yet another problem with these sorts of lists being kept under the premise of "the person being played is a cultural icon" or "the person is a special case." It requires editors to make POV judgments as to what historical characters are "icon" or "special" enough to warrant articles. There can be no objective definition of what historical personages have achieved that status so looking to such alleged status is problematic to say the least.</li>
<li>Nor, I have to say again, does keeping the article under the theory that people will use it as a research tool on how actors approach the role make any sense. These lists tell us nothing about how actors approach the role, only that they did. The same argument could be made for any role or character type and unless we want bloated lists of every actor who ever played a cop or a bank teller the argument should be put down as well. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>OK, but Wikipedia pretty much requires editors to make POV judgements on "cultural icons" and "specialness" every single day, especially on AfD, due to a little thing called "notability". Once again, you're conflating something notable with non-notable slippery slope portents like "unless we want lists of every actor who ever played a cop or a bank teller" - I would agree that such lists should probably be deleted (including last week's Nazi one): anyone, actors or otherwise can play many such roles - so I definitely see your point, but I don't agree that it applies in a small number of cases. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that in my opinion this probably passes the relevant section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics", since the list's entries are directly associated with a specific topic (Elvis). As an example of how this could be useful, consider if someone is researching or writing about Elvis and wants to look at how various people have portrayed him. The first obvious course is to find a list of either movies and shows that have included Elvis as a character or to find a list of actors who have portrayed Elvis. Both lists would produce the same general list of entries for further study.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, all that being said, I am concerned that the list appears to be original research as it is relying on an original collection of inclusion criteria not apparently found in previously published sources. So I'd only be willing to keep or merge the list if the consensus is that this list isn't a form of original research. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
