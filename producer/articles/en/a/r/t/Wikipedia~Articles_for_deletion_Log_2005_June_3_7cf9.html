<li><b>Delete</b> As far as I know (and I've been playing KOTRII alot lately), there is no actual information on Kae. She's mentioned as one of the Jedi Masters that taught Revan and thats one of the few times she's mentioned in the game. Its believed that Kae is Krea/Darth Traya, but I'm not sure.--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 10:22, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> - This is far too speculative, and cites no sources. None of this is backed up by the game, and can at best be considered only a weak implication.</p>
<p><b>Comment Again</b> You loser, just get a life. Stop critisizing other people when you don't even know if it is false misinformation. This site would be better without people like you, <i>Kross</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>I have common sense</b> - Hey, Kross, just to tell you, I agree with you fully. Well, almost fully. You have made a good point about how newbies should not write fake stuff and put it up. Well, this is actually quite a good article, and if you cant even use you brain for once, it is backed up by the book: 'A guide to Kotor', which is both approved of and congratulated by Lucas Arts as a 'G-Canon'. Anyway, don't call this newbie stuff, the expanded universe is newbie, that load of absolute crap and garbage, so go insult yorself and stop being a low life.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Interesting. The KotOR II strategy guide says little to nothing about Kae's background - which includes lack of information on her supposed stay on Coruscant, as well as her alleged trip to Yavin 4. And, although I do not own the original KotOR strategy guide, I highly doubt it reveals information on a character that wouldn't even make an appearance until the next year. Oh, and a guide to a Star Wars videogame being G-Canon? Maybe that's a typo, because G-Canon refers to the movies, their scripts, the novelizations of the movies, and the radio plays based on the movies. Not videogame guides. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 04:28, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:My problem with <b>Userfy</b>ing them is that then they end up in the widely ignored userspace. There is enough work here that it needs to be someplace where people can stumble upon them and work at cleaning them up (which is what I did). We need the strength in numbers, because it's hard work. It would take me a long time (if ever) if they were just in my user space (or anyone elses).

<li>As I stated below on a similar comment, this makes little sense to me because (a) Charles Matthews is not contributing the foundation articles and (b) this is a general bibliography on the topic which makes no particular connection with any of the articles. I'm asking about the sources that User:Wlad k or IP number 200.46.X.Y or whatever he chooses to call himself is using. By this logic, I could write anything at all in these articles, and because Charles Matthews has a bibliography in his userspace, it would be considered sourced information. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 02:00, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Userfy</b>. You should take these to a user subpage as a workspace for cleanup. Because these are so difficult to read, they're too raw to be articles. Otherwise, I think you'll spend all your time fighting off VfDs. Userfying them will let you develop them, and post them back as new articles when they've had a basic cleanup. That doesn't mean you have to wait until they're fully done, but they should at least be a short overview of a topic. You could then post the remaining raw data onto the article's talk page to allow for collaboration without exposing the severely broken english in main article pages. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 03:59, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>Could I ask for clarification&#160;? As a realtively new user, is it <b>policy</b> that articles which do not meet certain qquality standards, but on which work is being done, be deleted completely until they reach such standards, rather than marking them with requests for assistance, and allowing organic development of the entries&#160;? --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:05, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precedent says <b>no</b> that isn't a policy. Wikipedia is a work in progress and thus contains thousands of articles of a visibly sub-par nature. However as Wikipedia slowly matures, and its editor base changes, the average amount of patience that the user base has with such articles has diminished. "Modify in user-space" is becoming a more common and acceptable suggestion" but I think everyone continues to agree that we don't won't to lose material. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:41, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, clean up</b> of course. Anything that is not worth keeping in its cleaned-up state is naturally subject to being deleted. I can't understand why people say 'delete' before those who would be interested in cleaning up, rationalising and editing the material have their change. By the way, the author is a prolific contributor, with a track record of digging up much useful research from contemporary sources. <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Japan_%28additional_economic_and_financial_data%29_03e2.html" title="Empire of Japan (additional economic and financial data)">Empire of Japan (additional economic and financial data)</a> has already been substantially cleaned up.

<li><b>Delete or Userfy</b> unless more information about the source of this information can be obtained. I have two general problems with these articles. One is that much of the material is so garbled, I don't see how it can be reliably cleaned up. Sure, you can take some wild guesses at what the editor meant, but basically the original has been run through a distortion filter. How can this information be dependable? The second concerns the original sources. Especially in a case such as this, the source should be cited for verifiability. Somehow "This is what I think someone who doesn't speak English was trying to relate from uncited sources that cannot be checked" does not seem to be a dependable standard. For example:</li>

<li>I don't quite understand this comment, because Charles Matthews is not the person submitting the garbled articles. This is a general all-purpose bibliography on Imperial Japan. It does not tell us where the contributor's many specific facts and figures came from. I think making something verifiable and identifying the source of data requires a bit more precision than a general purpose bibliography in userspace that is not specifically connected to any of the articles. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 01:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Userfy / Move to temporary space</b> I have worked on a few of these articles and have two strong concerns.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>With the original text in Japanese and the contributor being a spanish speaker we are looking at three translation steps here: Japanese → Spanish → broken English → English. When working on the broken English I've been worried that I have been at risk of changing the original information. Quite honestly, I concluded that the integrity of the information was getting compromised as a result of the multiple translation steps.</li>
<li>The contributor is highly prolific. A look at <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_Imperial_Japan_4045.html" title="User:Charles Matthews/Imperial Japan">User:Charles_Matthews/Imperial_Japan</a> reveals several dozen articles and content seems to be added daily. The sheer volume of fixing them combined with the risks of information loss/distortion suggest that the issue of problematic articles from this source will persist and likely grow unless the Wikipedia community comes up with a way to actively manage it. I don't think we should delete this information, but we should quarantine it for further work. If we do nothing, I fear we'll be back here in a month having the same conversation but with an even longer list of articles. Even worse, I fear we'll end up with a bunch of articles that have been cleaned up from broken English but are full of inaccuracies because none of the translation can be confirmed.</li>

<li>I should be able to attend to some cleansing as I continue working through Russo-Japanese War related artys, whereon, I have no less than eight references spanning six decades, about half of which treat some of these topics (Based on a quick peek at the Vfd nominees). I'm not sure why some Artys seem imcomprehensible -- apparently those voters lack contextual knowledge, and should perhaps exercise more discretion. Several of the articles are especially bad in that they are period focused (circa WW-II ands aftermath) without refering to prior or subsequent (to current days) history, but that merely confirms their status as a stub needing expansion.</li>
<li>Timeframe of five days might be suitable to a student's life, assuming one was prone to ignore classwork and Wiki full time, which I hope seldom happens. So expecting such <b>ultra-rapid</b> clean up by contributors that are also provinding family members would pretty much kill off a lot of slow developing wiki-improvements, as we do have lives outside Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Spelling Mistakes was mentioned above, to which I need to add two comments. 1) <i>Correct Spelling</i> is an abstract ideal. Language drift has altered <i>correct</i> usages a lot in my 50 years, and so too have meanings changed. Take the term <i><b>Wicked</b></i>, use of a phrase like "She's Wicked" refered more to 'being bad, only worse and evil to boot' than today's usage (not to mention the uses of the word <i>Bad</i> these days). One problem with my work on the Russo-Japanese war, is that there are five different languages involved: Russian, Chinese, Brittish, Japanese, and American. Then again, one author noted that there were no less than eight different <i>English</i> renderings of a single Russian Admirals name; bad spellings (and typos) in sum, will be corrected. Ususally inside 45 minutes if MY Experience is a reliable measure! <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 00:43, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Usage is extremely rare and limited to a couple of texts. In this way any theorem may be called "conjecture". Indeed, there ase some theorems that for a long time knwn as conjectures, and usage of such kind of redirect would be justifiable. This is most clearly not the case. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:52, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As it now stands, this article is a tiny stub not about Tourism in Italy, but about Italy; and historically, the article has been a magnet for link spam. There is nothing in this that, if it has any value at all, doesn't belong under <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. An article about Tourism in Italy would presumably be about the encouragement of tourism, tourism incentives, the tourism business, revenues from tourism, the breakdown of what kind of tourists they get, etc. Nobody is writing this — I'm not about to — and if someone does, at least until it gets substantial, it can be put as a section under Italy. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 01:36, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have indeed heard of Rome (on which my own website runs to 600 pages), Venice, etc. All of these places have their own articles. "Tourism in Italy" suggests, not to belabor the point, that the article is about <i>tourism</i>, in Italy. Which this article, currently, is not. I&#160;agree with Gracefool that it could easily become a long article: but with not one shred of the stuff currently in it. (Hint: you want an article about tourism in Italy, write it yourself! The hotel industry, the economic impact of tourism, the foreign currency brought into the country, the training of hotelkeepers and restaurateurs, the value of tourism for the country's image, the government institutes that train tourism workers, endless etc.'s, absolutely: no shortage of material. Have at it!) But vague comments about Florence, and link spam to whatever website owner (out of many thousands out there) happens to add here, and hyperbole about how beautiful Italy is and how much stuff it's got (couldn't agree more), doesn't make an article.... <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 02:15, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Good Stub start for what can be a whole series of interesting Artys. Could act as a magnet for tentative editors as people planning a trip stumble across and add to it. Suggest the flaming sarcasims above be avoided in future discussions. An article on tourism will definitely have a whole different format and set of acceptable editorial practices than a factual article on Italy. The later would certainly be dotted with GDP, Resources, Population, and other statistical compilations, whereas the tourism article would focus pretty much on fun stuff. If someone is severely insulted by it's short nature, I daresay a visit to the local library will turn up several references that can lead to expansion.

<li>wrt this (opening) comment: "An article about Tourism in Italy would presumably be about the encouragement of tourism, tourism incentives, the tourism business, revenues from tourism, the breakdown of what kind of tourists they get, etc.", This article should perhaps be renamed <b>Tourism In Italy (Guide)</b> as I interpret the authors intent, with the drier factual matters allocated to a heading in the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> article. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fabartus</a> 01:17, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Magazine by a major UK publisher, audited circulation more than 24,000 (ABC, Jul-Dec 2004) one year after its introduction. That's good circulation in the UK market for a specialist niche magazine.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think you'll find that this is incorrect.

<li>Policy is here: <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> -- vanity articles are supposed to go through the VfD process.

It failed with only 44% support while 80% was needed to pass.

<li>There's no rule that says you have to explain your votes -- but maybe there should be. Even though we call our opinions "votes", we're not counting heads here.

<p>All these bullshit metal "genres" have to go. While metal bands frequently employ lyrics derived or inspired by Tolkien's literature, this is not enough to warrant the declaration of a new genre. The only band that has a consistent Tolkien theme is Summoning, and even so, their music is not identified as "Tolkien metal" by them or their fans. What this page lacks in information it more than compensates for in inaccuracies. The only ostensible connection between Isengard and "Tolkien metal" is the band's name; Isengard is a folk metal side project of Darkthrone's Fenriz. <a href="../../../o/n/w/User%7EOnwardToGolgotha_3242.html" title="User:OnwardToGolgotha">OnwardToGolgotha</a> 05:58, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, it's just that, as the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Guide to Votes for deletion</a> explains: "There are thus just two basic votes: <b>Keep</b>, indicating that you wish the article and its edit history to be kept; <b>Delete</b>, indicating that you wish the article and its edit history to be deleted. All other votes are simply shorthands for one of those two actions". ""<b>Redirect</b> to Example" is a shorthand for "<b>Keep</b> and change into a redirect article pointing to Example"." Admins generally count redirect votes as keeps, despite the firther explanation: "A voter who votes "Redirect" usually does so in the belief that whilst the article's content is discardable, a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirect</a> should exist to redirect readers who use that article title to a more complete, more general, or simply pre-existing article." Personally, I take that to be much more on the "delete" side of things, but I'm in a minority I think. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 20:55, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would <i>hope</i>—in a perhaps somewhat forlorn and futile manner—that any closing sysop would have the sense to read the <i>redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithril.html" title="Mithril">mithril</a></i> votes as <i>delete and create redirect</i> (another permissible vote), rather than keep. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TenOfAllTrades_2268.html" title="Special:Contributions/TenOfAllTrades">contrib</a>)</small> 21:29, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>For the benefit of the sysop, that's essentially what my redirect vote meant... although, frankly, I'm not sure it much matters whether the history is kept or discarded, if the term is a redirect. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 18:44, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm admittedly a bit of a webcomics geek, and encountered Zig Zag in webcomics form about four years ago, so the character is familiar to me, so that does make me biased. (Of my 21 daily comics bookmarks, however, only three could be considered 'furry': Sabrina Online, Ozy &amp; Millie (which I don't tend to count, personally) and The Class Menagerie.) However, Sabrina Online has a significant readership for a webcomic (or so it's link page suggests), as does the associated <a href="http://www.zzstudios.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.zzstudios.com/" rel="nofollow">ZZ Studios</a> fan fiction which features her as a main character, surprisingly enough (for fan fiction, anyway; 344 registered users in the discussion room). There's also fan-made radio play as well, apparently. (Weird-ish, that...) On the other side, "Max <i>Blackrabbit</i>" gets 553 Google hits. (I suspect many of the others in the 13,500 quoted above have sentences like 'A dwarf <i>rabbit</i> can be <i>black</i>, brown, white or gray, and grow to a <i>max</i> of six inches long.' or the like.) Still, I'd say more notable than a random Pokemon. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_McDuff_7576.html" title="User:William McDuff">William McDuff</a> 15:50, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Proposed city" it says. Proposed, yes, but as an artist's project rather than as a real place that will exist. The website pointed to (several times) in the external links talks of an already extant city linked to nearby similarly created villages.

My vote is conditional on this statement by the unsigned user being true and on the theory section being cleaned up. The amateur graphics don't help.

<p>I am highly sceptical of this entry. The author has no other edits, and his only comments on the Talk page are highly defensive. Also, the grammar, capitalisation, and punctuation throughout the article are substandard; at the very least, it has to be copyread and wikified. In addition, he has left the bottom two sections blank for the last three months. It seems to be promotional, and I only find 28 Google hits for it (not enough to substantiate it being "regularly the subject of academic papers on art history and the history of design"). Also, the entire entry has been plagiarised from the About.com topic about this artists' collective. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.158.31.195.html" title="User:216.158.31.195">216.158.31.195</a> 16:41, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article doesn't appear to have satisfied any of the criteria for deletion under the deletion policy guidlines. it does not infringe any copyright, contains no useless directs or schemes gone awry and is not a source text nor dictionary definition. Perhaps you could consider it a vanity page - but if that were the case surely the author would have mentioned himself. (yes you've guessed - I was the original author, and I gain no benefit at all from the page). clearly the page has caused some concern and it is right to flag it up for consideration. in its defence I would like to say that it doesn't misrepresent anybody nor conflict with anybody elses interest. perhaps it deserves to be considered for cleanup or articles needing attention. But to delete it on the basis of its popularity or the number of hits it has had / google search results would surely endanger every page in wikipedia that wasn't of mainstream interest. A point of information for those not familiar with them, the Booker Prize is the most prestigious british literary prize, and the Turner Prize is the most prestigious british art award, i mention this because it might reflect on wether the subject of the page is 'notable' - I have remedied the lack of name or reference to the turner prize nominee.</p>

<p>I appreciate and share your concern that this page and your doubts about it are judged fairly and by as many people as possible user 216.158.31.195. why then did you delete the link (without explanation) from the red herring disambiguation page? Surely that is not very good form, it almost seems that you have decided that your decision is final. Or would you prefer that others dont stumble across this voting page who might have an interest in Red Herring but only those from the VFD page.</p>

To give a different example, a number of people were featured in the documentary film <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116481/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116481/" rel="nofollow">Hands on a Hard Body</a></i>, who would not be notable except for their appearance in the film. In such a case I can see having an article about the film that mentions them, but not separate articles for each person, because their notability is restricted to appearance in that film and can be adequately addressed in that context. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 19:17, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apologies to Tabor here; I inadvertently did a mouse drag and inserted a comment by me into his edit (sounds weird, but it's true) I said: "There really is little point listing this kind of school for deletion when perfectly normal junior schools are routinely saved without the benefit of print, silver or technicolor." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:32, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There isn't really a good answer to your question; there's a lot of controversy over whether individual high schools are notable enough to get articles independently.

<li>Clearly the nominator here failed to do minimal research. This is not the way to perform cleanup or RC. The fact that since April 22nd some seventy school articles have been listed for deletion and their discussions all closed without deletion, and a further twenty deletion listings that have not yet been closed also seem to be headed for a non-delete result, also suggests to me that those nominating those ninety schools for deletion in the space of six weeks are failing to do proper research, failing to consider alternatives before going to VfD, and failing to judge the mood of Wikipedia on the matter of schools. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:18, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b>. I echo your sentiments. If the site and article can be validated as to their claims, it'd be an interesting article to see develop. But... since the early '80s?

<li><b>What the...?</b> Here's a sample: "Another point is that Brown had not yet remote viewed the reptilians in his first book, but released data from his remote viewing sessions about Adam and Eve that showed that there was a subspace interference affecting both of them. His second book suggests that the reptilians could be the source of that interference; this would corroborate that same teaching in Genesis."

<li><b>Comment</b>. Uh, I'm not really sure what to say about this. Obviously, this stuff is dripping with POV. Yes, it could be cleaned up, condensed and NPOVed, and merged with something else, but I think the important issue here is whether the topic itself really is at all notable? Are connections between the alleged results of remote viewing and religious scripture important enough to even warrant a short sentence or two in <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a> or some other suitable article, if even that? I mean, yeah, I'm a skeptic, no question, but that's kind of beside the point here; I absolutely approve of having articles for remote viewing and other similar things. But is this particular subset of remote viewing really notable or significant? I'm not familiar enough with the subject to tell. I'd appreciate it if someone who's better informed here could put this in perspective... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:03, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Appears to be an essay written in loving tribute to <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham United F.C.</a>, rather than a proper encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><i>tregoweth</i></a> 20:51, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Response; it is a fact that the club is known as The Academy of Football, and the players and appearances for England are a matter of public fact as well. Wikipedia would be lacking in its description of West Ham United if it did not refer to this. <b>Nevertheless the "essay style" and the "loving tribute" comments have been considered and the two final paragraphs have been removed.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> and <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham United F.C.</a>. If it's just a nickname for West Ham United, then there's absolutely no reason this should ever be anything more than a redirect. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 05:03, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I say all it needs is a severe <b>rewrite</b> for NPOV and style. The "Academy" is not just a nickname for the club, but a concept in itself. The article already contains enough factual information of interest to keep it separate from the West Ham article, but does need quite a bit of work. I'm willing to do it. Also, I think the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham United F.C.</a> article is too big to put something of this size in it. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintie_cad1.html" title="User:Mintie">Mintie</a> 00:08, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC) (resigned) <i>(see below)</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Questions</b>: What other "The Academy of Football" is there? How many other clubs are known as "The Academy of Football"? Why can't the success of former players from this club be mentioned in the West Ham article? (I see some of that's been done already.) I still think a merge is in order, but will defer to the fans. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 00:39, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC</li>

<p>The subject doesn't look encyclopedic. Nothing links here except one paragraph on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandate_of_Heaven_06c9.html" title="Mandate of Heaven">Mandate of Heaven</a> that's highly similar; I suspect someone is wikifying on impulse a book they just read from the library or something.

<li>I agree the book is real; but is it encyclopedic? Other than the fact that it has photos by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Cartier-Bresson_d293.html" title="Henri Cartier-Bresson">Cartier-Bresson</a>, I'm not aware of anything especially interesting about it. Is Wikipedia supposed to have an entry for every work of nonfiction ever published? (<b>If</b> the book has an interesting history, or is the vehicle for an interesting theory about the Chinese civil war, or something like that, then I agree <b>Move</b>. But I don't see any evidence of that.) --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 00:30, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My notability threshold for books or other scholarly works (especially on a serious subject like Chinese history) is a lot lower than it is for, say, websites; I take a "notable until proven not notable" view of stuff like this. That the book was published by a non-vanity press is good enough for me. In addition, this article existed for <i>eight minutes</i> before you nominated it. I'm a stickler for bad stub articles and even I think that's a little premature. Give it a chance to grow. If the book is truly notable and interesting, someone will add more. If not, it'll stagnate and maybe get deleted later. (Of course, if some expert in the field pops in here and says, "This is just a generic unimportant book," I'll change my tune.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 02:08, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Further all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small 'garage' companies are not likely to be acceptable." I don't think this is a 'garage' company but as a privately held Singapore-based company verifiability is on the low side. A more significant company, Eu Yan Sang International Ltd, (Singapore Exchange listed as "EYS") has an interest in Herose Pharma (see <a href="http://www.smartinvestor.com.sg/livingconcepts2.asp?livconid=104" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smartinvestor.com.sg/livingconcepts2.asp?livconid=104" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://ir.zaobao.com/eys/news/eys200601.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ir.zaobao.com/eys/news/eys200601.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). Herose has also been discussed in several online forums of patients suffering from skin problems (and the discussions have not always been favorable; the treatment is apparently extremely expensive). In addition, and what tips the scale for me, the company publicly announced in 2003 that it is conducting tests on an AIDS drug <a href="http://onenews.nzoom.com/onenews_detail/0,1227,162807-1-6,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://onenews.nzoom.com/onenews_detail/0,1227,162807-1-6,00.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. People may well want to read about the company, and that pushes my vote to a "keep".

<p>Sloppily-written, irredemably POV. I know of no persons or organizations who identify themselves as "neo-Luddite" - this is just a smear term.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A Google search for "neo-luddite" yields 24,000 hits. The term is in common usage in by some proponents; it's in the title of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roszak_6b8e.html" title="Theodore Roszak">Theodore Roszak</a>'s "The Cult of Information: A Neo-Luddite Treatise on High Tech, Artificial Intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking" and is used frequently in the text of Kirkpatrick Sale's "Rebels Against the Future: The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution: Lessons for the Computer Age." While the article may be sloppily written, the subject is encyclopedic and should be made to conform with NPOV by avenues other than deletion. <a href="../../../e/l/b/User%7EElBenevolente_e171.html" title="User:ElBenevolente">ElBenevolente</a> 22:53, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I sympathise with this view, but have you read the article? It's such a mess I doubt it's fixable. Full of statements like this: "Infoshop.org is one of a number of propaganda fronts which simultaneously promote luddism and deny that it is any sort of organized movement, much like how Sinn Fein denied for decades any connection to the IRA." And: "Both have labelled the philosophy of transhumanism as, "the world's most dangerous idea," despite the fact that no transhumanist has ever attacked or sabotaged anyone or anything, while so far, leftist neo-luddites do so as a matter of right[24] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeywrenching" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeywrenching" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeywrenching</a>)."

<ul>
<li>No one <i>needs</i> to claim that inflammatory crap is NPOV. An NPOV article <i>can</i> be written about neo-luddism. <i>Some</i> of the information currently in the article is useful; there's no need to start from scratch.

<ul>
<li>No, the two concepts are separate. Luddites were English workers in the 1800s. Neo-luddism is a modern movement. I don't necessarily disagree that both things couldn't be covered in one article, but would you delete <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassicalism.html" title="Neoclassicalism">Neoclassicalism</a> for the same reason? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 05:07, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All right, you logic bombed me. Good shot. Neoclassicalism is a distinct movement based on imitation of ideal archetypes. But neo-luddites and luddites have the same underlying ideas and belief systems, so I don't think they're distinct enough for separate articles. I ask myself, if I were reading the luddite article, would I want to know how these exact same principles apply in the modern world? Yes. If I were reading the neo-luddite article, would I want to know the origin of these beliefs? Yes. Is there too much content for one article? No. So redirect and merge what's salvagable from the "neo" version. Re-read the neo-luddism article. Is there any sentence that has it's meaning changed by removing the "neo-"? I don't see any. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 05:37, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said, I don't necessarily disagree with you on the merge. I was just reacting to what seemed to me as a rather flippant dismissal of the article's subject just because it starts with <i>neo-</i>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 05:49, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
