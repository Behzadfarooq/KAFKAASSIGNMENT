<li>Thanks Splash for cleaning up the page creation. My concern is that Mr. Kinsella himself recreated this new page about himself. It was already voted deleted once. He wants a second bite at the apple for his own self-interest.He has commented about it on his blog. <a href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stephankinsella.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Someone has linked him under "Noted" <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_attorneys.html" title="Patent attorneys">Patent attorneys</a> almost immediately after his new page was created. This looks like self-promotion. I do not think Wikipedia should be used like this. I do not think that it is appropriate. Mr. Kinsella looks notable enough to me to have an article about him. As far as I know, the information is accurate, however, it seems hard for the article to be neutral when he wrote it about himself. He certainly speaks very highly of himself, "He has drawn on his expertise as a practicing patent lawyer to become a leading libertarian opponent of intellectual property laws; his seminal argument 'Against Intellectual Property' has become widely referred to and cited." This does not sound neutral. I suppose it could be rewritten, but who is going to correct Mr. Kinsella about himself, so I think this creates an on-going problem for the article. I cast <b>yes delete vote</b>.--<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanKoppelman_6e3c.html" title="User:RyanKoppelman">RyanKoppelman</a> 21:01, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>RyanK: I had no idea until you just wrote this that I am under patent attorneys. I had nothing to do with this. I am really not interested in self-promotion. I just want people interested in my writing to be able to access it. As for the promotional aspects to my entry, I'll modify and make it shorter and more factual. But I have summarized my case for why my entry clearly satisfies the Wiki "notable" criteria here Votes_for_deletion/Stephan_Kinsella_2. None of the delete voteres have tried to follow the policy. Let me summarize: I have published books and articles, with audiences that satisfy the criteria. I have 19,000 Google hits. I am more well known than the average college professor. My info is factual and easily verifiable. Moreover, I am as far as I know the only practicing, licensed patent attorney who has written an explicit critique of the patent system as a whole, who calls for its abolition; and this articles has gotten a large amount of attention and is seen as one of the leading pieces in the libertarian anti-IP movement. By Wikie's own standards, I believe my entry is acceptable, as was the initial one not put up by me and therefore never should have been deleted. I would at least like to see Wiki editors citing and applying Wiki policy if they are doing to cast a delete vote. For example, why do I not qualify, in view of the factors I have noted, that I got from Wiki's own policy pages? <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 23:56, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, if you take out the domains mises.org, stephankinsella.com, lewrockwell.com and other domains that have blogs that you post to, your mentions drop to 13,000. Most of the 13,000 other hits are posts by you to other blogs, and responses to posts to the other blogs, since you seemingly spend every waking hour logged onto the internet to rebut your critics. So please don't go around claiming 19,000 hits as if these were people independently citing your work. Most of these instances are blog comments, and answers to your blog comments.

<li>I was the original contributor of the first article on Stephan Kinsella, although I contributed it before I started my present account. My contribution was based on a growing number of refereed journal articles, books, and lectures in which Kinsella's "Against Intellectual Property" was being cited. I was the original founder of the Birmingham, AL and Auburn, AL <a href="../../../t/h/e/2600%7E_The_Hacker_Quarterly_e4af.html" title="2600: The Hacker Quarterly">2600</a> meetings, and ran an "h/p/c/a/v" <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_e769.html" title="BBS">BBS</a> in the 90's. Since the late 90's, I have been very interested in IP, and have lectured on it at Auburn University and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. When I came across Kinsella's IP article in 2001 (in the Journal of Libertarian Studies), I had not met him, nor anyone else who knew him personally, but I did meet numerous academics who were taking his dismantling of IP very seriously. I personally thought that it was an essential step towards an exhaustive conciliation of the <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker_Ethic_cf5b.html" title="Hacker Ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_rights.html" title="Property rights">property rights</a>. Kinsella is now a frequent lecturer at Mises Institute events, and is constantly cited by eminent scholars like <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Block_b788.html" title="Walter Block">Walter Block</a> as /the/ go-to guy on IP theory. As the point most germane to this discussion though, please let me reiterate that I was the original article contributor, and only mentioned the entry to Stephan when I asked his permission to release an image (stephankinsella.jpg) from his website into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. I will cast a <b>vote to keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 18:39, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>userfy</b>. Certainly it is a vanity article, written and edited by the subject. It was deleted here <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Stephan_Kinsella_abad.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Stephan Kinsella">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Stephan Kinsella</a> just three months ago in a VfD which had a number of sockpuppets participating on his behalf. This article appears to have been recreated in part to compete with that of a rival, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_G._Palmer_9a85.html" title="Tom G. Palmer">Tom G. Palmer</a>, that Kinsella has used a blog campaign to try to get deleted. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:33, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Willmcw:</b> Have you taken into account that I and one of my IP publications is mentioned in the Wiki <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_Property_d0e1.html" title="Intellectual Property">Intellectual Property</a> entry; and in the Wiki <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_theories_of_law.html" title="Libertarian theories of law">Libertarian_theories_of_law</a> entry? I had nothing to do with either; I assume both predate my recent entry; and I was just made aware of it after doing a google search on Wikipedia. Is this no some indicia of notability? Those entries will pointlessly go to a blank page, if you delete my entry. Why? <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 01:29, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Willmcw: My original entry was put up by someone else. It was not a vanity piece. But I have summarized my case for why my entry clearly satisfies the Wiki "notable" criteria here Votes_for_deletion/Stephan_Kinsella_2. Why do you disagree with it? I fail to see the relevance of my motives for posting the entry, but if you must know, after looking at the criteria for notability more closely due to the delete debate about the Palmer entry, I realized my entry qualifies and should not have been deleted. The preveious delete debate did not cite of follow Wiki policy. People just used their airy-fairy discretion to say "notable" or not. BUt there are criteria, and I expect Wiki editors to make a good faith effort to apply them. WHich of the policy criteria that I have listed do you deny? Notice, you yourself are inconsisten, Willmcw: you voted to keep the Tom G. Palmer entry, on the grounds that he is openly gay at a think tank. This is ridiculous. What if I am a closeted gay?-wouldn't your policy punish gays in the closet? Moreover, as far as I know the only practicing, licensed patent attorney who has written an explicit critique of the patent system as a whole, who calls for its abolition. You seem to be nonobjective in my case. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 23:56, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The previous version, since you keep mentioning it, was most likely written by you originally. It was then posted to a copyrighted webpage. Another editor, DickClarkMises, posted it here verbatim. That was a clear "copyvio" and I marked it as such. You refused to release the text under our <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and made disparaging comments about me on your blogs (thanks). We undertook to write a fresh version that was not a copyvio, and that version was subsequently VfDed (in a process which saw several brand-new editors voting to "keep") three months ago.</li>
<li>Regarding the Palmer article, Wikipedia is not consistent. Please do not try to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> that if your rival gets something then you must too. Nonetheless I see you said there that you are not notable for your writing. If not that then what? On the other hand, in the spirit of equity, I'd be happy to change my vote to "delete" on that page if you'll do the same here. The chance that the Palmer article (which is mostly irrelevant to this discussion) may have started as autobiography and be currently edited by its subject are bothersome. Subjects who edit their articles are almost always a problem.
<ul>
<li>Willmcw, don't you think it's a bit ... off... of you to offer to change your vote on Palmer? Shouldn't you simply vote (a) in accordance with your good faith application of Wiki biograph policy; and (b) try to vote consistently? I assure you that my first Wiki entry was not vanity, nor did I do it or have anything to do with it. And as I have modifed the current version, it is short, unobtrusive, purely factual, and completely non-vanity.
<ul>
<li>I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humor. Anyway, the offer still stands. You said you're not notable, you say Palmer isn't notable either. If you vote to delete both of them then, as a gesture of "wikilove", I'll do the same. Oh, and if you had nothing to do with the previous version, then I guess "nothing" includes the fact that you wrote it, edited it, and then you (and your friends) fought to keep it. It didn't just "happen." -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:25, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Willmcw: I said i was not notable in a colloquial sense; but when I read the criteria, I believe I qualify. As for the previous version: I meant I had nothing to do with an entry being put up in the first place. Dick Clark is not my friend; I do not even know him. I cannot access the origianl article since you had it deleted, but yes, he probably got most of the info from my online bio. that is true. Once it was up, and i was made aware of it, I did edit it, which is not impermissible. I actually did not fight to keep it, when you deleted it, I just objected to your calling it a vanity page since it was NOT. --<a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 19:54, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>As I've already told you, the entire history of the article has been restored and is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephan_Kinsella&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephan_Kinsella&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

Please note that I did not call the original version "vanity" in its VfD. I have called this version "vanity" since it plainly fits the label.-<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:06, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Willmcw: I have removed the books. I can't find the original version of my entry, unfortunately. You say I wrote the original article; yet I have denied this and you have no proof. In fact Dick Clark admitted to doing it. Are you calling us both liars? That is uncalled for. I could have put my entry up anonymously or asked someone to do it. I have been honest. Your insinuation is uncalled for. As for copyright, there was not one, since I consented to it. The VfD of that first page was improper, since I clearly meet the criteria specified on Wiki policy. You have just asserted your own opinion as to consistency, but not tried to apply actual Wiki standards. As for Wiki not being consistent--no, it might not be, but you, as an individual, should be, otherwise you reveal unfairness, bias, or arbitrariness. Your alleged reason for Palmer's "keep" vote is that he is openly gay; this is absurd. Others say he has a large number of google hits, thus they vote "keep"; my google votes are higher. Others point to Palmer's publications; mine are greater in number, and I have books in addition to articles. I am only trying to have this entry treated fairly and judged by actual Wiki policy, which none of you deletes seems to want to try to make an effort to apply. I would appreciate a little fairness here.</li>
<li>Your google hits are almost entirely links to comments made by you on blogs, or responses to comments made by you on blogs. For instance, the number of hits drops by 6,000 if you take out the domains stephankinsella.com, mises.org and lewrockwell.com. Since you are prodigious in posting to the internet, that accounts for your google citations. You are not cited more than a college professor. Most college professors have better things to do with their time.Jstrummer 04:49, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I truly doubt that DickClarkMises wrote the biography on your (copyrighted noticed) website. <a href="http://stephankinsella.com/bio/bio2.php" class="external free" title="http://stephankinsella.com/bio/bio2.php" rel="nofollow">http://stephankinsella.com/bio/bio2.php</a> That is the material that he used to create the original article <s>(OK, not actualy <i>original</i>—plagiarized)</s>. Now if he actually wrote it then I am mistaken. But I doubt that because he described it as "dump of auto-bio from stephankinsella.com)".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephan_Kinsella&amp;oldid=19190784" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephan_Kinsella&amp;oldid=19190784" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Do you still insist that he wrote it? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:14, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is a good point. I suppose he didn't "write" it, b/c he probably borrowed heavily from my own bio.

Click forward through a few pages of hits (by jumping e.g. 10 pages at a time) and Google will truncate the search to the 'unique' results like <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22stephan+kinsella%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=5nF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=400&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22stephan+kinsella%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=5nF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=400&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Note the message from Google at the bottom. As an aside, I'm not sure that specifically searching with an engine that avoids any kind of media/literature search is particularly useful for establishing notability or not. Without commenting on this article, I would suggest that your 22 hits just shows that there are 22 references to him in usenet groups and the like; that doesn't cover any of the more useful outlets at all. There may or may not be anything more notable turned up in a proper Google, but the groups search doesn't even admit the possibility. I find the truncation that Google does to be quite useful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 15:34, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Martindale is a directory of lawyers, not an encyclopedia or biographical database, and it contains listings for over a million lawyers.

<li>True. What do you think Who's Who is? Do you think everyone there deserves encyclopedic entry? You do not answer my point: that you are in effect penalizing me wiht the "self-promotion" critique because I did not engage in enough self-promotion earlier in response to all those dumb Who's Who offers. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 03:18, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are not being penalized. An encyclopedia article is not a reward or something you deserve or have a right to. And no, I do not think that an entry in <i>Who's Who</i> should automatically get you an encyclopedia entry here, but it's a damn sight more notable than appearing in a directory of over a million lawyers. I'm assuming you are referring to my vote at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Tom_G._Palmer_0460.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Tom G.

<li>This is not true. I have noticed some people who voted to delete my entry are applying other standards elsewhere so I have merely asked that they make sure their standards are consistent and fair. That is all. If someone in good faith votes to delete my entry I have no problem with this. Strangely, however, I have noticed that NONE of the "delete" voters have even made an attempt to justify their decision based on Wiki's own criteria for bios; as I have shown, by those standards, my entry is permissible. No one has even attempted to contradict me on this. Sad. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 19:16, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

An important difference between his article and Palmer's is that the latter isn't self-written. Also it seems that Palmer simply has a greater claim to notability.

<li>With regard to criteria... all right. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is a guideline, not a firm policy; it is a set of suggestions on how to look at biographies. The main section says that biographies meeting some criteria <i>may</i> be included, not that they <i>must</i> be. I happen to like the Google test, one of the criteria mentioned in the article. My own vote was originally based on an application of a variation of the Google test, using Google Groups. I then confirmed my impression using a Proquest search. I am now about to do a third: I personally regard a person as notable if they have written a book with an Amazon sale rank number that is less than (i.e. higher ranked than) 200,000. I do not know how this test will turn out. I believe by the way that this is a weaker criterion than "sales over 5,000." If Amazon shows that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephan_Kinsella_bf6a.html" title="Stephan Kinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> has written a book with a sales rank number under 200,000 I will change my vote to "keep."

<li>Note that Amazon sales ranks depend strongly on recency of sales. a bookm that has sold fewer copiees, but sold them more recently will generally have a lower (better) rank. The ranks are really not meaningful until you are dealing with books currently sellign well -- then they may be used to compare how well. Also they only record online sales, and are thus subject to systematic bias against books disproportionaly sold directly. I think you can get actual sales figures fromw Bowker (the people who maintain the Books in Print database) that are much more accurate, and give actual numbers of books sold, not a "rank", but I don't know exactly how to do this. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 15:13, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't blame you, and thanks. The Civil Law dictionary is a mistake by Amazon; it's not even a book. I tried to get them to fix it but they won't. I have an article by that title. Someone at Amazon is confused. The other books are expensive, specialty books. They hardly ever sell on Amazon; almost all of them are bought directly from the 50 year old publisher Oceana, which has an established catalog and direct mail and online presence. Digest is a 6 volume set so has less than 5000 sales. I am not sure of the sales of Online Contract Formation, but I think it's less than 5000 so far; but it was jsut releated last year. However, the International Investment book IS BEING RELEASED NEXT MONTH so there are no sales yet (though there are over 1000 pre-orders). The book it's replacing is the 1997 book, on Protecting Foreign Invesmtment. Its sales have petered of in last 2 years b/c the new book is coming out and b/c it's dated, but that book did have well over 5000 sales, and I can get a letter from Oceana to prove it if you want. MOroever, the criteria say articles in publications w/ more than 5000 subscribers, and several of mine have that. The Freeman for one, and probably some of the law reviews. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 00:34, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> My original vote was deleted from this page. This is a vanity page, and Kinsella admits he wrote it himself. If you delete it, he's going to repost it as Stephan Kinsella 3, anyway. But it should be deleted anyway. Also, nearly all of the "keep" votes are sockpuppetish, or, I suspect, people on mailing lists that Stephan Kinsella has urged to vote for him. Virtually no libertarian knows who this guy is, except for a small band of people in Alabama. He's not cited in any serious academic articles. He's not published in any serious academic journals. He's just some lawyer guy who has a gigantic ego and a lot of free time to play around on the internet. Look how many times he comments on others' votes.

<li>Stephan: I have been in the mainstream libertarian movement for 10 years. I've met every notable libertarian academic in the U.S., and many foreign ones. I have also met you. I have met and had discussions with nearly every important libertarian legal theorist from Epstein, to Posner, to Volokh, to Barnett, to Post, and so on. Not once has your name been mentioned by ANY one of them, even when we've talked about IP law. It's very likely that not ONE of them knows who you are, although I wouldn't know for sure since your name doesn't come up. You are not cited by them. You are not invited to conferences hosted by or attended by them. You haven't taught at any particularly impressive schools, or published in any respectable academic journals. You may be a fine practicing attorney - I would not know - but you do not qualify as a libertarian thinker, if by you mean "taken seriously by others." What's more, my vote was deleted.

And I find your assertion that you have met "every notable libertarian academic in the US" laughable. It sounds to me that you have such a monster ego that if you have not gained personal audience with a "thinker" than you refuse to allow them to be referred to as notable. I have been in the "mainstream libertarian movement" for five years, and I HAVE heard of him.
