<p>This is a merger of three VfDs: <a href="../../../%E3%81%82/_/_/%E3%81%82.html" title="あ">あ</a>, <a href="../../../%E3%81%84/_/_/%E3%81%84.html" title="い">い</a>, and <a href="../../../%E3%81%AE/_/_/%E3%81%AE.html" title="の">の</a>.

<dd>Can you make it clear how votes count here? Do I have to put <b>delete</b> after each kana, or will you only count votes one for each person for the whole article? Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm not sure of the rules. --DannyWilde 00:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not likely to close this AfD myself (I rarely close AfDs) but I would recommend that whoever does close this use common sense in counting votes. It is important, in my opinion, that all three articles close with the same result, and I imagine that the closing admin will examine all offered opinions without too much regard to which articles they are offered in connection with to reach a decision about consensus. Frankly, at this point, I can't see how a consensus will arise out of this swamp, but stranger things have happened.... <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 01:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dictionary definition. DannyWilde 00:59, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, dictionary entry exists in Wiktionary anyway. --DannyWilde</li>
<li><strike><b>Weak Delete</b></strike>, as DannyWilde said, they're <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AE" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:の">already in wiktionary</a>. The roman alphabet (<a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a>, <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">B</a>, <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a>, ...) has individual pages, but the wiktionary pages seem to already have more information than is being created in the en/wikipedia pages. If there's enough information to go in these, that doesn't belong in Wiktionary, then <b>Keep</b>. Are all 50/100 kana going to be added? Are any kanji going to be added?? --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 01:20, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge to Wiktionary</b>, per Uncle G. How a word is written and pronounced belongs in a dictionary. The same goes for letters that make up words. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 12:49, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No, kanji will not be added, only the kana, and the katakana will redirect to the hiragana articles. Like with the articles on the English alphabet letters, these articles could show the history of the writing of individual kana. In fact, I have a 2000 page dictionary in storage that shows the history of each English letter, with each article on them at least two pages. Aside from the history, the article could go slightly deeper into phonology, too, and possibly instructions on how to write the kana. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 01:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, I've temporarily stopped until this AFD is closed. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 01:18, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wiktionary is the place for this (The fact that you are referring to a dictionary should tip you off.), and a lot of such work has already been done, long since. You are encouraged to go to Wiktionary and contribute your dictionary work there. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Seems to be the place for an <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/EB1911:A" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/EB1911:A" rel="nofollow">Encylcopedia entry, too</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 03:21, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No reason why these aren't any less encyclopedic than the letters of the Roman alphabet. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 01:20, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a>, if there is an encyclopaedia article to be had, it should be under an English title. But, as per the far better dictionary article <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AE" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:の">の</a> in Wiktionary, there is clearly no subject for an encyclopaedia article to be had. This article is a mis-placed dictionary article, pure and simple. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. As a stub encyclopaedia article it would have no hope of expansion. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you are unsatisfied with the name of the article, it can be moved to <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_%28kana%29.html" title="No (kana)">No (kana)</a> and the actual hiragana and katakana can be made into redirects.
<ul>
<li>I reiterate: There is no encyclopaedia article to be had here. Everything that you have proposed adding, pronunciations, stroke indexes, and so forth is <i>dictionary article content</i> about the word. Wiktionary has had vast numbers of such articles with pronunciations, stroke indexes, and so forth, since 2003. If you want to improve them with pictures, Wiktionary is the place to do so. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have articles on <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a> and <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">B</a> and so on. I don't know, but I should expect you would be able to say as much about the kana as about Roman letters. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 02:07, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One can, <i>and the dictionary does</i>. Go look at some of the thousands of such entries in Wiktionary. Some of them are huge. They have Unicode values, stroke indicies, input method indices, meanings in several languages, transliterations in several systems, translations, and more. Pictures would improve them yet further. A random medium-length example (selected, ironically, by hitting "random page" <i>exactly once</i> at Wiktionary) of what a dictionary can contain: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%86%9D" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:冝">冝</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:19, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Agree that this would be better in Wiktionary. Disagree that the article in Wikitionary is "better." This one has some nice information not duplicated there. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 02:49, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>New content was added since the "better" comment. Agree that the new content is good, and should be merged to Wiktionary. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 14:13, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Toothpaste - there is a rich history at <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a> and <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">B</a> ... and it would be nice to have the same sort of history for the kana. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:26, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, articles about letters are well-founded (we used to have them even back in UseModWiki days, indeed). <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 01:30, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What of the overlap between wikipedia and wiktionary? Is there a substantial reason to have them in both places? If not, which one should be kept? --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 01:34, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wiktionary. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Both can be kept, just as how the elements of the periodic table belong in both dictionaries and encyclopedias. In addition, the Roman alphabet also exists in a dictionary. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 01:51, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A false analogy. Whereas a dictionary article on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plutonium" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:plutonium">plutonium</a> tells one about the word, how it is pronounced and so forth, an encyclopaedia about <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> tells one <i>about plutonium</i> — about the element that the word represents. This is not the case here. You are not creating encyclopaedia articles about the things that the words represents. (It's clear from the Wiktionary entry telling us the meaning of the word that there isn't an encyclopaedia article to be had about the thing that <i>this</i> word represents.) You are creating <i>dictionary articles about the words themselves</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:01, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See for instance the precedent with the wikipedia <a href="../../../z/_/_/Z.html" title="Z">Z</a> vs the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/z" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:z">wiktionary:z</a>. Okay, Ungle G's description doesn't fit with precedent, but I agree that his description is the right way to go. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 02:10, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Complete rubbish. It's not outside of the scope of Wiktionary at all. Go look in Wiktionary at some of the existing articles. See the one that I picked at random above, for example. Many of them have stroke indexes, Unicode encodings, and other technical information. (And even they aren't complete.

<li>To my understanding, kanji are used as the bases of words. Hiragana and katakana are uses as noun endings, adjective endings, for other suffixes, to show the pronunciation of kanji, for stylistic purposes, for otomotopoeias, for emphasis, for technical terms, and for the transcription of words borrowed from other languages. I do not think we should have an article for every character representing a word, or part of a compound word, or a rootword, but for characters that represent individual sounds that can form a word, as in the English alphabet and with the kana. If this and similar articles were to be kept, only approximately 50 or so kana articles would be created total. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 03:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just a note from the person who suggested deleting this in the first place: there is some information about some of the kana characters which could be worth having in Wikipedia. For example the origin of the kana ン is disputed. It might belong in Wikipedia if we were to discuss the origin of the character, or if there is to be something other than just "this is a Japanese character, it is pronounced "no" ". However, I'd expect such information to come from a split from <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> pages if it came from anywhere. Also, "no" has very important grammatical functions in Japanese grammar. So I think there is a possibility of expansion or split from <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_grammar.html" title="Japanese grammar">Japanese grammar</a> of a "no" page. However, since there are already lists of Japanese symbols on the <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> pages, I'm very dubious about making a full set of small, unexpandable stub articles about every single Japanese symbol. --DannyWilde 03:47, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: since I started the vote for deletion, this article has been artificially bulked with copy-paste edits from other pages, probably in order to avoid being deleted. For example, the comments about "no" coming from the sousho form of characters, etc., apply to ALL of the Japanese kana, not just this one - there is no point in having fifty identical pages, one for each kana, with the same copy-pasted statement. Using this kind of trickery in order to avoid the page being deleted should not be acceptable. --DannyWilde 07:40, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please assume good faith. If you'd prefer the history section to be taken out temporarily, this would be fine. The transition of man'yōgana to hiragana is much more complex than what is written now. For example, it's a pretty big jump from the second character to the third in the picture at Image:Nohistory.jpg. I'd rather have a few copy and pasted statements, aided by pictures, than an article lacking completely in history content, which applies to this VFD, but overall, and I already it's already a beginning to be a bit comprehensive. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 07:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you are serious about writing in detail about the origins of kana on a per-kana basis, I would suggest an article on "Origin of kana" with section headings for each kana you want to discuss, if you have enough material that it will make <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> too big, of course. If there is so much stuff on <b>one</b> kana that you actually need a <b>whole article</b> on it, I'd be surprised. Spreading origins all over the place in fifty different articles doesn't make any sense, since the hiragana and katakana are all very closely related to each other and the history is the same. --DannyWilde 13:06, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Encyclopedias explain the <b>ideas those symbols refer to</b>, and refer back to physical symbol history only when needed for disambiguation purposes. This goes <i>doubly</i> for individual letters.

<ul>
<li>And, as stated above, letters are even more low-level representations than individual prefixes, words, or phrases. You find pronunciation of words and a long list of historical spellings in dictionaries, but not in encyclopedias. That's because dictionaries describe how you write a word down, how you pronounce the word, how you attach it to other words. Encyclopedias describe the concept, history, and larger context that pops into your head when someone says/writes/types that word to you. Individual letters having nothing to do with abstract ideas in your head. There's clear precedent that pronunciation belongs in a dictionary, so it follows that how a letter or word is expressed in Unicode or Braille also belongs in a dictionary, because these are just different mechanisms for communicating between two people, but they don't have any impact on the higher-level thoughts a person has once the idea is communicated to them. Note that kanji (and chinese characters generally) blur the line between letters and words, and chinese characters clearly belong in a dictionary. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 17:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Ahh. Ideograms clearly are dictionaries (eg. see <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary.html#Character_dictionaries" title="Dictionary">character dictionaries</a>). As for the difference between pentagrams and syllabary... You can stick a pentagram next to an octagon next to a circle, and it doesn't mean anything syntactically. Whereas, with syllabries and letters, their purpose is to be part of the language hierarchy (eg. letters form words, words form phrases, phrases form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, paragraphs form encyclopedia entries (or something)). Letters are on the opposite end of the language hierarchy from where encyclopedias sit. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I used pentagram and ampersand as examples of signs that have their own articles. I didn't say that pentagram is a letter or an ideogram. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 18:46, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to the standard I put forth in the couple of comments above, language-oriented <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapheme.html" title="Grapheme">graphemes</a> should be placed only in a dictionary (contrary to current precedent), but non-language-oriented <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictogram.html" title="Pictogram">pictograms</a> (such as a pentagram) should be placed only in an encyclopedia. So those were arguments for that position. Both Encarta and Merriam-Webster include entries for individual roman letters, so I suppose a safe way to rule on this would be to put the same/similar content on both wikipedia and wiktionary. But that's a bit of a weird solution, especially if we can find a standard that indicates which articles should go where. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm proposing that if an organization produces both an encyclopedia and a dictionary, and makes them equally available (<i>especially</i> for free), it should not have duplicate entries for every single grapheme.

<li>I think most people can understand the difference between Wikipedia and Wiktionary.

<li>I am of the opinion that this is material that is perfectly appropriate for an encyclopedia, and maybe less appropriate for a dictionary entry. However, whether <i>they</i> think it is appropriate <i>there</i> is something they have to decide by themselves, and I'm saying that <i>I</i> think this is appropriate <i>here</i> in this discussion. There is no rule that content must not be duplicated on Wiktionary and Wikipedia, as long as both communities want it. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 21:09, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A small correction: Japanese kana aren't <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideograph.html" title="Ideograph">ideographs</a>. Anyway, I completely agree with your point. I hope something everyone will agree with is that the history of kana does belong in Wikipedia. But, before deciding whether to keep the article on that basis, please take a look at the two excellent existing articles, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a>. If there is a lot of information to include, it is possible that each individual character might need to have a history page, giving more details, but as I suggested above I think it would be better to integrate the information into one focused page if at all possible. --DannyWilde 05:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, The issue is that, I strongly believe it's a problem if the standards say that information should be completely duplicated in both places. At this point, there's precedent on both Wikipedia and Wiktionary <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%8C" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:二">(1)</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Image:Zh-zu2.ogg" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Image:Zh-zu2.ogg">(2)</a> to keep all the information discussed so far on either side. When AfD/RfDs come up, the easy thing to do is vote Keep, and act like a problem doesn't exist. So eventually this information will get copied to both sides, while all along, people aren't required to give reasoned arguments for or against the idea that it should be copied verbatim in both places. I'm a programmer, and one of the first things that was pounded into my head over and over, was that you don't keep information in multiple places unless there's a really really good reason, because it always causes more problems than you think it will, keeping them synchronized or coordinated wastes a lot of human time, and usually there's a simple technical or procedural fix for it. This discussion is made more important because we really are talking about duplicating <b><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_joyo_kanji_by_reading" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:List_of_joyo_kanji_by_reading">hundreds</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Chinese_radical_index" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Chinese_radical_index">thousands of characters</a></b>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Most dictionaries <i>and</i> encyclopedias have characters in them. So people <i>will</i> come to either place looking for information. We're an electronic wiki, we're <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThings_to_be_moved_to_Wiktionary_db91.html" title="Wikipedia:Things to be moved to Wiktionary">one community, not two</a>, and we can do better. The solution is to put a redirect or interwiki link on the other side, and only store information on one side. And <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWiki_is_not_paper_5ec4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wiki is not paper">there is precedent</a> for doing that too. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 14:20, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> While there exists the potential to make a significant article for each of these, none of these has enough to justify a separate encyclopedia article at the moment. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 23:19, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
