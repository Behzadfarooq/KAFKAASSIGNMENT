I'm pretty sure that the "reviews" on the site are just promos/press releases submitted by the subject or the subjects rep. The name of the article's creator is also the name of the subject's own record label; it all adds up to self-promotion. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 22:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> What satisfies you Ohnoitsjamie? The review is real. and the plays on the BBC and Seans endorsement (if you listened to the show) seems sufficient to me. Even if it is deleted now it will be put up again by Polydor as they are distributing it, as they did with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Morrison_bc1f.html" title="James Morrison">James Morrison</a> 2 months before they released his debut album. i dont think your satisfaction is what needs to be satisfied here.

<dd>Well the site with the review on it seems reputable to me, try reading other reviews of theirs and you'll see it's not just some silly site. and the bbc link is reputable. I do agree with you that this site is not a tool for promoting, it is not my intention to do that. And regarding the snippet being on three different sites, please post the links as i tried to do this and have only come up with the Female First review. comment was added by Rarechords

<dd><b>Comment</b> Female First, Teen First and Male First are obviously one and the same. They aren't three three different review sites with the same review. That's not a fair point. And furthermore, if you aren't UK based, i dont feel you can fairly assess this issue, as there have been gigs and prints in magazines here, he's not an out of the blue artist. Also there is a band called Oswald (UK Band) that has a page up, they dont have a record out or any links apart from their site. comment was added by Rarechords</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> One album, which isn't out yet, and which is on a label of questionable noteworthiness, and radio play that began in October -- in other words, last week, maybe two weeks ago. A playlist is a trivial source, and I'm not convinced the review site linked qualifies as a reliable source. Finally, the article's author seems likely to have a conflict of interest here per <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. Unless some evidence can be produced to show this's taken the UK by storm, it's just not noteworthy per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> yet. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:51, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> No one has bothered to take this kind of action on the Oswald (UK Band) page, which has no links to their claims (and that's just one of the pages i've come across like that). It feels like I'm being picked on here. Regarding the "conflict of interest" please then amend the page to read more neutrally. I disagree that a "playlist is a trivial source". It's been on a few of Seans shows, he has a cult following down here and his taste is well respected, and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> dont just play any old record. And there need not be evidence produced to show this has taken the UK by storm as it is not one of the criteria listed in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The label is not "of questionable noteworthiness", true that it is at its early stages, but it is being distributed by Polydor (Universal) and they have a reputation to uphold. Please email them to have this confirmed. Also, just found this, Gary Crowley of the BBC Radio London has also played Yoriyos <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/04/gary_crowley_person_profile.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/04/gary_crowley_person_profile.shtml" rel="nofollow">link</a>(see closing track) and BBC <a href="../../../t/o/t/TOTP_eae2.html" title="TOTP">TOTP</a> Top Of The Pops has his album listed for release <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/new_releases/soon_albums.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/new_releases/soon_albums.shtml" rel="nofollow">link</a> (see Nov 13th) comment was added by Rarechords

<li>1. A playlist <i>is</i> trivial; it says nothing about the artist or the music, other than that it has been played. (And that the "debut album" is an EP, which makes it less noteworthy, if anything.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Rowley_1695.html" title="Sean Rowley">Sean Rowley</a> is itself unsourced, but he does seem to have a regular show, which could make this one noteworthy and reliable media source, if your song's on rotation, or if Mr. Rowley has commented on it, its artist, or its album. The show is called "Guilty Pleasures," and apparently "celebrates music that is slightly shameful to love," so I'm not sure this is a ringing endorsement, but still, a source.</dd>
<dd>3. It's probably not a good idea to use another article as precedent. Especially an article you think doesn't meet the standards. Thank you for pointing it out, though; I'll do some research and possibly nominate that article later tonight.</dd>
<dd>4. You're not being picked on. Wikipedia deletes a lot of articles about non-noteworthy bands. However, nobody's disputing that the album is listed for release; this does not make the artist noteworthy. Nobody's disputing that it's been played on the radio at least once; this does not make the artist noteworthy. This is a brand-new artist with no albums out (yet); this tends to make the artist non-noteworthy. Not necessarily -- if his single has swept the nation and he's debuted high on the charts, he would warrant an article. But so far I've seen no indication that this individual belongs in an encyclopedia. He has no established career, and, based on the article's claims, there's nothing unusual or notable about his music. If there <i>is</i> something that makes this young artist especially noteworthy, then it should be in his article, and it should be sourced. If not, he should wait until his career's more firmly established, such that someone else, <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">not directly associated with him or his label</a>, begins an article about him. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not in the UK, so I won't vote - but with respect to recording artists, perhaps a determining factor ought to be whether or not their recordings have hit the "charts". It is so easy to have recordings done now, the mere existence of a CD, even some radio play, is not sufficiently noteworthy, IMO.
