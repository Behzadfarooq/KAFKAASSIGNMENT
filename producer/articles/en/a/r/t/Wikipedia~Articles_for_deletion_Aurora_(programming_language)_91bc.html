I don't understand why this article should be deleted on the say-so of one person? I am not entirely sure how to even start defending the article with me being a beginner contributing to this site. First of all i tried to make the article as neutral sounding as possible by looking at the other language articles and following their style. Not only that, but this lanuage is maturing and will be fully released in a few weeks. This article was to pre-emp the research of the computer science community and general public regarding Aurora. Of course to you this must sound like marketing talk and one big advert but other users and i hold Aurora in extremely high regard within the OOP systems languages and is a potential successor to C++, which of course DOES make it notable. You show me another language other than Java or SmallTalk that rivals Aurora? This has created alot of dissapointment in the current Aurora community especially as the release date is so imminent. Does this mean that Aurora will never have it's own page until <i>you</i> say?</p>

<p>Frankly, for someone to start a delete thread who knows nothing about the langauge, its potential, and its roots, is absurd. The language is a solid compiler with tons of working examples, all it is lacking is a few documentation changes here and there. Do some research before you go and and try to hang something that you have no clue what it is or what it is about. If you bother to WIKI up XNA you will discover that there is a thread about it in here, and it is still technically in ALPHA, although they call it Beta 2 (or community technology preview 1), and its still under development. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of knowledge about many existing items. Aurora exists and is real and in use by tons of people.</p>

<dd>1) Since most people new to Wikipedia don't know about AfD, when a brand new user account's early postings are to an AfD discussion it raises the question of whether this might be an experienced Wikipedian posting under a new name, in order to give the appearance that a point of view is supported by more users than it really is. In AfD discussions, it is therefore customary to point out user names whose edits to an AfD discussion are among the first edits made under that account name.</dd>

<dd>2) The font type is a curious idiosyncrasy shared by the user or users of several accounts posting here.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't care either way, but i think it should be pointed out that some of the advocates for keeping this article, and indeed those who wrote most of it, are 'partner developers' that gain financially from the sales of this product. To that end their comments could be considered marketing. If the article stays it should read less like an advert and in a similar style to other languages 82.29.182.9 05:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article was to pre-emp the research of the computer science community and general public regarding Aurora. Of course to you this must sound like marketing talk and one big advert but other users and i hold Aurora in extremely high regard within the OOP systems languages and is a potential successor to C++, which of course DOES make it notable. You show me another language other than The C's, Java or SmallTalk that rivals Aurora? This has created alot of dissapointment in the current Aurora community especially as the release date is so imminent.</p>
<p>Also using google results as an indicator of being worthy for inclusion into this site is unreliable at best. Searching for mentions of Aurora returns a few thousand results, but is this an indication of its importance to the computer science community? I don't personally think so.</p>
<p>Lets take an example of other articles that appear on this site, lets take for example <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a>. Who is <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a>? I don't know either, but his contributions must of been <i>notable</i> because he has had a shiny wikipage for a year now. And guess what, he returns between 3-4 results from google!</p>
<p>Marking this article for deletion is a matter of opinion by someone who doesn't know anything about the subject of computer science or programming languages in general. Aurora IS notable and will gain global acclaim once it is released (exactly like XNA as another contributer pointed out). This article was created to educate people quickly about Aurora's design, feature set and history. Which is exactly the point of an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I do however concede the point that the article may be construed as marketing and that i, as a partner developer on Aurora was the one that started this article. The reason for this was to get the information as accurate as possible, so what better author than somebody directly invloved? Maybe you are right (?) that the article could be worded a little more neutral, but you tell me how you can mention a language's feature-set and heritage without it sounding promotional?</p>

<dd>It is good that someone who knows the language wrote the article (it'd be shocking if it was any other way!) but i think it would have helped your arguments if you were not on the payroll and the conflict of interests question did not arise. As to the article itself, certain phrases read like marketing spiel, for instance "advanced compiler" (what is so advanced about it?), "Linux and Mac OS X are planned" (marketing...), "Affiliates" (sales...) but perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of notability. A lack of hits on Google combined with a lack of links to independent sites in the article can only lead to the notion of it being non-notable. Sure, the developers and the (currently 210) forum members will have heard of it and will come here chanting "it must be notable - *I'VE* heard of it!" but who else? Has it been reviewed in magazines? Has any notable software been written in it? I don't think your argument about <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Koupal_d725.html" title="Doug Koupal">Doug Koupal</a> is relevant. If you think he is non-notable then you should take that to his page, it is has nothing to do with the notability of this article. After all that, i think the article could stay if tidied up appropriately although the question of notability (at this point in time) remains 82.29.182.9 18:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI even though it has no bearing on this discussion but to the validity of my posts, I am new to wikipedia, but I am a seasoned poster on many other forums. There is no validity in "calling me out" and accusing me of "puppeteering". Also, I think the cursive font is nice so once again, trying to accuse me of being one of the other posters by stating&#160;:"The font type is a curious idiosyncrasy shared by the user or users of several accounts posting here.": is an obvious gesture that you are placing me in the same category of those individuals, which in and of itself is a predjadicial remark. (you are basically being prejadice to my posts and towards me directly which is not allowed in wikipedia rules), I would appreciate it if you back off of me and stop with your prejadicisms towards me at this time. I do not appreciate them or your continued attacks on me, prejadice has no place here so please take it elsewhere and stick to the discussion as to wether or not this should remain in Wikipedia.</li>

The numbers themselves mean nothing. If I could find two or more in-depth, independent reviews of the Aurora software in some magazine or newspaper, I would change my call to "keep" in a flash. Sadly, there appear to be none. I repeat: The numbers and ranks thrown up by search engines add nothing to the article we do not already know.

<li>Zumwaltwood, the burden is on you to cite sources that show that the language is important. The people who write the articles and wish them to be kept have the responsibility of doing the research. If the language is important, this shouldn't be hard to do.

<li><b>Keep</b> Aurora is a NEW language, and because it is new, it shouldn't be evaluated for "notability" on the same criteria as long-established languages such as C++. I believe discussion about deletion of this article is premature. It won't do any harm to let it remain for a little while longer, and see whether the imminent production release really happens as claimed, and whether the language is reviewed in other publications as a result of its production release. --Rod Turnham 14:06 18 December 2006 (EST)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia grants no special privileges for "new" phenomena and does not evaluate them in a different way from other phenomena. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news medium. It's the other way around: there's no harm in deleting the article now. It can always be re-created without prejudice when enough has been published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to enable an article to be written that meets the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. I'd add that I believe a request to <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERFY_518d.html" title="WP:USERFY">"userfy"</a> the article, that is to move it to someone's personal user page on Wikipedia, would be honored. That would mean that the information would be available, indexed by Google, and make it easy to re-create the article at some future date. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
