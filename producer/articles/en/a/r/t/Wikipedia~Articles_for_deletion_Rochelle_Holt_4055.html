This is not usually done for trivial authors, but I don';t recall it every being discussed here.

<dd>Your continued call for the deletion of the article on Rochelle Holt is not only unjustified but even bizarre. Moreover, explaining the proposed deletion because, in addition to her MFA from the University of Iowa, she pursued further studies at Columbia Pacific University (CPU), <a href="http://www.columbia-pacific-university.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.columbia-pacific-university.net" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://circledance.tripod.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://circledance.tripod.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, is part of an orchestrated academic witch hunt. Since when is learning a crime? The defamation of CPU is part of the irresponsible misinformation phenomenon, which is described quite well, for example, in <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Scott_Peck_b9f7.html" title="M. Scott Peck">M. Scott Peck</a>'s book, People of the Lie (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-671454927</a>; Dr. Peck is best known for his best seller, The Road Less Traveled).</dd>

<dd>The article on Rochelle Holt in its present stage clearly shows and documents that she is notable on several accounts and highly eligible to be featured in Wikipedia:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>She is listed in the International Whoâ€™s Who in Poetry, London: Routledge, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0948875593</a>, and her biography is featured at universities and literary publications. Please see Reference Section in article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>She received numerous professional awards, grants and honours, including nomination for the Pulitzer Prize. She is regarded by her peers as a major poet and a significant science fiction writer. A Readerâ€™s Digest survey ranked her first among American poets. In addition to her numerous and well-received books, she published over 2000 poems in about 300 periodicals and magazines, and gave over 700 public readings at universities, schools, hospitals, libraries, bookstores and other places. She has originated a new literary genre within the category of the poem-novel, recognized by experts as a significant and innovative accomplishment. Her plays have been performed in theatres. As a publisher she has advanced the works of other professional artists. Among other things, she has published important scholarly work about the life and art of Anais Nin, Henry Miller, Lawrence Durrell as well as others and contributed to the development of literary theory.</p>

<dd>I went through uncounted entries in Wikipedia, and I am amazed to see how many of them are basically just short notes about people who cannot really reach the level of notability as Rochelle Holt does, and nevertheless they are featured in Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, according the the source you provide, NYU has a collection that includes some of your grandfather's personal papers. The collection is not called the "Papers of Nelson Frank". Apples and oranges. On the Pulitzer information, I have found she was nominated by a collection of academics, but she apparently did not become a finalist. Only finalists are "official" nominees by Pulitzer standard, so I struck out that comment above. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 23:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I would like to point out that there is no such thing as the "small press prose" Pulitzer Prize, and the name "Rochelle Holt" does not show up anywhere on <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pulitzer.org" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. This claim is likely to be a fabrication. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> 20:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>."Division" is jargon for the origin market. Think of "small press prose" as comparable to "mid-market periodical", as an example. "Categories" are the types of prizes awarded. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 23:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That may be true, though the Pulitzer website does not list anything approaching a prize that fits these categories, nor does it categorize its literary prizes by market type (beyond fiction, nonfiction, and so on). More importantly, Ms. Holt's name is not listed anywhere on the Pulitzer website, even though they list all nominees after 1980 (before the text in question was published). <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> 00:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>She would not be listed unless she was one of the three finalists in the appropriate category. Those are the only official nominees. That is why I decided to strike the Pulitzer claim. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 02:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The sources and claims <i>look</i> good, but the Pulitzer nomination was in the "small press fiction" category (a very minor thing) and I am having a hard time establishing the validity of many other claims, despite such impressive sources as, er, an Angelfire user page. In fact, about half the references were either off-the-page advertising or did not actually support the statement for which they claimed to be references. Looks like the author did a Google search and tried to find a home for every link. I find it really hard to accept this author's contention that a self-published author with with fewer than 200 unique Googles is a titan of the literary world. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Pulitzer nomination was in the "small press fiction" category (a very minor thing)</i> A non-existent thing, actually: they don't categorize that way. Fiction, Poetry, General Non-fiction, etc: very broad categories, really, and nothing to do with publication size. Even their journalism awards don't do that. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>As the author of ten books, most of them for sale now at Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.com, former editor at Prentince Hall Publishers and Teacher at Ohio University, the University of Hawaii and The New School for Social Research, I feel I know much about literature. I have read much of Rochelle Holt's work and I feel she is a very competent writer. She is an excellent poet and can write fiction and nonfiction. Her work should not be removed. Each reader can decide whether or not her work deserves attention. Maryanne Raphael, Writers World Web site: www.authorsden.com/maryanneraphael 209.244.42.59 05:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The quality of Holt's work is irrelevant to Wikipedia. The important thing is notability determined with reference to external sources. Also authorsden.com is a well-known site used predominently by self-published or vanity-press-published authors to network in order to promote each other's work. Like Holt, this poster's works seem to be predominently self-published. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 11:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Finally coming to a conclusion on this one, although it took a while. The Pulitzer nomination turns out to be totally unimportant and possibly fabricated. The publications seem to be entirely self published or vanity-press published. Having been an editor for a small press does not confer notability. Regarding the entry in the <i>Internaional Who's Who in Poetry</i>, it should be noted that there are two books of this title. I can't verify her inclusion in either, because both are insanely expensive. One of them is a vanity publication by the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.com.html" title="Poetry.com">International Library of Poetry</a>. Jonathon vos Post's web site, much as I respect it as a useful resource, is not a reliable source and cannot confer notability. The only thing that suggests notability is that a university has a collection of her work, which honestly doesn't seem like enough to me. We have no idea why they decided to collect this work, and there are no secondary sources discussing in what way the work is considered significant. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 11:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> - after reading the discussion here I have to say the article fails the smell test.
