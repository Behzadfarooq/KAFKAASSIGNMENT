But you don't find any note of any of that in the article. The problemisn't with the subject, who is as notable as many people are, it is with the article, which is not actually about him. SO yes, Prof Haley may well be worth biographising, but this is not his biography. It is eyt another of a string of articles pushing a very restricted POV of Ombudsman's att he expense of real information or an accurate view of the people whose names are used to cover them. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 19:03, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is an outrageous personal attack. Also essentially untrue (I was so irritated by an IP addresed user calling himself "the invisible anon" I registered the ID (making a literal error and registring the completely unused "Invisible Anon" which has been described as a sock puppet). I accept that that was WP:POINT and don't propose to do it again. AN admin commneting on it remarked that it had followed weeks of provocation - by Leifern, Ombodsmun and the IP address user referred to. If you look at Leifern's history, you will see that the first contact he had with me - triggered by Ombudsma - was a vitriolic attack on me, and an incoherent attack on a page I started called <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist">anti-vaccinationist</a> which he has sustained. If you look at other edits I've been involved in, you'll see they mostly go smoothly, despite being in subjects not always free of controversy. (Try fast breeder reactors, Exeter, Smallpox, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Jenner_379d.html" title="Edward Jenner">Edward Jenner</a> which is now a Good Article. If you have a look at <a href="http://ganfyd.org" class="external free" title="http://ganfyd.org" rel="nofollow">http://ganfyd.org</a> you'll see that I wrote the licence and was an instigator and am a sysadmin etc there and it works very well. Look at leifern's early edits and you'll see that one of the four subjects he is very obviously non-objective on is the presence of anti-vaccinationists in the world (I can understand the psychology of the other 3 but that one I'm unsure of - possibly it is the reaction of someone who makes his living from rationality finding that he is keeping company he cannot accpet as an organised group but must regard as coincidental agreement arrived at independently but this is a digression). I think this sustained pattern of behaviour against me is outside WP policies and norms and worthy of comment. It certainly is an ad hominem attack here.

<p>I would think better of this behaviour if it was <i>not</i> sober. I read the WP article on sockpuppets, and apart from WP:POINT which <i>I</i> shan't do again, but Leifern is continuing to commit, none of my use of the invisible Anon was harmful - no voting, just a demonstration that if one wants to be called {name} then following advice from several people to actually register {name} is sensible. Leifern's behaviour has been from the start unreasonable and obnoxious, as demonstrated here. Since he started editing WP he has been pushing a particular POV, forcefully, and in several instances by sustained rudeness and uncivil behaviour - see his history with <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">User:Geni</a> over Thimerosal, Mercury and autism.

<dd><b>comment</b>: As pointed out elsewhere, Haley is perhaps the foremost scientist investigating the neurotoxicity of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a>, an area of utmost importance with regard to the global epidemic of autoimmune disorders. His research and outspoken opposition to vested interests profiting immensely from contaminating the environment and poisoning medical patients is of extreme relevance to many significant health and safety debates, making this AfD one of the most ludicrous and preposterous examples of gaming the system yet perpetrated. The motivation for this AfD is beyond highly suspect, since it inherently relies upon both a lack of understanding of the issues by many or most Wiki editors and the built-in advantage of having the dubious wind of medical orthodoxy at its back. Haley's research isn't simply about the role of thimerosal in the <a href="../../../i/a/t/Iatrogenic.html" title="Iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a>, it has ramifications with regard to the wisdom of the ADA's refusal to allow dentists to speak with patients about mercury poisoning caused by mercury-laden amalgams, upon the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, and upon the understanding of the etiology of autoimmune disorders. There are plenty of fictional characters and soap opera actor biographies to nominate for an AfD, rather than gaming the system to suppress important information of a highly regarded scientist who is serving a critical role by actively investigating the devastating effects of neurotoxins that have ravaged the health of millions. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 20:17, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Conclusion of comment</b> This does not to me make Dr Haley's reputation out as described above. It is a disservice to an academic or scientist to blow them up as something more than what they are - one of many - and the underlying reason tends to be that few scientists share the particualr point of view lauded. Actually, Haley has a reputation for doing competent and interesting work in fields having nothing to do with any of this, and that points up even more strongly that this is a non-<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> piece of an article about <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal_controversy.html" title="Thimerosal controversy">Thimerosal controversy</a>, not about Haley, and not an effort to biographise him.

Haley's use of birth hair, blood and urine analyses, not to mention use of highly advanced biomarkers, are not mere theoretical indicators, these have been used to provide overwhelming and incontrovertible evidence of ongoing harm perpetrated by the medical industry. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 15:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just to pick out one thing from that un<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> un<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> comment, amalgam is _dental_ amalgam, not a medical thing at all. And while Haley's work is interesting, there is a need for someone else to actually succeed in repeating it before it convinces everyone. Thimerosal is pretty much abandoned now, and it is time the incidence of autism was shown to have changed as a result, if the cae for a connection is to be made - it is very classic really: make a hypothesis that A causes B, stop A, observe B decrease. We might avoid the stage of restarting A and observing B rise again in challenge - if it happens. WP:RPA does seem a useful semi-convention, and actually once it is appleid, the content of comments gets easier to pick out. The character of the argument of course doesn't of itself demonstrate the falsity of the arguments, any more than the ad homenem and more precisely ad personam attacks demonstrate anything about the article, the AfD or the science, but they are quite characteristic of anti-vacinationist and the fringe medical campaigners and IMHO out of place in the construction of an encyclopaedia. Medical orthodoxy by the way, has been assembled from whatever came to hand and worked, which is why so much that isn't orthodox doesn't work. We have been doing free and open copying of knowledge for generations longer than WP has, and approving of it. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It doesn't even say she's Norway's first porn star, it says she "Is <i>considered</i> as Norway's first porn-star" (emphasis added). Weasel word!

<li><b>Comment</b> there is already a Wikipedia article called <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyarat.html" title="Ziyarat">Ziyarat</a>, which covers Islamic pilgrimages other than the Hajj, and this article mentions Wahabi/Salafist persecution. Any real info could go there. Striver could put his energies into making a list of shrines that attract ziyarat and creating articles for each shrine, with pictures. Westerners know about the Hajj, but don't understand ziyarat. Info and pictures of the beauties of the shrines would help. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep with Rename</b>. The challenge of following an AfD vote on a page that keeps changing notwith standing, this page seems to have material that needs to be kept. The topic matter will almost inevitably suffer from POV, and I'd like to encourage Striver to work with others to help make this material more encyclopaedic and less POV.

<li><b>Keep</b> the significance of Shrines, mosques and graves is crucial to many Muslim practices. While Ziyarat is also an important practice to visit those places, Ziyarat will be a huge article by itself. I would say the article is a good stub that needs lots of work and it might end up being a huge article. I even started something similar to this in the Arabic wikipedia under categories. I was even planning to create something similar to this article myslef. <a href="../../../t/2E/p/User%7ET.P.W._c5e7.html" title="User:T.P.W.">The Peace Worshipper (aka 129.)</a><sup><a href="../../../t/2E/p/User_talk%7ET.P.W._425f.html" title="User talk:T.P.W."><span style="color:#008000;">Talk to TPW</span></a></sup> 23:48, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In the talk page for the ziyarat article, MPatel suggested a division into <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyarat.html" title="Ziyarat">Ziyarat</a> and <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyaret.html" title="Ziyaret">Ziyaret</a> -- that is, pilgrimage practices and places of pilgrimage. That seems workable to me. No one but no one is going to be looking for an article entitled "Shrines, mosques, and graves". I admit that <i>ziyaret</i> is not an English term and that no one will be looking for it either BUT ... it's unambiguous and we can direct people to it from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrine.html" title="Shrine">shrine</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mausoleum.html" title="Mausoleum">mausoleum</a>, and other articles. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:44, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because we aren't interested in mosques and graves per se -- there are millions of mosques and graves that aren't places of pilgrimage. We are interested in the mosques and graves that are pilgrimage centers. There is no word for this in English, but there is in ... Persian? Arabic? Anyway, ziyaret is a good word to import into English as meaning "Muslim pilgrimage center not the Kaaba or the Medina mosque". I would be willing to give it up if someone could come up with a better phrase, however. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:43, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Instead of putting that all in an article about shrines and pilgrimages, how about starting an article called Wahabism and historical preservation?

<dd><s>Comment: Very interesting. Delete philosopher becaue he is not famous or universally known . Keep article on the every single episode of Buffy the Vanpire Slayer, on the other hand!! I'm beginning to get the basic idea around here: the name should be changed perhaps to Populo-pedia or frivolo-pedia..

<dd>Yes, to be clear, I'm not nearly as concerned with keeping Sungsu Kim (or every single academic philosopher) in the Wikipedia, as I am in getting Buffy, the Simpsons and other such popular nonsense off of it. I am fundamnetally an <i>extreme</i> deletionist, on other words. There's far too mcuh crap on here. This problem needs to be addressed. In the context of all this crap, I begin to thing it's not inappropriate to add a vanity page for each of my hundreds of relatives. Until I find out how to delete Buffy, I still say <b>userfy</b> so I can illustarte and discuss some serious deficiencies that I have found in the selection process for the inclusion of articles in the Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 09:09, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I agree (at least in part) with your views on popular culture (I think it's OK to have a concise article on Buffy, but not a whole family of articles on every detail, character and episode), keeping this bio to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a> is not the correct way to go about discussing this change. – <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 17:00, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Is it realy better to delete this and duplicate them all over the place? Further, it DOES merit its own notability as a hadith used in Shi'a-Sunni argumentations and a notable hadith to be included in the list of hadith. Again, <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_1%7E5.html" title="Matthew 1:5">Matthew 1:5</a>. Further, this hadith is also cited by Sunnis, in fact it is a sunni hadith. So you dont put it in any Hadith cited by Shi'a. The whole idea of Hadith cited by Shi'a is pov, implying Sunnis never cite them. In fact, all hadith could go into Hadith cited by Shi'a, Shia cite all Sunni and Shi'a hadith. Zora tried to rename <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hadith.html" title="List of hadith">List of hadith</a> to someting like that, but did not found support for that. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:51, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree. In theory, I see every hadith as notable, though I don't think every hadith should have its own article. Especially with the length of the articles as they are now, with the hadith itself taking up a significant portion of the article space. If it is significant in discussing, it needs to be discuessed in other articles. That is why we have external links, citaions, references, etc. You can link to the hadith and mention any specific commentary in the article and cite it. If it warrants in the future, I suppose an individual article may be created. I think something more formal needs to be organized on hadith, and individual AfD's should not be taken as precedence. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 20:27, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Instead of arguing with people, make the article easier to understand by explaining (in laymans terms) what is a <b>Hadith</b> who is <b>Umar</b> and what is the importance to Islam. I suggest that the articles be merged at first, worked upon by whoever has knowledge of the topic, and then be put back as separte topics when they are ready. Just some constructive criticism please don't bite my head off, it's just when it comes to a topic of Islam, you can not assume that people reading these articles will have ANY clue about even the basics. -<a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oscar Arias</a> 01:57, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> despite bad faith nomination. Looking at an earlier version of the page, there was a citation. In fact there were several citations. If you had a question about the source, the corresponding talk page should have used. However, this article should not exist, nor should other hadith articles. Despite Striver's example of Matthew:5 or whatever verse he keeps flaunting as precedence, I still don't think each individual hadith needs an individual article. Perhaps <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora's</a> suggestion to create a Hadith cited by Shi'a article should be considered and these hadith could be merged their, instead of having thousands of individual articles floating around. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 13:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am kinda starting to see <b>Strivers</b> argument about these hadith articles. I believe that if we can have hundreds of entries for Bible chapters and verses (not to mention hundreds of <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> cruft articles), then <b>we should have ALL the hadith entries as well</b>. (I don't care if it's 10 or 10000 articles, <b>we've already set a precedent with Bible entries</b>) Just for the record, I currently consider myself <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>, I believe that God is unknowable and everything written about ALL religions is pure speculation, but that is strictly my POV. I believe Wikipedia should be NPOV when it comes to these religious topics and should have the teachings of ALL religions (I don't care if it's Christian, Islam, Judiasm, Taoism, Buddhism, Hindu, whatever). So I say bring them ALL the hadith's in if you want, but please make sure that if you do please make sure to keep NPOV if there are different interpretations between Shi'a and Sunni (and other) factions. As I mentioned above about <b>Anglo-Centricism</b> in Wikipedia -- to prevent votes like this from coming up in the future make them understandable by us <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infidels.html" title="Infidels">Infidels</a>. Otherwise someone (like I did initially) will vote to delete articles where they have no "frame of reference" (this is probably what Grenavitar was talking about when he mentioned "layers of articles" a few votes up.

<dd>The Christianity articles are more well developed... they may be at a level where it makes sense to create verses and put them in an understandable context... also, Bible verses don't involve such sectarian struggles that hadith do. So, under that logic I'd probably keep a Qur'an verse if it had information but I'd delete most hadith. (also, where do these names come from?) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More developed is great, lets have it more developed. The arguement "involve such sectarian struggles" only makes the hadith more notable, not less. People dont "struggle" about non-notable stuff. Exactly what about the article lacks context? If you could point it out, i would be happy to fix it, since i cant see what is out of context right now. Further, people dont end up here out of the blue, they have probably cliked through some article to get this deep in, and if nothing more, that should give them <i>some</i> context. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:51, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, it would need to be duplicated in disscusions in <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Uthman%27s_modesty_4228.html" title="Hadith of Uthman's modesty">Hadith of Uthman's modesty</a> and the hadith of Abu Bakrs belief. In short, when a hadith touches many subjects, its better to have give it its own article and have the details covered there, and just linking to the hadith from other articles. For example, the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Umar%27s_speech_of_forbidding_Mut%27ah_b0bc.html" title="Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah">Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah</a> tuches subjects like <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoning.html" title="Stoning">Stoning</a>, Abrogation in the Qur'an, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%27ah_1acf.html" title="Nikah Mut'ah">Nikah Mut'ah</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abbas_d33f.html" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> and so on...

<dd>I have changed my vote to neutral as I do not believe I have enough knowledge of the subject matter to decide where it goes. I still think it should go somewhere else but I believe Striver is correct that there will be duplication no matter which way you cut it. kotepho 21:00, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> despite bad faith nomination. Looking at an earlier version of the page, there was a citation. It was explicitly mentioned under the <b>Reference</b> section. If you had a question about the source, the corresponding talk page should have used. However, this article should not exist, nor should other hadith articles. Despite Striver's example of Matthew:5 or whatever verse he keeps flaunting as precedence, I still don't think each individual hadith needs an individual article. Perhaps <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora's</a> suggestion to create a Hadith cited by Shi'a article should be considered and these hadith could be merged their, instead of having thousands of individual articles floating around. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 13:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, pepsi, do we duplicate it all over the place? What article should it be merged to? Remeber that all the info about the Shi'a and Sunni view of the hadith needs to follow on the merge.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. We're missing a whole layer of articles necessary to make individual hadith articles worthwhile.

<li><b>Massively rewrite and cleanup.</b> Tim@, to be honest this looks like a college project or a first attempt at writing a review article for a journal. It's not original research but it is highly inappropriate for Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not <i>Bioinformatics</i>. Articles here should be intended for a general audience. Ideally you would explain in terms a high schooler or college freshman could understand, 1) what are protein-protein interactions, 2) why it is useful to be able to predict them with a computer, and 3) the general principles involved. The only wikipedia article I have ever seen with 150 references was on <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rathergate.html" title="Rathergate">Rathergate</a>, and that because it is so controversial. You should aim for no more than a dozen, preferably review articles from easy to read journals like <i>Current opinions in ______</i>. You also need to review the Manual of Style and become more familiar with writing wiki-like articles. My recommendation is that you voluntarily withdraw the article and copy it into your user space (see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>.) User pages are a great way to work on a complex article or figure out how to write a wiki article and they are not subject to (most of) the content guidelines of main article space. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:23, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Thatcher131, who didn't vote delete, but I agree with the principles, if that makes sense. Tim, it looks like you have a broad perspective on the literature for a field that isn't covered by Wikipedia well enough. Rather than try to add all your knowledge at once, why don't you start with smaller articles on individual methods? The narrower the topic of an article, the easier it is to avoid original research while tying it together. Once you've built such a foundation, it would be relatively easy to write an article named "Protein-protein interaction prediction" that links to the more specialized methods and draws on only a couple of secondary reviews. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 06:19, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>note:</b> Zargulon the article states that folding docking methods are currently unworkable on a <b>genome wide scale</b> because the best algorithms from CASP are given a month to find one fold. Taking 50,000 months to fold the proteins of a genome and then 2500000000 months for docking (assuming the same time frame for a single prediction) after only 7 days to sequence it is to slow for use.--Tim 02:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not because the CASP experiments give a month that the servers take a month to make a prediction, with the threading techniques a model is built in half an hour to a few hours, this varies with the length of the target sequence and whether homologues are known or not. If there is no known homologues, only <i>ab initio</i> techniques can be used and are restricted to small sequences, although the fragment approach is being developed with promising results. In addition, you are assuming that the genome wide experiment would be done on one machine, whereas this would be a massively parallel work. The servers involved in CASP are often clusters that are able to work on several targets in the same time. The limitations are more from the theoretical point of view, e.g. better potential energy functions, better detection of remote homologues... By the way, I can't find where the article states that folding docking methods are unworkable because of the time used for folding prediction algorithms, there is no mention of CASP either? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 05:48, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am staring at that section of the article, and it does not state what you just said it states. Rather, its implication is that folding and docking <i>will always</i> be unworkable. In fact is so badly written that I cannot begin to suppose what the intended meaning may have been. It also incorrectly categorizes docking and folding as "dynamics methods" - short for molecular dynamics? or dynamic programming? either way it's wrong. Most docking and folding methods do not use either technique. Even if you felt that truly representative literature search was beneath you, how much trouble would it have been to inform yourself by taking a quick look at the Wikipedia articles on protein structure prediction and protein-protein docking? <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 04:19, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also object the wrong use of many terms, for example the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_site.html" title="Active site">active site</a> is certainly not the site of interaction between two proteins. The best we can do is predict the residues that may be involved in interactions, providing that both the structures are known the rest is pure speculations.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless it undergoes <b>major revisions</b> per Blastwizard. The use of references is rather odd. A lot of the papers seem to be completely unrelated, remove every thing that doesn't relate directly to the text (e.g. the first 3 papers listed). Tim, I think the first thing you want to look at is to make specific citations in the text, to references you think support your claims. I might want to have a look at some of the things I think look sketchy, but I don't want to read 30 papers just to edit this page. I think you have to be careful not to confuse docking of experimentally determined structures with docking of proteins without a known structure. I would be highly critical of results from the latter, so this requires good references! Kjaergaard 06:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The author has no clue about the field nor has he a clue about biology.

In addition, looking at the history of the article, it looks like it started as a copy from a book, was somewhat well written and well referenced but obviously written by someone else.

<p>I have no promotional interest in his music. I'm simply a fan who finds his music to be quite impressive at this point. DNB artists that achieve great commercial success and almost a universal acclaim from dnb pundits is a pretty rare thing, and he's been achieving that lately. I tried to be as objective as possible in the description of the music, pointing out some elements that people might not outright like about his music. But once again, I have no promotional connection at all. I see tons of wikipedia artist profiles that are way more in love with the content than this one.</p>
<p>Also, I just edited the "future music" section so it sounds less promotional and more...constructive. hope that helps this a bit.</p>

<p><br />
It's kind of hard to present notability because the media existing to judge an artists notability or notoriety within drum and bass, is usually all web-based. But judging from his record sales within the genre, and judging from the response from followers of the sub-culture on the two main web outlets, dogsonacid.com and breakbeat.co.uk, he is probably the most quick selling, and one of the most respected popular artists within the genre right now. Unfortunately with drum and bass, there arent many mainstream media outlets that I can refer to his notability such as there is within pop music. -Sianspheric</p>

<li>I work at Logos; I don't believe the page was created by anyone here (based on other pages created by this author). While the article is thin now, the Libronix DLS is a platform for digital libraries used by more than 400,000 users and 120 publishers and which has an open API for external programming. There is potential here for more useful and general information than simply links to our web sites. To the best of my knowledge we are not on any blacklists, and would like to know if so. 15 March 2006.</li>

<dd>Your site <b>is</b> currently blacklisted (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>) due to spamming of WP pages. Rewriting the Libronix Digital Library System page with less links to your site, and in a more neutral way, not giving the feeling it's an ad, should be a good idea. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroquant_ee33.html" title="User:Croquant">Croquant</a> 17:42, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is a non-notable minor Australian party. I was going to nominate the article for speedy deletion, but I think that's stretching the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> to their limits. Proposed deletion is a no go because at least someone will probably object to the listing. So here is the AfD reasoning ...</p>
<p>The party appears to get only <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">61 google hits</a>, but not counting repeated hits the party only gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22secular+party+of+Australia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">21 google hits</a>, many of which are either wikipedia-related or blogs. It cannot have participated in any major elections because of its age, but I could only find <a href="http://theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18213274%255E12272,00.html" class="external text" title="http://theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18213274%255E12272,00.html" rel="nofollow">one minor media mention</a>, where it appeared to conduct a single survey. The party is far from notable now, and appears not to have made an impact on the Australian political scene. I sympathise with many of its views, but I believe it does not deserve a wikipedia article ... yet. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 11:10, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that advertisements for the party's policies appeared in Prime Time last year offers it some significance to escape deletion <a href="http://aliasfrequencies.org/son/2005/05/13/dont-let-the-church-govern-australia/" class="external autonumber" title="http://aliasfrequencies.org/son/2005/05/13/dont-let-the-church-govern-australia/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELefty_on_campus_b4f2.html" title="User:Lefty on campus">Lefty on campus</a> 08:12, 12 March 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have recently been asked to support this party and I do not. While I support its views, I think these have to be worked through with the larger parties. I do not have an axe to grind here. This is a very new Party. The article is clear and concise. Lets give it a chance. If the Party turns out to be a dud, then we can delete it later. Meanwhile, some people might want to learn something about it and this article does that. I suspect it will get more Google hits as the year progresses but whether it will grow as a Party I do not know. It might well be a notable Party by the end of the year. Why waste the effort that someone has put into this article? --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:23, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I vote to keep because a politicial party is as much a state of mind as it is a legal entity. In Australia, in order to become a political party recognised under law, you have to jump through many hoops but that even if not recognised by law that doesn't make them any less of a political party under a democracy. Anyone can set up a party, there is just a system of registration available to those who wish to seek it. If they do, they get benefits like money for election funding and their party name can be printed along side their candidates name. Are they notable enough&#160;? That's where Xtra's point comes in probably, they may be a very lame wing of the Humanist Society in NSW but they are probably inherently notable. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 00:58, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Counting the 2 Deletes and Merges with the Deletes, that come to approximately 70percent in favor of deletion. I find the arguments for Deletion very convincing. The article is not well cited, and checking of what citations do exist by others has raised questions of the credibility of the sources cited.

<dd>Er, sorry, but I took a look at the websites that are linked to as "sources". And let me tell you, I don't think it's a good sign if <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/isaiah_mecca.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-christianity.com/isaiah_mecca.htm" rel="nofollow">one source</a> chosen at random begins: "The following is an email I received from brother Silent Wisdom" and then rambles on in terrible English about something that, while not quite clear, consists largely of quotes from the Bible and the Qur'an trying to show how they connect. Or <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.org/predict.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-christianity.org/predict.htm" rel="nofollow">another</a> whose title is, in what I assume is <i>150 point size type</i>, "The lie of the crucifixion!". Indeed, all "sources" that are not Bible verse links go to <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/ac.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-christianity.com/ac.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, which at first glance is one individual's ranting website about how the Bible is supposed to prove that Islam is the true religion.</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong: I am completely in favor of having an article on how Islam views Christianity, or on why Muslims think the Bible proves that Islam is the true religion.

<li><b>Comment</b> The very title "Islam in the Bible" to which some editors have proposed to rename the article back is horribly POV, as it reflects the Muslim POV by stating as fact that there is indeed some Islam in the Bible. This view is ridiculous for any Jewish, Christian, or secular scholar, who all believe that Islam emerged only in the 7th century, much later than the Bible assumed its current shape.

<li>Exactly.

<dd>Yes, but the problem with the title is that it presents an existing POV without attribtuion. Had it been called "Islamic view of the Bible", the would be no problem about it. But hey, we already have an article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_view_of_the_Bible_674f.html" title="Islamic view of the Bible">Islamic view of the Bible</a>, why have two?

<dd>How is it pov? The aritcle name does not say there IS Islam in the Bible. It could just as well be read "Islam [is not] in the bible" as well as "Islam [is] In the Bible".--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:55, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What i mean is that it does not state that Islam is in the bible. Its like talking about "cookies in the jar", it is a valid frase even if the jar is empty. One could say there are cookies in it, and a critique could counter that there are no cookies in it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:00, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think "cookies in the jar" would in fact mean cookies are in the jar (any grammarians here?). Anyway, I'm not sure it's a good analogy, because a jar (particularly a cookie jar) would be expected to have cookies in it at times, whereas the claim that islam is in the bible is a controversial one. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 00:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Does Wikipedia have a special policy concerning paedophilia offenders? Because if there is none this seems an overwhelmingly non-notable criminal (per google). Does Wikipedia treat sex offenders differently from, say, crack dealers? (Assuming otherwise non-famous non-serial-type one-time criminals which this seems to be.) <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 13:07, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Being a paedophile doesn't establish notability. Wikipedia is not newspaper column about criminality. There are no special policies about paedophilie offenders but common sense says it is not worth of being encyclopedia topic. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 13:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. With due respect, Pavel, the article does not cite Choat's paedophilia as the reason for her notability. A detailed explanation of the notability of her case is provided in the concluding paragraph. It is her case even more than the woman herself which is notable. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 23:43, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the original author of the article. I have now provided references for this article - as a busy student, this was simply a work in progress (as is the case with many Wikipedia articles, often unreferenced and often with significantly less content than this one). The concluding paragraph carefully provides reasons for the notability of this subject and it is surely tortuous to suggest that this has not been established. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a> guidelines include the criterion: "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". One might argue about the level of notability / notoriety established, but this case is significant within the specific genre to which it belongs within Australian criminal law and is cited in the consideration of other such cases. This subject is an increasingly frequent matter being dealt with by courts in US and Australian jurisdictions particularly, and certain trends are emerging of which this case forms a significant part. Any person studying the emergence of female paedophilia in Australian schools would welcome this and similar articles as providing a reliable source of information. The fact that the article provides few Google hits is explained by the fact that the case occurred at a time when online reportage was not extensive. This fact might also be used to support the inclusion of this article in Wikipedia, since it will provide the only significant online resource about this case. The lack of hits on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au" rel="nofollow">AustLii</a> is explained by the fact that AustLii only reports on (Australian) High Court, state Supreme Court and Federal Court cases, not cases dealt with by lower level courts in state jurisdictions. I request that the deletion tag on this article please be removed. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 22:07, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In my opinion your referencing (a short database entry and a hardcopy article) is not sufficient for an article which makes serious allegations about a living person. I still do not believe notability has been established per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As an Australian myself, I do not believe this person is renowned or notorious. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 22:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Under the heading 'People still alive', <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". This case was published as the headline article on the front page of the state newspaper of the state (Queensland) in which it occurred, the article being of sufficient length that it was continued on an inside page. The fact that the case does not register ongoing notoriety does not detract from the fact that it was notorious at the time it occurred and that it has ongoing significance within the genre of such cases. I am glad that you state that "in [your] opinion" the referencing is not sufficient, because a reading of the newspaper article in question will provide ample evidence of the facts to which I have referred. That is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact for anyone who will go to the trouble of accessing and reading the article, which could be done at any state or university library in Australia. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 22:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Referencing to print and microform sources is still an established practice in academia, research and writing, despite the increasing prevalence of online sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am not saying that only online sources can be used. I'm suggesting that if this woman is a notable or notorious criminal, there would be some online references to her. I have general concerns about the fact you appear to think <s>tacking</s> adding a hardcopy article and a database entry at the end of the article is sufficient referencing for an article which is potentially defamatory. Also, the photo appears to be identical to the image on <a href="http://mako.org.au/images/choat.jpg" class="external text" title="http://mako.org.au/images/choat.jpg" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> (it even appears to have the same creases). This makes me wonder what is going on. If you are from Mako and you did indeed scan that image and make that entry, Mako should be discounted as a reference for the purpose of this discussion. If you are not from Mako and you did not scan the image, you should correct your "self-scanned" copyright declaration. Regardless, I do not feel comfortable with you hanging this article on one single newspaper article. This is my final comment on this page. I shall leave it in the trustworthy hands of the AfD people. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 23:39, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel that your use of the term 'tacking' in regard to my reference is a slight to my skills as a writer, and do not appreciate it. The use of the neutral term 'adding' would be preferable. The article would only be defamatory if it were not based on any verifiable sources, so there is no concern there. In regard to the photo: I am indeed definitely not 'from' Mako, nor do I have any connection with or interest in that organization. I would suggest that the similarity in the images is due to their having scanned it from the same microform source as I did, albeit no doubt a different copy of the microform. Thank you for your interest in my articles, and for conducting a (generally) civil discussion. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 23:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you have a reference for Jimbo's comments (who's Jimbo, by the way? pardon my ignorance, but I'm not yet on first-name terms with (presumably) administrators here. Can you reference him too please?) Now, as to the newspaper article, I don't 'have' the article, it exists, free for all to access, in probably 300+ libraries in Australia and probably dozens of others around the world. All of the material facts in this article are drawn from the newspaper article, so there is nothing in Wikipedia which has not already been said elsewhere. In regard to conclusions drawn, these are only factual extrapolations from the facts of the case, and do not make value judgments about the individual concerned, so there is no basis for any defamation action. If other evidence was available, I would have cited that too. I would observe, by the way, that <i>The Courier-Mail</i> seems to be a newspaper which withdraws its online articles much earlier than most newspapers - you will probably find that some of thie links where it is cited for other articles are already dead - hence my desire to add print references as well, in the long term. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 22:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are a lot of 'me too' notes here, but nothing that I have not fully dealt with in my substantive comments. People who are saying more are still leaving comments about matters which I have already fully replied to. I hope this isn't what passes for serious discussion on Wikipedia! In further reply to one or two items raised: (1) The comment by <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunk_641f.html" title="User:Thunk">Thunk</a> that "there were plenty of online sources by then" is very general and does not consider, for example, what was the state of online newspaper services in Queensland at that time? (2) The fact that she "is...not well known in Australia" presumably means that <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> has not heard of her; this would be true of many, many Wikipedia articles of a specialist nature, while not addressing the fact that, for those who are interested in the field concerned, this case is significant. (3) The sentiment that "she should be left free to live the rest of her life", while a fine idea on a human level, is not really an argument foror against deletion of this article; that logic could be applied to any criminal, and also fails to consider the fact that her victim would no doubt have liked to be left free to get on with his life, but is unlikely to forget these events. <font color="red">An additional extension of some of my earlier observations, also, would ask editors to consider the basic function of Wikipedia in this way: if lack of numerous online references to a subject be considered reason for deletion of an article, where does this leave Wikipedia as a repository of unique online knowledge as opposed to simply a convenient clearing house for organizing information which is already online?</font> --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 04:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Surely where an article is the product of serious research and writing and addresses a genuine subject, inclusion rather than exclusion is justified. I also further note that some of the Wikipedians voting for deletion seem to be prominent advocates of deletion of many articles, and I am troubled that people would want to go around destroying the legitimate work of others. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 13:30, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your definition of serious research therefore requires quantity rather than quality? That, in fact, seems to be the main thrust of your original basis for listing this article for deletion - that there wasn't enough of various things, rather than looking at the quality of what was there. My own view on life leads me to look at how full the cup is, rather than how empty, and this of course leads me to be an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:Inclusionism">Inclusionist</a> rather than a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">Deletionist</a>. There are really two issues going on here, and I think they need to be kept separate: (1) the quality (or quantity?) of referencing, verifiability etc; and (2) the notability / worthiness of the subject for inclusion no matter what the nature of the referencing. I have addressed both of these above, and won't labour the point further. Sarah Ewart, I don't see that your comment here adds anything to what you have already said, does it? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, verifiability seems to require, by this standard, a certain quantity of sources without much regard for the quality of the sources. Remoteness in time is an adequate explanation for the comparative dearth of material on Choat compared with Ellis; historians constantly face this issue, and historical writing may be validly based upon a single source provided the source is comparatively reliable. The front page of the Queensland state newspaper would seem to be as reliable a source as could be under the circumstances, save possibly access to court papers which, given the nature of the case, are unlikely to be publicly available. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would prefer to have the separate articles remain and to eventually tie them together with a more general article; but I do not live on Wikipedia, and this would be something which would happen over a period of time. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I appreciate the interest and support of those Wikipedians and admins who see merit in this article. I want to stress that I have not contacted any of the people who have responded seeking their support, and genuinely appreciate the encouragement no matter the outcome. I would like to observe, by way of probably fairly final comment since the period for submission on this AfD is nearly over, that I do see the debate over this article as somewhat symptomatic of the larger debate in Wikipedia between inclusionists and deletionists. I wish there was not such a debate, to be quite honest. I would rather have invested the time spent on this page in more positive efforts actually writing or revising articles. The difficulty I have here is that, for inclusionists, we can spend hours on writing something only to have it destroyed in a moment; whereas deletionists will have no such concerns, since presumably they will stick so strictly to a narrower interpretation of what should be included that they will never chance to write something about a more obscure topic. (When I use the term 'more obscure', I do not mean 'less worthy'; it is simply the case that while, for example, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> will attract widespread interest, <a href="../../../h/a/_/Ha_Ri-su_68de.html" title="Ha Ri-su">Ha Ri-su</a> will be of interest to but a few, particularly in the English-speaking world). Can I be really provocative, discover if deletionists have a sense of humour about their viewpoint, and suggest that deletionism is actually a form of legitimized <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>? In case someone takes too much exception to this comment, I hasten to state the obvious, that I am speaking somehwat tongue-in-cheek there - and yet my feelings, as opposed to my intellect, resonate with my suggestion. The beauty of Wikipedia, unlike print encyclopaedias, is that we are not constrained by the physical size of the published work, and this site can continue to grow to encompass the full range of human endeavours, accomplishments, deeds and misdeeds as well as every feature of the universe in which we live. I therefore would appeal to those inclined to delete the works of others to re-think and to adopt a policy of "live and let live", and to delete only patent nonsense and material which is clearly false.</li>

<dl>
<dd>In regard to this present article, I would suggest that it has found a significant readership among those researching more recent such cases which have featured in news reports, and if allowed to remain as part of a small but growing project on this topic, it will continue to do so. By nature, the subject of female teachers dealing with their students in the way that this lady and others like her have done has an interest, indeed perhaps a fascination in some cases, for many members of the community. Readers approaching Wikipedia for information on this subject will find an increasingly comprehensive treatment, and as on so many topics, Wikipedia will be the first online authority, gathering information from a range of print and electronic sources and synthesising it in one location. <font color="red">I would suggest that a deletionist approach will only render more distant the day when online researchers perhaps no longer make Google their first avenue of investigation, but rather turn straight to Wikipedia. Is this not what we would want for this amazing online resource?

Therefore you can't just cut and paste 90% of the content to a new article and leave 10% with the history of the other 90%. That's against the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html#How_to_rename_a_page" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">Wikipedia:Merging_and_moving_pages#How_to_rename_a_page</a>, where it says "Do not move or rename a page by copying/pasting its content, because doing so destroys the edit history". <a href="../../../n/f/h/User%7ENFH_d937.html" title="User:NFH">NFH</a> 22:39, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know if this page should have been put up for AfD.

I was going to just redirect this page to that page but now that it's in AfD maybe I shouldn't.

<li>well, if it goes to Wiktionary, Wikipedia will lose nothing in information, because it will still be in a sister project. It will also lose a little of the risk of dozens, hundreds, thousands of other slang terms being listed in Wikipedia - which is really a gain. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...

<p><b>Delete or Merge</b> This is a POV fork off the main <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro_Baptist_Church</a> article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Having considered this a bit, I think CHIN radio should be kept as the main article, the content of the other two articles should be merged into it, and the AM and FM articles should be made into redirects. Since CHIN AM and CHIN FM are both part of the same company, both broadcast multilingual programming in Toronto, I see no real point in multiple articles.--<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 16:34, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anyone who has a familiarity with 1970's text adventure games would, of course, spot the obvious combination of the two magic words "xyzzy" and "plugh", and have no problem spelling them. It is shocking and sad that the youth of today are so out of touch. You kids today, with your playstations and your "walkman" radios and your "MTV". Why, in my day, if you wanted to edit an encylopedia, you walked 10 miles uphill to the library, got out your quill pen and bottle of ink... --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 03:03, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete. This article was supposed to be about Winfield Taylor Durbin, governor of Indiana from 1901-1905.

<p><b>Reply from Article's Author:</b> The article has been edited so it's quite clear that it's no longer any more of an advertisement than any other organisation's page (ie: contains 1-2 links at the base). Google suggests different spelling, because "sblnet" is not a real English word - any idiot would actually realise thats not a real word by itself; but google, wikipedia or msn are not "real words" either; so I'd say, based on that - there's no longer any reason for deletion; oh, unless my apparent vanity counts. <i>(user: Sblnet)</i></p>

<dd>The alexa rank is low. So it's a NN site, and therefore not worthy of a Wiki entry.

<li><b>Comment</b>-- After carefully re-reading the articles in question it becomes clear that there IS NO verfiable content in these articles whatsoever. Too many "weasly words" (Appears to, is likely that, probably, seems, etc) The only (possibly verifiable) thing these articles contain <b>are descriptions of the pictures</b> contained within the articles themselves. It would appear that all the information in these three articles was obtained from watching some sort of movie trailer, and perhaps speculative discussions on fan sites. <a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oarias</a> 01:26, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well they are confirmed pokemon so just keep them and what is the point on deleting them that is like deleting mew or pikachu it is pointless seeing as they are on games already and also in a few months they are going to have to be put back on there seeing how pokemon diamond and pearl are coming out. and Oarias if you dont like the new pokemon just dont buy the game and stop complaining about them on wikipedia for christs sake</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> He lived and died well before the Internet, and being notable in another culture doesn't prevent en.wiki from writing about him.

<li><b>Keep.</b> In reply to nominator, the Yankees occupy a special place in sport. Basically, for about 40+ years (1920-1964) and especially in the 50s through mid-60s they were very dominant, more so than the Celtics or Maple Leafs or Packers or whatever, such that for two generations of fans, <i>any</i> contending AL team could assume that they would have to go through the Yankees to win. Thus, even in the early season, a win against the Yankees counted "double" - a win for you, and a loss for the team you would almost certainly be fighting for the pennant at the end of the season, if you ever got that far. This concept was commonly understood, and players that seemed to play well or be lucky against the Yankees were considered especially valuable. I recall Frank Lary in particular in that regard, and his nickname was indeed "The Yankee Killer". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:28, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I attached a {{prod}} tag, and this was removed with the comment "reverted" so I've brought it to AfD. Specifically: the article fails to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. It does not establish, or provide evidence for, its subject's significance. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a collection of genealogical information. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 22:34, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (obviously) meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines and some more. He is a notable professor of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbiology.html" title="Microbiology">microbiology</a>, now retired, but it is easily verifiable. It's not as if we have an article on every bloody soap star that's had 5 minutes on Hollyoaks, oh hang on, we do. Secondly, you can be important genealogically; that guideline is to stop you writing about your nobody great-great-grandmother, but if you have lots of famous relatives you fit into a jigsaw. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 22:58, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, on your first point: the article provides no evidence to substantiate his significance, it just says he is a "British bacteriologist". If there were some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">evidence</a> of his significance or notability included in the article I wouldn't have brought this AfD.

<p>Michael Lohan's inclusion in this encyclopedia is not necessary. He broke the law, but he is hoping to change. Having an article about him is not helping and is only and unfriendly reminder of his difficult past with both the law and his family. Also, if he weren't <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>'s father, he would be forgettable, and only gets the little tabloid coverage he gets because of his daughter's status as a star.

<dd>I agree. Or maybe not even a redirect. Just delete it! A redirect seems pointless. How many sites give Michael his own page? None. Except Michael II because he was in a movie. Is Michael I even worthy of it? Why even keep a page if all it's going to do is redirect to another page that has one or two sentences about him? It seems like a waste of site space to me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephe1987_e945.html" title="User:Stephe1987">Stephe1987</a> 02:52, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A redirect takes up virtually no space—literally, "#REDIRECT [[Lindsay Lohan]]" is all. Perhaps we should check with an admin to see how often the page is read. If it's called up even a few times, the redirect would be the way to go. If not, then a straight delete would be warranted. On the other hand, the redirect also would kill a second bird—anyone looking for her brother also would look for "Michael Lohan" as he is not known or credited anywhere as "Michael Lohan II".&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioKirk_a5db.html" title="User:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Radio</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioKirk_8f39.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: #161;">Kirk</span></a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioKirk_dc7c.html" title="User talk:RadioKirk"><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #161;">talk to me</span></a> 03:54, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sure this will be controversial but the categories <i>Defunct companies of the United States</i> and <i>Defunct retail companies</i> bother me. They seem to invite non-notable entries - what are the boundaries of this project?</p>

<li><b>comment</b> - first, I really like the <i>Defunct</i> categories. Failed businesses often have a fascinating history (often of excess), and those categories are great shortcuts. Second, I'm not sure how to apply <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> to a <i>former</i> company, excepting the publications part. This company seemed interesting (take a look at that globe "hook" in the photo that someone tried to inline), but I don't see anything else notable about it and finding notability might be difficult since it is 20 years in the grave. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru">Kuru</a> (<a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuru_0d36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuru">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

This song doesn't have the benefit of such an association. It appears on no album and has never charted. The Google results above (85,000 hits) are misleading, as most of those links refer to food, rather than to this song. Searching "Ice cream and cake" "buckwheat boys" returns only 518 hits, nearly all of which are lyric databases.
