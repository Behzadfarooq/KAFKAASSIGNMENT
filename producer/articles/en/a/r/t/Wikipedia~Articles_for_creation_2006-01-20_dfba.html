<p>This story follows the adventures of the fictional character Homer Winthrop during his days in the infamous Dillinger gang. Homer narrates the story, his purpose in the telling to explain how John Dillinger got the suspicious scar dividing his mustache, noticed after his death. The narrative, set in the 1930s, starts with Homer, John, and Jack Hamilton (yet another fictional character) trying to escape the police after a bank robbery. During the ensuing car chase, Jack Hamilton is hit by a stray bullet, but the gang is not willing to stop to give Jack medical attention. The gang goes temporarily into hiding, Jack getting sicker and sicker without the treatment of a doctor. During Jack's last hours, John and Homer attempt to cheer him up; Homer by lasooing flies and John by walking on his hands. During John's act, his pistol falls from his belt; striking the floor and inadevertenly going off. The bullet barely skims John's face, leaving a skin-deep cut (the scar dividing his mustache) and, while his friends are checking to see if he is okay, Jack dies.</p>

<p>Lincoln Pius X High School is the central Catholic High School in Lincoln, Nebraska and the Diocese of Lincoln. It was founded October 1, 1956 by Bishop Louis B. Kucera. The school took Saint Pius X's motto, "Restore All Things In Christ" as it's guiding mission. In October of 2006, the school will be celebrating it's 50th anniversary of existance. It's current Superintendent is Father Michael Morin. Tom Seib is the current Principal.</p>
<p>Lincoln Pius X's mascot is the Thunderbolts. The school colors are green and gold.</p>
<p>Recently, the school administration has been criticized by it's student body about new changes to the rules. Some of these rule changes include shorter passing periods, enforcing the purchase of banded polo shirts, and banning senior pictures from the yearbook shot by an outside professional photographer. Suggestions for new rules include removing an off period for seniors and hair length for male students.</p>

A reach truck is a special type of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forklift_truck.html" title="Forklift truck">forklift truck</a>, in which the <i>mast</i> holding the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forks.html" title="Forks">forks</a> can be pushed away from the driver's compartment by means of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulics.html" title="Hydraulics">hydraulics</a>. A reach truck is, as opposed to a counter-balanced forklift truck (see <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forklift_truck.html" title="Forklift truck">forklift truck</a></i>)), capable of supporting greater loads between its supporting <i>legs</i>.</p>
<p>When operating with the mast extended, the reach truck becomes a counter-balanced forklift and operates in much the same way.</p>
<p>The typical reach truck is capable of supporting the load on its supporting <i>legs</i>, with the mast in neutral position while travelling from one location to another.</p>
<p>With warehouse floor being expensive, reach trucks are especially suited for tight aisles, since the forks need not extend beyond the trucks footprint.</p>

Multigenic traits, also known as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygenic_traits.html" title="Polygenic traits">polygenic traits</a>, are traits that are influenced by several genes. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">Natural selection</a> shapes populations affected by phenotypes that are controlled by one or more genes. Height is one example of a multigenic trait. The influence of a certain trait is affected by the allele frequency. Polygenic traits are measured by measuring the traits in a population. If all of the phenotypes are graphed, a hill shaped curve will form, called a normal distribution.</p>

Lottie Williams is on record as the first and only (as of January 2006) person ever to be hit by space debris created by humans. While walking in a park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on January 22, 1997 at 3:30 am, she noticed a light in the sky that she said looked like a meteor. Minutes later, Williams was hit in the shoulder by a 6-inch blackened metal object that was later confirmed to be part of the fuel tank of a Delta II rocket which had launched an Air Force satellite in 1996.</p>

<p>Born <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, the Hon. Walter FitzUryan Rice married Margaret Villiers, daughter of the 7th Earl of Jersey on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>. Their home coming to Dynevor Castle, Llandeilo (the house, now under National Trust guardianship has reverted to its original name of Newton House) on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, was described by the Carmarthen Journal's special correspondent as 'royal.'</p>
<p>The Hon. Walter FitzUryan Rice followed his anscestors in pursuing a public career, serving as assistant private secretary to Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State for India, and then occupying a similar office to Lord Selborne, First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1910, he was elected Conservative MP for the Brighton East Division. He was elected a second time in 1911, only to have to surrender the seat the same year when the death of his father raised him to the peerage as the 7th Baron Dynevor.</p>
<p>From 1911 to 1914, Lord Dynevor served as President of the West Wales Federation of the Conservative Party, becoming President of the South Wales Federation after re-organisation in 1914. He would occupy this office until increasing deafness forced him to surrender this office in 1938. A major donor to the Conservative Party, Lord Dynevor's generosity was crucial to the healthy existence of the Carmarthen Conservatives in the inter-war years, often digging into his pockets to get the party out of trouble.</p>
<p>An active member of the House of Lords, Lord Dynevor functioned as Carmarthenshire's Conservative representative.He served on numerous committees in the Lords and saw Ministerial service in the Ministry of Munitions during the Great War. Lord Dynevor was involved in the Speaker's Conference on Devolution in the aftermath of the Great War. He does not appear to have favoured the draft Bill for 'Home Rule all Round,' just as he was vehemently opposed to Home Rule for Ireland.</p>
<p>In local government, Lord Dynevor was a member of the Landeilo Fawr Rural District Council and the Llanfeisant Parish Council, as well as a member of the local Board of Poor Law Guardians. He stood for the Carmarthenshire County Council as an Independent in 1919.</p>
<p>In 1916 Lord Dynevor obtained Royal Warrant to adopt the surname Rhys in place of Rice, thus returning the family name to what it had been before anglicised in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Lord Dynevor died on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>. His son, Charles Arthur Uryan Rhys inherited the title and estates.</p>
<p>As an interesting footnote, in 1952, Dr. D.J. Davies of Plaid Cymru suggested that Lord Dynevor should be made King of an Independent Wales.</p>

<p>While searching the internet I was trying to find a cool webcomic new and a more violant than the others, my friend Lauren had a site made by a company called Green Gizmo, and by some strange coincidence, the webcomic is called <a href="http://www.gx3r.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gx3r.com" rel="nofollow">gx3r.com</a> (Green Gizmo Game Reviews- (odd since they don't have reviews yet..). They've got some funny stuff and unlike other webcomic sites, this one has 2 active comics done by 2 seperate artists and also has art by the people who work there and for people who want to submit stuff! The site looks like it's only getting off the ground (and judging by the dates on the front page). So yeah I just felt that the word should be spread about this sit that's a good alternative to <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com" class="external text" title="http://www.penny-arcade.com" rel="nofollow">Penny Arcade</a> and <a href="http://www.vgcats.com" class="external text" title="http://www.vgcats.com" rel="nofollow">VG Cats</a>.</p>

<p>Rowe Street is one of the premier streets in Melbourne. It stretches from Alfred Crescent to Rushall Crescent, and is crossed by Delbridge street and Michael street. Almost all of it is protected as it is located in North Fitzroy, one of the oldest suburbs in Melbourne. It also extends from the notable Edinburgh Gardens.</p>
<p>It is located near such notable streets as Queens Parade, Smith Street and Brunswick Street. It is also located near the Edinburgh Gardens, famous for Brunswick Street Oval, the home of the now disbanded AFL/VFL club the Fitzroy Lions.</p>
<p>Rowe Street could date back as far as the 1830s, as it is located in Fitzroy (Melbourne's oldest suburb), which was founded with the arrival of John Batman, the Henty family, John Pascoe Fawkner and Thomas Mitchell in Victoria between 1834 and 1836.</p>

<p>Tom Raskin (b. 1972, a rising young British Tenor, was born in Bath, and began his musical education in the classic English choral tradition, first as a chorister at Bath Abbey then at Winchester Cathedral. After a music scholarship to Clifton College and a diploma from Napier Polytechnic of Edinburgh he went up to read music at New College, Oxford as an Academical Clerk. From there he sang briefly at the London Oratory before becoming a Lay Vicar at Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Having survived the controversy of the Martin Neary deposition he decided to fulfil his ambition of singing more Opera, so embarked once more on study at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester with Anthony Roden.</p>
<p>Since graduating in 2001 he has built up a career specialising in high-lying tenor roles in Rossini, evangelising the Bach Passions, and the Mozart canon.</p>
<p>He is represented by Neil Dalrymple of Music International Neil@musicint.co.uk</p>

<p>Bobakins is a Cat. A very famous cat. One day bobakins decided to go to the bathroom in the basement and decided he was going to wake up the family. So He meowed really loud and woke everyone up to open the door for him. If you scare him is back arches up and he looked like a holloween cat. His face is cute and trianglure. He is an amazing Bobakins. His real name is Pumpkin but Pumpkin tansformed into Bobakins...somehow. He is now under an adult tittle since my little bobakins grew up and became Mr. Bobakins or his work name Sir Bobakins. He also goes by Sir Bob Atkins, but less freequently. Thank you for visiting the bobakins page.</p>

<p>I would like to see an article concerning the being named Constant Drachenfels from the Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play Universe. I would like to know about his true nature, origins, crimes, etc.... His relationship to the Warhammer 40,000 Universe and the Dark Future Universe. Is there any speculation about him being a lost Primarch from 40,000? or something similar?</p>

<p>Psyco Gundam Mk.III made it's first American appearance in Gundam Battle Assault as a mini-boss with a pilot by the name of Valdor Farkill from Gundam Wing. The Pilot of Psyco Mk.III was changed in Gundam Battle Assault 2 to Ulube from Mobile Fighter G Gundam. Also, this suit has never been in any gundam series, and probably never will be.</p>
<p>As for the description of the Mk.III: it stands about twice as large as a normal gundam and prefers to kick and body slam the enemy into submission. Three shoulder mounted guns are located on either arm, and it carries a very long beam saber that cannot be blocked. Lastly, the Psyco Mk.III's special attack is a barrage of 12 laser beam shots from various locations on it's body, (legs, chest)</p>

Kelly Jane Evelyn Cook (1965-1981) was a resident of the village of Standard in southern Alberta, Canada. She was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Marion Cook. She moved with her family to Standard when she was a young girl and grew up in the village. She was a good student at school and a member of the local figure skating club. As a teenager, she frequently babysat the young children of families living in and around Standard.</p>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, April 22, 1981, Kelly, who was then a 15-year old Grade 10 student at the local school, received a telephone call at her home from a man who identified himself as Bill Christensen. He asked her if she could babysit for him that evening. Although she did not know who he was, she agreed to do so, and arrangements were made for the man to pick up Kelly at her home at 8:30 that evening, whereupon he would drive her to his house so she could babysit. As crime of any sort was almost unheard of in Standard at the time, neither Kelly nor her parents were apprehensive about this mysterious man. However, Kelly did ask a number of students at school that day if they knew of a man named Bill Christensen, but nobody knew who he was.</p>
<p>At 8:30 that evening, a light-colored North American car pulled up in front of Kelly's house. The driver did not come to the house's front door but chose instead to remain in his car. Kelly left the house and climbed into the car's front passenger seat, while her mother Marion watched through the living room window. By 9:30 p.m., when Kelly had not called home, her mother grew worried, as Kelly had been instructed to always phone her parents once she arrived at a residence to commence a babysitting job. Her mother placed phone calls to Kelly's friends and other townsfolk, but nobody knew where the teenager was on that particular evening. By midnight, her frightened parents called the RCMP to report their daughter missing.</p>
<p>Although a massive local search was launched in the following days, hardly any clues turned up. The owner of a service station just outside Standard remembered listening to a man use the station's phone on the morning of April 22 to ask a girl if she would babysit for him that evening. The service station owner gave a physical description of the man as being white, about 5'10", with a heavyset build. In addition, at 10:00 p.m. on April 22, a telephone operator received a call that was placed from a pay phone booth near the Town of Hussar, about 25 kilometers away from Standard. A girl screamed into the phone's mouthpiece before being cut off. Police say it was very likely that the caller was Kelly Cook.</p>
<p>On June 28, 1981, Kelly's fully-clothed and badly decomposed body was discovered in the Chin Lakes Reservoir east of Lethbridge, Alberta. Her body had been bound with rope and weighted down with heavy blocks. The body was discovered because an increased use for irrigation water over the past several weeks had caused the level of the reservoir to drop, exposing the corpse. As the body was so badly decomposed, police speculated that Kelly was killed shortly after being abducted.</p>
<p>Kelly's abduction and subsequent murder horrified the residents of Standard and made headlines across Canada. The brazen boldness of her killer, who actually picked up his victim at her house while her mother watched through the window, made the crime very different from most other abduction and murder cases. The killer also took a number of risks, as his car's license plate number could easily have been seen by witnesses on at least several occasions. However, despite a massive RCMP investigation, the case is still unsolved as of January 2006.</p>
<p>Kelly was probably not the killer's intended victim. In March 1981, a picture appeared in a local newspaper of a girl who was a member of the figure skating club. A man shortly afterward phoned the school principal and requested information on this girl. Although his request for information was refused, the man nevertheless tracked down the girl's home telephone number. On April 18, 1981, this girl received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as Bill Christensen, who asked her if she could babysit for him that evening. She replied that she could not and proceeded to give him Kelly Cook's name and phone number, recommending that he contact Kelly to see if she was available to babysit.</p>
<p>Kelly's body rests in the small Standard cemetery. Her parents still hold out hope that her killer will be brought to justice.</p>

<p>rageaholism is when you have a need to be agressive. Like acholisim it is a diasese and hard to control. it can also be called over agressiveness. If you think you might have it then you should go to a "shrink". please before you hurt your loved ones.It is as if you are addicted to madness. maybe from listning to angry music or bad games. Symptoms are loving violence acting out and being grumpy all the time. If you wish to go "postal" please dont and get a stress ball.</p>

<p>Violence and looting in Rochester spanned a period of approximately sixty hours, resulting in four deaths, at least 350 injuries, over 800 arrests, and property damage totalling more than a million dollars. The National Guard was called in to keep the peace. Dubbed"'smugtown" in the 1950s because of the comfort and complacency borne of the economic prosperity and amicable labor-management relations fostered by the Eastman Kodak Company and other large, successful, high-tech corporations, the riots represented a profound blow to Rochester's positive self-image. As the flames of discontent were replaced by the glare of the media spotlight, black and white Rochester residents were forced to reflect--from different perspectives and with different conclusions--on the causes and meanings of this devastating event.</p>
<p>The "riot" was precipitated by the arrest of an allegedly drunk and disorderly African- American man at a Joseph Avenue street dance. But even in its immediate aftermath, many looked to underlying social and environmental conditions to explain the events that followed. These conditions were analagous to those that existed in many Northern cities. They included a large and rapid influx of African-Americans from the South, the de-facto segregation of black arrivals in specific areas of the residential urban core, a failure to extend economic opportunities from white to black residents, the physical decay of black neighborhoods due to poverty and inadequate services, the routine exploitation of African-American tenants by white landlords, the neglect and persecution of blacks at the hands of an overwhelmingly white police force, inequities in educational instruction and facilities, and the inability of African-Americans to redress grievances through legitimate political channels. Rochester's was one of a trio of 'riots' in the summer of 1964. Together, they inaugurated the "long hot summers" of racial strife that marked the mid and late sixties. It is to the origins, effects, and implications of such events that the items in this collection ultimately speak.</p>

<p><b>Fact file</b> Insert non-formatted text here Otago United FC Player/Coach: Terry Phelan Assitant Coach: Malcolm Fleming Captain: Terry Boylan Imports: Lutz Pfanistiel (Goalkeeper, Germany) Ulikks Kottri (Midfielder, Albainia) Terry Phelan (Defender/coach, Ireland) Home ground: Caledonian Ground Reserve ground: Tahuna Park</p>
<p>Otago United was formed in 2004 to compete in the New Zealand Football Championship (NZFC). Based in Dunedin, Otago United, the sole representative from Federation seven, is one of eight teams competing in the NZFC. Otago United has the support of all the clubs in Federation 7 (Timaru To Invercargill)</p>
<p>The Nzfc was formed in 2004 as a replacement Competition for the Southern Trust National Soccer League (NSL). This was a club based league and the standard of Soccer was low and it was not working. (There was only one Dunedin club in the NSL. That was Dunedin Technical)</p>
<p>There had been many attempts to have a joint team from Otago in the NSL but there was too much club rivlary in Otago. Caversham AFC were the only Dunedin Club that wanted to go alone. (Because of NZ Soccer rules, Every club had to particpate.)There had always being a big rivallry between Caversham AFC(who wanted to go alone) and Dunedin Technical (who wanted to have a joint bid) This was magnified when Caversham AFC gained promotion to the NSL in 2003.</p>
<p>However when the NZFC was formed as a franchise competition every club (including Caversham) joined for Otago United. the Driving force behind this franchise has to be Marc Chidley. He has worked tirelessly for the good of Soccer in Otago at all levels, including organising junior tours to the Milk Cup in Ireland, Otago United and he even finds time to play masters Soccer.</p>
<p>The first season</p>
<p>The season started with a 2-0 loss away to eventual finallists Waitakere Unied away. Otago United then played their first home match vs Napier City. After leading 3-1 Otago had to settle for a 3-3 draw after a few late Napier goals denied Otago their first win of the season. However on Labour Day Monday Otago picked up their first win of the season with a 2-1 win over eventual wooden spooners Youngheart Manawatu. The win was thanks to two great goals from Blair Scoullar. In the next game vs Team Wellington Otago went behind</p>

<p>This debut collection of poetry - with the occasional short segment of prose - concerns a personal reaction to the rise of the web, and the possibilities for freer communication to come. There are references to natural imagery that almost make this a visionary work. The more notable poems include 'E-Ode to Lone Gun 3O'. The title is taken from the famous TS Eliot poem 'The Hollow Men<i>.</i></p>

<p>From the Publisher: This millennium-inspired volume of personal poetry takes its title from the TS Eliot poem 'The Hollow Men.' It uses for its exploration, cautious thoughts about human nature before and after an idea of greater spiritual convergence through technology/cyberspace. Through visionary and post-modern poems, this is a provocative collection to make you think and wonder about humanity within nature, and the limitations of our present time as a thoughtful, feeling people. Re-compiled and polished in 2002, and 2005. From the Author (Adrian McO-Campbell): These poems accumulated throughout the early days of the Internet, and surrounded my excitement for the communicative potential to come. Having grown up with the growth of the Web and computers, fascinated like most by these new elements of control and wonder, I began to think about the spiritual implications - mixed up with a personal struggle for expression - for our reaching souls within a system of nature. It was only later that I thought to gather these speculations together, and some of the results here question identity and highlight the limitations in our lives prior to this projected 'convergence', and in the future. I feel there is scope for much more speculation, to aid us in our relationship with computer technology. I have the support of my family to thank for the completion of this initial work. 86.130.132.122 23:25, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The HPD-15 is a drum machine with a difference. It uses new Roland technology to convincingly model the unique performance characteristics of percussion instruments via a 10" rubber pad that can be played by hand. This pad is divided into 15 parts for simultaneous control of 15 different sounds. Thanks to a built-in pressure sensor, percussionists can perform muting and pitch control as they would on an acoustic instrument such as a conga..</p>
