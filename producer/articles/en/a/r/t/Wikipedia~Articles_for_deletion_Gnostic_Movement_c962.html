<li><b>Keep unless notability not proven by end of AfD</b>: Given the prolieration of modern Gnostic movements, one main article is needed, but not many, many. The overall phenomenon "sounds" notable from what I'm seeing, but "sounds to A.

That could be fixed simply by citing some numbers (from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources) as to how many people are involved. Notability is key -- fix it or delete the article.

<ul>
<li>1. This article says the term Gnostic Movement is not associated with contemporary Gnostic organisations - this is a POV only.</li>
<li>2. By placing the word Masters in quotation marks in this sentence 'currently there are a number of different lineages of "Masters"' is to imply that none are actually Masters - this is a POV and not based on factual evidence.</li>
<li>3. Under 'New Order Schools' there are numerous sweeping assumptions. Saying that something happened "most likely" because of such and such a reason is not a factual description of events, but a guess based on biased views and information. There is no evidence given for the numerous assumptions. What is the claim that there is not a Three Chamber system based on? - POV only</li>
<li>4. Why is Gnosticweb the only gnostic organisation identified and selectively highlighted in this section - this is provocation.</li>
<li>5. The section on Pseudo-schools is another section for provocation. Whilst some claims may be true it is generally written based on opinions, hearsay, gossip and rumours.</li>
<li>6. Branding individuals as mistaken mythomaniacs is attacking and another sweeping POV.</li>
<li>7. Generally there is no merit to this article other than to fuel debate and argument.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is unfortunate that this page was called Gnostic Movement because it did not provide any objectivity about this topic, merely a POV that lacked neutrality and resourceful information. Listing people as "self Proclaimed Masters" and following it with comments eluding to those people being mythomaniacs, especially those still living, could very well be considered defamation of character.

<ul>
<li>I think this article violates Netural POV. Despite a surface neutrality, it seems clear that it's been written by a proponent of one of the earlier schools of Samael Aun Weor, and intended to discredit any later developments in modern gnosticism. Examples of this include:</li>
<li>use of inverted commas surrounding words like "advanced" and "masters", colours the text with a sense of incredulity or even sarcasm, and seems intended to influence the reader's perception</li>
<li>the quoted material (from Zodiacal Course) appears selected less to shed insight into what the Gnostic Movement is then to subtly deride other schools that disagree with the author's POV</li>
<li>much explanation of why earlier schools view later offshoots as "only superficially affiliated of the doctrine of Samael Aun Weor" without any attempt to provide the alternative perspective(s)</li>
<li>the use of the term "self-proclaimed" master becomes almost derogatory by the article's end, and the implication is that they are generally "mythomaniacs" according to the "source" (footnote 4). Upon investigation, the source appears to be the website of a school that goes to considerable lengths to make clear their disagreement with later offshoots of modern gnosticism -- can we expect this to be a balanced and objective source? Particularily, again, as no efforts are made to offer a countering perspective.</li>
<li>from viewing the edit history and the discussion pages, some of which seems almost hysterical, and considering the lack of verifiable sources, it seems that this article will inevitably be hijacked by interested parties, and fails to provide an objective assessment of the subject matter.</li>

<li>The article starts out giving the appearance of being informational, but as it goes on beyond the introduction, it seems that the actual purpose of the article is to persuade the reader that certain schools are legitimate, while others are decidedly not legitimate. It serves little informational purpose beyond the introduction, which contains information already found within other articles.</li>
<li>Some statements made later on in the article, including some under, "New Order Schools," are unfounded and without any source of reference. For example, how can it be proven whether or not the new order schools carry a three chamber system? This term refers to a school system (stated by Samael Aun Weor as being a defining point of a true Esoteric institution) structured with an external (public), intermediate, and internal (esoteric) chamber system. By definition, if a school did have an internal chamber, this wouldn't necessarily be something known to those outside the school. The fact that this is used as a defining factor of "new order schools" shows an author interested in promoting something he is familiar with, while dismissing that which he is unfamiliar with.</li>
<li>Similar could be said about the "self-proclaimed Masters" section. Samael Aun Weor himself was a "self-proclaimed" Master (literally, he proclaimed himself a Master). There is no way to prove who is and who is not a "true Master" versus a "self-proclaimed Master," so a list of self-proclaimed Masters seems again only to serve the point of view of the author that these "Masters" are illegitimate.</li>
<li>There are other statements presented as fact which similarly there is no way to prove. I don't have time to go through all of it, but if you go through it, you will be able to spot others.</li>
<li>Finally, the article defines "Gnostic Movement" as something which belongs solely to Samael Aun Weor, when it is clear that there are other schools with the same name. Because of that fact, the whole hierarchical structure of the article is flawed. I suggest deletion because in my opinion, there is no way such an article can exist without being a battleground for an edit war on the part of the disagreeing schools.

<dd>This page seems to have been started to do nothing more than debunk particular gnostic schools in favour of another and is littered with POV. Regardless of some users association with these schools the article is negative POV and contains some defamatory comments which the history shows has resulted in an edit war.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For the average user in userland, ie non wiki geek (no derogation intended) it would seem that nearly everyone has been discredited.</p>
<p>999 who initiated the call for deletion is discredited for making a drive-by nomination, even though no previous history or association can be found.</p>
<p>The early 'voters' who do not appear as sockpuppets are discredited because they are making votes not discussions.</p>
<p>The sockpuppets are discredited because they are seen to jump in solely to ask for deletion or other, when they had no previous contribution history (even though some of their comments are definitely worthy of consideration).</p>
<p>Those who had previously made contributions to the article but have shown some kind of affiliation with the subject matter are deemed bias and therefore discredited. (Why would someone spend time and effort creating a wiki article if they had no involvement or interest in it?)</p>
<p>That leaves only...? Wish I knew how the system worked?</p>
<p>It seems there is more emphasis on who users are then the actual contents of the article!</p>
<p>My opinion now (if it counts for anything?) is I tend to agree with the author - have a NPOV stub or delete the article.</p>

<li><b>Very strong KEEP!</b> and tag for clean-up regarding the NPOV issues. Large movements like this one and prolific authors should have articles. These articles have lasted more than 6 months and are actively being improved upon by several editors. They are not stubs, and provide a lot of detailed and potentially useful information. They seem to me to be no different from the vast majority of contentious issues that have articles on Wikipedia. The movement may not be quite as notable as, say scientology, but in many respects these articles remind me of the articls on that movement, only people have managed to bring that one up to FA status. WP certainly has articles on less notable things. Plus, articles that start out reading like ads can and have in the past been improved to such a point that no one mistakes them for such. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 15:25, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and tag for cleanup/npov.</b> POV isn't reason enough for a delete, IMHO. Honestly, the notability of the subject matter should matter a lot more. As noted above, there's a lot of history to this article and the subject matter seems notable enough for inclusion to Wikipedia. To delete an article because its easier than actually putting in the work to make it a GOOD article is, in my opinion, a less-than-optimal choice. As a matter of full disclosure, this article was prodded a while back and I removed the prod for similiar reasons (POV not sufficient for deletion). However, I have no other investment in this article. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 21:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
