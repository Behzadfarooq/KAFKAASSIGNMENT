<p>This article is highly speculative right now, attempting to turn two current military operations into a new full-blown war between nation states, and at the same time just providing links to the two articles already dealing with the two operations. I think it should be deleted until the world's media regard this to be a proper war between Israel and its neighbours. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 16:37, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is one of the reasons why I suggested on the article's talk page that the AfD (like the article itself) is premature. Events are going to keep happening, and people are going to vote based on the events as they stand when they vote; and then they may or may not go back and change their vote based on later events. One more reason to "park" this article under a less controversial name until events develop further. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 17:21, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Call it a war, call it a conflict - whatever it is, it certainly is something. It makes sense to keep, because two operations are clearly a part of something. Someone decided to name this something the 2006 Arab-Israeli War, because it seemed appropriate to them. If you disagree, we can settle on something like 2006 Arab-Israeli Conflict.

<dd>Thats not much of a reason to delete it, thats a reason to improve it. But its funny how hard it is to improve things when all the discussion is about deleting it. The article is about a day old, and its obvious that the conflict for which it describes is real, and worthy of a good article. This isnt an attempt to merge two articles together, its an attempt to have an overview article over the conflict for which Operation Summer Rains and the Lebanon crisis are a part.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but closely monitor for aboslutely unavoidable vandalism, and huge POV problems. This is should be a short article pointing to recent actions that are clearly related, in part to assist disambiguation in sorting out conflict with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in the north. They are clearly related as having been triggered and extended by hostage-taking of Israeli personnel, couple with rocket attacks. Israel has escalated the conflict on both ends with dramatic force. Hezbollah is widening the conflict, and the page should stay as it is with content updates until this does move to a broader conflict (rather than skirmishing and attacks from a distance like Kashmir between Pakistan / India).</li>

There are two different issues being voted on, the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> vs relevant info, and the duplicity, which was not in the nomination rationale. Therefore, as a matter of fairness and neutrality, it goes without saying that this should be deleted once any relevant info is merged. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMoulder_99cd.html" title="User:Moulder">Moulder</a> 22:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just counted the votes, and after 5 days, there are presently more keeps than deletes: the fact being that calling the situation a "conflict" instead of a "war" resolved general objections. Furthermore, there have been some work on timelines for events before and during this conflict: I feel content from those lists should be used to expand the article. Links to all articles relevant to the current situation should be posted in a "See Also" section. Updated references should continue to be posted. <a href="../../../c/w/o/User%7ECwolfsheep_0066.html" title="User:Cwolfsheep">Cwolfsheep</a> 04:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
