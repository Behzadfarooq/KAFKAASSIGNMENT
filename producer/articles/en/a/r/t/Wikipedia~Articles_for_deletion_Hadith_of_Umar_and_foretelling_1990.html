Changed vote to MERGE</s>, <b>Striver</b> you have to understand that unfortunately there is a certain <b>Anglo-centrism</b> to Wikipedia. Instead of arguing with people, make the article easier to understand by explaining (in laymans terms) what is a <b>Hadith</b> who is <b>Umar</b> and what is the importance to Islam. I suggest that the articles be merged at first, worked upon by whoever has knowledge of the topic, and then be put back as separte topics when they are ready. Just some constructive criticism please don't bite my head off, it's just when it comes to a topic of Islam, you can not assume that people reading these articles will have ANY clue about even the basics. -<a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oscar Arias</a> 01:57, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> It appears as an important point in Islam.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> despite bad faith nomination. Looking at an earlier version of the page, there was a citation. In fact there were several citations. If you had a question about the source, the corresponding talk page should have used. However, this article should not exist, nor should other hadith articles. Despite Striver's example of Matthew:5 or whatever verse he keeps flaunting as precedence, I still don't think each individual hadith needs an individual article. Perhaps <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora's</a> suggestion to create a Hadith cited by Shi'a article should be considered and these hadith could be merged their, instead of having thousands of individual articles floating around. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 13:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. We're missing a whole layer of articles necessary to make individual hadith articles worthwhile. There is no way that will help users systematically understand these hadith in context which might explain the importance of this. Basically, I agree with Pepsidrink and Zora. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 21:58, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Update</b> in accordance to Oarias suggestions, i have uppdated the hadith to be more "western friendly". I hope he is pleased with the resuls, and i also hope this is what Grenavitar was leaning towards. Please give me more feedback on how i can improve this article, and please remeber that there is no single place that this hadith can be merged to.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am kinda starting to see <b>Strivers</b> argument about these hadith articles. I believe that if we can have hundreds of entries for Bible chapters and verses (not to mention hundreds of <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> cruft articles), then <b>we should have ALL the hadith entries as well</b>. (I don't care if it's 10 or 10000 articles, <b>we've already set a precedent with Bible entries</b>) Just for the record, I currently consider myself <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>, I believe that God is unknowable and everything written about ALL religions is pure speculation, but that is strictly my POV. I believe Wikipedia should be NPOV when it comes to these religious topics and should have the teachings of ALL religions (I don't care if it's Christian, Islam, Judiasm, Taoism, Buddhism, Hindu, whatever). So I say bring them ALL the hadith's in if you want, but please make sure that if you do please make sure to keep NPOV if there are different interpretations between Shi'a and Sunni (and other) factions. As I mentioned above about <b>Anglo-Centricism</b> in Wikipedia -- to prevent votes like this from coming up in the future make them understandable by us <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infidels.html" title="Infidels">Infidels</a>. Otherwise someone (like I did initially) will vote to delete articles where they have no "frame of reference" (this is probably what Grenavitar was talking about when he mentioned "layers of articles" a few votes up. Anyhow, I've said my oberservations the rest is up to the Wikipedia community! --<a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oscar Arias</a> 13:48, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We should only have the articles if they are notable enough. The Bible entries are being paired down and there is even an Arbcom case involving them. Two wrongs don't make a right, so only make the articles if they are actually needed. kotepho 23:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course, nobody is going to bother bringing all hadith here. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>It would seem that the whole reason Striver is putting these articles up is that there is some differences in interpretation between Shi'a and Sunni on these Hadith, thus making them notable. Kinda like discussing different interpretations of Bible verses by Catholics and Protestants.--<a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oscar Arias</a> 16:02, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
