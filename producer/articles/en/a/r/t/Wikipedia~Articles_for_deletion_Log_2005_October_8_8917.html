<p>Essentially non-informative article whose information is put forth much better in <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_class.html#Abstract_and_Concrete_classes" title="Abstract class">Abstract class</a>. The only article that links (or rather: linked, I changed that) here was <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract.html" title="Abstract">Abstract</a>. The Abstract page lacked link to <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_class.html" title="Abstract class">Abstract class</a> so I replaced the link to Abstract (Java) with that one. As such, this article here has outlived its usfulness. --<a href="../../../j/-/s/User%7EJ-Star_d4b3.html" title="User:J-Star">J-Star</a> 14:46, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_class.html" title="Abstract class">Abstract class</a>. Note that the information in this stub is incorrect. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 15:22, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why redirect? Nothing links here anyway plus that it's hard to find. The only reason <b>I</b> found it was because I took a peek at the Too Technical-page. The article's name pattern is unique among the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Category%7EJava_programming_language_e1b1.html" title="Category:Java programming language">category articles</a> so there is no real pattern to be broken. Let's just waste it. --<a href="../../../j/-/s/User%7EJ-Star_d4b3.html" title="User:J-Star">J-Star</a> 15:34, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because redirects are cheap and easy and don't clutter up AfD. The number of articles on Afd every day could be reduced if editors are <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> and redirect articles (where appropriate) instead of listing them here. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 15:41, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Valid point... but 1) it's too late for that argument since the page is already on the AfD page&#160;;) 2) it's useless anyway and as such clutters up Wikipedia as a whole. So better to take the pain now and be done with it. --<a href="../../../j/-/s/User%7EJ-Star_d4b3.html" title="User:J-Star">J-Star</a> 16:02, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To the non-specialist this article might look like it has substance: it doesn't. The article does not cite sources and does not claim which Aramaic language this alphabet might be used for (see <i><a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_language.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic language</a></i> for the diverse history of the language). The fact is that the system as laid out does not make sense in itself, and it looks like the work of someone who knows a little of the language, but has not studied it properly. Thus, it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The authors, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">Sargonious</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.15.7.70_4f0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.15.7.70">12.15.7.70</a>, have previously contributed nonsense about Aramaic to Wikipedia. I also note that the article Aramaic Latin alphabet, to which a user moved this article at an early stage, also exists. It seems that the authors didn't realise where it had gone! <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:29, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There appears to be a bit of an edit war going on. As far as I can see, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">Sargonious</a>'s edits are very recent and my Aramaic is too rusty (ie nonexistent) to sort this out.

<li><b>Comment</b>: They try to make themselves sound like a big deal with this sentence: "Represented by the Christine Colas gallery in Paris, they exhibit regularly in Europe, the Middle East and Japan." I don't have the expertise to know whether this, if true, would make them significant in any way or not. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:59, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Very easy to check the truth of the information. Try Google!! pictures and links to the names of galleries and exhibitions are proof of their activity. As for the vanity article. It is not the quantity of google pages but the quality of the work and the possibility to create links from it which should be the question. It is preferable to be transparent and show the author as user than useless misleading by creating another Author. Wikipedia is surely not a place where someone puts adds on himself, nevertheless it is one way of getting into the wiki world and starting to collaborate.(Audic Rizk)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The question is not proof of "activity", which is manifest, nor the quality of the work (which I find quite appealing); it is whether it is well-known, widely written about, or the subject of media interest and art criticism, and so forth, and thus appropriate for an encyclopedia article. So yes, to some extent quantity is important. Writing and posting a article about yourself or your business creates the appearance of a "vanity" or self-promotional article. I would recommend moving this to User space ("userfy"). <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Abstract: The surface resistance to damage of homogeneous hard carbons such as glassy low temperature isotropic pyrolytic (LTI) and Ceraphite carbons have been determined by the falling abrasive particle test using SiC grit. Surfaces prepared from within the bulk of the glassy carbon specimens exhibit wear resistance proportional to their microindentation hardness but material near their virgin surfaces shows a lower resistance to this low velocity impact wear. Both pure and silicon-alloyed LTI carbons and Ceraphite material show considerably greater wear than the bulk glassy carbons of the same hardness. However, all of the hard carbons exhibit much greater surface damage resistance than other materials of comparable hardness such as mild steel or soda-lime glass. Microscopic surface examination indicates that brittle fracture is the main wear mode of the hard carbons in this test and the results are interpreted in terms of the microstructural features and characteristic elasticity properties of these solids.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Um, nn allotrope? No, I suppose that won't do. How's this - the article is doomed to remain non-encyclopedic, because all sources repeat the same few short sentences about it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article was started in Dec. 2004, so it seems pretty clear (at least to me) that the Wikipedia article was derived from one of these sources and not vice versa. It also seems pretty clear that this is not a hoax, as the Los Alamos National Laboratory uses the term <a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/downloads/PeriodicWebSite.pdf" class="external text" title="http://periodic.lanl.gov/downloads/PeriodicWebSite.pdf" rel="nofollow">here (pdf)</a> and UC Berkeley does so <a href="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips_epo/carbon.htm" class="external text" title="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/chips_epo/carbon.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (giving the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and the American Chemical Society as the sources for the page). I agree that there is little in the primary literature, but we must remember that most of the databases of scientific articles only include articles dating back to the early '90s and there is no quick way to do thorough search on such an obscure topic. So, I vote to keep, because although obscure, an allotrope of carbon is quite notable and encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/t/m/User%7EBtm_d07f.html" title="User:Btm">Btm</a> 05:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Both <i>Carbon</i> and <i>Wear</i> are awfully obscure Elsevier journals. Also note that the papers that go into <i>Wear</i> don't deal with the difficult subject of metastable phases in the phase diagram of carbon. The word isn't mentioned once in an ACS journal. As the editor who put the article up still hasn't put a source to back up his claim the entry ought to go; too many people have already wasted their time with it. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:11, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have done some more digging, which should settle the question. Ann. Rev. Mater. Sci. 1973, 3, 195 mentions the mineral chaoite as a recently discovered carbon allotrope. The article then continues to say claims were made than an identical material is prepared by subliming graphite at high temperature and low pressure. "In spite of these seemingly definitive reports ... several other groups have tried unsuccessfully to reproduce these experiments. Independent confirmatory work is obviously needed in this area, and at the present time white graphite appears to be the carbon analog of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polywater.html" title="Polywater">polywater</a>. <b>Delete and redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaoite.html" title="Chaoite">chaoite</a></b>, or get rid of the spurious phase altogether. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:31, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, definately. This was the article that lead me to learning of Ceraphite and if we delete this page we may as well remove it completely from the Carbon page as well. Also, with advancing scientific research we should soon be able identify a mollecular structure for it and maybe even get some pictures of it. Also there is no proof that ceraphite is chaoite. It says chaoite is grey or white whereas ceraphite is white, no mention of gray. User:Rickem
<ul>
<li>There is no proof that ceraphite even exists. It is mentioned in two conference abstracts, and the review cited in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaoite.html" title="Chaoite">chaoite</a> entry cautions that those reports were not reproducible at all. IIRC, chaoite is a carbyne phase. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Someone might object that i am printing original research in the paragraph: "A possible solution: neural networks". I'm almost certain this has been done before. Nueral networks are like wild animals in the sense that they dont obey rules very well. The method may have worked many times in the past but might not work in the future. Also they are difficult to tame. I really feel that in some cases this can be done and in other cases it cannot. How do you feel about this?</p>
<p>Another problem might be the repetition of the concept of a "geodesic". Yet the article on that subject is full of equations. I think my article says it from a different, more simple point of view.</p>
<p>The gentle political satires were removed.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> it's quite interesting but is really a personal essay rather than an encyclopedia article in my view - so unfortunately not really wikipedia material.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unfortunately, though the author has clearly put thought into this material, said thought has clearly involved thinking up new ideas, rather than organizing and reporting upon pre-existing ones. Personal essays, no matter how interesting the topics they cover, do not belong on the WP. (Sections trying to justify why the article "definitely belongs on Wikipedia", I must add, are counterproductive.) I suggest that the author create a user account and move this material there. Also, I suggest reading through what modern <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiotics.html" title="Semiotics">semiotics</a> people have said about communication as "encoding" and "decoding". While much of this structuralist, post-structuralist or whatever material is interesting, I find that large chunks of it are simply indigestable â the sort of bad writing <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Sokal_ba21.html" title="Alan Sokal">Alan Sokal</a> lampooned in the <a href="../../../s/o/k/Sokal_Affair_75f6.html" title="Sokal Affair">Sokal Affair</a>.

I have a question for you all: Why is it bad to keep this entry on the site? It is not made up of lies, its not a hoax and its not vandalism. Please understand that I think you are being silly by trying to delete something where there is no problem to leave it up.

<li><b>Delete</b>: I've requested references for the material in this article but have received no response (Talk:Council of Fourteen Minus Ten). My opinion is that no significant portion of the article has a legitimate source and it is unsalvageable. Moreover, the author has added redirects to this site from <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Four_4645.html" title="Council of Four">Council of Four</a> and Council of Fourteen. The former was a legitimate article that the author moved, renamed and made into a disambiguation page (see histories for the two pages). <a href="../../../w/s/i/User%7EWsiegmund_987c.html" title="User:Wsiegmund">Walter Siegmund</a> 02:54, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This article basicly has no source because it is for a club type thing. It is something I am in. I am trying to put it on wikipedia becuse it is basicly undocument. I dont think that is a crime to come up with your own information! Other people dont always have to do all the reasearch! As I said before, IM me at persept0 on aim if you want to talk about this. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersept_f87f.html" title="User:Persept">Persept</a> 03:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>By the way, it was not me who wrote about Tolkien and Marvel comics and the Council of fourteen. I have no clue who put that there since it only showed an ip address. It seems entirely made up to me. And i put a disambiguation page to disinguish from The Council of Four Minus Ten(which equals 4) the council of four from india, and the council of four lands. I thought this was nessisary. If i didnt think it was nessisary I wouldnt have gone to the trouble of changing all the links so there would be no redirects! <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersept_f87f.html" title="User:Persept">Persept</a> 03:48, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would like you to carefully read the requirements for patent nonsense:
<ol>
<li>Total nonsense - i.e. text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all. This includes things like ".lz nbl[909nvn[904wv[90am[0vm43[ eiov", where random keys of the keyboard have been pressed.</li>
<li>Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make sense of it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is neither!! Stop making false accusations! And Someone answer my question: Why is it bad to keep this entry on the site? It is not false and it is not patent nonsence, its not a hoax, and its not vandalism. Why cant you people see that there is nothing against my site!!! <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersept_f87f.html" title="User:Persept">Persept</a> 03:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>If editors had not once again abused the "patent nonsense" speedy deletion criterion, which this article does <i>not</i> come under (it being quite comprehensible), but had instead provided an applicable rationale for deleting this article, we perhaps wouldn't be having this discussion; because the original author would be looking at the policies that quite clearly explain why this article does not belong here, rather than looking at <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Wikipedia:patent nonsense</a>, which is irrelevant here.

<dd>comment: I was the editor responsible for adding the nonsense tag. In defense of this choice, I believe that (as MCB noted) this article is purposely absurd and an example of some weird sort of contrived incomprehensibility. Going strictly by the patent nonsense policy page, I didn't think that this article was merely poorly written or immature, but appeared to be <i>completely meaningless</i> at the time of nomination. I'm sorry if listing it for speedy deletion was too brash, but after re-examining the article and the author's comments concerning its creation, I still think it qualifies as nonsense. <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode">Anetode</a> 18:19, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Im new to wikipedia: do i simply need to make it more factual? Search 'carshare' in google and Newtopwn carshare, our sister site, comes up 6th - i think its relevant. - Nic, author of page</li>
<li>I came across this: "Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style" - so if I change it will it be acceptable?
<ul>
<li>I'll let someone else take this; I'm not sure where the boundaries are. The fact that you're writing about your <i>own</i> company, while probably not per se forbidden, raises strong suspicions that you mainly want to use the article as free publicity for a commercial venture. There must be someone who has more experience with this issue who can comment more authoritatively. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:44, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your time on this - as I said, I am new to Wikipedia - and I have dual motivations. I saw an article about the US companies (contributed by unknown persons) so I figured I could contribute one on what we've done in Australia, seeing as how we were the first ones to do it here. Anyway, I guess I have to leave this one up to the community!

<li>Should every business providing a trendy, valuable service, get an ad on WP? Give them a sentence or two in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_sharing.html" title="Car sharing">car sharing</a>, and an external link to their website; if they make some money off of that, great. But we shouldn't have articles promoting particular commercial interests.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Considering that the author is new to Wikipedia, it seems only fair to ask for some specific changes to be made rather than deleting the article. My suggestion is that the article be rejigged to focus on the generic benefits of carsharing within major Australian cities and a comparison of the Australian approach with precursors in other countries. This approach could readily satisfy the requirements for articles to be written in an objective and unbiased style. It would be a pity if information about this socially-beneficial approach (did I hear anyone mention petroleum crisis?) was excluded because of a suspicion about 'free publicity' being the major motivation for submission. Maybe as suggested, it could be included in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_sharing.html" title="Car sharing">car sharing</a> section under a heading of car sharing in Australia. I'm sure that the material could be revised somewhat by the author to prevent the unfortunate impression of a lack of impartiality. The fact that the author has dual motivations should not prevent him/her being able to produce a revision that focuses upon the social good aspect. Or do we assume that any submission by someone who has mixed motives is intrinsically tainted? That would seem a bit rich. Surely we should judge on the nature of what's finally actually submitted rather than taking an 'original sin' approach - I vote that we ask for the article to be edited so that it is 'balanced' in a manner analogous to that found in the Flexcar article. <small>unsigned comment by 134.7.248.129, 01:06, 10 October 2005</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">was bold</a> and rewrote it, stripping it down to a brief and factual article and taking out as much of the advertising as I could. It was certainly pretty advertising-heavy, but it appears to be a notable service in its area, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_sharing.html" title="Car sharing">car sharing</a> services are becoming much more prominent recently, so I think it's important to have an article on this one. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 01:12, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The revised version from Bikeable seems fine to me - it does a great job of informing about the basic idea without the former problem of the advertising overlay. I'd like the original author to expand the article along these lines (without advertising!) as suggested above to point out how the general car sharing approach has been 'tailored' to the specifics of the Australian context. I think this would be very useful for people in countries where such schemes do not yet exist.<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertus_Pictor_d9e8.html" title="User:Albertus Pictor">Albertus Pictor</a> 00:04, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My view is that these don't meet our criteria for inclusion at Wiktionary, as they simply are not attested words, by their very natures as hypotheses, and that therefore transwikification is not an option. I asked editors at Wiktionary to contribute to this discussion, stating that view but also pointing out that the AHD has an appendix listing such words. As you can see above, other Wiktionary editors agree that Wiktionary will not take these as main namespace articles. It's worth noting that, unlike many other of our language articles, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_language_3a39.html" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European language</a> has no "vocabulary" section or breakout vocabulary article. (Compare <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_language.html" title="Esperanto language">Esperanto language</a> and its <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_vocabulary.html" title="Esperanto vocabulary">Esperanto vocabulary</a> article.) The merger suggested above would create a "roots" article paralleling such a breakout vocabulary article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:55, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is wise if you read at least part of the book first, Enrique Ros had a relative also called Enrique Ros, who was one of officers in Cuba's elite marksman squad at the Hotel National in 1933 which held of the mutiny of the enlisted ranks lead by Batista and others. This Enrique Ros has written extensively and well on Cuba. And he, the author Enrique Ros is an accredited historian to the National Archives of the United State. he is also closely related to to a US Congress person, and extremely well informed. While I am sure that is not your intent; one might well consider that to demand the omission of this reference might well be considered a bias that would violate Wikipedia rules and ethics (El JigÃ¼e, 10/8/2005)</p>

<ul>
<li>I consider the structure itself, built as a free-library at the bequest of the first mayor of Woodstock, handsomely designed by an architect of regional note (G L Fairweather) and in continuous use since 1912 to be a structure of sufficient significance to merit an article in an encyclopedia alongside such institutions as "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate%E2%80%A6_God_kills_a_kitten_3af5.html" title="Every time you masturbateâ¦ God kills a kitten">Every time you masturbateâ¦ God kills a kitten</a>". <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:12, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was built by an architect who doesn't have an article, and normally painters and authors (and by extension architects) don't have articles for each and every creation, especially not for a creator of "regional note". 1912 is positively new by some standards; I understand in Hamburg the new town hall dates from the 13th century. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 00:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're absolutely right. And Amsterdam's Niewe Kerk is very very old. However the context for this structure is Woodstock, not Hamburg and the context for this article is Wikipedia, not Encarta. We've got an episode-by-episode guide to "<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_edf3.html" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a>", detailed descriptions of minor characters from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, and we can afford articles about significant structures in medium-sized towns. Hey and listen, if you want to merge and redirect, that's fine. But AfD isn't the place to do that. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:25, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "normally painters and authors (and by extension architects) don't have articles for each and every creation", I was speaking in the context of Wikipedia. Even great authors don't typically have all their books wikified.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 17:38, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's also true (unless the author happens to set their novels in the Star Wars universe, of course). This building is more than an example of an architect's capability, however. It is also a local institution and landmark, an example of an important style of architecture, a keeper of locally significant archival collections, and, above all, verifiable and NPOV. Notability is a disputed criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:50, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fish and chips shop outside my house is a "local institution and landmark", the building is ex-government built housing, so it was designed by a famous and well paid architect, a provider of nutrition, a place for the community to meet and exchange information on local events, verifiable (features in the University Student Magazine, which has an online edition), and is totally unsuitable for Wikipedia. Given that the criteria you mention above can qualify an otherwise unsuitable fish and chips shop for inclusion, perhaps they are flawed?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 22:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It sounds like the housing estate itself is probably worthy of an article, with perhaps some mention of the policy regarding the mix of retail and housing that was current at the time and a link to the famous and well-paid architect's biographical article. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all keep busy with constructive additions to the encyclopedia rather than going around deleting everything that isn't of any importance to you. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:11, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It'd be nice we all kept busy with constructive additions that filled spots in the encyclopedia that were of comparable notability to articles in the encyclopedia, thus creating an encyclopedia that is comprehensive in what it handles, instead of creating articles about things that are just like thousands of others that aren't getting articles.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 23:28, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assure you, the housing estate is not at all article worthy either&#160;:) And I'm sure we can agree that removing material from Wikipedia that shouldn't be there is just as constructive as putting stuff in that should be there.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 01:50, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I can agree with that statement, but I feel that my threshold for inclusion supports an optimistic view of Wikipedia's potential for growth while some of these votes betray an attitude that seems contrary to an "encyclopedia that anyone can edit." It presumes that we should try to "manage" contributions so that the most notable topics are fully covered before we stray into more trivial matters. Of course we can agree that many more notable libraries have yet to be written about, but we do not agree that we should therefore delete what HAS been written about this one. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:00, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia articles are encyclopaedia articles, and are <i>about the people/places/concepts/events/things that the initialisms represent</i>. Our article entitled <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> is about the space agency, for example.

<li>I don't get how that makes it "not a dicdef". The article defines the meaning, says in what context the term is used and by whom, and not much else. This is all dictionary stuff. If it were an anthropological article about the <i>phenomenon</i> of people using this term as opposed to another one, that would be different. I might still vote to delete--seems like pretty thin gruel; I'd want to see citations indicating that the phenomenon (rather than the term) was an object of scholarly study.

<li>These initialisms are most commonly used in sexuality research and GLBT publications and the GLBT community. In fact, I have actually overheard the phonetically-pronounced words "motts" (s/l pots) and "motos" (s/l photos) in casual speak at bisexual rallies.

<p>I created this page under the spelling "rabab" using an old spelling; I later found out that "<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubab.html" title="Rubab">rubab</a>" is the correct romanization and there was already an article on this instrument there.

<p>POV, Original research. Only link is to website from where entire text has been copied. The subject of rainbows in mythology may be interesting, but its not an actual topic of historical research, that I know of; either way, this article is merely a summary of one author's beliefs regarding rainbows, as indicated by the first line of the article ("The following is adapted from [book] .." If it were 'List: Rainbows in mythology', I might buy it, but not one sentence in this article presents any relevant, <i>cited</i> information. Generally reads like typical "New Age" fare. Also isn't linked from any other article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve, or Userfy. I would say delete due to copyright violation, but the original poster is User:Blakeee and the webpage from which the article is copied belongs to <a href="http://www.rainbowlight.net/about_us.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rainbowlight.net/about_us.htm" rel="nofollow">Blake Ebersole</a>. They may be the same person. Three other points: 1) Wikipedia is not a repository for original research, but that doesn't mean that articles cannot cite books of original research by others. Citing just one book doesn't necessarily render an article "original research." 2) It is unclear what is meant in the nomination regarding "rainbows in mythology" not being a topic of "historical research." While article does not cite sources for individual facts, the book the article claims as a source appears to be a legitimate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0271019778/104-4318680-6817565?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0271019778/104-4318680-6817565?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">book</a> dealing with the topic of rainbows as depicted in mythology. It was published by Pennsylvania State University Press, which at least implies serious research on the topic. 3) While specific sources for the stories are not cited, several of them are well-known mythological tales that would be reasonably simple to verify. (e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/f/Bifrost.html" title="Bifrost">bifrost</a>, which has a Wikipedia article.) Perhaps this could have been better titled "Rainbows in mythology." <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 16:53, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am Blake Ebersole, and I had sourced 'Rainbow Mythology' from said PSU Press book, yet however I did not post that on wikipedia. While that excerpt found on my website rainbowlight.net may be copyrighted, as long as the original source by Dr. Lee is referenced, I give permission for it to be posted on wikipedia. Additionally, said referenced book is as legitimate as I have read on the subject, contains over a hundred references itself. IMHO 'original research' is a fuzzy term like 'reasonable doubt' and very subjective. The words in 'rainbow mythology' are mine but the ideas and the 'original research' comes from Dr. Lee's book. -- (presumably a <b>keep</b> - moved from top by <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a>) Unsigned edit 02:23, 9 October 2005 by User: 68.58.96.227. <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 03:56, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> by nominator. By original research in this case, I didn't mean the individual facts mentioned in the article (which only need citation), but rather the <b>concept</b> of a 'Rainbow mythology'. Again, if it were 'Rainbows <b>in</b> mythology', that would be different. But, other than as a book title, there just isn't any actual thing called 'Rainbow mythology'. (BTW, Blake, thanks for contributing. However, your disclaimer above isn't enough: you must list it under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>. But personally I think using COPYVIO to AfD a non-commercial page would be a <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploit_%28computer_security%29.html" title="Exploit (computer security)">cheap hack</a>). In any case, my only goal is to help clear the August 2004 cleanup page, so if it gets a thumbs up, I'll rewrite it myself.

<li><b>Keep</b> a collection of facts about the occurrence of the rainbow in different mythologies. It's not original research since it is a collection from other researchs. Interesting and useful to people asking how rainbows fit into various mythologies. Does need cleanup.

<li><b>Delete</b> as insufficiently notable.

<li>Comment: Well, it looks like this will be kept now. I would suggest a new name be thought of. At a minimum "Communism" should not be capitlized, since "Smurf Communism" is not a proper name of anything. Something semi-neutral like Smurfs (comparisons to communism) would be legitimate (as it doesn't imply there is actually such a thing). Unfortunately, we've now set a precident here, and everyone and everything ever called a "communist" might get a comparable serious or silly POV fork-article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 08:57, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but...</b>. It is a very in depth article with good references. It should not, however be under the Communism section. It is a general theory that many people have heard about, and interesting as a fictional representation of a 'communist utopia', whether the creator intended it to be so or not.Hegar 10:10, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Even though it's never been confirmed by the creator, there are far too many parallels between the ideals of practical socialism and the smurfs for this to be dismissed off-hand. Anyone who's really studied Soviet political history / ideology will agree. But yes, should be under a "socialist" rather than a "communist" heading if you want to split hairs. <a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVon_sanchez_e6ad.html" title="User:Von sanchez">User:Von_sanchez</a></li>

<li><b>Merge</b> This is a theory that I have been going off about for many, many years to friends when the Smurfs come up in a conversation. Where I first heard it, I have no idea.

However, I think it could be merged with the main Smurfs article.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Numerically, I know it's a no consensus so do-nothing. However, it's been demonstrated that the term is actually just wrong, and the deleters point that out, so to merge it would be inherently wrong: we might not be paper but we still don't wilfully carry misinformation. So this time, I'm going to let the more thorough research outweigh the numerics. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Obscure as it seems, I actually have seen references to this group before especially relating to music. I think they may have been some sort of actual band that played shows in the Northeast. On sites where band post information and sample songs, I definetly remeber listening to samples from a group that made reference to the Band of Theives. I've never actually seen someone with the wristband, but I am fairly confident that this group actually exists. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.64.148.141 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.64.148.141_4c6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.64.148.141">contribs</a>) 22:24, 11 October 2005 (UTC); <i>user's only edit</i>.</small>

<li>I stumbled across this article and I must now debunk this idea that the Band of Thieves does not exist. I am proud to say that I am an actual wristband-wearing member of the Band of Thieves. This is not a myth or a joke, but an actual group of people who are still active today, and if you walk through major northeast cities one can spot these green bracelets from time to time. In response to the first entry, we used to post our music on music posting websites, but I believe most or all of this music has fallen by the wayside in recent years. You may be able to find some old recordings if you scour the internet long enough, however, the band still plays regularly and ideas for a national tour are currently being considered. And, as the article states, the band is about much more than playing music, and in that sense, the group is stronger now than it has ever been. Members are continuously joining as the core ideas and beliefs of the Band spread to the far reaches of the country. Let this thriving community of artists and thinkers be recognized on wikipedia, from one who can speak from experience of the vitality of this unique group. Dprof 23:27, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I read an article about waldergame in the times newspaper a few weeks ago. It appears to have a dedicated following and is quite popular. Perhaps it should stay. or perhaps not:)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that the article is poorly written, I believe the intrinsic intellectual merit of the game itself has some value. The second point I'd like to make is that Amazon.com's Alexa claims to monitor 12million sites and that by their calculations, considering the current trends in the distribution of internet traffic, anything that consistently scores within the top 100,000 ranked sites</li>
</ul>
<p>is what they term 'meat and potatoes'. As of 2005/October/06, if over 3 internet users in every 1 million over a 3 month average was reached by waldergame, and the general trend in popularity has been exponential since its begininning, is it 'not-notable'? Tough call. I think it's a wait and see. --Charliebobtonysteve 12:31, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is vanity and unencyclopaedic. We do not even have an article on the village in question, yet there is this article on the headman's family.

<p>Gareth Hughes has been bashing all of my contributions to Wikipedia. I an Aramaic/Syriac speaking Assyrian according to Gareth Hughes know less about myself and origination than he does. I beg to differ.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am Gareth Hughes: I speak Syriac. I'm not bashing you: I simply believe that you are writing nonsense. The fact is that this is not an encyclopaedic article. If you want to write something about the name <i>Youkhanna</i>, it should be added to the article on <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/John.html" title="John">John</a></i> as an alternative spelling. If you want to write something on Araden, then it should be titled <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araden.html" title="Araden">Araden</a>. However, this is really about a bit of both, and is not worthy of being an encyclopaedia entry. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 10:53, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
