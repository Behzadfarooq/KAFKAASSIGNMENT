<li><b>Keep</b>. I created the entry, with no intention of an attack or 'hit list.' The genesis behind it is that I was reading the article on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strikebreaking</a> and 'scabs' and remembering a few of my favorite sports players had actually crossed the picket lines and made successes of themselves. I thought it would be interesting to see how many strike breakers actually made it. Certainly -- the initial use of the word "scabs" on the list was changed with no objection from me, simply to Strikebreakers and it has since been combined in the title. I still have no objection to simply listing it as famous strikebreakers. Really, I was just using the term as it was being used on that other page and how it was used in the media. I really don't have an axe to grind here at all. I think a POV is being imputed by the above into the article - again, I think it is notable that many famous athletes, actors, musicians were involved in these labor disputes in this way. It is definitely part of the story. I do hope people decide to keep the list and update it -- there are several other notable strike breakers that are non-athletes/actors. I just haven't had the time to go ahead and do the research. In the meantime, as an expression of good faith -- I'll go ahead and change the substance to get rid of the offending word - "scabs". --<a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopple_ff0a.html" title="User:Gopple">Gopple</a> 18:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems to me that the list serves only to attack members of list. I can't see this going anywehere good (even as strikebreakers instead of "scabs") --<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 01:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again, I think you're reading a bias into what it means to be a strike breaker. Is that supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing? Or is the point that it shouldn't matter--only that its part of the historical story. I guess the other idea is to incorporate it into the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">Strike action</a> article. --<a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopple_ff0a.html" title="User:Gopple">Gopple</a> 02:01, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Then, in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">Strike action</a>, say e.g. that "at <i>place</i> at <i>date</i>, <i>number of</i> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> players crossed a <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picket_line.html" title="Picket line">picket line</a>", without mentioning names.

</ul>

<dd>I still fail to see how this is a "public shaming", as you've linked to twice now - Do you think the actions of those who worked during a strike shameful? That seems especially POV. I think Jimbobl's idea is a good one -- context is always important -- but so are the players in major economic/business standoff. I disagree that saying "X number of people crossed a picket line on Y date." The fact that every person on that list is notable enough to have their own wikipedia entry shows that its a part of their biography and the history of union/management standoffs in the United States.--<a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopple_ff0a.html" title="User:Gopple">Gopple</a> 05:23, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This has plenty of relevant, publically accessable truthful (non-slanderous) content relevant to sports players. For example, every baseball strike breaker cannot join the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLBPA_317a.html" title="MLBPA">MLBPA</a> and thus their name and likeness can't be licensed by the union. This is the reason players like <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Millar_f011.html" title="Kevin Millar">Kevin Millar</a> cannot be represented in video games. I think this article does correctly record valuable historical information about the players. I do think maybe each strike should be listed separately maybe with additional neutral point of view introductory paragraph, listing the views of the different parties (e.g., players union vs. players. vs. owners vs. fans) for each group of strike-breakers to put it in some context.--Jimbobl 14:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no point in maintaining this (unmaintainable) list other than as a wall of shame. Any relevent info can go into the respective articles about the strikes. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 18:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. POV, arbitrary, borderline attack page (regardless of the title of the article). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These people made a choice to publicly cross a picket line. All this page does is acknowledge this as fact. Nobody is passing judgement on them here. Simply stating facts. Isn't that what wikipedia is? Deleting this page is nothing more than hiding the skeletons in the closet of some popular sports heroes. Wikipedia is about the TRUTH, it is not a public relations agent for athletes. 04:26, 16 July 2006, User:71.197.188.244</li>
<li>Does anyone propose deleting Hitler entries because his actions present him in a poor light to readers? (04:28, 16 July 2006) (edit), User:71.197.188.244</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as listcruft. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 04:27, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as Listcruft, as almost totally excluding historically worthwhile strikebreaking, as seen in socially relevant unions, where Ronald Reagan would have to be listed for his part in the ATC strike breaking. a bunch of jocks who want money more than union strength, and being referred to as 'scabs' in the list shows incredible bias.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:26, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
