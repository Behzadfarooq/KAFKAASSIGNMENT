<p><b>Nomination for Delete <s>Transwiki</s></b> Delete <s>and transwiki to Wikinews</s> as breaking news item with no claim of encyclopedic notability. Newsworthy but not encyclopedically notable individual/incident. Fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - Wikipedia is not a news service or a place for articles about news events without encyclopedic significance. (On the other hand, Wikinews IS the proper place on Wikimedia for broad news event reporting). Plus let me emphasize that news coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the victim here (plus my best friend is a student at UCLA). There are many incidents of police brutality - unclear what makes this one special enough (plus though its a serious incident, there are many worse cases too) for an encyclopedia article of its own. Potentially there could be sufficient encyclopedic notability from this incident in the future e.g. if this case leads to some major change in Californian law - but Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. It's way too early to tell.</p>
<p><s>Finally, let me make a plea on behalf of Wikinews. When news events happen, people always seem to rush off to create well referenced, detailed articles on Wikipedia at the expense of Wikinews (the proper site for wikimedia news service reporting), which ends up being a somewhat neglected backwater - it's a shame that Wikinews suffers from the good faith mis-impression that Wikipedia is a news service.</s></p>

<li><b>Query</b> Does this restriction still apply to material deleted from Wikipedia's public article space? I realize that deleted content still resides on Wikimedia servers and are not actually permanently deleted - however they are removed and inaccessible from the public article space, so is this content still covered by GFDL? Particularly if the intention is to transwiki the content to another wiki owned by Wikimedia? Perhaps I'll write to the Wikimedia attorney about this question <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable. Has been reported in major mainstream media. A unique and interesting case in that a six-minute video of the incident exists. Another example of misuse of Tasers, which is a hot topic. One of three similar incidents reported in LA this week, each one with accompanying cellphone footage. Wikipedia isn't paper. Countless similar articles exist already. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 07:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC) Added: it should also be noted that the UCLA article currently has a sizable section concerning this incident.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I stated in the nomination that the incident is newsworthy and emphasized that what I doubt is whether this incident is <i>encyclopedically notable</i>. Wikipedia is not a news service for breaking news and "hot topics". Wikipedia isn't paper but it's also an encyclopedia and news coverage - yes, even in major mainstream media - doesn't automatically translate to encyclopedic notability. I doubt that countless similar articles exist, but that's the usual <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon defence</a> anyway. Can you substantively suggest how this day-old incident falls under, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> describes valid articles related to news events, "<i>encyclopedia articles</i> on topics of historical significance"? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I doubt that it will survive for long on the UCLA page either. Unless this incident turns out in the future to be a defining moment in UCLA history (and predicting Rodney King riots or whatever now would be crystal balling), this incident does not belong on the UCLA page. It's a serious incident, but it's not obvious that its anywhere near the league of say, the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_shootings_f7ad.html" title="Kent State shootings">Kent State shootings</a> or the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_State_killings_4153.html" title="Jackson State killings">Jackson State killings</a> in terms of historical/political significance <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:46, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Well, this is still a current event - so it might have some historical/political/cultural/etc significance. Or it might not. I'd say to maybe let it stay for now. On a personal level, it makes me suddenly feel insecure and a little paranoid about the police force here and their use of power. I think many others feel the same way too. In that regard, I think this is where its point of signifance may particularly grow upon as the situation develops. At the very least though, this event does deserve a menton in the UCLA page under the controversy section... I personally like how is is expanded upon. I don't know if putting it under the student's name is the best way to explain the event in whole however, but there isn't exactly a real given name (that I'm aware of) to the situation either quite yet. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 10:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. The information in the article is not speculative of <i>what is going to happen</i>; only facts and opinions offered by news articles are noted and sourced - therefore, this article is technically alright. I feel it would be trying to "be a crystal ball" to delete the article based on speculation of it being non-notable in the future. I feel we should bring up the issue of deletion again when things begin to settle down a little more; we don't know where this issue is going to head quite yet. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 20:43, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said those articles were more important. You misunderstood my implication. Both the Prussian Blue and USA for Indonesia articles went through this same similar thing at its time of controversy, and many memes go through the same process as they suddenly come out (but may/may not become a cultural artifact later on). People still read and edit them. I'm saying you should consider that the importance of the subject now, does not mean it will not be important, or even at least relevant, later. People still refer to them. That said, Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball, and neither are we. I say we just let it flow normally in its premature stages before determining if we should cut off its head. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 01:09, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak (Temporary?) Keep</b> Normally I wouldn't call for a temporary keep; we're not a crystal ball. However, in this case it will be apparently in within the next 3 or so days if this particular person is going to become notable enough to warrant an article, in fact we should know by the time the AfD is up since that takes up to five days. I think its likely that this is going to turn into a major court case/incident after watching the video related to it myself. Lets watch the news over the next couple of days and then decide. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 11:16, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The incident itself is notable, but I would give it a month before deciding whether to merge this content with the UCLA article, or to stick with the status quo, or neither.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's clearly encyclopediac. Lots of people are aware of the story, and interested in learning more from an encyclopedia article about Tabatabainejad. It's not an either/or choice with respect to wikinews. It can be in both places, with appropriate treatment in each place. To indulge for the moment in imputing motives, I think this is a good example of how people go overboard in trying to make wikipedia seem more important by imposing an inappropriately high standard of notability. Yes, a person who is notable only because he (or his mom, or his friend) write a blog post about him, sure, delete away. Someone like this? Please. Electrons aren't in such short supply that we need to be so zealous in conserving them. If this article had been deleted, it would have been a real inconvenience to me, and probably a fair number of other people, who are interested in what a wikipedia article on Tabatabainejad would contain. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 01:55, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not disputing the point you're making. Wikipedia shouldn't be a respository of news articles; agreed. I just don't think that point supports the deletion of this article. When I went looking for it, I wasn't looking for a news article. I can get any number of those from any number of sources. I tend not to use Wikinews for that, because I think there are things about wiki technology that work really well for an encyclopedia, but don't work particularly well for a news site. But that's a completely separate issue. And if the point about calling for this article's deletion is to somehow help Wikinews get traffic it wouldn't otherwise get, well, I don't think the cost is worth the benefit. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 06:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is HISTORY, it is an event that describes racial profiling and it is one of the many events that are probably going to occur in the future where acts of violence against Middle-Eastern individuals is on the rise. It is also an historical account in terms of police brutality. I say it should stay on wikipedia under police brutality/racism/racial profiling or one of all of those categories, along with anymore "excessive force" events that occur.

Our world is changing rapidly, and Wikipedia is becoming one of the world's reference sources for people trying to keep up with, and make sense of, the changes. A factual, verifiable article on the Tabatabainejad situation is a must. Wikinews is not yet nearly as well known as Wikipedia.

<dd>We can say at this point that this story has attracted considerable international interest. We can't predict whether it will be maintained, or diminished.

<dd>Agreed. It could be argued that it's the position Bwitth is advocating that is relying on crystal-ball gazing, to determine, in advance, that the incident is destined to be viewed as insignificant. Yes, there are a lot of other similar incidents that could be covered in Wikipedia in the same fashion. And yes, it may be only an odd side-effect of the posting of the video on YouTube that has led to the degree of notability the incident currently appears to have. Regardless of the reasons for its notability, though, it seems pretty clearly to have achieved it, or at least gives preliminary indications of doing so. Lots of people have contributed to the article, and continue to update it. Maybe those people, and some of the people stating positions on this page about dramatic historical significance, are overstating things, and will tone down their views with the benefit of hindsight. I'd agree that that's probably likely. But it doesn't mean the article fails a notability test. At least as I see it, it's way, way over that bar already. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 19:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Strong Keep - This is definitely a keeper. We are probably beginning to see the extension of public journalism where cell phone camera is being used to capture and disseminate news events. This is probably one of the most touching videos I have seen and since it is not being picked up by national media, its wikipedia should keep this.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - although I agree with the person earlier who said that the title should be changed. This is not really an article about Mostafa Tabatabainejad but about the incident.<a href="../../../m/s/_/User%7EMs_medusa_e166.html" title="User:Ms medusa">Ms medusa</a> 20:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It is notable, as long as there is enough room in the wiki servers, we should be inclusive. Of course, since it is a living person bio, we should pay attention. As for the rename (or reorientation) proposal to make this article about that particular incident, I suppose it is ok since I don't think that this person's bio is of the importance in itself, but it is because of the incident that he made the news, so if somebody was willing to change the title, it would be ok. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP - We should definitely keep this up until we at least know what the outcome of the situation is. If those police officers are found to be guilty of violating this man's right or if they are found guilty of police brutality then this incident becomes significant when discussing the subject of police brutality or for that matter police brutality and the LAPD/UCLAPD. So until we learn more about the situation and more importantly the outcome, I think we should have this article on Wikipedia. -DAN <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.180.192.61 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.180.192.61_94d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.180.192.61">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - With all my respect to the previous comments for deltion of this entry fully understanding the concerns and agreeing that wikipedia is not a new story repository. This is not just about an incident, this is about the person Mostafa Tabatabainejad. Mostafa has become a bit of a hero. A voice of definance and resistance to the erosion of personal freedom. Wikipedia will serve as a fine place to collect information about this very interesting character.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia does not, to my knowledge, require a level of popularity before an article is kept. I can find articles on obscure alien races from obscure 1990's video games; I don't think an article on a guy who got famous for being tasered warrents a deletion simply because it's not big enough for an encyclopedia to cover. I would suggest if this entry is deleted, then the entry for <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_King_f40c.html" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a> should also be deleted, for the exact same reasons. Or they should both be kept, because they are, after all, interesting subjects that people might want information on.--TheCynic 04:46, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree with Bwitth that this should go to WikiNews for now because it is so new and prior to this incident Mr. Tabatabainejad was clearly non-notable.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - He is notable now and will be notable in the future.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's a bit premature to be drawing conclusions about the historical significance before the fullness of time has made it apparent, and to be making comparisons to events whose historical significance are already clear, the subject of this article is significant enough for inclusion on Wikipedia on the basis of the broad-based national news coverage he is receiving right now. As a side note, if the subject of an article is very recent, then perhaps it would be a good idea to give it a week or so before trying to decide whether it is noteworthy enough for inclusion, rather than to immediately start deletion proceedings. I think it's quite clear at this point that this article is going to stay, and a whole lot of unnecessary rhubarb in this discussion could have been avoided if we had just waited a few days. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 08:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> although WP is not a crystal ball and without evidence we have to assume that it is not noteworthy. This should be a wikinews entry first and foremost, but this is the kind of articles we should have links to under police brutality, tasers, etc. That these kinds of things happen are not <i>only</i> news, they are also a fact about how things seem to work in the world (including democracies) - saying they are only news and thus not encyclopedic is saying that they are unique occurences. Its notable because it is so damn important.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is deleted all the same, I suggest we link to a mention somewhere under police brutality (and have a link there to the wikinews article which we certainly should have). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 08:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a noteworthy and probably historic event. Discussion has been heated and there is a need for a neutral collection of the facts.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although we can't be 100 % sure, the amount of coverage and exposure would suggest this incident will be remembered as a noteworthy event for a very long time (although Revolute's suggestion that it will become a historic event is pushing it). To debunk the Crystal Ball/News event argument: often elections (just an example, other kinds of events too) have an WP article dedicated to them, that was started the moment the event was ongoing, and for which deletion was never considered. Several of these elections/events proved to be less noteworthy than this incident. Still, they have some importance, and merit a WP article. On a side note, I would suggest renaming the article to <b>Powell Library Incident</b>. The article is about the incident rather than about the victim; and that's just fine: the incident is far more noteworthy as the person Mostafa Tabatabainejad. — Adhemar 11:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd suggest splitting into two articles, one on the incident and its aftermath, as well as the current one with biographical information on Tabatabainejad. The biographical one will be fairly short for now, but it could be expanded as new information comes to light. And running another call for deletion on the biographical article will give all of us something to do with our time.&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 14:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Do you really want to start an article for everyone that happens to make it onto someone's cell phone camera? This started as a violation of college policy that was escalated to what amounts to a misdemeanor. The ruckus that took place is no more notable than any other resisting arrest. It's always ugly from the outside. How about the black guy in New Orleans post Katrina that was captured on tape being beaten by NOPD? How about every car chase that makes it onto a news helicopter camera? Just because this is a UTube/blog phenomena doesn't make it encyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneb1955_ac1e.html" title="User:Geneb1955">Geneb1955</a> 11:30, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course we should not include everything caught on camera, nor should every piece of news have an article. But important court cases, good examples of a phenomenon (such as police brutality) should be included. Not because they are caught on tape or good news, but because they are important culturally, legally or otherwise. If this was just a misdeameanor, a ruckus and someone resisting arrest, then I would agree. But I see it more as an instance of misuse of force, taser used for punishment of a handcuffed subject and police brutality. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 14:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have personally heard about it from three separate sources since it occurred, and I believe it is notable enough to deserve an article under the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guideline. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECoderGnome_8f1d.html" title="User:CoderGnome">CoderGnome</a> 18:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Article highlights a shocking event that there is interest in, and a need for correct information on. The article also documents the aftermath of the event, which is important to be noted and held on record. The ongoing legal case will also develop with time, and the article should serve to provide users with access to the latest developments and truth about the issue. I would, however, recommend that the article is moved from "Mostafa Tabatabainejad" to "Mostafa Tabatabainejad Tasering Incident" to ensure that the person and the event (which fills the entireity of the article) can be logically seperated. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamSebWolf_543a.html" title="User:AdamSebWolf">AdamSebWolf</a> 00:09, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
