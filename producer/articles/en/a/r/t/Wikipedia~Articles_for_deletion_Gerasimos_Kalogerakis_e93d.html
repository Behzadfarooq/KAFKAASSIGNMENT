<p><small>META: This may have been a case for PROD, SPEEDY, or copyvio-deletion, but as I smell dispute here, we can as just well do a full blown AfD.</small></p>
<p>The article doesn't assert notability of the subject. It is -- as a claimed translation of a book cover -- most likely a copyvio. Not that it matters much, but the inappropriately used fair-use-images complete the picture.</p>
<p><small>NOTE: The entire <a href="../../../e/p/s/Category%7EEpsilonism_1cf1.html" title="Category:Epsilonism">Category:Epsilonism</a> may deserve a look.</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As per the discussion below. --<b><a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimon_4454.html" title="User:Kimon"><font color="black">Kimon</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimon_7b04.html" title="User talk:Kimon"><font color="#008080">talk</font></a></sup> 11:50, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, fails WP:BIO criteria for notability. There is nothing in the article that asserts notability, ie outside reviews of his books or mentions of him.The analogy with the articles is not quite correct since they refer to ideas, however this is a bio. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 04:29, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As the creator (and maybe only editor) of this article I have to support the reasons that led me create this article. This person is a quite recognisable writer in Greece. He has written dosens of books many of them were successful. If models and trash-TV personalities deserve to be here I don't understand why scolars should not. This person has made a big contribution is study of archaeology, paranormal and alternative history and his books are published by various ediotrs. I believe he deserves a place here. In time I could also expand more on his contributions.<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanosfidis_04bf.html" title="User:Panosfidis">user:Panosfidis</a>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the article should remain (see my keep vote above) but, to Baristarim's point, his notability is not asserted. Models and "trash-TV" personalities don't "deserve" an article (actually, nobody and nothing "deserves" an article - WP articles are not rewards) but rather, have done something to make them notable persons. I would urge you, as you are apparently more familiar with the subject than I, to find something like a review of his work or someone outside of Wikipedia talking about him.<br />
PS. Please sign your comments --<b><a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimon_4454.html" title="User:Kimon"><font color="black">Kimon</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimon_7b04.html" title="User talk:Kimon"><font color="#008080">talk</font></a></sup> 14:19, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precisely, if there were outside sources that talked about him, then if would definitely be a keep. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>O.K. here is another editor that publishes more than ten of his books</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>There you can also find his biography (in Greek) which I translated to English.</li>
<li>Here you will find an entry where he narates some of his paranormal experiences</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apologitis.com/gr/ancient/ilios.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apologitis.com/gr/ancient/ilios.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<li>Now excuse my language about who deserves to be here and who does not. What I meant to say is that when it comes to a blond bimbo who only speaks about herself it is easy to make a biography because you have many sources (she always speaks abou herself!) When it comes to a scholar who rarely appears in public it is naturla to be more difficult to gather sources. The only source I 've got so far is the biography I found on the back of a book but I suppose (and hope) that I will find more in the future. So I suggest Let's wait a bit.</li>
<li>By the way he is not my relative or something, I just happen to like his books.</li>

<dd>Your references (1) and (3) above are just listings of books by the author, sold in an Amazon.com fashion. (3) is the person speaking for himself promoting his book. These are some examples that can be used to assert notability (as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>):
<ul>
<li>A credible independent biography.</li>
<li>The person has received significant recognized awards or honors.</li>
<li>Wide name recognition</li>
<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</li>
<li>Multiple features in credible news media.</li>
<li>Commercial endorsements of notable products</li>
<li>The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors.</li>
<li>The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.</li>
<li>The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.</li>
<li>The person's work either (a) has been displayed in a significant exhibition or as a monument (b) has won significant critical attention, or (c) is represented within the permanent collection of a significant gallery or museum of more than local significance.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>A bio off the back of his book is not sufficient. Though I have heard of him (through friends in Greece) if objective, 3rd party information cannot be found, then I may have to change my vote to a delete and wait for the article to be re-created in the future with the extra support. --<b><a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimon_4454.html" title="User:Kimon"><font color="black">Kimon</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimon_7b04.html" title="User talk:Kimon"><font color="#008080">talk</font></a></sup> 18:59, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
OK my last arguments after that I stop.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you search in google you find 239 entries in english and 628 entries in Greek.</li>
<li>He was mentioned (and praised) in 90's TV-shows by<a href="../../../a/n/e/Anestis_Keramidas_499b.html" title="Anestis Keramidas">Anestis Keramidas</a>, another writer.</li>
<li>His book "The Ancient Greek Religion" became a best Seller (but I cannot prove it)</li>
<li>Many of his books are in the central library of Salonika (2nd biggest city in Greece)</li>
<li>He is the main contributor in the quite notable monthly magazine "Elanion Imar"</li>
</ul>
<p>well that's all. If after that you still insist I have nothing more to say. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanosfidis_04bf.html" title="User:Panosfidis">user:Panosfidis</a></p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>The actual number of hits in the English language Google is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gerasimos+Kalogerakis%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gerasimos+Kalogerakis%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">31</a> and in the Greek language is <a href="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%22%CE%93%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82+%CE%9A%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%82%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%22%CE%93%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82+%CE%9A%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%82%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">72</a> (your search was looking for "Gerasimos" and "Kalogerakis" but not "Gerasimos Kalogerakis"; it also brought in WP results). In any case, I'm not a big fan of using Google as a measure of notability. If that were the case, there would be an article on me (I've got 5000 Google hits).</li>
<li>If there's a transcript of one of Keramidas' shows or a TV-Guide type entry where it shows the agenda listing a discussion on Kalogerakis, it would be great!</li>
<li>If in one of those on-line bookstores mentions that the book was a best seller or the book itself says so, it would be great, since the source would also be included.</li>
<li>I am not familiar with that library but, I don't think that's enough. For example, the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> has almost every book published but, not all authors are notable. If his books were part of standard coursework at a university or cited by others, it would be different.</li>
<li>I'm not familiar with the journal "Elanion Imar", perhaps an article on that would be a good start in building a case for Kalogerakis.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm tending to change my vote to a "delete" now, as supporting material cannot be found. The fact that I've heard of the guy is not enough for an entry in a general population encyclopedia. I'll wait a couple of days and then, if nothing is added, change to "delete".</dd>
<dd>And yes, I'm well aware that this isn't a vote.</dd>
