The link I supplied above<a href="http://www.chea.org/Directories/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chea.org/Directories/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> shows this is not a legimate accreditor.

An article about an accreditation mill is worthless if the article just says what its not and lacks WP:RS telling what it is.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Sources have been there from the very first, though not visible unless the article was looked at carefully--which I did not do last night. I have just reformatted them for increased visibility, and there should be no more question. Expansion wouldn't hurt, but that's an editing question. it should be obvious that a notable purported accreditor is as worthy of an article as a real one--and the article serves a real purpose, for it can now be linked to if some diploma milll or the like should list it as a source.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: How do you expand it when there are no sources for it? The website is registered to "John Doe" and there is no names, addresses or phone numbers. Is this a scam? Is it real? The "sources" are simply two lists that say its no a recognized accreditor. According to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, we should have <b>multiple non-trival sources</b>. Feel free to find and add the sources. Until then it is clearly not notable. Its claims and <b>mention on two lists</b> does not mean it is wikiworthy. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 01:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I share Arbustoo's view that this organization is an accreditation mill. I created the article to provide documentation of the claims made by this outfit and the evidence for listing it as an "unrecognized accreditation association of higher learning." Several diploma mills claim authenticity based on accreditation by them (for example, see <a href="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>), so an article about their status could be helpful to people who might otherwise be taken in by a diploma mill. Additionally, I do not trust <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>, because I have found some legitimate organizations listed there with red links (for example, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Council_on_Education_8cc3.html" title="American Council on Education">American Council on Education</a> was listed there). In my opinion, it would be an improvement if every red link on the list were replaced by an article. <b>Minor issue:</b> I'm dismayed that several other contributors failed to notice the references in the article I created (they were displayed in the text in the format "[1][2]") -- many Wikipedia articles use this format to display URL references, and I thought this was an acceptable (albeit minimalistic) method of listing sources.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 00:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> it being put on list does not mean 1) it notable or 2) we have enough sources for a balanced article. Those two reasons must be considered when explaining vote or keep. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says a notable article is multiple non trival sources about the subject. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 01:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did notice the links you provided but, like Arbustoo pointed out, they cannot be considered "non-trivial sources". What we need is articles or books written about the subject. <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 08:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Major diploma mills that currently claim this entity as the source of their authority to grant degrees include <a href="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Capitol University</a> and <a href="http://www.unw.ac/" class="external text" title="http://www.unw.ac/" rel="nofollow">University of NorthWest</a>. Some diploma mills that formerly claimed accreditation by this outfit now say that accreditation is irrelevant (for example, see <a href="http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm" rel="nofollow">University of Northern Washington</a>).--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 14:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> But that doesn't matter <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Reasons_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">unless there are sources</a>, and the current references are just mentions of the name. I'm not trying to say that the organization doesn't exist, I'm saying that if there are no non-trivial sources of information (such as books, articles <i>about</i> the organization), the article must be deleted per official policy. <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 14:59, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Orlady, 1) we need RS sources for write an article. 2) Those "major diploma mills" don't even have wikipedia articles. This article can be recreated when there is enough to write about. Until then it fails to do any parties favors.

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which states that "Trivial or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability."

<li>WP:CORP states "Trivial or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." It belong on two lists is trival. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 23:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thats not a very good interpretation of the guideline. The government entities are authoritative and reliable sources on the matter of accreditation, and inclusion on this list is considered to be an official ruling. These lists (and these lists alone), are used by other institutions to determine the validity of credits - that alone makes these reliable sources. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guideline was intended to prevent using directory like listings of companies as reliables sources. Thats obviously not the case here - <b>Keep</b> for passing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> as a diploma mill. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 01:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just because it's true does not mean it belongs in Wikipedia. Inclusion on a list is trivial coverage. There's no notability here. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 06:12, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
