<p>Appears to be an obscure neologism. Our article gives no citation of notable use (or of anything else). A term in contemporary American politics that only gets 138 Google hits is probably not ready for prime time, and a quick survey of several of those links does not suggest to me that they all use it to mean the same thing. It is (barely) possible that there should be an article here, and I might be convinced by some good citations; I suspect, though, that if someone does the research they will find that the particular meaning the article claims for the term is not borne out even by the bulk of the meagre collection of known uses. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:46, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: I have heard this older neologism used in dialogue more than once, but very recently (two weeks ago). I find it interesting that its resurgence may be a way to anger neoconservatives by describing them with a term containg 'liberal', as that seemed to be the context in which I heard paleoliberalism. 42Moxies 10:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I am the person that created the article and of course object to it being deleted. The accusation that I made the term up is ridiculous. I've read it in various articles and webpages. That's where I got the name and from those articles and webpages I was able to put together the description of Paleoliberalism. As others have commented, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and as Wikipedia describes it an encyclopedia is "a written compendium of knowledge". And knowledge is exactly why the article should stay. I created the article as a public service of sorts, for those who my not know the term, but may know the concept. If the article is deleted it will do a great disservice to this website. Therefore I humbly request all of you who have voted for deletion to reconsider your votes and instead vote to Keep out of the spirit of what Wikipedia is supposed to be. -- <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleoLib_e0ff.html" title="User:PaleoLib">PaleoLib</a> 17:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, possibly Merge with Classical Liberalism.</b> The principles espoused in this article are fairly in line with most Libertarian positions, and in fact I can see very little in it that really differs with common notions of Classical Liberalism. On general principle though, I feel Wikipedia is not a resource of finite bandwidth, or pagespace, as the guideline stated. Hence, I think it should be kept, but possibly narrowed to tailor itself to focus towards the specific minutiae that separate it from other forms of Libertarian/Individual Rights political ideology. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKade_4d23.html" title="User:Kade">Kade</a> 01:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, I know it was like that when you got there. But the improvements you made don't fix the core problem with the article—that it is all original research. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:15, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What if we merged it w <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Liberalism_ef28.html" title="Classical Liberalism">Classical_Liberalism</a>? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 02:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How would that give it sources? This is a personal essay by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleoLib_e0ff.html" title="User:PaleoLib">user:PaleoLib</a>. If we merge it then it's worse because we wouldn't realize how unsourced it is. (It's like asking a vegetarian "Well, could you eat the meat if we cut it up finely and hid it in a sauce?") The fact is that the word is a slightly-used neologism, and if we wanted to we could accumulate all of the different meanings of the word. But that's dictionary-making. There doesn't seem to be "paleoliberal" movement that uses the word. If there is, we should find sources that atalk about it. Either way, we need sources. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 02:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There are no academic sources, that I can find, that refer to this particular political idea. There are however blog and political publication sources which use it in reference to current events. Certainly that can warrant it a sub-section inside a much larger, well known sub-ideology of Liberalism? <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKade_4d23.html" title="User:Kade">Kade</a> 03:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That'd mean throwing out this article and starting from scratch. But yes, I think that an article (or section) of whatever length would be fine—so long as it is sourced. In this instance political blogs and named forum contributors might be considered appropriate sources. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 03:09, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've already voted above, but I want to reiterate: if someone can come up with more than a handful of citations that this word is used with some consistency of meaning, fine, but, otherwise, original research shouldn't be here, adn making it redirect somewhere is likely to be actively misleading, because we've already found multiple uses among the few that exist. If someone comes across a reference to paleoliberal meaning a Nixon-era neoconservative and looks up the word, it's not use to them at all to get a redirect to something else entirely. If we are going to have this in Wikipedia at all, what we need is a decently cited article on how the word has actually been used, linking to the articles that then explain the (diverse) ideologies for which this is an (uncommon) name. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:48, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
