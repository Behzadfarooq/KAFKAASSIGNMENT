<p>Contested PROD. Original reasoning was "Personal essay and interpration of film. This article violates core policies <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> by definition." To that I would add that the large number of "fair use" images, as well as the fact that every single scene of the film is described in detail, infringes on the copyright of the film. The content of this article has been moved out of <a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29_dbd6.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey (film)</a> because the main article is too long. For this reason (and because the content itself is inappropriate per the above arguments), merging the content back into the main article is <i>not</i> a viable option. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 10:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Originally, I was going to say <b>delete</b>, but I will ammend this to a <b>conditional keep</b>, if Mr. Palpatine agrees to work on this page with me to refine it, and do further research with citations. It is a film that needs a longer explination than may be given on the front page, but should not be as long as it is (or have so many pictures as it does) now. There <i>are</i> the workings of a good article behind this-- one which may utilize quotes between Kubrick and Clarke for an NPOV and citations. My guess is that if our effort is put towards it, it can be a functioning wikipedia entry by the end of the week. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoplayer_672f.html" title="User:Thephotoplayer"><small style="font-family: Impact; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">The Photoplayer</small></a> 11:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Borderline unencyclopedic. On the other hand well done, verifiable, descriptive rather than an opinionated review, and an influential film. For a lot of other IMDB-top-100 films this level of detail would be insane but for this one it works. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> paper so going into detail is possible. The main article can (and does) have a greatly abbreviated synopsis. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 12:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the proposal <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> describes this situation well, an extended film synopsis (without secondary sources) is too much like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, the impact of the film on the "real world" is more encyclopedic, but that is already covered in <a href="../../../a/_/s/Interpretations_of_2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_c64e.html" title="Interpretations of 2001: A Space Odyssey">Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey</a>.

<ul>
<li>To clarify: If a film synopsis is done by a wikipedia editor, then it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, if a synopsis is done by a secondary source, then wikipedia can discuss the <b>synopsis</b> as a tertiary source, but analysing multiple secondary sources (e.g. synopses) to create a new one, is also original research. Also, this article does not reference <b>any</b> sources, so it's hard to tell which one it is, but neither are appropiate.

<dd>I disagree, editors combine multiple secondary sources all the time; it is only "generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data" by the editor that is forbidden by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. To my way of thinking, collecting information from multiple synopses is not analysis in the sense that WP:NOR means it; it is just "collecting and organizing".<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:57, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article as it stands references <b>no sources</b> at all, so why didn't you include the full listing of your sources in the article, as required by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? What I mean by secondary sources is outlined in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but basically if the article is a film synopsis, then, by definition, it is based on the primary source. The question is then, who is doing the synopsis? If that synopsis is by a wikipedia editor, then it is original research. If the synopsis is done by someone else, then wikipedia could source that as a secondary source, but the article should then discuss the synopsis, but not the film itself. Thus, a synopsis of a film must fall into two categories, either secondary sources has summerised it, and the article reproduces it, which is a problem with copyright, or an editor has analysied several synopses and summerised them, which is original research.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Phrases from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> are frequently used in popular culture. The phrase "I'm sorry Dave" gets 139,000 hits on Google. A collection of memorable phrases from this film can be found at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I would favor an article that gives sufficient context to the most important quotes from this movie so a person who never saw the movie could search on the quote and understand the context of the quote. I don't know how well the article under discussion serves that purpose. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 04:08, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article cannot be merged because there is no encyclopedic content here. It is not a "sypnosis", and aside from the title, it makes no pretentions to be. It very clearly describes itself as an "interpration" of the film. It is not a summary of other's interprations, which already exists at a seperate article, nor an actual sypnosis, which exists within the main article. It is strictly a personal essay, which is further demonstrated by the fact that writer has allowed virtually no changes to the article that he originally created.
