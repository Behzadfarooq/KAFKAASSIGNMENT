<p>This movement does not exist. It's the brainchild of one rabbi in one synagogue in the Bronx, NY. There is no media or scholarly coverage of this movement outside of the movement itself, which must, of course, be excluded. Besides, not having any clear boundaries between orthodox, modern orthodox, open orthodox (go figure...) this article serves as an unhelpful, unmergable vehicle for the promotion of the religious musings of Rabbi Weiss and/or creator user:Shirahadasha. Which is good, but it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. To reiterate, I don't think merging this anywhere is a good idea. The Rabbi is borderline notable, but his ideas don't belong here. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for things invented in synagogue one day. <b>Delete</b>. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 13:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Shirahadasha, just to be clear, are you voting for <b>keep</b>? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 17:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep'</b> Firstly, this article meets the standard criteria in terms of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and sufficient material for a stand-alone article. Secondly, the nomination raises a red herring -- it says there is no evidence of the existence of a "movement". But the article describes it as a philosophy, not a movement. And philosophies are often associated with their founding philosophers, so long as the philosophies are themselves independently notable. As additional evidence of more widespread use in addition to the press coverage, see also e.g. <a href="http://www.ostt.org/pdfs/0607Brochure.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ostt.org/pdfs/0607Brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.hiwp.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hiwp.org" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.discoversydney.com.au/things/synagogue.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discoversydney.com.au/things/synagogue.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.bethjacobatlanta.org/?page_id=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bethjacobatlanta.org/?page_id=20" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. This has attracted enough attention and followers to be legitimately more than something specific to Avi Weiss and to be an approach a substantial number of individuals and congregations subscribe to. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 07:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"This process has resulted in the development of open orthodoxy whereby adherents to halakhah (Jewish law) re-engage both with secular studies, Jews of all denominations and global issues. This movement has its own rabbinic school in New York, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. Some within this movement have experimented with orthodox egalitarianism where gender equality solutions are found through halakhah. This has led to women taking on more leadership roles. Others in this movement are increasingly re-engaging with social justice issues from a halakhic point of view." No. This is trivial to support an article on a new religion. Any books written on it by anyone outside the movement? - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 15:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> <b>Redirect</b> into Avi Weiss and keep all the material in the Open Orthodoxy article as part of Avi Weiss. Rabbi Weiss is very notable and Open Orthoodxy is notable but the ideology is entirely by one person, one author, and one director Avi Weiss. If, and when, they produce other authors and thinkers then it should become its own article. Or if they hold a convention that brings all the fellow travelers of ideology under one tent, then it is notable as Open Orthoodxy. Or when they form their own Rabbinical association. Right now, it is still a one person show. YCT has not produced any notable graduates yet. The movement does indeed exist, and is notable, but is entirely STILL linked to one single person. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 16:34, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find crz much too biased on this one, using inflamitory language of "new relgion" givng his owe definitions of Orthodoxy. Yes, Open Orthodoxy is being discussed at the GA as we type, and is regualrly featured in the Federation Jewish papers. It is certainly more notable and less advocacy than the many many kiruv outreach rabbis who have pages on WIKI. They only have press coverage when they buy ads or put out their own self promotion. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 17:01, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Though it is a fledgling movement in Judaism, it is developing. Yeshivat Chovevei Torah only started ordaining people a few years ago, give it time. I know rabbis from this movement I also know that many Modern Orthodox disparage them and the movement. It is distinct from Modern Orthodoxy and other Jewish movements, and is distinct from its creator, Rabbi Avi Weiss. It deserves its own page. I, by the way, am not part of the Open Orthodoxy movement just so you don't think there is a POV motivation here. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValley2city_89ae.html" title="User:Valley2city">Valley2city</a> 17:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Hehe, no, I've never heard of it. Besides, not being modern orthodox, I am not exposed to the disparagement of the movement. I've never heard of it. Asserting that it's a distinct movement does not make it so. That YCT has only started ordaining people - give it a few year - is a good argument for deletion. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 17:42, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is little to disntinguish most members of the Edah Charadis from each other, and there is nothing to seperate them from their schools. If you dont know the distinctions between the Rabbis then do not comment. Shall we determine Charedi Rabbi by the knowledge of their uniqueness among Modern Orthodox? Maybe we should collapse all Chardi Rabbis into the Chasam SOfer or Satmar Rov?

<ul>
<li>Surely you're joking, Jayrav? I am not disagreeing that Avi Weiss may be a visionary of Modern Orthodoxy, but no member of the Edah Chareidis claims to have started a new Jewish movement. Obviously all Charedi rabbis deserve their own articles like Avi Weiss does, and some even deserve special pages on their philosophy (e.g. <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_im_Derech_Eretz_1d79.html" title="Torah im Derech Eretz">Torah im Derech Eretz</a></i>, which is of enormous religious &amp; social significance and 200 years older than Open Orthodoxy). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 14:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to I-don't-care-where. The information in the article (not necessarily all of it, but most) is interesting and useful and should not be deleted. But "Open Orthodoxy" is a term I've never heard outside of this discussion, and it should not be its own article until it has reached an appreciable and distinct identity.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi_Weiss_8920.html" title="Avi Weiss">Avi Weiss</a>, certainly. I disagree with several points made by some editors, though. Open Orthodoxy <i>does</i> exist, and it <i>is</i> a unique movement. I imagine that it will become more notable as time passes, but as of yet it is not.

<li>It seems that a <b>merge and redirect</b> is in order; the delete votes strike me as odd: do these mean that some people belive that none of this material belongs in the article on Weiss and that this term should not redirect to that article? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:59, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
