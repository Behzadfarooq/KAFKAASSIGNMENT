<li>It seems that this was the first example of an entirely unremarkable genre. The external link that I took led to a nightmare site of vanity URL, frames, Flash, etc., but <a href="http://jg.prose-ac.net/sites/jam2003/html/main/schedule/latest.gif" class="external text" title="http://jg.prose-ac.net/sites/jam2003/html/main/schedule/latest.gif" rel="nofollow">here within all of that is the schedule</a>. It seems to be your average muzak station: DJs play records and chat between them. Decades ago, in my undergraduate yoof at Essex University, we students interviewed guest lecturers and the like -- or at least those who we thought would say something interesting -- for University Radio Essex. (I interviewed Graham Greene's sinophile brother <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Leap_Forward_dece.html" title="Great Leap Forward">Felix Greene</a>.) I don't say that the URE of the 70s was encyclopedia-worthy, but this seems much less so. If I've misunderstood, please amplify the article to describe significant ingredients.

<li>Tentative <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_University_2901.html" title="Hull University">Hull University</a>, but certainly don't delete the information. I don't want this to be read as precedent against campus radio station articles: a campus-originated radio station can have an extremely notable place in the broader community: see <a href="../../../c/k/l/CKLN_a72e.html" title="CKLN">CKLN</a>, <a href="../../../w/f/m/WFMU_cb16.html" title="WFMU">WFMU</a>. I'd lean to merging this instead, as it seems focused entirely on the university community. Per <a href="http://jg.prose-ac.net/sites/jam2003/html/main/advertising/advertising.htm" class="external text" title="http://jg.prose-ac.net/sites/jam2003/html/main/advertising/advertising.htm" rel="nofollow">its advertising page</a>, it covers "the Union shop, the Square, the Continental, laundry areas and over 3000 student homes every day." <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 08:32, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_University_2901.html" title="Hull University">Hull University</a>, which has more than enough room for it, is relatively stubby and short on detail, and currently does not mention the station... and redirect. What is the Wikipedian fetish for tiny breakout articles?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Possibly, but do you also think that if someone bothers to write an article about <i>anything</i> it must be notable? (That too makes sense in a certain way.) Or if radio stations are unusually special, how is this? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:36, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. AFAIK, you must get a license from local authority to start broadcasting, so this makes radio stations special. Student radio stations are more special because they don't get paid for it. 2. I wrote an article on semi-notable radio station myself and I don't want it deleted. 3. I vote keep on almost everything that may have a remote chance to be interesting to someone. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 17:43, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's bad reasoning. If someone writes an article about a broadcasting station, or a small pop group or band, it's sometimes the case that it is one of the persons involved themselves writing it, with the intention of getting it listed on Wikipedia and its mirrors, and thereby <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebomb.html" title="Googlebomb">increasing its Google page rank</a> and the attention of its Google-cruising audience. Wikipedia is a convenient means for people to get around the fact that Google charges a fee for the placement of advertisements. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:17, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm confident there's no other radio station named "Jam 1575", and I'd dare guess there's no other radio station serving <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_University_2901.html" title="Hull University">Hull University</a>, in the world. The idea this is linkspam, or para-commercial advertising for a non-profit, volunteer-run community radio station, doesn't fit this case at all. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 06:45, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>comment:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Actual radio stations, IME, are notable. For instance, being a <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_radio.html" title="College radio">college radio</a> veteran myself, I'm personally <b>very</b> interested to know more about stations outside of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, which is exactly where this station fits in the grand scheme of things. If this isn't notable, I don't see how <i>any</i> university radio station could ever qualify. To me, it's a keeper. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree completely. To me, it's very easy to imagine that some university radio stations are significant and others aren't. Indeed, I've read about some that I'd certainly say are significant. This one too <i>may</i> be significant, but I haven't seen any reasoning for this, other than that it was the first of a certain kind of radio station in Britain. For one thing, I'd like to know if it has any programs to which a moderate number of students <i>listen</i>. I spent some time at a British university recently -- I'll kindly forgo naming it, but it wasn't Hull -- and after some time was surprised to see an ad for the campus radio station. The people I asked seemed hardly aware that it existed. It seemed to be a low-budget imitation of commercial pop music radio, minus the commercials -- a respectable enough hobby for a few who were involved in making it, but of little significance to anyone else. (People had regular radio, web radio, CDs, etc., playing in the background.) Maybe Jam 1575 is entirely different. I'd be happy to hear about the differences, and would consider changing my vote. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:33, 2005 Jan 16 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, not all radio stations are notable. There are many stations that get licences and most are not notable. This is a university radio station - its not notable enough to have its own article. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:52, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
