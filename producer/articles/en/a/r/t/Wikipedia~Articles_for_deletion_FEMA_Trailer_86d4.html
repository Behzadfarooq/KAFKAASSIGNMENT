<li><b>Rewriting.</b> At 19:00, I converted the article "<a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_Trailer_980c.html" title="FEMA Trailer">FEMA Trailer</a>" to "current-event" status, after rewriting and adding 6 sources for facts. Upon close examination, I found the article contained unsourced general information (not "original research" to FEMA), including new events up to last month. Now it is a totally different current-event article, and never was a neologism since FEMA uses the term: "FEMA Trailer Hotline" and such. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 19:15, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's something that will definitely grow with time in both content and citations. Killing the article now would be an exercise in ignorance and shortsightedness.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Convert to stub-tag status and request sources for facts. Allow the originator or others time to expand details. The information is very detailed and, inside the <a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_68a4.html" title="FEMA">FEMA</a> or hurricane articles, the detail would be excessive. The term "FEMA Trailer" is not a neologism but, rather, a combination of the two words.

<dd>- the trailers have propane stoves but microwave ovens;</dd>
<dd>- trailers will only be installed with external electric service;</dd>

<dd>- FEMA has extended the usage-deadline beyond the original 18 months.</dd>

<p>Current news reports have indicated that FEMA trailers were still being issued in recent months, not just in 2005, hence the "current-event" status and not another description of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and such. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 19:30, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">User:Brianyoumans</a>. Simply as a subject, the article fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> because there's really no such thing as a "FEMA trailer"; it's just a catchall term for any trailer that FEMA (or any other government or NGO entity (like the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Red_Cross_30ae.html" title="American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a>) happens to give you after a disaster. If there was actually a specific trailer built for FEMA to FEMA specifications (like, say, a <a href="../../../u/p/s/UPS_truck_a907.html" title="UPS truck">UPS truck</a> is), then you'd have a reason for the article to exist in the first place. But since there is no one such thing as a "FEMA trailer", there's nothing to define, and you end up with what this article actually is: a big <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> violation that wanders all over the place. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:04, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if refocused. We don't have an article on FEMA camps and they're clearly notable, set up on federal land or leased private property in what, about 12 states? Some of this would fit in such an article. There were a number of features on the camps especially in the first couple of months and probably some anniversary articles as well, so they would meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Second, the use of FEMA-issued trailers in disaster zones seems like it's a worthwhile subject, <b>even though</b> most of this article focuses strangely on the trailers themselves when it's more of a social phenomenon. We have a number of "effects of Katrina" articles including social effects of Hurrican Katrina and this could at least be trimmed and merged to fit into that if nothing else. Not to push <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">countering systemic bias</a> too far, but the people in the camps especially were cut off from the media glare and we don't know much about what happened to them. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:05, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Wikid77's revisions and per Dhartung's general comments about notability. also, FEMA trailer isn't a neologism; it's just a handy description.

<li><b>Keep</b>Added reference from 1995 to FEMA trailers used for 2 1/2 after 1992 hurricane. What on earth is wrong with an article on the interim disaster housing currently used to house thousands of American displaced by Katrina or future disasters? Seems well referenced. If this article bites the dust, it could be part of an article on disaster housing: tents for short time, trailers for intermediate term. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The article has useful info, but FEMA haas been providing trailers at least since 1992, so it is odd to focus so much on Katrina response criticisms. That could better be put into <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_government_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina_2efa.html" title="Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina">Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina</a> as a section. Then there could be a section in <a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_68a4.html" title="FEMA">FEMA</a> on housing they make available: tents (or motels or domed stadiums) for the short term, trailers for a year or 2. I find nothing in Wikipedia on "Disaster housing in the U.S." which could become important in the event of various natural disasters, wars or terrorism incidents. The stuff here which is not Katrina or FEMA criticism belongs in an "Intermediate term disaster housing" section. The article seems like too much info on too little a piece of the topic.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 02:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> "Too much information" seems an odd criticism here. If someone isn't interested in the trailers, they can stick with the main FEMA article. Having this much info <i>there</i> would be too much. But providing well-sourced information elsewhere is to be lauded. While it might not interest you, it probably does interest thousands of other people. Having it in a separate article guarantees that it will not overly intrude on those who do not care for this much information, while providing it for others. No reason information about 1992 trailers can't be included, an article shouldn't be deleted for being incomplete. A retitle (with redir) to "FEMA disaster relief housing" would be fine though. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 02:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, at the risk of not being able to shut up. Can we please get past the <b>title</b> of the article, which can be easily changed, and focus on the content. It matters not if the title is a neologism (and it's not), the title can trivially be changed to FEMA disaster relief housing or something. As to notability, these have quite substantial coverage from the NYTimes, CNN, and MSNBC. What is the standard for notability? Google News usually only keeps article two weeks to a month; "FEMA trailer" yields <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22FEMA%20trailer%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22FEMA%20trailer%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">170 unique hits</a>, which to me says notable non-neologism. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 05:58, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I was neutral about this article in its initial form, but this rewrite needs to go. The original at least attempted to describe a FEMA Trailer as a subject, but this is attempting to describe some sort of possible recent culture connected to U.S. hurricanes in a region. All of that is terribly biased, since FEMA's distribution of trailers is not a new concept or limited to that region. The article as it now stands does a bad job of representing an NPOV and, quite frankly, appears to be an attempt to capture some sort of cultural phenomenon that may not be encyclopaedic at all, and may be more of a construct than a reality. Without strong academic sourcing (the sort which likely won't come until many years from now if it is to come at all), this sort of thing just doesn't seem to belong. If this article were actually focusing on the history, purpose, and use of the FEMA trailer, it might be more acceptable, although I would then likely be more inclined to merge it with FEMA; however, the article as it stands needs to go.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Certainly not a neologism. (243,000 google hits for "FEMA trailer".) Something directly relevant to hundreds of thousands of people, has been in national and international news.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as this is not a neologism. As the article states, this is what FEMA itself calls the manufactured housing.<a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=30718" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=30718" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:39, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an official US Govt. designation and the topic is important in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The article should be kept and improved. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 19:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I prefer this wording for the title (though it should probably be moved to <a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_trailer_a2fb.html" title="FEMA trailer">FEMA trailer</a>), but if people are hung up on the "neologism" issue, it could easily be at FEMA use of trailers or some such. I'd appreciate it if those advocating deletion would explain whether they would merge <i>all</i> this information into the FEMA article, which I think would be excessive detail there, or, if they wouldn't, then which information in the article they would instead expunge completely from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 10:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It may be government terminology, but it is one that is in use by the print media as a term no longer needing explanation. There is a real phenomenon here. Parts of the article may still have sourcing issues, but I have complete confidence that there would still be an article worth having after any (if there is any) remaining original research was removed. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
