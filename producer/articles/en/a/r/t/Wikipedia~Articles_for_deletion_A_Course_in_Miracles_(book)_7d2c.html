<li><b>Delete or Merge.</b> I resubmit this nomination. I don't see how sidestepping the problems mentioned above would resolve them. Rather it seems to me that it would merely compound them. If editors wish to improve the main article, or to divide the article down into a 'book article' and also a 'movement article' then it seems to me that this first needs to be discussed and agreed to on the article discussion page. This 'book' article seems to me to be quite POV, calling the students of this book a 'cult', and attempting to place what seems to me to be undue attention on a single contributor to the early publication of ACIM who was a transexual. Please do not delete this discussion until after it has had due time to be fully discussed here.</li>

<li><b>Clarification:</b> For what it's worth, the article calls the book a "cult favorite". It does not say that the devotees are a cult. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The term "cult favorite" does not mean <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> per se. Movies, such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_bb05.html" title="Rocky Horror Picture Show">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a> have been referred to as "cult favorites". The term simply means that a particular item holds a great deal of appeal, is perhaps even a centerpiece of the lifestyle of, a comparatively small portion of the overall population. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Deletrix_fe81.html" title="User:The Deletrix">The Deletrix</a> 05:57, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The term <i>cult</i>, when applied to a religious movement in any direct or indirect way, may also imply certain additional connotations beyond simply <i>a group of unusually devoted movie goers</i>. It seems to me that there might be other more effective and less potentially misleading terms or phrases to use here than the term used by the Publisher's Weekly author, such as perhaps the phrase "which has managed to gain a significant group of devoted students." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scottperry</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottperry_457e.html" title="User talk:Scottperry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scottperry_ff53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scottperry">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>I agree.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Deletrix_fe81.html" title="User:The Deletrix">The Deletrix</a> 00:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regardless of what editors <i>think</i> the word "<i>cult</i>" means, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">policy</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research." Therefore any individual <i>opinion</i> about the word "cult" is up to the reader, and our jobs are to provide the reader with reputibly verifiable previously published information. Ste4k 01:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless this is Wikisource, some interpretation and synthesis of source material <b>is</b> required to write the most objective and neutral and verifiable of articles. Refering to ACIM followers as a cult can't be defended by refering to the word "cult" found in a secondary source and saying "look, it's verifiable!" because it is clearly taken out of context. Have you not seen enough people distort the meaning of Biblical text by pulling it out of context to support some non-neutral agenda? There is no difference here. Neutrality of articles requires thinking and interpretation on the editors part and this is a component that cannot be removed from article writing, again, unless this is Wikisource or Wikiquote. Nor should you say Wikisource is built on verifiability-not-truth, for it is surely through verifiability that you are hoping to retain the truth, for it <i>is</i> what you value. —<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 19:58, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see your point, but the statement in the article does not refer to "ACIM followers", whatever or whomever those might be. Here is the statement: "<i>It became a spiritual curriculum for many individuals and study groups, well over a million copies have been printed, multiple foreign-language editions exist, and it remains a cult favorite.</i>" I read four different things there, none of which necessarily have to with one another unless one injects a personal bias. The word "<i>cult</i>" itself, only has negative connotations to people whom have only experienced the word from a negative perspective. From an objective NPOV perspective, and from the perspective of PublishersWeekly, this is the term used to distinguish a small religious group from a large religion. The entire first section also gives accolades for the number of books sold. Do you believe it impossible that there is a significant portion of 1.5 millison readers that like cults? The nominator says, "<i>calling the students of this book a 'cult'</i>". Do you think that this statement is true? The nominator also says, "<i>undue attention on a single contributor to the early publication of ACIM who was a transexual.</i>" The contributor in question put forth $440,000 as the initial catalyst and was very open and proud about gendre issues during a time (70's) when "out of the closet" hadn't even yet come out of the closet. The contributor is now deceased, but has left an educational foundation as a legacy. To pull out from the entire article only these two terms and express fears of bad connotations seems to be done from a biased point of view rather than neutral. The term "ACIM" by the way is considered to represent only a faction of the full population that reads books of this title. To present a neutral perspective, factionism should be avoided.

<li>Why hang on to "cult" and quibble over its meaning.

<li>I think it would be helpful on the nominator's part to contact each of the people that voted on this matter earlier, since the nominator believes the reason is different enough to re-open a closed discussion that the other parties believe has been closed and dispensed with. Or if the nominator believes that the question put forth is wholly the same as put forth by the former nominator, then the seperation between <i>Original</i> and <i>Resubmitted</i> sections should be removed. If the latter is the case, then my procedural vote will be striken. Ste4k 01:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>A unified article structure or a fractured one?</b> Should this article (and the logic of its creation) remain, then the previous main article on ACIM would essentially have to be deleted and a new article only about the <i>movement</i> would have to be started. This article seems to me to be an attempt by its creator to sidestep the traditional Wiki process of dialogue with the editors of the main article, and to ultimately thereby delete it. I do not agree with the logic of the creation of this article, and I believe that this discussion should be clarified. It chould be clarified here that either there will be two articles: one about the <i>movement</i> and one about the <i>book</i>, or there will be only one article about both. It seems to me that this is what this discussion should ultimately determine. No?</p>
<p>If this is an accurate assesment of what we are discussing here, then the question essentially becomes: Is the <i>movement</i> better fully described <i>apart</i> from the book article or <i>within</i> it? It appears that the creator of this article has not actually read much of the book itself, but instead has mainly focused on the external circumstances of its authorship and early publication, which admittedly are unusual. The actual contents of this book repeatedly stress the need to steer clear of formal organization. Thus no formal officially sanctioned <i>movement</i> has yet formed around this book, but instead the majority of its students focus primarily on independent study of the book. By this I mean that the original editors and publishers of this book have never sanctioned the formation of such an organization, and the majority of its students do not belong to any such formal organization. I do not see why this <i>movement</i> deserves a separate article in Wiki.</p>
<p>I believe that the creator of this article would do best to follow the traditional Wiki course of dialogue with other editors rather than attempting to delete the main article via what seems to me to be a rather circuitous procedure here.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge into main article. There is useful content in this article that would benefit the other article. Once merged, address the various issues identified with each article and build the merged article into something better, using consensus editing. Delete as POV forks any new ACIM-related articles that crop up unless agreed to on the talk page of the main article. The merged article may get big enough to justify subdividing, but don't do this until the merged article is otherwise in very good shape and a consensus evolves for how to subdivide it. NPOV, consensus, verifiability, encyclopedic -- all are much more important than article length. They're also much more important than whether Wikipedia has two smaller articles or one bigger article.

<li>I purposely left the material that was incorrectly merged into this article alone. The rest of the work was my own, and as previously stated, obviously a POV fork, whatever that is. I do not want any of my contributions to be associated with this topic at all. It has already been <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">pointed out</a> sufficiently that nobody wants to know the truth underlying this topic, and researching the matter has only generated accusations of bad faith, etc. Ste4k 15:48, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Surely, and I can appriciate your desire to not be involved with this topic. It has generated quite a few misunderstandings. It is because I understand the value of your contribution and your desire to bring facts and objectivity to this topic that it can't be fair either to you or the WP community to allow it to be simply deleted. The information you have collected at the above revision is neither a POV fork, not-notable, nor unverifiable, so it can't be fair to the community to simply revoke the information in virtue of your being the lead contributor. Again, I can understand not wanting to be a part of this project anymore, and not wanting your name associated with it. Can we agree, then, to allow the work to be viewed and understood as if were community-authored, and on its own merit? I think it is very important that we reach a decision that is fair to you and the community. —<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 19:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The past has already occurred. The future cannot be predicted. There are possibilities that neither of us can even consider at this juncture, which looking back upon, a year from now perhaps, we might both say to eachother, "Oh my, had we only had the wisdom not to print that." Hindsight has been granted us to realize how irrevocable the future might be. A truly neutral position is seen as despicable from all perspectives, being contrary to any of them. It is only your opinion that there is value to my contribution at this time. What I propose is as equally fair to me as it is to the community. Ste4k 20:08, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that no one could write an article and have no motive and no conception about which viewpoint was the more truthful. Still, I think there is a difference between having a point of view while understanding and respecting the dissenting perspectives, and having a point of view antagonistic to dissenting perspectives. I can understand and respect your viewpoint and yet disagree, but for respect of it, want to talk about it. Discussion would surely be pointless otherwise. Similarly, there are a lot of things I've commited to print that I've later disagreed with, but for respect of it (and really myself), continue forward, willing to continue making mistakes for the sake of learning from them. Surely your viewpoint is not so antagonistic or despicable, else what would leave me here talking with you, totally unconvinced? —<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 21:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merging two topics which are contentious to each other, which discuss different topics under the same name, only serves to provide more ambiguity rather than disambiguate the title. It would be better to provide the information in an article that is complete, and which has a better topic name, etc. The information that this article contained is not lost and will be re-introduced at such a time when it is more of a complete topic with better research. The article's existence under this name is misleading at best. Ste4k 13:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
