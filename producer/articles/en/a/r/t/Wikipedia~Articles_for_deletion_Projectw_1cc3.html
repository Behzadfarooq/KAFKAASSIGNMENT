<p>Yes thats true but they do boast a membership of over 300,000 registered members in just about 2 years. I believe that is a large enough pool of people to permit us to make a wiki about it. It is one of the largest players in the warez scene and i have seen much smaller boards have a wiki. -Zabzu</p>
<ul>
<li>That assumes that they aren't lying. Or creating thousands of fake accounts, which is the same thing, really. Either way, every single source I found on google was either a primary source, a blog, a personal website, or just using their email addresses to recognize contributions.

<p>ProjectW gains over 500 new members a day. It has 2347603 articles. I have seen much smaller sites have wikis and i think you should give our a chance, the site can only grow. We have members from almost every single country in the world. As soon as the Admins get on i can access the tracker info to show you how large and well represented projectw is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're entirely missing the point. You must have reliable secondary sources to get an article. We don't keep articles because their subject is big, without reliable secondary sources. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 03:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Secondary sources to back up the content? Warez boards are usually not officially listed as warez but i can prove that it is one of the 20 largest phpbb boards.</p>
<p>omg! all this discussion... ok, but to come to the point.. can we have the article or not?</p>
<p>here is a source, on of the 20 largest warez board, in fact projectw would be number 9 <a href="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members" class="external free" title="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members" rel="nofollow">http://rankings.big-boards.com/?filter=phpBB,all&amp;sort=members</a> they refuse to lost Warez boards and other adult content but in fact if you sort by members ou will find projectw fits into 9th place</p>
<ul>
<li>OK. 9th largest warez board. We'll assume it's true.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Is projectw notable for that reason alone? 9th isn't all that impressive.</li>
<li>If not, is projectw more notable than any other big warez board? If so, why?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If you can't answer these questions, the article will likely be deleted. <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 03:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>More important is this:
<ol>
<li>Are there reliable secondary sources on which to base the content?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If there aren't, the article will almost definitely be deleted. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 03:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>i still do not understand what you mean by secondary sources. IS big-baords not a secondary source?</p>
<p>And no projectw is also notable for the fact that It is the largest warez forum on the internet. When people download warez they have two choices, a bittorrent client or a forum and the number one forum is Us.</p>
<p>Also ProjectW beats the other warez competition in the fact that we have almost double the members of our two competitors and we are affiliated wiht other large warez sites such as katz.ws</p>
<ul>
<li>Now wait. Are you the largest warez site, or 9th largest? You've claimed both. Also, Bigboard's rankings are based on self-reporting by the sites, which is unreliable at best. Has the site been mentioned in the media at all? Size *alone* isn't a reason to have a Wikipedia article. --<b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 04:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are the Largest Warez Board and the 9th Largest phpbb board. That clear? Also this is the most reliable way to track the size of these boards.</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This is one of those cases where lots of g-hits does not imply notability. Any site devoted to the Warez scene has the potential to be drastically over rated by the google test as a result of top100 lists, leech sites, mirrors, and content hosting sites. In very rare cases (such as the Pirate Bay) outside media attention makes a pirating site notable. In this case, the article reads like a teaser for the forum, and I honestly don't see how a well formatted NPOV article could say anything beyond "ProjectW is a warez community with a good number of members". <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:gold;font-variant:small-caps">-bobby</em></a> 14:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not the obligation of those in an AfD debate to prove something is not notable. It is the obligation of those seeking to keep an article to show multiple independent mainstream coverage of it. Claims of how many members there are from the website itself are not verifiable or independent. I found no mention of "Projectw" in a database of 4,000 publications, but I did find numerous articles about the persons operating such sites getting convictions for software privacy. Warez is notable, this one site is not so far. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When the article makes a claim, I'm afraid the onus is on those deleting to make the case that it is a false claim (or that having requested proper citation to verify no verificaton has been produced).
