<dd>That's from the first 20 pages of Google hits. I believe that would show it had had some effect outside it's community. Oh, and most of them don't name the lead characters, so your "elimination of false positives" was more like elimination of anything that didn't give the full storyline. In fact, a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Pure+Pwnage%22+%22FPS+Doug%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Pure+Pwnage%22+%22FPS+Doug%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google search with FPS Doug included</a> gets 10,200 results. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKel-nage_e5d8.html" title="User:Kel-nage">Kel</a>-<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKel-nage_73a2.html" title="User talk:Kel-nage">nage</a> 00:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Site's forum shows 11672 registerers. Within minutes of the last episodes release, hundreds of people already started downloading via bittorrent (500 or so, I recall).

<li><s><b>Change Subject</b></s> The title sounds like the gaming concept of "Pure Pwnage," which should be an article. The article's picture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nonoobs.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nonoobs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nonoobs.jpg</a> is good and demonstrates the concept. Yet, the article is about some website and pretty boring. "...is a webisode series by ROFLMAO Productions featuring a Canadian professional video game player named Jeremy. The show portrays the making of one "gamer's life". Settings for the show include Toronto and occasion..." &#160;::ho hum:: It's all this person's life and that. <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Gaming_a042.html" title="Power Gaming">Power Gaming</a> is an article. <a href="../../../g/o/d/God-moding.html" title="God-moding">God-moding</a>, too.

<dd>What competitive online gaming have you done? Ownage, Pwnage, Owned, Pwned, Pure Ownage, Pure Pwnage. It's an expression that means to beat someone easily. In military for instance, the 2-week (or so) destruction of Iraq's former government (the aftereffects were bad, but the initial victory was easy), The Vogons destruction of earth, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vadar_da8f.html" title="Darth Vadar">Darth Vadar</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lexx_9889.html" title="The Lexx">The Lexx</a> blowing up a planet.

<dd>A lot of articles are fascinating, including science and math ones. Those aren't boring to me. Thanks for the link to the article name. Odd in <a href="../../../p/w/n/Pwn.html" title="Pwn">pwn</a> 5 "citation needed" tags. I've often seen editors remove the information if it's unproven, as well as remove citation tags claiming it is unnecessary, as well as articles filled with information lacking citations that can be proven wrong (and editors revert any citations that prove otherwise), etc. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 14:46, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Since there is already an article on this subject, I'm not sure how to vote. Basically I think the article needs a lot of revising. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 14:50, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you may've missed what the article concerns. The article does not discuss the concept of "pure pwnage" (i.e. those frags looked like pure pwnage). The article concerns the popular web based show about a gamer's life. It has little to do with the "pwn" article. <a href="../../../n/c/a/User%7ENcannino_abd7.html" title="User:Ncannino">Ncannino</a> 15:58, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It seems like it may be somewhat vain now, but I don't think one should go as far as to delete the entire article. It definitely requires cleanup, and then perhaps some information on its impact on society. At the moment, I can't find any more good evidence of notability to add to the ones above. The best thing I can say (empirically) is that I've played in lots of CS:S servers with a large amount of players, and in many of them, there are people who seem to recognize the "BOOM HEADSHOT!" and FPS Doug when I acted like an FPS Doug fanatic (for jokes, of course). Hope that can help, somehow. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHeteroZellous_ad35.html" title="User:HeteroZellous">HeteroZellous</a> 19:22, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very obvious keep</b> Not to be too vulgaric here, but all I can say is FUCK YOU. 11 000 registered forum members, and let's say, that about 4/5 of every viewer does not register, yet regularly follows the show? Dig your fucking head off your ass, if you want to go CONTRIBUTE to Wikipedia, (which you obviously can't, but you should give it a try) then go CREATE and ADD, don't fucking start PROPOSING DELETION OF A REMARKABLE THING such as Pure Pwnage. Now may I ask you, have you ever fucking even visited the website, seen any episode, or otherwise fucking seen that Pure Pwnage is a serious project and has at least 40 000 viewers and 1,5 million web page hits?
<ul>
<li>Free advice: the only thing your rant above did was made me itch to change my vote from Keep to Delete.

<li>I think better said than the above rant: it looks obvious to me that someone took a glance at the article and thought "a videogame show? words like noob? this must've come from some teenagers and can't possibly entertain an intellectual like myself." Then that person decided his lack of interest qualifies as vanity and should merit deleting something that many people, in fact, have interest. 65.6.109.43 02:36, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>•I believe that the descriptions of the individual episode plots should be deleted because they have nothing to do with the show's importance, and that they detract from the humour of the show. Facts such as the release date, the running time, and memorable moments (songs, quotes, shots, etc) should be the only items included in the episode descriptions.</dd>
