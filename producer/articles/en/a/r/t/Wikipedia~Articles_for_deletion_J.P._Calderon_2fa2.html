<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Full disclosure, I wrote the article. The article is about a nationally-ranked college athlete who went on to become an acknowledged (albeit admittedly not particularly successful) professional, who has been/is part of the cast of two different reality television series. The nominator acknowledges on the talk page that there are already two sources noted in the article (The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Sun_f34a.html" title="Calgary Sun">Calgary Sun</a> article and the <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a> article), along with several other references which he dismisses for various questionable reasons, but then goes on to claim that the two <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are somehow "not notable" enough to sustain the article. Nominator hangs the AfD on his contention that someone would have to finish 4th on Survivor to be notable (a contention which as far as I can tell is unsupported in policy or guidelines) and on his dismissal of two reliable sources as "non-notable" which makes no sense. Scorpion redirected the article without comment and, when I restored it, redirected it again with the rationale that there are other Survivor contestants who are more notable but who don't have articles. This is an invalid rationale. A subject's notability is independent of another subject's notability. If the hundred other Survivor conestants are as or more notable than Calderon, then Scorpion or whoever else is free to write articles about them. Their absence is not an excuse to delete this article. There has been nothing offered in terms of either Wiki-policy or Wiki-guidelines under which this article is not acceptable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>They are not absent because nobody wanted to create them. They are absent because they have <i>already</i> been deleted.

<li>Which brings me back to the point that the notability of one subject has no bearing on the notability of another.

<li>'<b>Merge and redirect.</b> I read the debate, which seems to center around the question of whether 2 sources automatically qualifies as "multiple." For this issue I came down on the side of delete (really M&amp;R) because of a different consideration. I consider this person as unlikely to do anything notable in the future <s>(i.e. his "career" ended with the show)</s>. If he had gotten a movie deal or something similar that would keep him on the radar, then I would have voted "keep." 2 sources is on the fence -- it could go one way or the other -- but since this person seems unlikely to ever get more attention I say merge. (Before anyone flames me, I'd like to note that this isn't policy, or a guideline, or anything. I know this. The problem is that the guidelines are few in number, and in this case don't clearly tell us what to do. And since they are just that -- guidelines -- it doesn't make sense to interpret them literally. How many sources constitutes "multiple," for example, varies depending on the nature of the article.) --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:32, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jeff Varner become a noted reporter, as did Hunter. I have no problems with them having pages. Sundra was in several TV shows before Survivor, again no problem. There are far more notable Survivors whose pages have been deleted because they weren't considered notable, thus taking his time on Survivor out. Apart from that, all he has is some minor reality TV show and once again, there is precedent because few raialty contestants outside Survivor, The Apprentice, American Idol or The Amazing Race have pages. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 16:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Sourcing looks fine. Given that independent coverage is avaiable, and that some of the people who "placed" don't seem any more likely to "do anything notable in the future", it seems a bit arbitrary to draw a line at "final 4". It also seems a bit unwieldy to merge all these contestants into the parent article.

<li>Yeah, that was basically my point when I said that even though those two are technically "multiple" that I didn't interpret them as being sufficient in notability, because as you say they're just standard interviews that everybody does. Even the very first person voted off, that's only on the show for 1 episode (as one of ~20 people there for that hour) gets his TV guide interview published, and gets to appear on a talk show the next morning and the whole thing. But by the next week you've already forgotten who he is, and by the time they do the reunion show nobody even recognizes him. His 15 seconds of fame is over, and he's already an unfamiliar face. Basically, he's non-notable, in spite of a couple interviews he gave during that 15 seconds. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 20:49, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> How so? Here is the entertainment related criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and it's already been established that being on Survivor alone isn't enough for a page.
<ul>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>) - <i>Nope</i></li>
<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person - <i>All of the interviews were mandatory Survivor interviews conducted because of his Survivor involvement, not because of his self notability</i></li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a>, <a href="../../../g/q/_/GQ_8d36.html" title="GQ">GQ</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/ELLE_7ea6.html" title="ELLE">Elle</a>, <a href="../../../f/h/m/FHM_6b72.html" title="FHM">FHM</a> or national newspapers. - <i>The only articles cited are mandatory interviews that come automatically after elimination. Meaning that none of the interviews were conducted because of his notability</i>
<ul>
<li>I think he clearly passes this criterion. Why does it matter if they are "mandatory"? In addition, as Otto has shown, he may meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for his involvement in college and professional sports. I am not a survivor fan at all, by the way. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 15:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following - <i>No indication of that</i></li>
<li>An independent biography - <i>Not much of a biography</i></li>
<li>Name recognition - <i>They didn't even tell his last name on Survivor</i></li>
<li>Commercial endorsements - <i>None indicated</i></li>

<li>You know, I recently argued for the inclusion of Calderon on his talk page believing that he satisfies WP:BIO and WP:NOTE and someone dismissed them, saying "It's just a guideline, not a policy." I'm trying to remember who it was who was so dismissive...oh right, it was <a href="../../../j/2E/p/Talk%7EJ.P._Calderon_f5c3.html" title="Talk:J.P. Calderon">you</a>. Kind of odd that you're arguing for WP:BIO to be the measure today when you dismissed it yesterday...</li>
<li>Note that WP:BIO also has guidelines for athletes: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States." Calderon competed for <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University%2C_Long_Beach_67aa.html" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a> in men's volleyball and coaches women's volleyball. CSULB's article notes that its men's and women's volleyball teams are both highly nationally ranked. He is also a ranked player by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Volleyball_Professionals_a59d.html" title="Association of Volleyball Professionals">Association of Volleyball Professionals</a>, which its article notes is the premiere professional beach volleyball league in the United States. I have already acknowledged that his pro volleyball career has not been stellar but that doesn't mean that his volleyball career should not be considered in addition to his appearances on Survivor and JDMA. I happen to think his reality TV career is by itself sufficient to establish notability but his TV cast appearances plus his sporting career are definitely enough to qualify him as notable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hey, you said to cite some guidelines, and I did, so don't get angry and keep in mind <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. I looked at that Volleyball article, and very few of them have pages, not even the two players who the article claims were the top ranked in 2005. Precedent has already been established for Survivor articles, and if not even the top ranked AVP players have pages, then the main reason for his page is JDMA, which he hasn't done anything of note in, and by the way, none of the contestants from that article have individual pages, not even JDs page is linked from there. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 03:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
