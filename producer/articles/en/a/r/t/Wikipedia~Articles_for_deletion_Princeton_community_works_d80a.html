<p>This article will start/inspire more entries by others on the subjects of Non-profits management, Non-profits fund raising, Non-profits board issues, Non-profits marketing, Non-profits PR, Non-profits low cost Web usage, etc. This group helps many low-budget and low-profile non-profit/volunteer groups survive and grow. This group offers workshops and will share knowledge with other similar groups in the country. Many such groups and organizations are not tech-savvy to be know on the Web. This entry in the Wikipedia may help other such groups to learn and grow. This group has provided free help to other volunteer/non-profits for 9 years and made significant impact to the society. It does not make sense that when many users come to Wikipedia and can't find "Princeton Community Works." Please give us comments to help us KEEP this entry. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangWeiHsing_60b8.html" title="User:WangWeiHsing">WangWeiHsing</a> 05:35, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many adult sites may have a huge number of hits on Google, but it doesn't mean that they should have a Wikipedia article. An entity doing significant work cannot be judged by just Google hits. This group is helping hundreds of small/low-budget volunteer groups, and could be the only training they receive in the entire year. These small(some are large) groups touch the lives of at least a hundred thousand needy people, or solve society and environment issues. If you are part of this kind of low-budget group, you understand that they cannot spend money on building Web presence -- although they should learn to do it at almost no cost. However, if they go to a library and use the Wikipedia, can they find Princeton Community Works? Any local school can have a Wikipedia entry if it is done right, any local community foundation should not be denied an entry, either. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangWeiHsing_60b8.html" title="User:WangWeiHsing">WangWeiHsing</a> 14:03, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please vote only once. Duplicate votes are not counted and just make it more difficult for the administrator to tally everything correctly. You ask, "if they go to a library and use the Internet, can they find Princeton Community Works?" The answer is YES because the group has a web site that's the first result when searching Google. Nobody is denying that Princeton Community Works does good things; just that it is not worthy of a Wikipedia article at this time. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 16:55, 4 November 2005 (UTC) Thanks, the error is corrected as above.

<p>All those duplicate comments on 'not notable' or 'not worthy' are not healthy and not agreeable among Wikipedia community. You knew it, you have seen it, you have been there, done that, right?

<p>Please don't just go around and cast your vote on this same reason, read more and think more. Why get in the habit of deleting others' entries with 'not worthy/not notable?' If you don't have a 'real' reason, your vote looks like you are showing your anger at what others may have done to you.</p>

<li>Those of us who patrol AFD regularly are very familiar with what you're citing. Note that none of that is actual policy, but discussion on how we can improve the deletion process.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't care a jot about notability, but one half of this is unverified (if it is a significant workshop, where is the press about it? external sources? verification?), the other half is just a list of attendees at a yearly meeting (Wikipedia is not a directory). A workshop that - as far as I can tell - rents a hall in Princeton University's Frist Center once a year really needs something more. However noble it may be, this is just advertising, not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 10:51, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please excuse us if we seem brief in our criticisms, because as you can see there is a large volume of articles that get nominated for deletion every day! Basically, articles need to be encyclopedic, both in subject and in content, and some people think that your subject is non-encyclopedic in that you haven't demonstrated why it is relevant to anyone outside of the local community. Ways to demonstrate this would be to show that it is unique, special, or unusual, or that it has received considerable press in several reliable, fact-checked publications like books, large newspapers, or the like. Unfortunately, many people try to use Wikipedia to promote or advertise things, and there is often a strong reaction to the appearance of this, which is what I think you may be dealing with here. The best examples of Wikipedia articles are the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a>, and all of them contain multiple sources (as I said, books, significant news reports, and so forth) to back up the facts that they provide. More specifically, articles like <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome_Trust_4ffb.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Helsinki_Human_Rights_Group_8b1b.html" title="British Helsinki Human Rights Group">British Helsinki Human Rights Group</a> provide a good model of the kind of verification that articles need. If you have offline materials (note that they still have to fulfil the criteria of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>) you don't need to scan them, just reference them as detailed in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. I will warn you, though, that the bar is set pretty high, and there will have to be some extraordinary proof that this is more than just an annual conference attended by some community groups (there are literally tens of thousands of such meetings, few of which would be encyclopedic).
