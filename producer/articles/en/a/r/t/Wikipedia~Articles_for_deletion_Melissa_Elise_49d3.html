<dd>The defined reason for deletion was because one cannot attribute that she did or did not appear in <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kiddy_Grade_e83d.html" title="Kiddy Grade">Kiddy Grade</a> based on the fact that she is non-notable. Which is an unjustified reason. And <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> appropriates this as his reason in the very same place on his <a href="../../../h/a/t/User_talk%7EHateless_a584.html#Mellisa_Elise" title="User talk:Hateless">talk page</a>. Just because she is not particularly famous, that doesnt constitute as a valid reason for deletion, mainly as an encyclopedia is for the collection of information, irrelevant of how important that information is. Look it up in a dictionary. I made the page to rid of red links on the <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kiddy_Grade_e83d.html" title="Kiddy Grade">Kiddy Grade</a> page, nothing more nothing less. I am not a particular fan of this person, I just do not want the red link. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 19:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are two ways to get rid of a red link. One is to create an article; the other is to edit the page and change the link to plain text. The second is often the better choice. Always consider both options. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also a page about a person cannot be expressed on a separate page. Consider having <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> bio on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> page.

<li><b>Comment</b> The cast list is editable, and you could change the entry from <b>[[Melissa Elise]]</b> to <b>Melissa Elise</b>, which would eliminate the redlink.

<dd>Speedy deletion refers to these things. Patent Nonsense, Test Pages, Pure Vandalism, Recreation of deleted material, banned user, housekeeping, author requests deletion, talk pages of pages that do not exist and office actions. None of these refer to unimportant persons. And under A7 (Unremarkable persons) it refers to AFD to decide if the subject is worth deletion. Which is what has eventually been done, after the original (without proper reason) speedy deletion was imposed. Thus hateless actually broke policy.</dd>

<dd>Thus under all this the above Delete is unfounded and an affective break against policy, AFD is designed to decide this, but if AFD refers to articles which refers to AFD no decision can be made.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I don't see where the criteria for a speedy deletion really applies here. This article is not up for a speedy delete. AFD is an appropriate venue for articles that may not qualify for inclusion in Wikipedia under the appropriate guidelines but do not qualify for a speedy delete. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 20:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'<i>Comment</i> The criteria for speedy deletion applies from here(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65597414" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65597414" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and here(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65598478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melissa_Elise&amp;oldid=65598478" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) as he asserted that it should have been. Also the rules that contribute to delete an article are stated as this "The articles for deletion (AFD) process, supported by two companion processes, speedy deletion and proposed deletion". Deletion policy (<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>) refers also to proposed delete, which does not apply and AFD, which is currently under way. The reason that this is brought up under AFD is also because deletion guides and thus speedy deletion indicate to bring this to AFD as described earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Basically policy indicates purely and simply to refer to AFD and thus AFD must make the decision, but because of this AFD cannot refer to policy for its reasons because policy directs to AFD. The need to delete this page doesn't come any non-AFD criteria, as described earlier, and is based entirely on wether or not this article is useful. Melissa Elise is a recent voice actress and she is soon to have many more roles. This page will have to eventually be made anyway, and is there really a reason to delete it? It isn't spam or anything else. This has started to become personal... --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 21:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>After all that, I the Author of the page Melissa Elise propose Deletion, under the simple fact that the aforementioned person has no biographical information available and that all information on the page is contained elsewhere and that no more information will be available as this only instance of voice acting was in 2002. I will contact an admin for deletion. (Thank you Fan-1967, your comment, though simple, was the simple solution.)</b></p>
<p><b>Comment</b> AFD is the way we Wikipedians get together to determine if an article is appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia. Policies such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> and, to a lesser extent, guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> help to set the standards for these discussions so they don't fall into a free for all. While <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> tells us to list an article on WFD to gain consensus, it also specifically instructs us to use guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as an aid in determining notability. Trying to argue that policy doesn't apply to AFD is not likely to convince anyone but yourself. You state above that Melissa is "soon to have many more roles" but one of the tenets of Wikipedia is that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is Not a Crystal Ball</a>. Perhaps we should wait to see if she actually does get some more jobs instead of assuming that she will. If and when she does, that is time enough to add her. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 21:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
