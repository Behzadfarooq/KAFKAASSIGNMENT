<li>I do not think that this article should be deleted, namely because it seems to be a fascinating part of history. I, too, did a google search, one for Truelove Eyre, and a number of websites came up. All members should google search for Truelove Eyre before they either vote to delete, lest wikipedia should be deprived of a very interesting historical entity. And, if google hits for the Eyre Empire are rare, that is probably because the entire thing went on within one family. I've been doing my homework, and there IS an Eyrecourt in Ireland. Go to yahoo.com, and search it. Then try google, and britannica. Tourists go there now. Add to that, there is a large inland body called, "Lake Eyre," in Australia. Deleting this article would be silly, and deprive students and history buffs of a topic that is not covered very often.</li>
<li>i dont know how to vote on this thing, but i agree w/the last person. That articles cool, its helping me with my paper. you should leave it up.
<ul>
<li>Please note that both anonymous comments above were added by the same IP address, 68.18.24.191. Also, i reformatted the comments to make them easier to read, but did not alter the content. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz"><font color="green">Foobaz</font></a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz"><font color="brown">✐</font></a> 19:12, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The comments would naturally use the same IP address, as they're coming from the same computer. I posted a comment here some time ago, as has my sister. It seems utterly ridiculous to me to delete this article, especially when there is such an abundance of outside reference for it. Go to google and look up Jehu Eyre. You have to search around a bit, but it's there. How does one vote not to delete? Also, look up, "Eyre Coat of Arms."
<ul>
<li>68.18.24.191, if "there is such an abundance of outside reference for it," why didn't you cite them in the article instead of having everybody else search for it? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 20:47, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The answer for that is simple: I did not write the article. However, I still stand by what I said; I'm not a history person in the sense that I don't enjoy it (though I do not quite a bit about it because of some wonderful teachers), yet this piqued my interest. My sister and I both have to report on a historical family (she's doing the Hapsburgs), and these people just seemed like a very fascinating bunch. Plus, there are about five different people who routinely use this computer, which means that when I have to do research, I need it FAST. Wikipedia has become my academic crutch, especially in terms of history. I've always liked it because it features articles on things that aren't always widely known. If I, a high school student, can find information on google to back this stuff up, then surely wikipedia can recognize said article's validity. Trust me, google, yahoo, it's there. Just do what I did and you can see these sources for yourself. I'll ask my friend about all of this...he is a real whiz with history.

<li>Funny, when <i><b>I</b></i> Google for "Truelove Eyre", I get zero hits.

<li>Certainly. Go to YAHOO.COM (NOT GOOGLE) and type "Truelove Eyre" into the search bar. A list will come up. Numbers 1 and 5 give a history about the story surrounding this man and his family. Poke around the other websites there, because I've only had time to look at a few. This is all very exciting!

<p>Keep: some of the websites behind it seem fairly genuine. And one of the blogs, imperialpress.blogspot.com, does offer a history section that positively identifies the link between William the Conqueror and Truelove Eyre through Edmund II. Go to the archives section, November of 2004, and read the article, "House of Eyre Came From House of Wessex." A number of other families established similar domains: the Angevins (not widely known), the Plantagenets (not widely known), the Hapbsburgs (not widely known among Americans), etc. Also, the Coat of Arms is real, that's on yahoo.

<dd>The claims on that page are not backed up by any references or sources at all except a brief mention of "newly unearthed records".

<p>Keep and Tweak: as an (enthusiatic) student of medieval studies, I have come across similar articles in stories over the years. Most of what this article says is accurate. However, I would recommend something; while most historians confirm that Truelove Eyre did exist, some of his ACTIONS are a bit murky, said to have originated in legend. (There is a similar story that says Truelove knew King Richard the Lionheart, a sheer impossibility due to the fact that they lived in separate centuries). The author should clarify that while Truelove is widely acknowledged to have founded the Eyre Dynasty, the WAY in which he did it is still disputed. Also, some source citations wouldn't be a bad idea; you can find the stuff, but it's inconvenient to search. Other than that, keep it. It would be a shame to get rid of an article that deals with one of the very few things able to last through the Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Industrial, and Modern Ages. 168.184.90.11 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.184.90.11.html" title="User talk:168.184.90.11">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.184.90.11_1928.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.184.90.11">contributions</a>)</p>

<p>I stand by what I said yesterday, and what the two people there have said completely proves my point. The whole Truelove Eyre thing must be rooted in some fact, otherwise the family crest (which we've all established existed) wouldn't bear the leg symbol. I went to imperialpress and found it quite helpful. The fact that there even IS controversy at the site that Hyperzonk cited shows that there is some sort of historical basis for Truelove Eyre. I agree with the other ones. Aside from Truelove, we now for a fact that this family exists (especially as many of the links listed on THIS PAGE take readers to sites detailing Eyre descendants now living in the US). The article is a website about a rich and influential family called "Eyre." We now know that that family is a factual part of history. So, not counting the Truelove Eyre thing (which should be modified to reflect his mythical status), the article should stay. 68.18.24.191 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.18.24.191.html" title="User talk:68.18.24.191">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.18.24.191_7191.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.18.24.191">contributions</a>)</p>

<p><b>Enthusiatic Keep and Edit</b> This is a good article dealing with historical fact and should not be trashed, but I annoyed by several things. First of all, the author mentions "Leroy Heller's descendants," yet fails to reference some of the most important among them. To begin with, Leroy's son, Stanley Heller, the chairman of a Philadelphia bank and presumably the rightful heir to a resurrected Eyre Empire (should that unlikely day ever come about), is entirely skipped over. This leads me to believe that the author had a less than full knowledge of the subject matter. Stanley Heller is a significant descendant and should be listed. Secondly, another of Leroy's granddaughters holds a high level position for CDC and another works for a Democratic senator. Why haven't these things been included? Anyone with enough knowledge about this, please edit the article, or I will. I say, ANYONE WITH ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE, because it's not a widely known subject except in some royalist and medieval historical circles. So, if you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to fix this because you'll just make it worse. <b>Elizabeth</b> 168.184.90.11 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.184.90.11.html" title="User talk:168.184.90.11">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.184.90.11_1928.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.184.90.11">contributions</a>)</p>

I have no vote on this issue yet; I'd just like to provide some actual Google hits here, so as to clarify that this is NOT NONSENSE. It may not be notable, but it's not nonsense, okay? Sheesh. Note that many of these are for "Truelove who was henceforth called Ayre/Eyre", or similar phrasings.

Enthusiatic Keep and Edit This is a good article dealing with historical fact and should not be trashed, but I annoyed by several things. First of all, the author mentions "Leroy Heller's descendants," yet fails to reference some of the most important among them. To begin with, Leroy's son, Stanley Heller, the chairman of a Philadelphia bank and presumably the rightful heir to a resurrected Eyre Empire (should that unlikely day ever come about), is entirely skipped over. This leads me to believe that the author had a less than full knowledge of the subject matter. Stanley Heller is a significant descendant and should be listed. Secondly, another of Leroy's granddaughters holds a high level position for CDC and another works for a Democratic senator. Why haven't these things been included? Anyone with enough knowledge about this, please edit the article, or I will. I say, ANYONE WITH ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE, because it's not a widely known subject except in some royalist and medieval historical circles. So, if you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to fix this because you'll just make it worse. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistory21_c579.html" title="User:History21">History21</a> (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistory21_199e.html" title="User talk:History21">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_History21_4a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/History21">contributions</a>)</p>
<p>CZAR TO MAKE TRIP TO THE CAPITOL; FEBRUARY 16, 2005(OLD CALENDAR) The Imperial Compound is confirming today that Czar Arthur is planning on making a visit to Washington, D.C. this summer, where he will be given a VIP tour of the Capitol and will meet with several senators in the Senate Dining Room for luncheon. The czar's second cousin, Princess Alicia (a granddaughter of Senior Dowager Czar Leroy and a niece of Dowager Czarina Marie), who has overseen a Senate office for the last twelve years, will be host to her royal relation. Proponents of the Eyre Empire see it as an enormous step in the right direction. It will be Czar Arthur's first official trip since being crowned head of the resurrected financial dynasty in December. It will also serve as the first meeting between an Eyre monarch and a government representative since the spring of 1929, a milestone that many say is representative of the family's rejuvenation. Dowager Grand Duchess Augusta, mother to Grand Duchess Anna and Czarevna Mildred, was thrilled to hear the news. "This is the best thing that could have possibly happened," she said. It has also confirmed many in their thoughts that the empire is rising once more. “It’s like everything is happening at once,” said Grand Duchess Anna, referring to other recent events within the family (see articles below). The Imperial Compound has promised to keep the Imperial Press updated on these events.</p>

<p>No, that is my blog. I, for one, do not appreciate insinuations that I am A. trying to spam. or, B., writing under false pretenses. Not once have I tried to log in under two different names. In fact, I haven't provided any. And the above passage "I am a wiki user," was contributed by someone other than myself at a different area of this site who had the kindness to let me copy and paste. The moronic insistence at this sight (with the exception of some people, whom, I can assure you, are not myself in disguise) to deny historical fact because the majority of the history came from a murky time just makes me laugh to myself at the hypocrisy of the "contributors," who, in this case, have become, "detractors." Grow up and learn to properly use a computer. Also, a dictionary wouldn't help; you misspelled, "You're." <i>comment by anonymous user 68.18.28.36</i></p>
