<p>This article is becoming a POV mess between Armenian and Azerbaijani editors. Both sides have expressed a desire for this article to be deleted once and for all. This article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Khachkar_destruction_a9b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Khachkar destruction">nominated for deletion earlier</a> with a conclusion of <b>keep</b>.

<dd>Not acceptable. I appreciate you being bold, but there isnt any call for you to "fix this mess" on your own. The only way a nominators withdrawal would be reason to close is if the article is left in the original state before the Afd. The consensus so far is that this article should be kept as-is. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:06, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Withdrawing your nomination indicates you are happy for the article to remain in its original condition before you nominated it. The admin can still close it as "keep" or "no consensus" or whatever they feel is appropriate. Withdrawing your nomination will probably have little bearing on the admins approach to closing this Afd. If the admin decides "keep" then it would be a brave person to redirect the article soon thereafter, effectively overriding the closing admins decision. I'm not sure how familiar you are with the Afd process, but typically if a redirect is an appropriate outcome for the Afd, people will vote/comment along the lines of:
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article.html" title="Article">Article</a>, reasoning".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If others agree, that is usually what the admin will do when they close the Afd. If you think that a redirect is the appropriate outcome, you need to suggest it on this Afd (down the bottom please) with a good reason for doing that, taking into account what Atabek has mentioned at the end of this Afd. All discussions regarding the outcome of this article should be discussed here; not on some talk page somewhere. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> There should be an article about the destruction of khachkars in the Azeri occupied province of Nakhichevan. The current article is just a total mess.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 15:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> <i>First</i> articles about disputes between ethnic or political group have a very strong presumption to remain in WP. WP is not an ideal version of the United Nations, in which such disputes could be settled, or the issues definitively clarified. Our role is to provide a neutral forum in which all such allegations can be discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When people want to suppress such an article, it can either be dissatisfaction that one's own side is not being treated fairly, or a realization that the fair treatment of one's own position will lead to conclusion contrary to one's own interests. Neither reason is valid. There is no subject which cannot be properly edited, if necessary by a third party. If both sides think a neutral article unfair, this can be seen as a demonstration of prima fascia NPOV. And if a fair article does in fact show one party to be unambiguously in the wrong--as is sometimes the case--then there is all the more reason to prevent the persecution from extending here. WP is not censored, and this does not just refer to sex. The majority of the editors here will not be personally involved in any one ethnic controversy, and an article fairly edited will express what will usually be a fair view of the range of public opinion. Let each side say in the article what it can, with opinions expressed in 3rd party quotes supported by references. The reader will judge. (And the reader will get some guide to judgment from seeing who it was that tried to prevent the article from appearing.)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Second</i> it is an abuse of process to renom articles indefinitely or at short intervals in the hope of getting a favorable verdict eventually--and the recent case of the D.B. article exposes the absurdity of our continuing to permit it. There is no written policy preventing it specifically; perhaps there should be. Personally, I would extent the general idea of 3RR to at least a limit to three tries a year at no shorter than three-month intervals, or--much better-- 1RR, one try a year. But policy is made also by the community in its decisions here, and it should refuse to entertain quickly repeated tries. Without reference to the particular parties here, I would say that a nom this quickly is often indicative of bad faith. WP:VAND defines Vandalism as editing content in such a way as to disrupt WP. Common sense would interpret this as including any attempt to disrupt WP by deleting content through the use of the WP processes. Until such behavior is accepted as appropriate for a RfA, we can at least discourage the behavior by voting keep on repeated noms unless there is truly reevaluation of the evidence or obvious injustice. It is good to see the many eds. already saying this.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 18:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Requesting for deletion can be done by using common sense, in this case the initiative was taken when I said that it would be better to delete it. This was not done in bad faith. There is an ungoing Arbitration case involving <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Armenia-Azerbaijan_2091.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan">Armenia-Azerbaijan</a>. This article was created during the case and involve it. My reason into proposing it, which resulted with the proposal itself, was that the creation was innapropriate. The timing is innapriate. What was supposed to be Khachkar destructions, which was reported in various notable publications such as The Independent <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article621782.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article621782.ece" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, The Times <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article707673.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article707673.ece" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or the Archaeological Institute of America. <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/djulfa/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/djulfa/index.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. But what happened was that Adil and Dacy started toying with the article, disturbing it. I have proposed their banning on the Workshop and believe that until proper measures are taken by the Arbcom, it is better to delete this article to not cause further disruption. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm sick of this. It seems that nobody has any idea about the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict here on Wikipedia. If they did then they'd vote for deletion of this article. Here we are debating the validity of deletion even after Artaxiad, this article's own creator voted for its deletion (that has to count for something). -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 14:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does not count, because once the article is created it belongs to Wikipedia and the creator has no ownership on it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 14:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article, claimed by Artaxiad as POV, was created by him. I don't see a reason why it should be deleted after the evidence of destruction in Armenia is included as well. Obviously, by first creating the article and now trying to delete it, Artaxiad does not hide the agenda of creating the article with a sole purpose of attacking Azerbaijan. Aivazovsky's forwarding to Julfa is also unacceptable (although I am sorry for him "getting sick" over it, as he stated above), because Julfa is the territory of Azerbaijan, while destruction of khachkars is alleged on Armenian territory as well. So this is obviously issue separate from the topic of Julfa. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 21:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article was redirected to <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julfa%2C_Azerbaijan_%28city%29_04da.html" title="Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)">Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)</a> twice by <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a>, apparently in consultation with <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> according to the edit log. Dacy69 and I have each reverted the redirect once; my reason is that someone should have mentioned the redirect here first in order to gather consensus. This is a sensitive issue, so the right thing to do is stick to the book and move slowly. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 21:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Redirect was not agreed with me, I just did not object to it on a certain condition. I agree that I should not have discussed this in private, and all the discussion should be on this page or on talk of the article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 22:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julfa%2C_Azerbaijan_%28city%29_04da.html" title="Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)">Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)</a> on the condition that an article specifically on this topic will not be created again. Let's make it public then. Is that agreeable? -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 23:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, if the current Khachkar destruction pertains to destruction in Armenia as well, then redirect to Julfa would confuse the issue and limit it to Azerbaijan only. So the answer is no, it's not agreeable. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 00:06, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay then, what if the article was <b>deleted</b> with the condition that an article specifically on this topic will not be created again? Would that be acceptable? This article is becoming a major headache (and I'm sure there are others, both Armenians and Azerbaijanis who agree with me on this). -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 00:34, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
