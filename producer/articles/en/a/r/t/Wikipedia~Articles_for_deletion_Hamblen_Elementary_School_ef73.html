<dd>That's a little misleading. Virtually all verifiable real school articles for several months have been kept. Looking over a year, it's the overwhelming majority. It's often the those wishing to delete, which will point this out. We don't delete municipalities, and we don't delete schools, if they are verifiable. I find it annoying that some people miscontrue deletions of schools lacking verifiability (which I've voted and/or nominated for deletion) as being a general allowance for deleting a verifiable school. We should not be deleting articles on an entirely random basis, as you're currently seeking. Please, don't try to go back in time, and undo what's done. This is a waste of time, and we all know it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I don't think you mean to misinform, your comments are potentially misleading. You say don't "undo what's done" as if there had been some inflection point where policy changed. That is not the case. There is no consensus on a policy to keep all schools. The fact is we <b>do</b> delete schools that are not notable. I agree with you that we should not be deleting articles randomly, we should be doing so based on their importance or non-importance. The waste of time is in creating articles on non-notable subjects, which then take time to delete or (worse) take time to police them for up-to-dateness and vandalism in the case they are kept. Editor fatique is a real problem on these non-notable articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please give a full list of recent examples of AFDs that resulted in K-12 school articles being deleted, that did not involve verifiability issues (or copyvio), but were strictly based on "notability". <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_2005_b29c.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005</a> seem to disprove your point.

<dd>"Non-notable" is your own opinion. How many times have you reverted vandalism to a school-related article?

<dd>Amen. The vandals tend to hit the big articles which makes it really frustrating if you're trying to do a good edit on one of them. Yes, some do vandalize the small articles, but there are bots and people who just pay attention to the "recent changes" page to take care of that. Even if vandals DID focus on "small" articles that would not be a legitimate reason to delete, as we don't delete based on the possibility of vandalism. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 23:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you're saying John Seigenthaler didn't deserve a page? Anyway, defamatory content can, and often is, posted on chemical pages that are not commonly viewed, but are important nonetheless. The problem isn't with obscure articles. It's with anonymous vandals. However, Wikipedia is based on the idea that anyone can edit, so vandalism is a risk the community is obviously willing to take. I don't think the possibility of vandalism existing in the future is a proper concern in the deletion process, but I realize you feel differently. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 00:28, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Let's see. You can't find anything wrong with the current content (or history since June), so you manufacture some scenerio that might happen in the future. Shall we also delete all the RAMBOT township articles because somebody might write "<i>Mayor skinner molested me.</i>"? As somebody who regularly edits and watches many school articles, I *know* how absurd your claims regarding vandalism are (though like any article area, it obviously exists as a problem). As somebody who rarely edits school articles (except to nominate them) you simply don't know what you are talking about. At least research something before commenting. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting indent) I'm not digging through deletions outcomes on schools becuase it is irrelevant how many schools have or have not been kept in the last few months or the last few years. Just because a <a href="../../../c/a/b/WP%7ECABAL_ad8b.html" title="WP:CABAL">cabal</a> has formed to try to blindly keep all school articles, regardless of notability, does not mean that the rest of us are to be intimidated. The fact is that even with the cabal to protect every school-phone-book entry, there has been no change in policy to protect schools from deletion. My arguments about vandalism apply not just to schools but to all non-notable articles. Schools are no different from restaurants or shopping malls. If there is something special about them, then by all means lets have an article about them. If not, then lets delete them and get on with more important articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:45, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many of us spent a lot of time (wasted judging buy your comments here) discussing this issue. I personally started out from your viewpoint. However at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> the only possible compromise was the merge to district or town page with no loss of content and a redirect in place. You may well disagree with this but until you have gone through the archives you will not appreciate this position. Not to mention reopening the can of worms will just waste a huge amount of time from your own perspective. The original goal was to reduce the number of school AfD's since they serve no purpose other than to cause fights. As Rob says, how many verifiable schools have been deleted recently? It is a fools errand to persue this to the end game. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 03:03, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No to being a member of the cabal (so far as I'm aware) because he does not participate in auto-pilot keep-voting. No to being intimidation because he says he thinks people should relax, which is very different to inflamatory language such as "you don't know what you are talking about". However, I think his recommendation is a bad one. Especially when he says <i>The argument "what if someone did this particular thing 100,000 times" is not a valid argument against letting them do it a few times.</i> You have essentially demonstrated what is wrong with this statement when you tout the fact that some non-notable schools have survived deletion as an argument why all non-notable schools should survive deletion. That is exactly the danger with letting these kinds of articles stand. They continually lower the bar for what is to be included here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re: "you don't know what you are talking about". He has a point. Have you read through the archives on this discussion? They are long and tedious but necessary because all your arguments have been made before. As I said above, i was saying exactly what you are saying now.

<dd>What compromise would that be? What Rob is saying is that schools don't get deleted very often, so just keep them all. That is not a compromise. To answer your question, I am familiar with the debate over schools. I think some of the best arguments are in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Delete" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Delete</a>. So, yes, I know what I am talking about. I am aware some people want to keep all schools, regardless of whether there is anything special about them or not. I am aware some of these people have tried and failed to establish a policy saying we should keep all schools. I am aware we should be discussing here this individual school and whether it should be kept.

<dd>No I don't mean the project page i mean the talk pages, see the archives here: <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia_talk%7ESchools_074b.html#Archives" title="Wikipedia talk:Schools">Wikipedia_talk:Schools#Archives</a>. These arguments (delete, merge and keep) have been discussed to death. The compromise was that crap school articles can be merged and the school page would be maintained as a redirect. Do i think this is a good compromise? Not really. i do think it is likely to be the only comproimise that can work. Read the archives and see what you think. You will find that your position was well represented at the table. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 04:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have not read every word of the discussion, but I have read large chunks of it. My favorite quote is "merged crap is still crap" - which Rob said at one point in Archive3. If I understand the context correctly, he was arguing to improve articles to good quality, versus just merging stubby stuff together to make it look more "keepable". However, there is no compromise there, as far as I can tell. Just within the past 24 hours the proposal has been marked as rejected policy<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47213567&amp;oldid=47209185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47213567&amp;oldid=47209185" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Rob agreed to this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47214505&amp;oldid=47214348" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Schools&amp;diff=47214505&amp;oldid=47214348" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Therefore, I don't see how any compromise has been reached. I see that we are left to discuss each case here on its merits, just as we do for non-school articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Rob supports that move since there is a description of how to write a school page on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. i did notice man in blacks 'reject tag' although i was not quite sure what it meant. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html#Current_proposal_for_schools" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools#Current_proposal_for_schools</a> seemed to be a workable solution to keep schools out of AfD and therefore to stop these huge long discussions which are time sinks. i still think that solution is better than the strife that comes from AfD and schools. Crap yes worth my time no (although here I am again doing just that). <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 04:34, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I and probably most people, didn't really love the merger compromise. But, we accepted it, as the best so far. I voted to oppose it as *official* policy or guiedline. But, it was me, who put the merge compromise wording onto to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> page itself (so it wasn't just on the talk page). I also regularly cited it in AFD. This was an effort, to support compromise, even when the compromise, wasn't my personal version. We all gotta live with a lot of stuff we don't like. That's the only way this thing works. You have to understand the compromise doesn't have to be official, to be used. No new policy is needed to do merges, as policy has always allowed that as a regular editing decision. However, some people misuse <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>, and mistakenly used it to justify deletion. All the confusion over its meaning, led me to accept labelling it as a rejected guideline. Anyways. For this article here, I will happily accept a merge/redirect, even though it's not a perfect solution. I don't vote "merge" per se, because some misinterpret it as being "like delete", which it is not. Paradoxically, you've increased the chances for a stand-alone article. Had you just done a redirect, I doubt anybody would have minded. I have done nothing to prevent a compromise, and we can easily have a compromise for this article. Once the AFD is over, a discussion of what to (e.g. merging) can be done. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:53, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because the articles on towns start from material generated by a bot from a <i>reasonably</i> comprehensive, authoritative, accurate, and up-to-date database, and therefore the collection of town articles taken as a whole, is <i>reasonably</i> thorough, reasonably consistent in style, and reasonably accurate.

<dd>RAMBOT census places (which you refer to) applies to a country with 5% of the world's population. All the issues with currency apply to all the other places in the world (95%). Articles on places outside the U.S. is one of the largest areas of *human* created articles (full articles, stubs, and substubs). Thank goodness we don't waste time on AFDs on all those articles. Incedently the *vast* majority of those human made articles (with no bot maintenance) have no claim of notability, yet remain one of the most valued parts of this project, and are what attract a large portion of readers and editors. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:12, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
