<p>Furneaux Grove is a little cul de sac street in Whitby, New Zealand. It was named after 'Furneaux', a sailor abroad the Endeavour with Caption Cook. It is a beautiful street and has been the home to some very famous people. Rolling Stones member, Mick Jaggar lived in number 7 Furneaux Grove when he was a child from 3-8 years old. Elton John lived there also in Number 5 and neighboured Mick Jaggar. Britney Spears and secret step- brother Tommy Lee also grew up in the gutter adjacent to the brick wall. Furneaux Grove has had some very unforgivable events happen. Maryln Munroe overdosed on sleeping pills on Furneaux Grove in the bushes and Osama bin Larden held his victims hostage in the drain pipe of Furneaux Grove. Prince Charles and Princess Di got married on the grass turf there too. Furneaux Grove is a legendary street, to all.</p>

<p>The Wheeler-Kenyon System is a method of archaeological excavation. The technique draws its origins from Mortimer Wheeler's work at Veraluminum (1930-35), and was later refined by Kathleen Kenyon during her excavations at Jericho (1952-58).</p>
<p>The Wheeler-Kenyon method involves digging within a series of 5x5 meter squares set within a larger grid. This leaves a (1 meter wide) freestanding wall of earth--known as a "balk"--on each side of a unit. These vertical slices of earth allow archaeologists to compare the exact provenance of a found object or feature to adjacent layers of earth ("strata"). During Kenyon's excavations at Jericho, this technique helped discern the long and complicated occupational history of the site. It was believed that this approach allowed more precise stratigraphic observations than earlier "horizontal exposure" techniques which relied on architectural and ceramic analysis.</p>
<p>There are several problems associated with the Wheeler-Kenyon Method. First, this stratigraphic dating technique can only be applied to a site that has formed in identifiable layers; this criterion excludes many sites in North America. It also cannot be used on large-scale projects, and leaves no opportunity for re-excavation by future archaeologists using improved techniques.</p>

<p>Forever Will Burn is a metalcore band with melodic death metal influences, from Cape Town, South Africa. Forever Will Burn's sound mixes crushing riffs, double bass drum patterns, and furious screaming-growling vocals with melodic elements. Their music is heavily influenced by the Gothenburg music scene. A key feature of the band's sound is the use of complex single-note and power chord riffs featuring dual-guitar harmonies. Forever Will Burn Has also played along side bands such as Sepultura, Entombed, Most Precious Blood, Konkhra and Soulfly to name but a few. They are one of the most driven bands around today and work as hard as anyone. Always pushing themselves to make each song better than the last one, Forever Will Burn now feel ready to branch out and see how far their music can take them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-09_aaba.html" title="Edit section: DJ AB">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>DJ AB</b></span></h2>
<p>DJ AB is a DJ/Producer in the genre of dance music, and has forged his own space in dance music history. DJ AB's first big break came when popular night clubs, named "Palms" and “Midnight Shift” on Oxford St, Sydney, Australia played his first debut white label track – “Prove Your Love” with the vocals from Taylor Daine with phenomenal success and soon became a club anthem in the gay scene world wide. However although taken well, this sparked a certain degree of controversy regarding its copy right status to BMG records, this however, boosted DJ AB’s status to new heights, as he became a recognized and respected producer, even though he was only eighteen at the time. (2005)</p>
<p>The downfall however came when his other tracks, such as his remix of “Venus” flopped and was given very little club play. DJ AB was very disappointed with this outcome. The major flaw was, however, he once again blended house, 80’s pop and HI NRG Scouse House which was his signature sound at the time, therefore it merely sounded like a recycled version of “Prove Your Love”.</p>
<p>DJ AB felt it was time to take a new direction in his musical creation, and forge a new and exciting sound that would captivate audiences world wide, and this was a one of his golden moments in the dance scene, with “I Got My Money Right”, using the vocals from the hip hop group, Ludacris. This track gained momentum almost instantly and shot to the top position in the club play charts world wide. With its infectious eurodance and commercial trance influence and delicious pop hooks, this track was a dance floor filler.</p>
<p>Things once more began to look up for this young and talented producer, and with his striking good looks, and charming charisma, he became a pin up boy for one of the hottest night clubs in Sydney, ARQ. (He is the one with the black hair.)</p>

<p>This amazing opportunity allowed him to become not only a recognized producer, but a sex symbol nation-wide, as be graced the covers of SX and Sydney Star Observer.</p>
<p><br />
Soon afterwards, DJ AB signed a contract with Central Station Records, and produced a hard-style vocal trance track with his vocalist Natalie Craven, (DJ AB Feat. Natalie Craven) named “Show Me A Sign”, a cover from a previous dance act named Kontakt. However, although it had phenomenal success in the Trance charts initially, it quickly fell out of favor within a few weeks. To make matters worse, the Kontakt’s label picked up on this activity and since it was released on vinyl, they attempted to file a law suit, luckily, and agreement was reached and all the records were promptly deleted from stock lists.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, DJ AB and Natalie Craven issued a brand new track, named “Natural Disasters”, this track however, was only placed in DJ PROMO CD’s and was not signed, due to the lack of club play and an over all lukewarm response. The future looked bleak for this new project, and a quick change in musical direction was quickly issued, they favored a new electro-pop house flavor to attempt to break into the booming house music scene. The track was entitled “Infectious Love”. This became a hit in Australian dance music, and work on a debut album began. However, record companies were hesitant on releasing it as a CDM due to the previous law suit Central Station Records faced and “DJ AB Feat. Natalie Craven” disbanded and fell into the obscure world of dance music one hit wonders.</p>

Natalie Craven) <a href="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/2462/cdcovegrs3apmf5.th.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/2462/cdcovegrs3apmf5.th.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/2462/cdcovegrs3apmf5.th.jpg</a></p>
<p>After several months of silence, due to the disgrace his tainted name as a producer, he issued a statement to his fans saying “[[Image:<i>Yes I know mistakes were made, big mistakes, but life is a forest, and dark patches will be encountered, but you can only be half way into a dark patch to be half way out, a clearing is always in sight. I’ll be back rocking the clubs very soon.</i>]]”</p>
<p>Sticking to his word, DJ AB shot back up to the club charts and issued “Downtown 2006” (August 2006) which became a club anthem within weeks. DJ AB is in talks with Central Station Records to release it on vinyl and hopefully, a CD single. A close source to DJ AB has revealed that a massive remix of “Lambada” will be a follow to this track, just in time for the Australian summer.</p>

<p>Samuel Ruben (1900-1984) created the mercury cell and later developed the zinc mercuric oxide battery more commonly known as the alkaline battery a revolutionary new battery technology first brought to fruition during WWII. The new battery worked extremely well in diverse climates like the tropics where hte military needed ways to power its radios and flashlights. His partnership with Philip Rogers Mallory created what would eventually become Duracell now one of the largest battery companies in the world.</p>

<p>The AT&amp;T Alliance Information Architecture is an information architecture or data model developed by AT&amp;T Labs in the UK and New Jersey together with inputs from British Telecom. It attempts to describe many of the entities utilised within a telecoms business support system (BSS). The model originates in work carried out in Turkey in the mid-1990s by AT&amp;T Labs UK and further developed in Switzerland during the later 1990s. From 1998 onwards AT&amp;T's alliance with British Telecom saw rapid development of the model, and during 2000 the model was submitted for patent in the UK, Canada and the United States by AT&amp;T and BT.It later formed a principal submission to the TMF Shared Information/Data (SID) model, of which it forms a considerable component.</p>

Byiomi-koop (literally meaning "useful language") is one of the most recently created artificial languages and is made by a Finnish artist and language philosopher Mikko Hotti in the late 2006. Byiomi-koop holds only a few speakers around the world who use it as a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_franca.html" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a> so it's categorized as a minor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">constructed language</a>. Roughly put, the language isn't based on anything, which separates it from most constructed languages. Some similarities to Finnish, Japanese, English and French can be noticed, though. This is due to the fact that the developers of this language speak the languages mentioned.<br />

<p>I am = Mizvico ko<br />
You are = Mizvico-kan ko<br />
He/She is = Mizvico-ket ko<br />
We are = Vimbevico kon<br />
You are = Vimbevico-kan kon<br />
They are = Vimbevico-ket kon<br />
<br />
to be = ko (plural form: kon)<br />
Those pronouns are fairly interesting if they're translated; mizvico means "me" and mizvico-kan means "another me" and mizvico-ket means "that me" and so on.</p>
<p><b>Word order</b><br />
The word order in byiomi-koop is always<br />
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT + DEFINITIVE WORDS<br />
eg. I eat food in the kitchen (Mizvico mussu ba m'jamm ite kitta)</p>
<p><b>Articles</b><br />
Just like Japanese, Byiomi-koop does not use articles.<br />
Eg. I have a car = Mizvico age mobi (I have car).</p>
<p><b>The Genetive Case</b><br />
Simply add the suffix -ers to the word, eg. the cat's car (mjuers mobi).</p>
<p><b>The Object Pronoun</b><br />
The object pronoun is always "ba", eg. Klez ba mussu (smell food). When something is done to something or something is a part of something, use "ba".</p>
<p><b>Particles</b><br />
in/at/on = ite<br />
(in kitchen = ite kitta)<br />
from/out of = bram<br />
(from the store = bram stratte)<br />
to (somewhere) = zhir<br />

Pervasive learning is a social process that connects learners to communities of devices, people, and situations so that learners can construct relevant and meaningful learning experiences, that they author themselves, in locations and at times that they find meaningful and relevant. (Quote by Siobhan Thomas on www.pervasivelearning.org)</p>
<p>A pervasive learning environment is a context (or state) for mediating learning in a physical environment enriched with additional site-specific and situation dependent elements – be it plain data, graphics, information - and learning objects, or, ultimately, audio-visually enhanced virtual layers. Learning is the processes through which knowledge is acquired, shared and developed. (Quote by Hundebol &amp; Helms on www.dream.dk)</p>

<p>The Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped is a religious sect from the fictional work Slapstick by the American author Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</p>
<p>In the novel, which takes place in the future, the United States has collapsed and the prominent religion is the Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped, in which the underlying belief is that Jesus Christ, believed to be the savior, has already returned to Earth, but has been kidnapped by the "forces of evil." Followers believe that Jesus Christ must be found and rescued, otherwise God will strike upon the world with his wrath. According to the beliefs, all followers must spend their time looking for the kidnapped savior until he is found.</p>
<p>The church began as a small cult in Chicago, but eventually became the most popular religion in the United States.</p>
<p>Instead of the popular Christian icon, the Crucifix, the Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped has a symbol that depicts Jesus Christ facing forward, with his face in profile. He is gagged, handcuffed, and chained to the ground with a single tear leaving his eye.</p>
<p>Followers are characterized by the constant jerking of their heads, they are doing this in a continuance of their constant effort to find Jesus Christ.</p>

The Doze Family is a fictional family from the National Sleep Foundation. It follows the stories of different family members and their sleep cycles.<br />
There is Joe Doze, who works at a big business and has trouble sleeping. There is Jane Doze, Joe's wife, who works a night shift at a local hospital. There is Minnie Doze, who is a teenager and has more energy, and there is Grandpa Doze. He has trouble sleeping at night due to the fact that he takes naps during the day.<br />
