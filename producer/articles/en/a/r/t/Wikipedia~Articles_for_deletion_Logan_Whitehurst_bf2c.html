<p>To begin with, it's hard to call the page a memorial page when it existed long before the subject passed away.</p>
<p>I prefer to begin addressing the claim of notability by analogy. Logan Whitehurst is to the Velvet Teen -- a band which does warrant inclusion on Wiki -- as Pete Best is to the Beatles. Pete Best has an article, despite having no claim to fame himself except for having been a member of the Beatles before they became famous. Given that the Velvet Teen is notable, it stands to reason that Logan Whitehurst's page belongs here as much as Pete Best's.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Logan Whitehurst released six albums and has been acknowledged by indie labels such as Pandacide and Slowdance records as a notable figure. Dr. Demento, Pab Sungenis, and Nigel P. Stinkwell have all played his music on their shows. Dr. Demento and Pab Sungenis have dedicated entire broadcasts of &gt;30m to his music and his memory. While the actions of these three individuals (and probably more who I'm not aware of at the moment) do not constitute a major radio network, they are nationally known. Dr. Demento's show is syndicated and gets airplay on major radio stations, so this could be argued to count.</p>
<p>Along with the Velvet Teen, Logan Whitehurst has gone to Japan on tour. Sources: <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/v/velvet-teen-040814.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/v/velvet-teen-040814.shtml" rel="nofollow">popmatters.com</a> <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=89347&amp;category=32741" class="external text" title="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=89347&amp;category=32741" rel="nofollow">Portland Mercury</a></p>
<p>On his second to last album, members of Death Cab for Cutie and Pedro the Lion -- both notable bands -- recorded with him.</p>
<p>Another thing of note, though unrecognized by wiki as notability as far as I know, is that much of his popularity came from MP3.com.</p>
<p>All this and I haven't even mentioned his artwork which has appeared on the covers of releases by The Velvet Teen and Tsunami Bomb.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There's no question in my mind that Logan Whitehurst's page belongs on wiki. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerise_55d3.html" title="User:Cerise">Phil</a> 21:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Logan toured internationally (wiki criteria 3 for musician notability) and was the subject of a half hour or more radio broadcast (wiki musician criteria 11) on the nationally aired Dr. Demento show (<a href="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd07.0107.html" class="external text" title="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd07.0107.html" rel="nofollow">January 7th, 2007</a>, and <a href="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd03.1012.html" class="external text" title="http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd03.1012.html" rel="nofollow">October 12, 2003</a>.) In addition he was a founder, lyricist and drummer for the wildly successful group "The Velvet Teen", which is notable by wiki standards, and wiki criteria 2 for notability of lyricists says "Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above." In addition, he was a highly visible and well known artist in the Northern California indie music scene, and apart from his musical talents was an accomplished graphic designer, creating <a href="http://www.loganwhitehurst.com/artwork/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.loganwhitehurst.com/artwork/index.html" rel="nofollow">album art</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_Bomb" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_Bomb" rel="nofollow">Tsunami Bomb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Boy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Boy" rel="nofollow">Dynamite Boy</a>, and many other bands. There is no doubt in my mind that Logan meets wiki's standards for notability. FilmCow 22:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there are basic, sourced assertions of notability. Article just needs work.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 23:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Not only are all the other keep arguments still valid regarding <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but I have done a lot of work on the article to better assert his notability, include more sources, and provide a whole lot more information about his actual career than his death. The disparity there was among the reasons it was speedy deleted as a memorial site in the first place. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrot_4fa3.html" title="User:Albrot">Albrot</a> 05:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the primary requirement for notability is that the musician in question "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." As was noted in the Deletion Review discussion, there have been multiple, non-trivial, independent published works, although these were not adequately cited within the text of the article. I have edited the article to incorporate additional citations to these independent sources. Argument about individual WP:MUSIC criteria doesn't seem particularly fruitful to me, because these criteria are simply those which imply the above-stated central criterion, which is, in my view, met. Nchaimov 00:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability is apparent under the guidelines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the recently edited article better conveys this notability than the original, deleted, article did. This may have been a better candidate for cleanup and expansion than deletion to begin with. PabSungenis 23:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
