<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a How-To guide. The entire purpose of the article is to document the procedure on how to extract the salvinorin from the plant itself. So it's not a "random" drug making guide, it's a guide specific to Salvia Divinorum. That doesn't change the fact that it's still a how-to guide and needs to be removed from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 03:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I created this article. I thought this information was inappropriate and distracting from the main <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin_A_fd75.html" title="Salvinorin A">Salvinorin A</a> article, which was getting a bit too long. I definitely did not want to start an edit war of any sort, and I apologize if I inadvertently raked up an old conflict. If people want to throw it out altogether, I suppose that's also an option, but I definitely would hate to see it go back into the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin_A_fd75.html" title="Salvinorin A">Salvinorin A</a> article, especially now that Salvia is in the news so much and a concise and accurate source of information is so sorely needed. <a href="../../../s/j/e/User%7ESjeng_b6fb.html" title="User:Sjeng">Sjeng</a> 17:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It needs to be deleted from Wikipedia because it's not within Wikipedia's scope. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Wikipedia is not a how-to guide, and an article explaining how to extract Salvinorin doesn't belong here. It's not because Salvinorin is a drug or is controversial, but because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and simply not a how-to guide - an article explaining how to extract a tooth would also have to be deleted. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 19:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Salvinorin isolation is clearly an interesting and encyclopedic topic and it would be perfectly ok to write about it in a general form and give references to the respective publications or (serious) online sources. However, I'd guess that wouldn't fill an article of its own. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 23:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I quote the article itself: ' the extraction and purification of salvinorin A should only be attempted by qualified researchers with experience in chemistry and the proper laboratory equipment.' Who are not people who typically use Wikipedia to find expirimental procedure. <b>Delete</b> as useless for any legal purpose.</li>
<li><b>Keep - This article is not labratory instruction</b>. To quote the article: <i>This summary does not contain nearly enough information to act as a Step-by-step or how-to guide for extractions, such guides are readily found on the Internet via search engines.</i> This proceedure is as enyclopedia worthy as other scientific and mathematical proceedures that are uncontested for Wikipedia inclusion. If the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin_A_fd75.html" title="Salvinorin A">Salvinorin A</a> article is getting overly lengthy, it is completely appropriate to give Salvinorin extraction its own article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 04:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you are saying we should keep it because it is too poor and useless to be considered a <i>real</i> how-to guide for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>? Or because in spite of its heading "How To Extract", it's not really a how-to guide because it claims so? Or perhaps because the information is available everywhere else (just like porn) that Wikipedia needs to mirror it? Policy says that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a collection of indiscriminate information</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an instruction manual</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a mirror</a>. WP:NOT is a policy not a guideline, and I think the consensus being sought is whether or not this article violates the policy, not whether the policy should be disregarded here. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 04:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This article is proposed for deletion as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" class="extiw" title="w:NOT">W:NOT</a> violation because it is allegedly a "how to article". I (1) pointed out that it isn't a "how to article" and doesn't purport to be, (2) opinioned that it is notable and (3) said it sounds as if a merger is impractical. I can't spell this out any more clearly. If still confused, you're on your own. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 09:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To quote the heading: "<b>How To Extract</b>". Seems pretty clear it's a how-to to me. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 09:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Shaundakulbara, renaming the section from How To Extract to Extraction Process doesn't change the fact that the bulk of the text remains a how-to guide. To stop it from being a how-to guide, you would have to reduce the entire article to a summary of a couple paragraphs. It would then be a stub which couldn't be improved on without making it a how-to guide, indicating that Salvinorin Extraction should be remerged into the main article under the new summary. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but re-format from a "how to..." to a more general "extraction process for...".

<li><b>Comment</b> - It might be helpful to point out that actually instructions for this process are <i>much</i> lengthier than this article. This article is a synopsis of the process that is appropriate for Wikipedia (but yes, this synopsis could be streamlined further). I suspect that some of the delete voters believe this article advocates or encourages hallucinagenic drug manufacture. It doesn’t. There is no POV in this article nor is there censorship on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 21:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I assure you that advocacy of drug manufacture is not the issue. I have personally extracted Salvinorin from leaves using essentially the procedure described, and used the resulting product myself. I'm hardly trying to advocate morality here. Wikipedia is just not a how-to guide. For example: "<i>Although extraction may be dangerous due to solvent toxicity and flammability, Salvinorin can easily be extracted from leaves using chilled <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acetone.html" title="Acetone">acetone</a>. It can further refined by using <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naphtha.html" title="Naphtha">naphtha</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isopropanol.html" title="Isopropanol">isopropanol</a> to remove impurities, as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin.html" title="Salvinorin">salvinorin</a> is poorly soluble to these</i>" just about covers it. Being two sentences, they would fit right back in the main article, not in a new one. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 22:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
