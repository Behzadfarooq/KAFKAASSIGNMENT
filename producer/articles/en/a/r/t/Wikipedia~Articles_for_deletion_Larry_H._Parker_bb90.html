<li>I don't think being known locally for annoying ads rises to the level of being encyclopedic. Comparisons are odious... but... we recently <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Boch_e389.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boch">deleted</a> an article on the late Ernie Boch, his sons, car dealership empire, philanthropies, etc. He had regional notability. In fact when I recently bought my car from Boch Toyota (2nd largest Toyota in the world), someone was there who had driven <i>200 miles from New Jersey</i> because Boch had the car he wanted in stock and his local Toyota dealer was estimating a <i>one year</i> wait. Boch's ads in which he smashed car windows with sledgehammers screaming "Nobody smashes prices like Boch" and his catchphrase "Come on down!" were famous throughout the Boston area. He was of significant local economic importance, building a coalition of auto dealers in the Norwood area into a loose coalition and promoting the "Automile" as a car-shopping mecca. I live near the Automile and am a happy customer. I thought the article should be deleted, and that was the consensus. I really think the degree of notability between Boch and Parker is very comparable... and both fall short. Both individuals deserve brief mention as local notables in the articles on the cities where they did business, and that's all. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:41, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the new version. I just edited the page. This is accurate and verified information. Larry H. Parker is actually a very noted injury attorney in Southern California. The first article (which was pretty funny) seemed to be written tongue in cheek. I went ahead an edited it to make it a legitmate article. Let's stop the debate now.--<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundevil4life_312b.html" title="User:Sundevil4life">Sundevil4life</a> 21:43, 29 August 2005 (UTC)
