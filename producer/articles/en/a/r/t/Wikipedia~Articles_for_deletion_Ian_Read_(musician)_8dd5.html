<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Notability criteria do not equate to "I have heard of it"/"I have never heard of it" or "I think this topic deserves attention"/"I do not think this topic is worthy of attention". These subjective evaluations are irrelevant to the notability of a topic regarding its inclusion in the encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. With respect to notability, the inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. As such, the primary notability criterion does allow Wikipedia editors to determine whether "the world" has judged a subject to be notable, but this is not a consideration of whether a Wikipedian personally thinks a subject is or is not notable.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.219.142.172 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.142.172.html" title="User talk:71.219.142.172">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.142.172_38a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.142.172">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> The pertinent question here is "does Ian Read meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines?" It appears he does indeed as a member of Soul Invictus and Fire + Ice. Both bands are apparently fairly important and influential Neo-Folk bands. His occult significance isn't really relevent because he's notable as a musician according to Wikipedia guidelines (and I imagine he meets other <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria as well if anyone wants to look into it further.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 01:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
