<li>Why is it that deletionists just vote NN Delete, and nobody even mentions it yet as soon as someone votes keep they are asked (in highly sarcastic tones sometimes!) to justify themselves? <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 23:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since for almost any article type (see for examples <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>) notability is not a default presumption. Notability must be demonstrated. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:29, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really an answer, since whether notability is demonstrated or not is frequently an opinion, not a foregone conclusion, which was the essence of the question. You can't just claim something is non-notable (just as you can't just claim that something is notable); you also have to say why it's not notable. Frequently in these debates (and with PRODed articles) I read the article and am at a complete loss as to why anyone should think it wasn't notable. The deletionists often seem to believe that determination of notability is their prerogative alone, hence the desire of non-deletionists to know their exact reasoning and not just a "NN Delete"-type response. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well it is an answer. Any object by default isn't notable. A good rule of thumb in this regard for when dealing with common objects (such as schools) is that subjects to be notable need to meet some criterion which makes them distinctive from the norm. Hence, people point to age or the point of many notable alumni or something similar. Essentially, what makes this school at all different from any others? If you can't point to anything it isn't notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:14, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I'm sure you know, as far as schools are concerned many people believe that all schools (or at least all secondary schools) are notable, for reasons explained many times over on many different AfDs, and thus the "any object by default isn't notable" argument is disputed with regard to this particular subject. But my point was a general one, as was the original question. Just claiming non-notability without explaining why is, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. Some things are blatantly non-notable to pretty much everybody, true, but many articles that are nominated for deletion <i>do</i> in many people's eyes already establish notability. When notability is obviously clear to some, it is not productive to vote simply NN. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A school, and particularly a public high school, has an inherent claim of notability that no Wal-Mart -- and certainly no individual person -- can ever make. Society seems to have this thing with education and schools that confers an inherent notability for all schools in general, and for each particular one. We are taxed to fund universal public education and required to send our children to school for an education (or to educate them independently). Wal-Mart meets none of these criteria. While I do not believe that every school deserves a Wikipedia article, I do believe that any one of them starts with a greater leg up on notability than does any Wal-Mart store or any individual. While this article will benefit greatly from expansion, the article (as updated) more than meets the minimum standards for retention. I disagree that schools are no more notable than a Wal-Mart (or an individual), which I find to be a particularly poor line of reasoning. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article does not meet the standards for retention, would you mind explaining how it does? It fails all the criteria of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, and two of the external links are the same article (one just re-prints what the other said). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 21:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmmm, I find your line of reasoning to be particularly poor (talking to Alansohn, not TJ).

<li><b>Keep</b> The school meets WP:SCHOOL Criterion 4: "The school has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools." It was on the No Child Left Behind hit list in 2003. It instituted a apecial tutoring program for students with inadequate English skills, emphasizing peer tutoring by seniors in advanced English, and all students were brought up to meet all federal benchmarks by 2005. Many fine high schools have not been so fortunate. This special program and technique diffentiates it from other schools and merits its having an article. The article is still stubby and could use revision.
