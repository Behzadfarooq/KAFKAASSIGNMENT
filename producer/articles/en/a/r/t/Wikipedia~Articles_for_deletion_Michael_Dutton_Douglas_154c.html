<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I believe this is a poor VfD nomination. MDD is a minor, but notable person, and the article is well written and (very) well sourced. From looking at <a href="../../../t/o/s/User%7EToshiba_e007.html" title="User:Toshiba">Toshiba</a>'s multiple edits of the Douglas article this is actually a dispute over content. Also, Toshiba just deleted <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">saxet</a>'s comment above; I have restored it. Please let's keep things civil. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 01:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There seems to be a lot of bad blood here. May I suggest as a solution that the giant honking "Main article MDD" notice be taken off from the Bush article and this article kept? Another solution is for parties involved to take a break from editing this for awhile and let the rest of the wiki figure out a consensus. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 01:48, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, I'll retire from this mess now. I never wanted any of it to begin with, felt like I did everything to try to accomodate Toshiba but even the most basic facts were ignored/deleted (e.g. that Laura was in fact driving the car, and not Judy Dyke). Problem is, I believe Toshiba has plenty of usernames and I'm afraid a lot of ‘them’ is going to vote in this Vfd. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">saxet</a> 02:02, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; Getting killed by a pre-notable does not by any standard make you notable yourself. The personal details of this person is irrelevant in relation to encyclopedic content.

<dd>Accroding to <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a>, "A stub is an article which is clearly too short, but not so short as to be useless.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../t/o/s/User%7EToshiba_e007.html" title="User:Toshiba">Toshiba</a>, I would appreciate very much if you would stop deleting large portions of the article. And that the 'multiple users' that sometimes follow you around would cease to do the same. I've urged you plenty times to discuss any specifics (style of language etc) that you might disagree with on the talkpage but with no luck so far. As you are aware of, there's the police report photo (that you can enlarge) on the page, yet you seem to want to delete information that is verifiable to anyone who reads the report. You also insert a lot of information that contradicts the report. Also, you seem to want to delete any information regarding the person Michael Dutton Douglas which might be one reason the article is a stub. One of the reasons the Laura Bush segment on MDD is similar is because you do the same things to that paragraph. Of course the subject matter is notable, Wikipedia is about collecting all human knowledge and so far there's has been at least four LB biographies that discusses the subjectmatter, plenty of newspaper articles and entries on many other web resources, including Snopes. If included in the Laura Bush article the subject would simply become too dominating. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDervish_Tsaddik_4360.html" title="User:Dervish Tsaddik">saxet</a> 00:47, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - why is this article up for a second VFD in 24 hours? It's already listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_21#Michael_Dutton_Douglas" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_21#Michael_Dutton_Douglas" rel="nofollow">here</a> from the August 21 session.

<li><b>Keep</b>, because this young man was notable, and it prevents material on him from dominating the first section of <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Bush_b0c7.html" title="Laura Bush">Laura Bush</a>. Plus, Wikipedia's article on Michael Dutton Douglas is the #2 result on Google for his name now <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Michael+Dutton+Douglas&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Michael+Dutton+Douglas&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, having transcended all the nutjob theories on him circulating the internet. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShem_Daimwood_ae70.html" title="User:Shem Daimwood">Shem</a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShem_Daimwood_0bf4.html" title="User talk:Shem Daimwood">(talk)</a></sup> 02:24, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>; What did this young man do which made him notable? Asides from getting killed by a pre-notable how does this man distinguish himself from millions of other youths around the world? Besides, Wiki's placement on google is perhaps the worst conceivable argument for keeping or not keeping articles. Celcius 02:43, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The incident was notable, and an article with his name is the most appropriate place to put it. Some death victims <b>are</b> notable, despite this new "no killing victim articles on Wikipedia" trend, especially one killed by a future First Lady of the United States. The Google link was just a "plus," clearly labeled as such, not that I consider it "the worse conceivable argument" by any stretch. Much as it bothers you, Celcius, you'll have to deal with this article being around. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShem_Daimwood_ae70.html" title="User:Shem Daimwood">Shem</a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShem_Daimwood_0bf4.html" title="User talk:Shem Daimwood">(talk)</a></sup> 02:57, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm well aware of the concept of democracy and I do realize that I "have to deal" with the outcome of the vote. Still, I find it redundant to have the same information in 2 different articles. Celcius</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Douglas' death is the opener in one biography of Laura Bush, but the story itself in all its detail doesn't sit particularly well in her article.
