<li><b>Comment.</b> I believe that the move for deletion was brought on by a competing website. Gweedo767 happens to run <a href="http://witendofi.com" class="external text" title="http://witendofi.com" rel="nofollow">WitendoFi</a>, and he has repeatedly tried to comment when DSmeet or other websites that compete with his are mentioned on blogs or other websites (this instance on Wikipedia is another instance of such). Some evidence: <a href="http://calico-media.com/wordpress/?p=105" class="external autonumber" title="http://calico-media.com/wordpress/?p=105" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/28/1259220" class="external autonumber" title="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/28/1259220" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I believe this is the motivating factor behind his push to delete this article, and I ask that you consider it when you make your decision. As for whether or not DSmeet is actually a notable website, I have some thoughts on that as well: DSmeet has a fair <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=dsmeet.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=dsmeet.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa rating</a>, and has <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/ds/meet-strangers-for-dsing-147835.php" class="external text" title="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/ds/meet-strangers-for-dsing-147835.php" rel="nofollow">been</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/02/13/ds-meet-introduces-online-tournament-system/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/02/13/ds-meet-introduces-online-tournament-system/" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/29/animal-crossing-online-catalog/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/29/animal-crossing-online-catalog/" rel="nofollow">often</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/11/ds-online-community-service/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/11/ds-online-community-service/" rel="nofollow">in</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2005/12/10/mariokart-decal-maker/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2005/12/10/mariokart-decal-maker/" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/mario-kart-ds/search-for-mario-kart-ds-user-names-139580.php" class="external text" title="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/mario-kart-ds/search-for-mario-kart-ds-user-names-139580.php" rel="nofollow">press</a>. I believe that the impact this website serves in the Nintendo community is absolutely not trivial, and I also believe that Nintendo is closely monitoring websites like DSmeet to see how to best conduct their future online endevors, as this is an important new direction for their business with the Nintendo WFC. Full Disclosure: I am the owner of DSmeet and I do believe DSmeet is non-trivial, but I also acknowledge that I am a heavily biased individual. In any matter, I await your vote whatever the outcome may be. --<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchelon_3be1.html" title="User:Echelon">Echelon</a> 02:16, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> DSmeet simply isn't a big enough community to require a Wikipedia article. A compromise would be to add a section on <i>friend code sites</i> in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection_0a4a.html" title="Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> article giving a brief summary of each website (all while keeping an NPOV). Most of the article is indeed plugging a website and is an article that simply isn't needed.

<li>I've been thinking about my earlier proposal, and I actually must go back on it. DSmeet has, by far, more users and traffic than the others combined. It's more impacting in the Nintendo community. I think if we did a general article on all friend code websites, it would simply ignore the reality that there is only one "big" and "active" directory/service. Consider this: I now think of this issue in terms of an article on, say, an IMDB competitor. There are hundreds of them scattered about the web, but none of them are as significant or well known as IMDB is. If we were to make a general "DS Friendcode Services" article, it would be the same as creating, say, a "Movie Database Websites" article. I think that would miss the point--IMDB is significant in movie culture. DSmeet is significant in the Nintendo WiFi culture. --<a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurina_4963.html" title="User:Sakurina">Sakurina</a> 02:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are 55,000 Google results for "DS Meet" and "DSmeet." I'm not sure how many are necessary for it to be considered "notable," but, at any rate, if the problem is that the article is plugging the site, why not just correct the article instead of deleting it? It would be a fine part of a collection of articles about the online communities Nintendo's first true venture into online gaming is creating. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWild_Bill_925c.html" title="User:Wild Bill">Wild Bill</a> 03:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Change vote: Keep.</b> I'm changing my vote because I completely forgot that we could simply edit the article to modifying the non-NPOV/plugging aspects of the article. And with the recently posted proof that DSmeet is more notable than I thought it was, this simply made me want to change my vote. --<a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurina_4963.html" title="User:Sakurina">Sakurina</a> 03:43, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to disagree with DS_Meet being considered a "trivial" website. As previously mentioned, DS_Meet has received alot of recognition throughout the web. Users join DS_Meet to fill a void left by Nintendo's own community and are provided with useful tools and information to enhance their gaming experience. I feel it is a notable website and should be allowed to remain in Wikipedia. Gweedo767's reasons for requesting removal are clearly personal and should be discounted as such. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisMax_b1e2.html" title="User:NisMax">NisMax</a> 07:40, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
