<p>made a lot of research that we use as material in our courses until today. The Lee Observatory itself is the only Astro Dome of Lebanon. It is not stated in any of Wikipedia's articles. And so you choose to delete the only article that talks about Lebanese Astronomers. Instead of expanding Wikipedia you try to shrink it. I found dozens of articles that are unsignificant on Wikipedia yet they are kept. --George CHOUCAIR <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.224.136.107_5fbe.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.224.136.107">82.224.136.107</a> (talk) 18:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Thank you all, however it is very sad, that you choose to judge and delete after an article has been published on wikipedia, this shows a certain weakness in this system. Allow me to explain:<br />
The administrators of wikipedia could have been more creative in a way that they would include all material that are subject to approval in a waiting zone prior to their publication. Once they are approved they should be published. It is quite discomforting in my particular case since the person being my own father, and he will find out that because he does not have internet evidence of his work well guess what you are not credible and all what you have done is to be considered as nothing and subject to deletion. In this case i think it will only humilate the person and his work.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is very nice from all of you to have followed this issue and no offence Go ahead and delete it. You have my approval Signed Walid HADDAD 01:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear all,</li>
</ul>
<p>I Thank you to write and I appreciate your comments and trust that you will make wikipedia better.</p>
<p>I have added the links to Mr Kennedy and Mr Gingrich on my father's page. I have also deleted the link to his homepage not to appear as if i am making any attempt to sell his work through wikipedia.</p>
<p>My father being born in 1935 (which is not yesterday) most of his papers used until this day by scholars at the AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT are not to be found on the internet. Actually most of the studies written or not by him are not to be found listed on any internet databse this was back in the 1950s where i beleive not even computers existed. So checking references on the internet for some facts is irrelevant. Internet is a product of the 1990s So anything before that has 90% chance not be available on this internet. Or is in the process to be inputed in a databse. This is why through <i><b>wikipedia</b></i> <b>there is a chance of letting these historic facts come to light.</b></p>
<p>So once again if you feel there is no way that this article / bio is by the guidlines of wikipedia because there is no proof of it/he/she on the web please feel free to remove it. Knowing that his notability is valid only to a very tiny world for astronomers, scholars of astronomy astrophysicians of Lebanon, a country that will may be stop to exist one day. I just hoped that one day in the far future people would consult and find facts, about this person and know about astronomers and that particular period of time.</p>
<p>Thank you all for you concern, and time. Sincerly Walid HADDAD 21:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)<br />

<li><b>note</b> I have also searched Web of Science back to 1900, the Catalogs of the Princeton and Harvard Libraries,</li>
</ul>
<p>each noted for its astronomy collection, and Library of Congress. I haven't found the publications: &amp; I suspect they were locally published--if so, I wouldn't rely on any of these. But it would take a knowledge of Arabic to go further, because I can not trust the transliterations or read the titles.
