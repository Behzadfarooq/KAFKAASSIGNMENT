<li>The history of the <i>name</i> is the history of the <i>word</i>, and belongs in the dictionary. The history of <i>the people/places/things</i> belongs in the encyclopaedia. This is standard practice from many other name disambiguations. The history of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington.html" title="Darlington">Darlington</a>, the place, is in the encyclopaedia. The history of the <i>name</i> Darlington, how it originated as a word, and how it was co-opted and its meaning expanded, is in the dictionary.

<li><b>keep</b> or re-merge with <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a> article. There is "encyclopedic" information and history on the name, so I don't think it should simply be thrown away. As regards the "is not a geneology database" comment, why would the current article qualify as "geneology"? Should we reject information just because it is associated with a surname? I think there is plenty of room in Wikipedia for interesting aspects of various surnames without it becoming simply "geneology". — <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenmoss_cfa1.html" title="User:Greenmoss">Greenmoss</a> 22:55, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>The list of people with the surname Yoder that has begun to grow qualifies the article as genealogy. And <i>very little</i> of the content of this article is encyclopaedic. How to pronounce the word "Yoder" isn't encyclopaedic, for example. There's a perfectly good dictionary right beside the encyclopedia, that has holds written (and, in some cases where Wiktionarians have been really enthusiastic and uploaded sound files, spoken) information on the pronunciations of words. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:19, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li><i>"The list of people with the surname Yoder that has begun to grow qualifies the article as genealogy"</i> - so we should get rid of all the disambig lists of people sharing the same last name, because that's genealogy? Genealogy is <u>not</u> the study of people sharing a last name, but of the lines of ancestry and descent within a single family (see, e.g. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukes_of_Swabia_family_tree_15a0.html" title="Dukes of Swabia family tree">Dukes of Swabia family tree</a>). This article is clearly <i>not</i> that. It seems that a lot of people here are a) confusing geneology with etymology, and b) presuming that etymology is not a legitimate part of an article. Shall we scour wikipedia for articles that describe the origin of the word in question - such as <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Thames_9174.html" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">Pantheism</a>, and eliminate those descriptions as unencyclopedic? --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 15:44, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li><i>so we should get rid of all the disambig lists of people sharing the same last name</i> — Try fewer straw men and more reading.

<li>Whoa, let's take a step back here! What we're really discussing is whether the information in this article should a. be discarded, b. maintained in its current place, c. moved to somewhere else in wikipedia (presumably the Yoder article) or d. moved to somewhere else in wiki* projects (presumably Wiktionary). Consensus seems to be moving toward c. around here, and that's fine with me. What I really *don't* want is a., and I also don't think d. is appropriate, considering this isn't a "word" in the English language, with a definition, etc. An encyclopedia really does seem like the most appropriate place for it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenmoss_cfa1.html" title="User:Greenmoss">Greenmoss</a> 16:02, 21 May 2005</li>

<li>No need for Wiktionary now. A shiny new <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Yoder" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Yoder">Wiktionary:Yoder</a> article now exists, written from scratch. I note that some misguided editors are copying information that is already in <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a> into this article, in particular disambiguation information for places named "Yoder". Aside from the fact that information on place names doesn't belong in an article that purports to be on a surname, <i>the disambiguation is already at <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a></i>. Trying to bolster this article by duplicating the disambiguation article is just plain silly. We also appear to be growing a list of people with the family name Yoder, but who don't have encyclopaedia articles (or even redlinks from other articles). That way lies <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">a genealogy database</a>. The only content to merge into <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a> is the third paragraph, <i>the only actual encyclopaedic content of the whole article</i> (apart from the <i>original</i> family name disambiguation), on the demographics of people named Yoder, which fits quite snugly into a "people with the family name Yoder" section of the name disambiguation article at <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a>. But for that <i>one</i> paragraph, my vote would have been delete. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:19, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li>...which is exactly why I suggested merging <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder_%28surname%29.html" title="Yoder (surname)">Yoder (surname)</a> into <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a>, the existing disambig page. The disambig is valid, and there's no reason on earth to exclude a few lines of etymology from it, especially where they might be useful to a person searching for information on their name (both in terms of what it means and in terms of who shares it). As an example, I recently did something similar for my own surname, 2412. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 05:24, 2005 May 21 (UTC)</li>
