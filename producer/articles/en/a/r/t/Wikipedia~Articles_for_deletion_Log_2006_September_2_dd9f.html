<li>I'm the author of that article, and not the originator of the term. I searched everywhere for the term's origins and couldn't find it, that's why I wrote the article, so that if ever someone else may find the term confusing or comedic or vulgar that there is verifiable evidence that others have as well... just like all of you. The phrase and its definition are now verifiable by the very existence of this message board. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.86.40.216 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.86.40.216_fac0.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.86.40.216">contribs</a>) 09:34, 6 September 2006.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>: No one cares if the term is offensive or vulgar; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored for the protection of minors. The real issue, as stated above, is (by your own admission) the lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of any of the information about this word... aside from some random message board, which does not count as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, even if it was cited, which it is not. Thus this phrase is thus a suspected <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">protologism</a>, and an article about the term probably violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">the no original research policy</a> as well. I hope this addresses the concerns you might have as to why other editors are advocating deletion. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 16:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd also like to note that just about every single Digimon card (there's hundreds of them) all have some little insignificant write up similar to this, that Blahblahmon comes from the planet Nebulone and wears green pants. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Digimon, that's why I've gotten myself so involved in these articles, but even I know when something is extreme cruft and totally insignificant. When these characters appear in the anime series of Digimon they have new histories and personalities that are usually not based on their description in the card game (not only that, but a single Digimon can have several different cards each claiming a different thing about that same 'mon). -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:02, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>I think there is a real divergence of viewpoints here about the purpose of lists.</i> Agreed, I see this happen all the time with list AfDs. In the case of the <i>two</i> lists involved here (as this is the same as the aforementioned other AfD), most of the groups featured actually warrant their own articles. Yes, the list is fairly raw, but I see nothing which intrinsically prevents it from being enhanced. A notariety requirement, as foul as notariety is as a concept, is a much-needed addition. These are not "List of cool websites", these are "List of established organisations", many of which are national bodies deserving of their own articles (and indeed have them, but are often not linked). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 11:45, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b> as vandalism. This is, simply, not an article. It's a page that purports to allow people to find Wikipedia vandalism to "laugh at". At best, this is a project namespace page. But we already have BJAODN, which already covers the ground of things that made people laugh. And much of the vandalism listed was in fact perpetrated by the editor who then listed it on the page.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm one of those newbies from Groklaw, but I'd hate to see an online reference like this site surrender it's credibility via self-censorship because of <b>fear</b> that some overly-agressive company might take offense. It's my understanding that <b>truth</b> is a defense against Libel. Check out Groklaw's extensive database - you'll find the truth. Clean up is always good, but depriving history of a record of this lawsuit due to fear that unsubstiated libel charges <b>might</b> be filed (if SCO even survives) seems to be over-reaction. Wait to see if there is any threat of lawsuit first. If you start deleting articles because of a fear that someone may get offended by the truth, then this site loses much value. 66.134.134.124 04:34, 2 September 2006 (UTC) Ed Freesmeyer</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - For any unreferenced sections, a trawl through the legal documents, computer news sites, and the likes of Groklaw should find plenty of pointers to information that will back this lot up. And your reference to <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a> is just silly IMO.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> for now. Film has not yet been released, but if it becomes notable I have no problem with article recreation. "It won't suck" is hardly a qualifier at the moment, though. FWIW, however, the original <i>Freddy vs. Ghostbusters</i> has no WP page - I don't know if that's a result of a previous AfD or if it never got made. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 16:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't believe a Freddy vs Ghostbusters page was ever made. Although it was definetly notable as it was all over the place, it went so far to be British media. (They called them Canadian Youngsters), Bloody-Disgusting.com even said something around "If you ever took the time to download something, this should be it". It won best film at the MicrocinemaFest in South Dakota. It's also on IMDB and if IMDB actually adds a page for it then it's definetly noteworthy.
<p>for the record, It will be finished. Hanksta2 was Hank Braxtan who is the director. If you took the time to look at the official page you can cleary see that IT WILL BE FINISHED. Stop with this "If" stuff.</p>

<p>NN. <b>Delete, and merge</b>. While I respect the notability of the producing band, I don't feel the individual albums are notable enough to warrant their own individual pages, and that short summaries within the main article about The Dregs could achieve the same aim as this article. Other bands, for instance the Beatles, have individual albums well-known enough to be notable on their own, and are widely analyzed by music professionals for content, both musical and lyrical. While I don't insinuate that the Dregs' album is devoid of either of those, I'm doubting there are published, peer-reviewed sources available that provide such information, as a result of the album's non-notability. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 02:07, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wow, a Roman writer. I'm so used to seeing minor characters in Codename:Kids Next Door and whatnot that this makes head spin.

<ul>
<li>But wait a second, the Pokemon characters, a lot is known about them. Here, Amafanius is as much of a victim of history as anything--that's not our fault. And again, there is no sourcing that says we have any of his works, that I've read--so we have, essentially, a name. And that's just it--nothing we can attribute to the name, not his works, not his life characterized in other works, nothing. Mention in Cicero and Montaigne is not sufficient--this is a classic case of the difference between <i>use</i> and <i>mention</i>--in fact, Cicero draws this distinction clearly in that he mentions Amafanius, about whom we apparently know nothing, either biographically, or historically (if we do, it's not on the net, and hasn't been sourced outside of it), but again, Cicero doesn't want to do Amafanius' thing--according to the article itself, the mention in Cicero is to briefly say what Cicero does NOT want to do, and thus, he doesn't USE him. While he may have been someone, all we know about him is that he existed and Cicero and Montaigne mentioned him, Cicero not agreeing with him. That does not notability make. What this is essentially is list-pushing; it's trying to accompile a list when not all members of the list are notable. History is what makes Amafanius not notable, not us, and not him. That's the judgment you should make--that we can't control history, and also, we should avoid considerations that Roman philosophers are somehow more significant than Pokemon characters. Significance is not a test--verifiability, notability, these are tests, and what we have for history of Amafanius flunks both.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 07:14, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There are historical reasons why <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicureans.html" title="Epicureans">Epicureans</a> don't get as many google hits as follows of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> (and not just that the bloggers aren't that into them this year) and that not as much is generally known about them. The fact that some ancient authors aren't as "notable" as others is an outcome of centuries of debate, with some thinkers being pushed forward and others left behind, all of which was heavily influenced by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. That doesn't mean they weren't influential to their contemporaries. A classical Roman scholar, whose name and a bit of bio has survived the centuries is notable, even if only for that. I don't believe that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> exists to dumb down wikipedia, but rather to prevent folks from writing about themselves, their neighbors or their brother's band. I essentially agree with <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a>'s statement to the effect that the best arguers write history, but I don't like the implications.

<dd>"Subject" is disengenous. Billy Graham's "My Life" has one subject, a principal subject. To be a subject here indicates mention, and not use, as I explained above, and that mention is brief, and not notable. In fact, I don't see anything on the page, nor was I able to find much, about what historians have written about him. Cicero and Montaigne have mentioned him, not used him. That doesn't make him notable. If George W. Bush mentions a yu-gi-oh price guide, does that fact weigh in determining its notability? No. Powerful people, notable philosophers, mentioning, as opposed to using, is a weaker notability standard.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I know of nothing in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that makes an exception for the "If he's ancient, he must be notable" argument. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:23, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I'd argue that perhaps there should be. There is one exception quoted at the top of the guideline ie. <i>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</i> I believe a lot of the editors are making the argument here that ancient scholars are an example of that more general exception. I think it's worth noting that most of the criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would not really apply to any <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presocratic.html" title="Presocratic">Presocratic</a> scholar. The only one that does is <i>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</i> "widely recognized" is what's at issue here and the discussion seems to me to be whether any ancient scholar other than the big names could fulfill that criterion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thales.html" title="Thales">Thales</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximenes_of_Miletus_5cda.html" title="Anaximenes of Miletus">Anaximenes</a> aren't exactly household names either -- and we don't even know when Thales lived, and Anaximander's thought survives only in fragments and references in other people's work . However if you stop by at the first lecture of any intro western philosophy class, you'll be hearing as much about them as it's possible to know. It's specialist knowledge and infinitely encyclopedic in my view. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just to clarify my point on reread, I'm not suggesting that <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicureans.html" title="Epicureans">Epicureans</a> were <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presocratic.html" title="Presocratic">Presocratic</a> (cause they weren't) but using the Presocratics as an example of ancient writers about which very little can ever be known. <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> just came to mind as a good example.

<dd>But if I want to know about Anaximander or Anaximedes, I can pick up Plato and role with it, or even Heidegger, for that matter. The Presocratics are all eminently notable, without question. Here we have a figure who was mentioned by just one guy, and seems to have little historical significance, like the Presocratics did--you know, the beginning of Western philosophy, all that important stuff. But the Presocratics wouldn't be notable without Socrates, and so forth. So the fact that Cicero names this guy, this isn't an antecedent of importance like the Presocratics. Hundred of other philosophers held these claims, and here's the big problem: it's his membership on a list that gets him onto Wikipedia to again be in a list. Two lists does not a notable bio subject make.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They really are the philosophical precursors of the bread and circuses tyrannies of the Caesers.

Suppose someone reads Cicero and comes across this name, and wants to find who that is by looking him up on Wikipedia. The current article then would give all information that is available, and Wikipedia has done its duty. If, however, there's nothing at all on Amafanius on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia would simply appear a deficient resource. Even short articles can be important, and I don't think the article as it stand now is a stub.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b> AfD is not a way to go about finding sources for articles. An AfD has already been done and the consensus and ruling was to keep. The clan is notable and lack of sources is not grounds for deletion. I suggest you retract your nomination. You can go about noting lack of resources in other avenues, which are actually the correct way to go about it. This is faulty. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 04:55, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The article is a little over-laudatory... I doubt the word 'revolutionized' is appropriate, and it doesn't really explain what Shadowclan really <i>is</i> all that well--but it is certain notable, per the sources, and shazbot. Do not suggest, however, pointedly, a speedy keep.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 05:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears the only support this nominator has for deletion is lack of sources. If you want to see about citing sources, I suggest the user refer to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">the citation page</a> to go about that. I urge the nominator and everyone else to kindly refer to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion guidelines</a>, particularly the "Renominations and recurring candidates" section. There, re-nominators are warned to be careful. Now, if you'll kindly refer to the "Problems that may require deletion" section, you'll see his nomination reason falls nowhere in there.

<li><b>Further Comment</b> It appears the voter in question has made an admission of association with a rival guild of Shadowclans' that existed on a different server.

<li><b>Comment</b> The author of this single dissenting vote, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlake911_66d3.html" title="User:Blake911">User:Blake911</a>, is in fact the author of the Bloodclan Wikipedia page. His guildpage is up for deletion for non notability. I question his motives for his vote. Bloodclan was similar to Shadowclan in that they inhabited the same server as the one Shadowclan started on, and they also roleplayed orcs. However, Bloodclan never reached notoriety that even came close to rivaling Shadowclan from game developers and the like, which is why I can see the article being deleted and the Shadowclan one kept. I hope there is a way to circumvent his voice in this discussion being that it is biased.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would prefer it if the entry for Shadowclan and/or Bloodclan not cause Wikipedia to become a battle-ground for these two groups. The point is, Shdadowclan has more hard evidence and sources than the other, and that is why it should be kept and the other deleted, regardless of who came first or whatever else they want to argue about.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This discussion is very interesting and all, and I probably would have chosen <b>Delete</b> in the first nomination had I participated in it (it is difficult to imagine a situation in which a computer game group has the kind of notability for Wikipedia). However, the article survived a notability AfD nomination fair and square, and this current nomination is not based valid criteria—there exists a tag for unsourced articles. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes">Simoes</a> 17:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - While im not voting on notability, I do take it with a grain of salt. First redirecting people from the clan homepage to the wikipedia AFD as it has happened here is not a nice thing, and might have moved the tides of the first Afd as well, Also take e.g. the "Victory!" section on <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85">User:Shazbot85</a>, considering this to be a kind of fight-game ... note as far I have seen shadowclan got already deleted twice bevore, but now they semm to have got their way (so this is actually the 4th nomination). And second this might open a pandara box, as then every clan wants to get a page... then they post two interviews upon some side with a headsperson and thats it, they are notable. Not that every game has its own fan site, and yes most likely will post interviews to some clans on that game.. tada a big can of worms umms clans is open, that take their childish fights now on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The arguments for and against deletion have been well made in the previous discussion of the topic. In that discussion, the consensus decision was that Shadowclan is notable. The criteria have not changed since then. To reiterate, this article does not exist because Shadowclan is a gaming guild. Gaming guilds, as a general rule, are rightfully not notable. Even though Shadowclan was the largest guild ever in Ultima Online (UO) - the first major massively multiplayer game (MMORPG) - that does not make it notable. Neither does the fact that it was the largest guild in Dark Age of Camelot. Size does not make a guild notable. What is notable is what was done for the very first time. That action -- that creation -- was named Shadowclan. The fact that Shadowclan is a gaming guild is irrelevant to its notoriety. It is the action that is notable, and the results of these actions that made it notable. There are at least two highly notable aspects to this action. Both have been recognized by key developers of the MMORPG genre and the MMORPG media, and these have influenced the design of several MMORPGs, and influenced how many people play MMORPGs. In fact, many derivative efforts based on Shadowclan have been spawned. The first notable aspect is that an organized highly successful effort was made for the first time ever to take the place of the artificial-intelligence-controlled monsters in a major MMORPG by having people roleplay these monsters. This took Ultima Online in a direction unanticipated by its creators, yet recognized and supported by the creators, even to the extent of creating special servers that better supported this type of gameplay (Siege Perious). The second notable aspect is that a large vibrant virtual online collective-oriented roleplayed community was created. This community was active 24 hours a day, every day, for years. As MMORPGS will continue to grow and develop (World of Warcraft for example has over 6 million players), they may become in many ways more like real life. As this happens, strong Shadowclan-type organized communities will likely become more common. Perhaps even they will begin to rival the size, activity, and economies of small countries. The origin of this can be traced back to the orc community in Ultima Online known as Shadowclan. One could also argue that Shadowclan is notable as being the first and largest Tolkein-style Orc-based community effort, even integrating Tolkein’s Black Speech into the language. Most people familiar with the history of MMORPGs have heard a great deal about Shadowclan and many probably also understand its influence. This article is for those seeking to become better educated about an aspect of the history of this increasingly significant development of the internet era - online worlds and the resulting virtual communities. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerog_71d4.html" title="User:Berog">Berog</a> 05:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: As I see, some steps are done: (1) Montenegro asked ISO; (2) ISO said proposal; (3) Montenegro government decided to accept proposal; and some are not done: (4) Montenegro didn't send a letter to ISO (or ISO didn't get letter yet); (5) ISO didn't announced that it is done (but, if both sides agreed there I don't see any reason why not to announce it in the near future); (6) Montenegro didn't send a letter to IANA (or IANA didn't get letter yet); (7) IANA didn't accepted ISO proposal, but as the article about two letters ISO codes say, the main purpose of those letters is usage for ccTLDs. (Yes, of course, I know that it can be different, but different ccTLD and ISO TLC is an exception, not the rule.) (8) IANA didn't send a letter with acception to Montenegro; (9) Montenegro didn't say "yes, we agree" about something which is ageed; (10) Montenegro didn't send a letter to IANA with it's agreement; (11) IANA didn't list that as a ccTLD. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">millosh</a> (<a href="../../../../sr/%D0%BC/%D0%B8/%D0%BB/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80_%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%7E%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%88_e20c.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Разговор_са_корисником:Милош">talk (sr:)</a>) 20:08, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While Game Junkie by no means is a notable national store, it is notable on a local and regional level due to the amount of innovation it shows over your standard brick and mortar locale. The ideas that the store has put there, such as tournaments and the selling of the Bawls and SnoBawls beverage, predate their appearance on a more national level, making them notable as trendsetters. The videos mentioned in the videos by Sobrider, also predat similar efforts by groups like <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_64.html" title="Mega 64">Mega_64</a>. Due to knowing a lot about the store, I will be likely editing and adding more content to this article to show its worthiness to stay in the Wikipedia database. Yes, people like TJ Spyke aren't going to know about the store, but I do not believe that the inability to be nationally notable is reason for deletion. sav2880 16:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: sav2880 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_sav2880_4931.html" title="Special:Contributions/sav2880">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>It was just brought to my attention that the entry existed and I was trying to make it look like a artical should be. I decided to register because of the negitive light surrounding editing without having a username behind it. I added better information, a link to a newspaper artical that was a cover story. I am just a loyal customer of the store and it is different and noteable. Other stores don't do the things this store does. I think a great accompishment is for a store of that size to sell 20,000 of anything, let alone be a top seller in the USA. <a href="../../../s/o/b/User%7ESobrider_2e2c.html" title="User:Sobrider">Sobrider</a> 06:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as a store that is only "notable on a local and regional level." And for the record, WP:CORP says that your store must be the subject of <b>multiple non-trivial</b> published works. One minor article about the store's owner doesn't come anywhere near filling that requirement. There is also a terrible dearth of reliable sources for this subject. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 18:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it does, since it discusses the store. It tells us about events held at the store, for example. The non-triviality requirement is there in order to exclude sources that are nothing more than business directory listings. The article doesn't provide <i>much</i> in order to source an encyclopaedia article, but it isn't a mere directory listing, or a report of opening hours. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:36, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it's important for Game Junkie to be listed in Wikipedia...perhaps it's because the definition of non-notable is....nebulous. The status of non-notable is simply a matter of opinion. Wiki has a listing for the Delhi Sands Flower loving fly. Many would consider this fly a non-notable insect..many have never even heard of it. Does it deserve deletion for being non-notable insect simply because it lives in one small section of the United States? I could find more people in a 50 mile radius who have heard of Game Junkie and not the Delhi Sands Flower Loving Fly...which, then is more notable? More children can identify Mario than Gerald Ford...is Gerald Ford non-notable and in peril of deletion? Game Junkie tournaments attract players from the four corners of the United States..this can be proven and submitted upon request.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have read over the listing criteria for Wikipedia, and believe I can shed some light on why this article should remain on the site. Articles pertaining to Game Junkie, as well as television newspieces have been published by independent sources with no affiliation to the store, and said articles and newspieces are not reprints of press releases. Beyond the article in CinWeekly, Game Junkie has been mentioned in articles by the Cincinnati Enquirer and on the podcast presented by Short Attention Gamer. The store has also been featured on NBC news (2004). The notability issue, being non-subjective, is met by the international attention also paid Game Junkie. Video game players from as far away as northern Canada, California and Florida frequently travel in excess of several thousand miles to visit the store. Major League Gaming is also interested in using Game Junkie as a host for official tournaments. Subjectively, Game Junkie is of interest to the nation, and the world, because it stands as a model independent business in a corporate world. Game Junkie employs a "customer as friend" approach that is unique in today's business climate, making it more than a "local or regional interest," such as the restaurants Skyline Chili or Primanti Bros. (in Pittsburgh). Customers order from as far away as Japan and Australia. Penny Arcade has interviewed the owner (link forthcoming), as has the owner of Gamebot, a nationally recognized video game show. I will edit the article to make it meet the criteria set forth by this site.
<p>And regarding the sale of Bawls. Hoborama, LLC, the maker of Bawls and Snobawls, is a multi-million dollar company whose products are found in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and beyond. CompUSA will begin exclusively carrying Bawls in 2007, eliminating all other drinks form its inventory, making the beverage available in over 299 stores. That an 1,800 square foot store has sold 30,000 bottles in 42 months is notable. That's over 23 bottles a day, for a business not specializing in drink sales. More will be posted in the article with citations. lytnngseed <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: lytnngseed (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_lytnngseed_52f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/lytnngseed">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Bawls is sold all over the place, and tournaments happen in any LAN gaming center, there is nothing to say this particular store is notable. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooty_3c1e.html" title="User:Wooty">Wooty</a> 05:40, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Game Junkie tournaments frequently have over 100 entrants, and the fact that Bawls are sold nationwide is not in dispute. The notability comes from the amount sold in one location. It seems your use of notable *is* subjective. I have found references to Game Junkie in forums around the country, discussing tournaments past and present. Also, Game Junkie has been mentioned in news articles around the country, mentioning its innovativeness and broad appeal. Both of these facts constitute notability under Wikipedia guidelines. I will be updating the Wikipedia article to include all citations. Lytnngseed 06:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How many people are in a tournament, or how much of a drink is sold at a location ("my lemonade stand had record profits, time to add a wikipedia article"! are not relevant numbers. Nor do forums count as references under notability guidelines. First off, there are no links to any of the "news articles". Second, even if there were, the NBC news thing (which is not explained in any detail) or Enquirer article (possibly) are probably the only ones of those that matter. In addition, your bias comment is confusing. How am I biased? I have nothing against or for the company. In addition, per your turning your entry into a "pretty good" article, this does not mean the article's subject is notable, it just means there's a decent article on the table. If the article needed cleanup and not deletion, the nominator would have tagged it as such. EDIT: After looking at the "articles" you mentioned, I see a few college newspaper articles, and a mention on Kotaku about the bathroom. I suppose you could create an article on the bathroom, but the company is not notable because of their unique decorating styles. Could you please use the preview button, too?

<li>Keep: There is no reason that this page should be removed. To do so would be no less than spitting in the face of a small business that has brought so much inspiration to a world dominated by big business and a world that needs a place like Game Junkie. Going to Game Junkie is like going nowhere else. The Game Junkie article is interesting, and needs to be kept up so that people can read about the store and come to realize that this small business, which not only set the bar for tournaments in our entire region, is the world leading retailer of Bawls, attracts customers both nationally and globally, employs several hardoworking, kind, helpful employees, has been featured both regionally and nationally in the press, and has overall changed the lives of many people.

<li>I'm sorry about the SPA tagging, but it's a necessary process in a community like Wikipedia. Since <i>anybody</i> can edit, it's very easy for a single person to create a large number of single purpose accounts in order to spam pages like this AfD, so such accounts are often viewed with a little suspicion.

<li>I have edited the page and added as many articles as I could find mentioning the store and its relevance. Only one college source is listed...AZ Central, CinWeekly and the Enquirer are all professional periodicals. I have also mentioned the national websites (e.g. Smashboards, SoulCalibur, Twin Galaxies) which have taken interest in the store, further proof of potential notability. The Bawls sold and tournament entrants are just "neato" stats. The notability should come through in the articles linked. Why should it matter if someone in college wrote an article? Once pictures are posted of the store, I'm sure you'll see why <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> and Game Junkie are *not* comparable. Why does it matter that it's a single location? Also, forgive my ignorance, as I'm not sure how to tag a television segment. To those supporting the article, please try and see what the other editors are trying to say. Stop "defending" the store. Help show why it is notable, as in its significance in the world. Wooty, I have added articles from Arizona as well as Kentucky mentioning the store. The Pac Man bathroom is notable, as it is one of a kind and would pass muster for a published encyclopedia as a monument to a pop culture icon. As I find more, I will add them. Sobrider had good intentions when creating the page, but did not have all the information. As Wikipedia is an ever-evolving process, I hope yourself and other editors can see that deletion is not necessary unless a consensus feels Game Junkie has not achieved notability when all the facts are presented, and thus has no place in the annals of Wikipedia. However, if the articles I've presented do meet the standard, I hope you will change your mind. Lytnngseed 07:57, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for one unstated reason. When a store affects fighting game popularity in an area, I believe that a store is notable. Players from California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida unite to come to Game Junkie for Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen! 4 tournaments. Obviously, Ohio players also attend. Naruto 4 is the second most popular fighting in Ohio next to Super Smash Bros. Melee. And the game has grown exponentially in this area since last year. The Naruto 3 Tournament April 2005 had 6 attendees. The Naruto 4 Tournament in June 2006 had 37 attendees. Here are videos of tournaments in Ohio. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=tbcboocock" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=tbcboocock" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> I am also the writer of the review on Gamespot for the game. Game Junkie is the main reason why Naruto 4 is a the second most popular fighting game in Ohio in front of Soul Calibur II, Guilty Gear XX Slash, Tekken 5, Capcom vs. SNK 2, and Marvel vs. Capcom 2. This is because Game Junkie offers a one-in-a-kind gaming experience. Friday Night Live holds small tournaments every Friday, breeding competition. Players come to buy a Bawls and play with their friends. Despite being $70 per copy plus a $20 add-on, Naruto 4 is more popular. Why? Game Junkie.

<li>I've been using the online handle GameJunkieJim for almost 13 years. About a year ago, someone pointed out the store to me, someone from Liverpool, England on an online forum. I live in New Jersey myself, so the store's location is not a major factor in it's appeal. They have public forums, which I joined (and was mistaken for an employee, to my amusement) they have public tournaments, and they make it easy for many to obtain imported titles and other goodies through mail order. My personal opinion is that they are just as entitled to have an article entry here (provided it is NPOV and about the store's features and community rather than a Wiki Advert) as Valve or Bungie.net or any other gaming oriented site (especially those with Forums). By many of the deletion arguments here, one would assume that the Microsoft page should be removed because they sell software, and they don't have stores everywhere. I think it's laughable that this is even an issue. Is the Meg of space that precious? Are we turning into little facists that decide what information is available and what isn't?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Some SPAs are quite passionate about this store. But it fails verifiability of reliable sources. <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/vgames/articles/0207gamers0207.html" class="external text" title="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/vgames/articles/0207gamers0207.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the only article about it that can be found. Cin Weekly article might at first thought be a second one, but its just a subset of the azcentral one. The Bawls claim is unsourced, and the news.enquirer.com link has this store as a passing mention. But its close. With better verifiablity I could be more confident in the article, but it mostly fan-fluff, and very localized. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 19:18, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> refers to itself as a "rough guideline." This means that, while typically anything and everything stated in it should be followed, sometimes what it contains must be interpreted or bent. It states that one way for a company to be considered notable it must have "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." This store was featured as the cover article for an edition of CiN Weekly, which definitely means that it has been the subject of at least one "non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The only problem is that many of the other references to the store can be contested based on the wording of this rule because most of the other sources either are considered "trivial" by some, being college newspapers etc., or contain stories where Game Junkie is not the primary subject of the article. I contend, however, that if a store is the primary subject in one article, and a secondary subject in numerous other articles, that it should qualify as notable. In addition, to say that the claim regarding Bawls is 'unsourced' is insulting. Earlier on this very page was linked a reference to data collected directly from the stores sales database detailing the number of Bawls sales. The number of sales is undisputable, as it comes from sales data published by the company. In addition, claims regarding how the store is the number one retailer are based on data acquired from the Bawls company, with whom the store was in frequent contact when the store celebrated it's 20,000 Bawls celebration. And in regards to whether this figure makes the store notable, I think it does. Earlier, someone mentioned that if his lemonade stand sold a lot of lemonade, it wouldn't be notable. But I claim that if your lemonade stand sold more lemonade than any other lemonade stand in the entire country, it WOULD be notable. But I digress. In regards to the topic of articles featuring the store, I think the context should be considered. While this store is notable, it is admittedly only notable to a certain population. As it happens, the population to which it is notable prefers to receive its news and information not in printed format, but in a digital format. The fact that there isn't a preponderance of printed articles about the store in no way reflects the stores notability. The facts that people across the country discuss the store online, that people across the country watch videos from the store's tournaments, and that the store has strongly affected the gamer culture in at leat a 100 mile diameter area around it reflect its notability. Refering back to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>, it is stated that "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the company, corporation, product or service notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." People independent of the company discuss it in forums, and talk about how it has affected them as gamers, and how it fits into their gamer life. People independent of the company have found it notable enough to make recordings of events at the company, format them, and then release them to the internet. The community to whom this store is notable does not purchase newspapers, and so of course there aren't stacks of newspaper articles about the company. However, the community to whom this store is notable has self-published numerous non-trivial discussions, articles, and videos about this store. The fact that they can be acquired for free does not make them trivial, and the fact that they are not published by a professional news company does not make them trivial. Numerous people, most of whom are completely independent of the company, find this store very notable. And the essence of the notability guidelines is that they attempt to find ways to prove that people find the subject notable. And if one were to claim that customers are not independent opens other companies for the non-notability chopping block, such as the Mavalli Tiffin Rooms mentioned in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>, which is mentioned as notable because many people who have dined there later wrote about their dining experience. Whether or not this store meets the magic number of "multiple" published works, it is notable. People who are not related to the store devote their time to writing about it, and devote their time to sharing their experiences there. Almost anyone who has ever been there would agree that it is notable. Those who have the most knowledge regarding the store agree that it is notable. So I guess the problem isn't that the store isn't notable, just that those who've been there haven't been able to accurately portray to those who haven't been there how notable it is. And what a better venue for them to try to show how truly notable it is than Wikipedia. --Appellation 21:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

If you want to establish how notable Game junkie is through your own experiences, then have those experiences and opnions published in a notable third-party source (a magazine, a newspaper, major online publisher, et al.).

<li>To clarify some things, just because the store has sold a lot of a certain type of drink doesn't make it notable, especially when said drink is a limited sale product (one need only read its article to see that).

<li>I'm not sure why such a big deal is made when accounts with fewer than 10 edits vote. The logic is flawed. It assumes that Wikipedia is automatically a part of everyone's daily life, like breathing or eating. What if this article introduced said voters to Wikipedia? You were all new to this site *once*, right? How does that discount someone's opinion? If anything, Wikipedia just grew stronger by adding all the new people who have viewed and commented on this article. Several "single-use accounts" have gone on to edit other accounts or contribute in some other way on this site. The point of a bandwagon is not who got on first, but how many got on at all.

<li><b>KEEP</b>Just because something isn't worldly known like McDonald's doesn't mean it shouldn't be recognized and have the opportunity to be appreciated by all. Have you ever heard of Candidate for Goddess? Probably not, but wikipedia has kept it just the same. There are more useless things on this site than Gamejunkie, which keeps kids off the streets, welcomes anyone into their arms, holds tournaments that people come from everywhere in the country to participate in, and has NEVER discriminated anyone because of their past history. Never once have I felt anything than appreciated when i walk through the Gamejunkie front door. One is never treated as a customer, but extended a friendly hand, and nowhere else in the nation has ever given me that experience. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.27.189.68 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.27.189.68_3a29.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.27.189.68">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>Notable? This was a Saturday morning cartoon, with 730 hits on google, which is amazingly low for pretty much any television program. Its age is the most interesting thing--1996, about 10 years old, existed for one year. I think this is the "imdb yes, tv tome yes, wikipedia no" category, where if it is so unheard of a mere 10 years after its one year run, it's not notable to the masses, and it probably wasn't notable when it ran. Also, Damon Wayans <i>produced</i> it--this doesn't help its notability particularly. Who knows him as a producer? Bottom line: only 10 years out, a TV show ought to show more evidence of notability than this. I judge it NN for wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 07:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not take the position that everything on TV is notable just because it has a potential of being seen by a lot of people. There's lasting effect, and this one clearly had nothing. Relegated to a Saturday morning position, it generated, obviously, no clear fan-base, no distinctiveness--it was cancelled after a season. I think that we go too far with TV, with too much inclusivism. Prime time? There's a reason to be inclusive, a wider actual audience. But when you've got 730 google hits, it's hard to say that, as TV shows go, that that is anywhere near notable.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 00:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Capitalistroadster. If <i>individual episodes</i> of some series can get their own articles, then any show that lasted for an entire season on a well-known network should get an article. Keep in mind that this aired in 1996-97, a time when many children did not yet have regular access to the Internet. The Google test doesn't really apply here. The only cartoons generating a lot of discussion back then were those that catered to adults, like the Simpsons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(Now, however, a <i>single episode</i> of a more recent Wayans-produced cartoon, <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thugaboo.html" title="Thugaboo">Thugaboo</a></i> ("Sneaker Madness"), gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=mf6&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22thugaboo%22+%22sneaker+madness%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=mf6&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22thugaboo%22+%22sneaker+madness%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">36,200 Google hits</a>. If <i>Waynehead</i> had been released this year, instead of 1996, it probably would have receieved a similar number of hits.)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, Waynehead does get 44 Lexis-Nexis hits from major newspapers and magazines, which is arguably more substantial than a hundred times as many Google hits. These results are <i>all</i> from non-trivial sources, which is something you can't say about Google hits.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I <i>do</i> remember this show, and even it's theme song. I also recall that it aired on <i>Sunday</i> mornings on my local <a href="../../../w/c/i/WCIU_0efd.html" title="WCIU">WCIU</a>, rather than Saturday mornings. These facts have no real bearing on the discussion; the point is that <i>Waynehead</i> wasn't as obscure as you think it was.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Both of the bands that contributed to the EP have articles on them and appear vaguely notable - multiple albums out, active for long periods of time, some claims to originality/notability. There seems to be a general policy that if a band is notable, their records are too. I suppose they are easy to maintain as articles, anyways - once you have a track listing and an album cover, you're done, forever, unless someone wants to add reissues. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:04, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wow, more annoyingly anal users trying to get articles deleted that they don't like. The article in question right now is called a stub and I created it. I suppose it'd be more logical to put a "stub" notice at the bottom rather than whine about deleting it all together. I've contributed numerous other "abbreviated" album pages to Wikipedia for Beyond Dawn and other groups and have never faced such a rediculous proposition before. I guess that's what I get for trying to contribute obscure material to Wikipedia - people like Kmaguirl who want it gone simply because it's "totally not notable". Feel free to respond to this post with whatever self-serving means necessary, because I won't be back to respond. I've said my piece and you can delete that album if it bothers you that much. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilter1987_e2bd.html" title="User:Filter1987">Filter1987</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I forgot to mention original research, as the information is culled from a wide variety of sources that are not on the subject of black billionaires, but just mention the person's wealth or are about the state of blacks in general (none of the sources I checked (about half of them) were specifically about the subject of black billionaires, but there might be a couple).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Kjkolb, however I also have to look at the fact that people may use this article for research purposes for specifically looking for black billionaires. Ideally, I would make a new article called List of billionaires by ethnicity (see:<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_billionaires_by_nationality.html" title="List of billionaires by nationality">List of billionaires by nationality</a>) to avoid singling out just black people and have it list actual names instead of just numbers. Perhaps the page could be moved to the new name, and have what is currently there under a section for black people, and allow others to add people of other ethnicities. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 11:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment (in reply to Coasttocoast): People should not be denied the right to write about an issue just because there is nothing worthwhile to say about a corresponding white phenomenon. If such a policy is reinforced, wiki contributors better get busy composing articles about white civil rights movements, white minority struggles, white racial profiling (uhm, and how about an article on DWW, "driving while white"?), or the corresponding article about such issues in the black community would risk being deleted or not given a place. There is nothing remarkable whatsoever about being included in the rank of the billionaires while being a white male, the reason being that the odds are stacked in your favor. Beating the odds makes for notability. I also want to add: if a child is told to stop dreaming and set realistic goals because there is no such thing as a black billionaire, in my opinion that child should be able to type the phrase "black billionaires" into a search engine and a wiki article should pop up that addresses this issue in a NPOV, encyclopedic, as well as non-Eurocentric, way.

This topic is even more noteworthy when one considers that currently the world’s only Black billionaire is a woman and self-made, and historically it’s virtually unheard for a woman to rise independently to the highest economic level in any race, ethnicity, or culture. In addition, this article fills a necessary void, since virtually all the articles about racial economic inequality are confined to specific places (i.e. America, Africa) and limited to discussions of poverty. This is probably the first article to discuss Black economic inequality at the highest level, and the fact that it does so from an international perspective makes it all the more relevant. Considering how noteworthy the topic is, and considering how extensive, useful, and well sourced the information is (relying on authoritative business magazines like Forbes), and considering how many categories this article fits into to, only a fool would advocate deleting it. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 17:44, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this article is far from noteworthy. It's relatively poorly written, and(from a non-white), VERY bias and POV. The article tells one side of many different examples.(Like the oprah arriving past CLOSING time of a store and getting denied access, but it only depects OPRAH'S side, not the side of the store or the employees, very POV) Black Billionares is a bad idea for an article. Where are the White Billionares or the Asian Billionares, or Jewish billionares? Just because there are very few doesn't mean that the article is noteworthy. And no matter how "oppressed" a race was(which by the way, oppression is relative, and I personally believe that, by FAR, the Jewish race was the most oppressed), just for the fact that it was oppressed does not mean it should have an article, unless that article specifically deals with oppression. <a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidtenmillion_a062.html" title="User:Liquidtenmillion">Liquidtenmillion</a> 23:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's an article on German billionaires. If you think Jewish billionaires are just as worthy of an articles as Black ones are then do something useful and create one, don't do something destructive by voting to delete this one. I think an article on Jewish billionaires would be excellent and quite note-worthy and provide helpful information to those interested in Jewish wealth, just as this article is useful to people interested in Black wealth. But I can't stand people who just go around trying to get other articles that other people have worked hard on deleted, just because the information doesn't seem important to them.</li>

The article is written in a decidedly POV fashion, and I'm not sure that any number of attempts at neutrality could redeem it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Who ever said it was 'okay' to have an article on <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a>? Is everyone assuming that <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> has received Wikipedia's infallible approval just because it's article isn't on the AfD page yet? I think it's ridiculous as well. However, this is an AfD for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_billionaires.html" title="Black billionaires">Black billionaires</a>, and the existence or nonexistence of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> neither explicitly nor implicitly condones the necessity or lack thereof for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_billionaires.html" title="Black billionaires">Black billionaires</a>. I see that many made the claim repeatedly that if one exists another ought to as well; that is a weak claim, and people voting on this AfD ought to make more cogent and less specious arguments. A given article does not exist to give complicit license for another article's existence. Also, this isn't a popularity contest, and it's not about cutting down Blacks and lifting up Germans; don't misconstrue it as such. My own stance is that both articles are unmerited and I'll vote "Delete" on <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Billionaires_24c7.html" title="German Billionaires">German Billionaires</a> as well if someone cares to put it up for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 07:07, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:We are not here to argue about whether or not the American president article, which has N O T H I N G to do with the Black Billionaires article(except for the fact that it is a list). 1. There have been MANY american presidents, and they are static, sourced, and encyclopedic, in that it doesn't go off on 20 tangents. 2. Just because people aspire to something doesn't mean that it is noteworthy. I'd say VERY few people aspire to sexually abuse children, but yet we WAIT, we have an article for it. We'd better delete it then, since nobody want's to aspire to it, it MUST be non-noteworthy. 3. Billionaires make up significantly less than 1% of the population, so it'd be hard to get that few people to influence the stupid and poor majority, except through advertisement, which probably wouldn't sway anybody too far from what they initially believed anyawy. 4. I am the person who pretty much decides what food I will eat today. So if food is noteworthy, then I am too. 5. This article is not up for deletion because it is "black related". That's, well, fucking stupid. There are many, many "black related" articles that are not up for deletion at this very second. Maybe this is just a specific aritlce that is being specifically targeted for deletion for specific reasons, unrelated to ethnicity? 6. Asians are Americans, and the global asian population outnumbers the American population 6 to 1. <b>Where is my Asian billionaire article?</b> Your argument offers more arguments about why the American Presidents article should be DELETED than why the black billionaires article should be kept. I think it should be deleted simply because its POV, and there has been no effort to make it NPOV, and because it is more of a list of non black billionaires than it is of black billionaires themselves. <a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidtenmillion_a062.html" title="User:Liquidtenmillion">Liquidtenmillion</a> 00:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please try and calm down. First you asked where your Asian billionaire aricle is? In fact the richest Asians are not limited to one article, they get five, without any controversy: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Singaporeans_by_net_worth_745b.html" title="List of Singaporeans by net worth">List of Singaporeans by net worth</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Rich_List_ca04.html" title="China Rich List">China Rich List</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_Rich_List_ade8.html" title="South East Asia Rich List">South East Asia Rich List</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Korean_billionaires_and_multi-millionaires_9bde.html" title="List of Korean billionaires and multi-millionaires">List of Korean billionaires and multi-millionaires</a>,List of Hongkongers by net worth. And yet a single article on Black billionaires generate four nominations for deletion. Never mind the fact that Black economic developement was stunted by slavery, colonization, and apparteid, segration, Jim Crowe laws, and world-wide racism that is as old as recorded history and so Black billionaires are a special case. Never mind the fact that the Asian articles deal with highly specific sub-groups, while this article is broad enough in scope to focus on the entire Negroid race-one of the three broadest racial groups in anthropology and ten times more relevant because of its international population. And this article is extremely well sourced in that it relies primarily on Forbes magazine wealth valuations, the most authoritative business magazine. And how is this article any less static than the presidents one. The current president changes once every several years and so does the number, and identity of Black billionaires. And as for your earlier charge that this article is biased towards a non-white POV, this article depends on Forbes which is run by rich White Republicans. The articles cites several examples of corrupt Black billionaires and half-billionaires including dictators who allegedly exploited their own people. Yes the section about racism may be a little one-sided, but in the case of Oprah, the store's CEO agreed she was right and apologized on her show, so all an encyclopedia can do is report the official statements. The part about racism preventing Michael Jackson from reaching billionaire status does come off as paronoid POV, but at the same time many in the Black community are paranoid about racism holding successful Blacks back, and so this is a noteworthy perspective that needs to be reported on in a neutral way. If you feel the presentation was too biased, then the constructive thing to do is find alternative sources that present alternative opinions. It's not helpful to try to delete an article that deals with an important Black demographic that no other article can discuss in detail. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 02:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As you said <i>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place.</i> I believe the events described in the article meet this criteria. Take Tiger Woods for example. The prospects of him, a part-Black man becoming a billionaire athlete in a White dominated sport is considered virtually inevitable by the numerous sources discussed and is so noteable that a popular magazine created the chart cited in the article about Tiger's march to $1 billion. And you also have the whole race to become hip-hop's first billionaire. The is not "future history" or extrapolation. It is simply reporting on a much hyped note-worthy competetition that provides much insight about the cultural value the idea of a black billionaire has in hip-hop culture and society at large. I really think you need to step out and look at this from a different perspective. There's more than enough encyclopedic content to produce an article on Black billionaires. It's not just the number of Black billionaires themselves but it's their changing net-worth as a fucntion of year, it's the yearly change in the percentage of Black billionaires among the total number of billionaires, and there's the constantly changing comparison between the net-worth of the richest or only Black billionaire compared to the richest person period. There's also data on Billionaire with partial Black ancestry. The data is far too detailed and far too international (see the membership chart) to be limited to the discussion of African-American economics. And the discrimination against Black billionaires is on a totally different level than the discrimination against Blacks at large, and what better place to discuss it than artice about Black billionaires. Everyday Blacks are discriminated against because they are assumed to be poor or because they may appear physically threatening. But alleged discrimination against Black billionaires appears to be resentment that "these people" having surpassed society's expectations for what a Black can accomplish and attempts to knock them down a peg. If you feel this is too POV then balance with quotes of people claiming Blacks are just paranoid. But I find it the most fascinating discussion I've ever seen in wikipedia and do not wish to see it marginalized to just a sub-section of another article. There are all kinds of Black scholars who have all kinds of theories of why ther aren't more Back billionaires. You may call that a POV launch pad but I call it sociological theories, and reporting on theories is what encyclopedia's do. If you feel the theories are too slanted to the political left, then feel free to add right-wing theories. But please stop advocating the deletion of this article because it's my favorite article on wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 05:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable vanity article. We'd have twice as many articles if we had one for each P2P client that's in verson 0.004 with its own author-created "proprietary open source" license (major oxymoron). --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidkay_530f.html" title="User:Midkay">midkay</a> 08:12, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why is this a "vanity article"? I don't see why it is that way. Because I wrote it? Does that matter if the article is well-written (yes, I agree that 'stub' is probably best suited for the article at this point)? Would it be better if someone else wrote it? There are plenty of different P2P clients that are on Wikipedia that doesn't have a "stable" version or where the article is a stub/written by author. And why does "0.004" matter? If I choose to call the next version 5.2, does it magically become more useful for Wikipedia? As far as the license goes, if the "proprietary" phrasing bothers you, just change it. <a href="../../../u/l/l/User%7EUllner_506e.html" title="User:Ullner">Ullner</a> 08:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, it would be better if you didn't write about yourself, instead letting others do it when you or your product becomes notable. This helps guard against potential conflicts of interests; please see <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. Does the software pass <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> notability criteria or have some other particular claim to fame?

<dd>I agree, it would probably be considered more reliable if someone else had written it. However, I tried to write the article as neutral as possible, and I think I did a 'okay' job. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheParanoidOne_a135.html" title="User:TheParanoidOne">TheParanoidOne</a> added that the article should be a stud, and I agree that it is just that. As far as the criterias, I think Elise pass #1. There have been several non-trivial works published. Sure, there is no direct notable 'fame' associated with Elise, however, there is no other software, that I know of, that is an platform independent ADC client. That alone make Elise 'one of a kind'. I guess adding a direct link to the license and/or history would be great. <a href="../../../u/l/l/User%7EUllner_506e.html" title="User:Ullner">Ullner</a> 08:43, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Cornish refer to the Duchy as the whole of Cornwall as confirmed by the original text of the Grand Charters and other references. Whilst the modern Duchy estate claims to be merely a collection of farms and properties across the UK there is a forthcoming court case in Europe which involves the Duchy and the principle of equality before the law and I feel it inappropriate to merge these articles at this stage. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabbtree_0638.html" title="User:Crabbtree">Crabbtree</a> 10:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is clearly a discrepancy - <b>a contrived chasm!</b> - between the official (propaganda) view of the Duchy and that which may be seen from the legal statutes and documents which created/restored it. It would seem appropriate, therefore, to retain the two so that each may bring its own logical argument to the public domain. Because of the complexity of argument over the Cornish Duchy, a single page (merged, or reliance on inadequate qualification within other related pages) cannot begin to promote real knowledge and truth on this topic. The <b>territorial</b> aspects of this brings into play the rights of the Cornish <b>as a people</b> whereas the official (propaganda) view seeks to deny that right. A single page would only serve to confuse and marginalise the truth in favour of those who control the debate! -- TGG 10:20, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Since there is a <b>de jure-v-de-facto legal</b> distinction between the two entities, how else can it be presented without being totally marginalised by comments that reinforce a de facto status quo (e.g. but this is not accepted by the Duchy/Government etc.)? Would/could a merged page accept qualifying legal documents without being edited out? I can appreciate the concern over <b>a fork</b> but how far will 'the people's encyclopedia' go in promoting true knowledge? A single page with continuing contradictory text would be, at best, confusing and would not be dealt with in an even-handed NPOV way! -- TGG 11:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The answers to your questions are "in one article," "yes if they do not represent extreme minority opinions in Cornwall," and "very far." You are underestimating the ability of a talk page to clarify tricky differences in opinion about editing articles dealing with currently disputed subjects. You are underestimating the ability of a large community of editors to be even-handed in the long run after an immense amount of arguing. And I think you are patronizing the reader by denying them the ablity to see all the information about a topic in one page because we might confuse the poor dears. Contradictions are a part of the world (particularly when it comes to British topics I've noticed!) and the reader is well-served by juxtaposed, qualified, contradictory text in one article.

<li><b>Merge</b> The Duchy of Cornwall page doesn't really do the subject of Cornwall as a territorial unit justice, and makes the duchy sound very much like a property company only. Although Prince Charles runs the revinue collecting aspects of it like a business, this is not the only face of the duchy and it is quite clear that it was never historically meant to be thought of as just a company. The <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Estate_478d.html" title="Crown Estate">Crown Estate</a> is today run very much in the same vain to the duchy of Cornwall, but one wouldn't take this to mean that England is a company. By merging the two pages and giving adequate coverage to both these aspects it should hopefully give more balance to the topic. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 15:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whilst I agree with your initial sentiment which truly highlights the distinction between the Duchy, as officially presented (an estate), and its hidden true historical construction (a territory with people), I have little confidence that one page can do the subject justice. At least, maintaining the two pages will facilitate cross-linking references. On one page only, every Establishment POV will be faced with 20 others pointing out the historical, and legal, proof to the contrary. Wonderful, if it were free from edit vandalism, but we are well aware of what, in fact, is going on! -- TGG 23:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A little background history is in order here. The article was created as a mostly unreferenced stub by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyT_3543.html" title="User:JimmyT">User:JimmyT</a>. I spotted it while doing RC patrol and tidied it up, adding references and further material. In the process, I found that Flanagan (who I'd not heard of before) appears to be a figure of some note in the alternative medicine / New Age fields, but has also aroused controversy for his claims. Lexis-Nexis returns several dozen results for him, mostly critiques / takedowns of his claims. Google Books also shows that he is discussed in several New Ages / altie books (<i>Phenomenal World</i>, Joan D'Arc; <i>Iporanga</i>, Kevin Apostobranco; <i>Interactive Technology and the New Paradigm for Healthcare</i>, M. Richard et al; <i>Before I Go</i>, Jim Walker; <i>Surfing The Tao: A Revolution of Free Will</i>, Angela V. Michaels; <i>Holy Order of Water (P): Healing Earth's Waters and Ourselves</i>, William E. Marks; <i>How We Heal: Nutritional, Emotional, and Psychospiritual Fundamentals</i>, Douglas W. Morrison; and others). While the article undoubtedly needs more work, the subject does nonetheless clearly meet the criterion set out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> of having "made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 12:26, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. The raw comment totals are 3-2 Delete. But one could take the post by User:Hanksta2 attempting to provide a reference as a Keep comment. But FWIW User:Hanksta2 has mostly only edited the article under consideration, and one of the Keep comments was a Weak Keep. So let's move on the arguments. The argument that the article is not verified is true. It should, however, be relatively easy to verify the article, unlike some unverified article. The claim in the article that <i>Freddy vs. Ghostbusters</i> is popular on the internet is not verified, but neither has it been refuted, granting its harder to prove a negative. In my mind this one <i>juuuust</i> falls off the bubble and survives. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:10, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2) If age were a reason for intrinsic notability then every class, every room, every stone at Harvard should have its own article. Perhaps the oldest buildings at Harvard are notable for their age. All of the houses are not notable because Harvard is old.</dd>
<dd>3) Countless college newspaper articles have been published for nearly every university that describe a huge volume of details including historical minutiae that are <i>only valuable to someone affiliated with the university.</i> Details about the names of house masters or how one house stole the other house's gong do not make this a "splendid" example of an article just because there are verifiable citations to the information in the Harvard Crimson. They make this a splendid example of the kind of insular "my-school-my-home-is-really-really-important" attitude that Wikipedia has tried, often unsuccesfully, to avoid. Show me a national or even a city-wide news story about "The Hastings Doctrine" or the rechristening of a house to a new name and I'll be more impressed with the notability of the subject matter. This article <i>is</i> of note for quite a few people affiliated with Harvard but not for a general purpose encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comments/Response</b> Actually, this is precisely where Harvard houses differ from dorms. For decades (in some cases over a century), they were allowed to select their own members and, despite official policy to the contrary, this apparently still happens to some extent. Newspaper or magazine articles about famous Harvard graduates <i>do</i> sometimes mention whether they lived in Elliott House or Kirkland House, for example, and this information tells you about the social class and hobbies of these people when they were young. (Hint: Elliott = rich, old money, Kirkland = more into sports than studying) <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 10:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Harvard houses differ from dorms elsewhere, that makes the entire house system notable but it does not make each individual house notable. Also, many universities (perhaps most) have living systems where one location has a lot of rich kids and another location has a lot of jocks. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:17, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Addendum</b> A quick check of newslibrary.com shows hundreds of hits for "eliot house" and "harvard", over a period of decades, in newspapers around the United States (subtracting out the hits from the Harvard Crimson, of course). Nexis has hits in The New Yorker, New Republic, as well as regional papers like the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. I'm glad to send you copies of any articles if you'd like to verify.</dd>

<dd>Most significantly, when Harvard changed its policies about how students were assigned to houses in 1996, it was national news. See for example, "Harvard tries to break with tradition Students now to be assigned housing, diluting cultures of residence dorms," The Dallas Morning News, June 16, 1996. Harvard houses are not dorms, and they are notable. <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 17:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would never argue that Eliot House isn't notable. I would argue that Eliot <i>is</i> notable and I also think the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_House_3553.html" title="Eliot House">Eliot House</a> article could use some work. I also think the house system as a whole may be notable. I'm arguing that Pforzheimer and many if not most other houses at Harvard are not sufficiently notable for their own Wikipedia article. I'm hoping for discretion instead of including every house at Harvard "for the sake of completeness" as an editor said <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cabot_House_f198.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cabot House">here</a>. I don't think Wikipedia should be about having an article for every member of a category for the sake of completeness. Eliot passes my notability test. Most other houses at Harvard do not. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:17, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am amenable to this view and feel that a single article on the house system might be ideal. In addition to being more consolidated it might help stem the amount of triviality, which any article along these lines attracts. If these articles are deleted, I'll probably seek an undeletion to carry out a merge. Assuming you don't oppose such an action I'll use your comment to demonstrate the usefulness of such an action. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 03:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A partial list of publications which have mentioned North/Pforzheimer in recent years include the <i>Boston Herald, Boston Globe, Chicago Daily Herald, Dallas Morning News, Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, New Haven Register, Portland Press Herald, Seattle Times, Fort Worth Star-Telegram,</i> and the <i>Joliet Herald-News</i>.

<dd>Rather than offering to forward this list of several publications to us, I wish you had made the effort to take the <i>notable content</i> about this house from just <i>one or two</i> of these publications and add it to the Wikipedia article with citations.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Harvard Houses are analogous to the individual colleges at Yale, Princeton, Oxford, and Cambridge, although Harvard is the only one of the five that uses the term "house" instead of "college". Each house has its own internal system of tutors and departmetn coordinated tutorials. They represent an intermediary locus between what people typically think of a dorm, and an independant liberal arts college. It is also important to know that just because dormitories are a "bad article idea", it does not mean they are forbidden, nor does it mean that this one in particular ought to be deleted. Why are wikipedia editors wasting their time going around nominating pefectly well developed articles for deletion just because the article doesn't matter to THEM. Just leave it be.<a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvymike21_1400.html" title="User:Ivymike21">Ivymike21</a> 17:07, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - my inclination is <b>delete</b>, else I wouldn't have nominated it, but I agree with the above that this company might just barely reach the threshhold of notability. (Although it might not; again, the links that the author provided to establish notability are highly questionable.) The problem is that the article does <i>not</i> deserve to survive in its present form, and I think it's likely that the author (whose only contribs are to this article) is affiliated with the subject and may be unable to provide an appropriately <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. And I don't know if there's anybody else who's informed enough to write a good, neutral article. Again, the company, if notable, is just barely so. If this whole virtual-tour thing catches on, the company will probably grow in importance and in notability, and at that time unbiased people will be familiar enough with it to write an appropriate article. Until then, however, I continue to believe that the appropriate action here is to <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 05:18, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am submitting this article along with all articles of the category category:Weaponlord (except the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weaponlord.html" title="Weaponlord">Weaponlord</a> article of course). All articles are beyond all cruftiness and at the risk of offending the fans of the game of absolutely no encyclopedic value. Wikipedia is not a game guide. It is also supposed to be written in encyclopedic tone and so articles that include brilliant sentences such as "It is rumored he killed a fearsome sabretooth wolf once with his bare hands, and now his face is shrouded by a wolf's mask. " don't exactly have their place. Finally, let me also add that it sure looks as though the "Story" sections of the articles are copyright violations as they are likely copied out of the game booklet. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 15:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. I was involved in the making of these articles, and I would like to say that this game is not third teir, at all. This was the first of its genre of Sword on Sword Beat 'Em Ups, and no doubt went on to influence the massive Soul Calibre series, and similar games.</strike><b>Comment:</b> I admit the story sections need a cleanup, I promise to do that myself if these articles are not deleted. I will clean up the tone of the articles in general as well, if you believe that to be a problem.

<li>NautiChem should be redirected to Pietzschke. As for Pietzschke company, it is an old German company that has plaid a major part in inventing new technologies in the Ship Building industry used on vessels oll over the world today. Pietzschke belongs to a good educational background in Germany and Europe and has its place in any good German dictionary. To delete Pietschke would decrease the quality of Wikipedia. User:United-IQ 14:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Pietzschke is important as Robert Bosch, Zeiss and other companies launched in this time, invented new technologies and made its way successfully. The size of a company is not be decisive, Pietschke has worked in the Industry field while other companies commonly more known because they produce for the end user consumer market. Pietschke belongs to the good educational knowledge and has to be in Wikipedia. NautiChem need to be redirected to Pietzschke. User: Iconium 13:35, 5. September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> So what if there are pages on school clubs? Wikipedia needs to take the step forward and become an encylopedia on EVERYTHING. Pine View Latin Club makes this bold first step, and even so, as pointed out by Rabbitspawn - students from Pine View may find it useful. In response to it being unverifiable, I believe that to be ridiculous - this is most definitely verifiable. Contact the teacher of the class through the school's homepage, and he can verify. Additionally... I'd like to quote Wikipedia's guide to notability. This article is verifiable and does not contain original research. As there are no specific guidelines presented regarding school clubs, I refer to this paragraph - and by it, PVLC should not be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been argued that lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other things) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since Wikipedia is not paper and (in theory) has no size limits, there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with our other criteria, such as verifiability and no original research.</p>

<li>In defense of myself, I found the [[Don Bell (reporter) article when I hit "Random article" and felt that <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Bell_%28reporter%29_cf51.html" title="Don Bell (reporter)">Don Bell (reporter)</a> didn't meet the inclusion criteria. When it wasn't I tried the next thing, which was the nomination. After I added it, I noticed that it had been nominated before, so I followed the instructions to nominate it again. It appears that the first nomination was not a true discussion, as CFIF accused the nominator of being a sockpuppet. From what I read on CFIF's talk page, he has a history of doing this to other people in order to keep his articles, despite the fact that Wikipedia articles are not owned by anyone! Isn't the whole point of the exersise that if a user finds an article that doesn't meet the established standards, they can try to obtain a consensus by having it deleted? Is CFIF's goal on Wikipedia to make it an elite clique where his articles are never deleted or to just attack the newbies?</li>

<p>As for my addition of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation_%28Maine%29_000a.html" title="Plantation (Maine)">Plantation (Maine)</a> to all the Maine plantations, I not only created the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation_%28Maine%29_000a.html" title="Plantation (Maine)">Plantation (Maine)</a> article, something that was needed, I went and added a relevant link to all of the articles, including at least one that was impoperly linked to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">Plantation</a>. If this is the level of aggravation that is going to be typical of Wikipedia, then I don't think I want to be a part of it. I am definitely not this EDP named Scott Brown. Just because someone nominates some delete worthy TV reporter doesn't mean that they are part of some greater conspiracy. If anything I would say that you are all the EDPs for acting in this way. You people took something that was fun and turned it into some sort of sick and disturbed schoolyard scenario. On the schoolyard people like you had a name - bullies, who had their own sick and twisted pathology behind their behavior. And guess what? You people are acting the same way. You all would never make it as cops, since you would most likely arrest anyone without cause and do not seem to understand the concept of innocent until proven guilty - something that Wikipeida incoporates in its assume good fatih doctrine. God, do you people have lives or are you all sitting at home all day dreaming up conspiracy theorys? I am not going to waste my time with this, since judging by what you have written you are all seemingly suffering from some degree of schizophrenia with unseen people out to get you or things you think you own. I have dealt with enough EDPs in my life to realize it is a loosing and fustrating battle to reason with them. This isn't what I signed up for, so you win - I QUIT! <a href="../../../r/m/p/User%7ERMP_2584_61ff.html" title="User:RMP 2584">RMP 2584</a> 20:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wrong. WP:BIO mentions the Google Test as an "alternative test", <i>not</i> as a proposed test. It does so because this is a test that some people use. WP:BIO is merely being descriptive.

<li>What I read at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is, "Alternative tests... Other tests for inclusion that have been <i>proposed</i> (but haven't necessarily received consensus support) include... Google Test." If I'm wrong, if it is an <i>alternative</i> test for notability, then notability is proven, case closed. However, I notice the word <i>proposed</i> in the sentence, and say otherwise. I happen to know, because I have some degree of interest and knowledge in this area, that Miki Sawaguchi is a well-known model with extremely high visibility in both the adult and the mainstream media in Japan. Now, I know this sort of personal interest and knowledge in the field does not constitute verifiability, and I am making no claims it does. I haven't checked the article, but will work on it later, and am fairly certain I <i>can</i> prove notability and verifiability. (By the way, if I did <i>not</i> have any interest and knowledge in the area, I would not be pasting a uniform untested and unsupported assertion of non-notability on every article in the category.) <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Wikipedia:Google Test</a> specifically mentions that it is not an accurate way to determine notability of porn stars.

<li><b>Comment</b> HongQiGong continuously asserts the false claim that <i>Japanese</i> adult stars must either meet a <i>proposed American</i> test, or they must meet a standard world biography test. Again, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>specifically</i> mentions Google under <i>Alternative tests</i> as a <i>proposed</i> way to establish notability, a test this model would pass easily. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test</a> also "describes a method used by some on Articles for Deletion to approximate notability." And, again, I am <i>not</i> saying a Google search establishes notability (and I'm not going to bite on another nonsensical Google-test argument), however the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <i>does</i> mention it. As for HongQiGong's claim that there are only two possible guidelines for ascertaining notability (the <i>American</i> porn one and the standard world biography one), there exists an entire Category devoted to differing means of establishing notablity issues for different subjects. Applying a strict <i>American</i> test to <i>Japanese</i> topics is at best a way to ensure cultural bias at Wikipedia, at worst an underhanded way to censor Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, this is another <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nomination Golbez. This is becoming increasingly more ridiculous. If this editor were <i>seriously</i> interested in notability and verifiability issues, he would tag the articles for sources, check and find sources, or even do some work and clean up or expand the article himself. He does not. Instead, with <i>no</i> attempt at checking notability or verifiability himself, he often first tags these articles for speedy-deletion, and then reverts when that tag is removed. Just short of a 3-Revert violation, he then further tags the articles for deletion with a pasted, pre-prepared, un-checked, un-supported assertion of non-notability. During the discussion, he then apparently willfully withholds pertinent information (researching using Japanese names instead of Roman letters), and engages in non-ending, nonsensical circular-logic arguments. I've been <i>trying</i> to assume good faith from this editor, but in all honesty, by nominating <i>this</i> subject-- a multi-media, international star (I will update the article with sources soon)-- for deletion on "non-notability" grounds, he has really crossed the line. It is quite apparent that his intent is to disrupt Wikipedia through frivolous deletion nominations, circular arguments, and censorship. Lots of time is being wasted by this editor. Recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Koavf#Blocked" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Koavf#Blocked" rel="nofollow">another editor</a> was blocked for mass-delete tagging of similar articles. This editor is even more insidious, however, since he is doing it slowly and wasting everyone's time with these repetitive discussions.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added to the article, and added sources. The test mentioned was put into place from an entirely <i>American</i> perspective, addressing the <i>American</i> industry and <i>American</i> society. It completely ignores the vast differences between the US and some other cultures. Even the most non-notable of these Japanese models have a presence on mainstream outlets like Amazon. Miki Sawaguchi is a <i>retired</i> model, yet still has 27 DVDs, 24 Videos, and 4 books listed at Amazon. She was a regular on <i>two</i> television shows and appeared as a guest on many more. How many retired <i>American</i> porn stars with articles can show this much notability? Instead, we're forced to prove that <i>Japanese</i> models meet the <i>proposed American</i> 100-film test. How much verifiability do we need? An academic treatise on the subject? These are porn stars we're talking about. Miki Sawaguchi has had articles in U.S. magazines concerned with Asian cinema, such as <i>Oriental Cinema</i> and <i>Asian Cult Cinema</i>. I have listed as sources those I could find. The Nikkatsu Roman Porn genre existed for 30 years before a book was written on it in Japan. It took till the year 2000 before a book covering the subject to any degree was printed in English. Again, insisting that <i>Japanese</i> adult actors pass a test set up by and for <i>American</i> adult actors ensures cultural bias. If <i>any</i> Japanese adult star is notable enough for an article, Miki Sawaguchi is. Wikipedia makes claims of being uncensored, and to fight a cultural bias. If an article on a multi-media, internationally known star like Miki Sawaguchi can <i>seriously</i> be considered for deletion on grounds of non-notability, something is seriously wrong somewhere. Could it be people with no interest, no knowledge, and hostility to the subject are nominating and voting to delete these articles? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 02:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, what there is is a lot of micharacterisation of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> as being "American", for some reason. That mischaracterisation isn't supported by reading the page.

<li>Well, <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> specifically makes mention of mainstream work, being the monthly feature in magazines like Playboy or Penthouse, awards, etc etc. If a Japanese porn actress do not have similar credits to her name, then she would not be notable. Mainstream work <i>in Japan</i>? Notable magazine appearances <i>in Japan</i>? Notable awards <i>in Japan</i>? etc etc. The only arguments I've heard so far for keeping the plethora of articles on seemingly non-notable Japanese porn actresses is that they have xxx number of Google hits or they have some random number of DVDs, like "24 DVDs, she's notable". What? Who decided that 24 DVDs, with no awards, no mainstream work, no notable magazine appearances, etc, is notable for a Japanese porn actress? And why are American porn actresses subjected to a much harsher test? But regardless, like I've also said before, if you do not like <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> or a suggested Japanese equivalent, we can always fall back to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which this particular actress would not pass either. Something you may not be aware of - it is already very lenient to nominate an article on a Japanese porn actress based on an <i>imaginary</i> equivalent of a <i>proposed</i> notability test. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is much stricter. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 17:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point, SliceNYC. The puns seem quite obvious, but hardly can be verified while they are only in the author's brain. I don't know how to verify, for example, from what he created the name "nappa". If someone has this japanese book (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 4088737024</a>), it can be a good reference, however, using it for this kind of article would not be a <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use</a>. I understand the feeling of Folken de Fanel, but it seems almost impossible for this article to satisfy both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use</a>. --<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleTree_5f2a.html" title="User:LittleTree">LittleTree</a> 21:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per SliceNYC's comment. Despite Folken's mistaken belief, the article most certainly <i>is</i> uncited, and it's easy to prove this by observing the simple fact that there are no citations. To say "this name came from this word", where the name is not actually identical to the word, is research, and if uncited must be assumed to be original research, and we cannot include original research in Wikipedia. Additionally, the list is unnecessary. Characters' names should be explained in the article or section on the individual character, and the characters themselves are presumably already listed in other DB character lists; there is no need for this.<br />
If kept, note that this needs serious cleanup, both to remove inaccuracies and to remove the often indiscriminate wikilinking of common words to irrelevant articles. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Rename and rewrite</s>Delete</b> <s>I agree that the article is skimpy, poorly written and unsourced. However, if there isn't an article on this topic, there should be. This article describes a major foreign policy shift of the United States and, as such, the new foreign policy approach should be documented in an NPOV way. Whether you agree with it or not, this theory of foreign policy is of major significance to the U.S. and to the world.

<li>No. There is no consensus over schools articles. Part of the problem is that a lot of editors employ "stuck record" arguments. You can see several "stuck record" arguments above. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is an attempt to break this pattern and to get editors back on track with <i>concentrating upon sources</i>, as encyclopaedists should.
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is that the school be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the school, which in fact gets one to roughly the same place, since these published works are neutral sources that can be used to build and to verify an article. (Works published by the school itself are not neutral.) The Ofsted report is one such published work. I've asked for another one three times, now. <i>All that needs to be done is to cite one</i>, and you will have the strongest of proper encyclopaedic arguments, multiple independent non-trivial sources discussing the subject, for keeping the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:39, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The deletion of the categories are not at all a precedent, because lists are utterly different from categories; they are more easily maintained, annotated, etc. This is precisely the reason why lists and categories are seperate.

<p>We've already gone through several rounds of killing categories about dead comic book characters. We need to <b>delete</b> the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dead_comic_book_characters.html" title="List of dead comic book characters">List of dead comic book characters</a>. The list is not maintainable. I found too many errors. Some will point out that the article says they could all come back. Fine. However, there are at least a quarter million dead characters in the history of comics! A few of those who were listed have been shown to be alive now (Dead Moira was an imposter) and other information was inaccurate (Captain Boomerang survived <i>Identity Crisis</i> to die in a different comic). So the article is wrong and, in fact, can never be right. Too many debatable deaths will be listed, thereby invoking POV. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 21:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not convinced there are that many notable dead characters yet. There are currently 53 characters on the list, and only 2 have stayed dead since the 1950s-1960s.

<li>Agreed, we need some criteria for inclusion/exclusion. <i>Own series</i> seems a little too strict (what about team members? villains? Major supporting characters with years of history?). I think <i>own article</i> will do it. If truly obscure characters pop up, we can use that as a cue to clear out/merge those pages. Alternate universes are excluded <i>de facto</i> already, but that could be made clearer. Probability of return is a useless criterion.

<li>The problem with <i>own article</i> is that it's easily rectified. If someone wants to have an alternate future version of the Hulk on the list for whatever reason, he would have free reign too as long as he made his own article for that character and added whatever content he deemed as "significant".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But you have a point. Therefore, I suggest we split the criteria amongst character types:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Major characters</b> - Must have held own ongoing/limited series. (ex: <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29_559e.html" title="Superboy (Kon-El)">Superboy (Kon-El)</a>)</dd>
<dd><b>Villains</b> - Must be recurring ("recurring" being defined as having faced opposing hero(es) at LEAST <i>three</i> times). (ex: <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Cold_4b6e.html" title="Captain Cold">Captain Cold</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Supporting character</b> - Must be one of the following <i>at time of death</i>.
<ul>
<li>The hero/villain's love interest. (ex: Gwen Stacey)</li>
<li>The hero/villain's "sidekick/aide/protege". (ex: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Brown_b73a.html" title="Stephanie Brown">Stephanie Brown</a>)</li>
<li>The hero/villain's "mentor". (ex: <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Mercury_7aa4.html" title="Max Mercury">Max Mercury</a>) (<i>Note: Parents/guardians should NOT count. No one cares if Batman's parents, Peter Parker's uncle, or Superman's home planet are still dead.</i>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Would this suffice? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Zeal_c0bd.html" title="User:King Zeal">King Zeal</a> 05:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I also suggest explicitly excluding alternate universes (Ultimate, What If, Elseworlds, and so on), and characters in worlds where people just Don't Come Back. I've added some tentative criteria to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_dead_comic_book_characters_0cc5.html" title="Talk:List of dead comic book characters">talk page</a> -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 06:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Van didn't create the article, he's removed large chunks of non-essential information and his edits are non-controversial and constructive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Nobody is disputing factual acccuracy here, so citing a POV concern (especially when Van isn't the primary author) seems like a strawman. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 14:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Afterthought</b> Van is absolutely the primary author. See his edits from late February 2006 when he changed the page from a spoof to his own bio: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820</a>. He later edited it to add more of the current content. It now reads like an abbreviated resume. Moreover, POV has little to do with factual accuracy; articles in The Nation or Newsmax may be factually accurate, but no one pretends they have a NPOV.

<dd>'<b>Response'</b> Awesome, we're both using the same edit to try and prove different points. It looked to me like Van was removing a whole bunch of chaff and leaving in the important information. And I think you're missing my point about POV. The issue here is whether Van is notable. Your musing on whether or not someone can write an article about themselves without a POV is not germane to the debate. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 23:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The edits Van made violate the guidelines of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAutobiography_1f61.html" title="WP:Autobiography">WP:Autobiography</a>. His claim to inventing "combined triple average" cannot be independently verified. "Van has privately confided that he wasn't blowing smoke here and is in fact working on a major innovative advance in sabermetrics," he writes.

In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Eric_Van_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Eric_Van_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">AfD two months ago</a>, the focal points of the argument were that <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" rel="nofollow">one article</a> had been written about Van and that he was known in the Boston area. (For what it's worth, the article was in the arts section, not even the sports section.) The difference this time through the AfD process is that we are discussing actual policies and guidelines, not just vague concepts of notability. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 21:30, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Two of the Keep votes were by editors whose only edit so far are their Keep votes, another by an editor who has had one other edit, and another by an editor whose only edits have been to this AfD or to the article under consideration.

<li><b>Keep</b>The attacks this actress is undergoing here on this page negates the very essence of Wikipedia. They seem personal in nature and lack merit. The quality of the writing is acceptable. The article is written with a neutral point of view. The information can be verified by both on-line sources (IMDB) as well as hard copy sources (The Hollywood Reporter). This actress is acknowledged by the Screen Actors Guild as being a professional. Her face has been seen by millions of people, being that she has been in huge Hollywood films. She also has two new soon to be released notable films with character names credited, both on IMDB. The very fact that there are so many statements here shows that this person is someone of note, otherwise no one would bother. I for one would like to know more about an actress that could stir so much controversy. --<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfoGuru_993a.html" title="User:InfoGuru"><font color="green">InfoGuru</font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup>13:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are lesser known people that are on Wikipedia. There are reality TV stars who were on just one episode, so should they be removed too? This is an actress/model who has been in well known movies, so if you only want leads than you need to make that clear from the get go. I thought wikipedia was for the people, done by the people and did not realize there was a heiracy of who the right people are to be part of wikipedia. seriouslyomgwtf 20:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unfortunately, some people are referring to IMDB as the most reliable means to establish someone's credibility. Although IMDB is convenient, it is sometimes highly inaccurate. In addition to using this [IMDB] site, it is known amongst those involved in the entertainment industry to use reliable hardcopy publishings (i.e. Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Daily Variety, etc.) as well. I subscribe to the Daily Variety, and I found that this individual's film <i>E&amp;A</i> was listed in the Friday, August 4, 2006 edition (p.8). And as a side note, she is listed as the first in the cast which means that she is most likely one of the leads. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/g/r/User%7ETGreenburg_7122.html" title="User:TGreenburg"><font color="green"><b>TGreenburg</b></font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am Logan. www.Zulu-Online.com is the website for the game in development. As the person above me said, if we are releasing in October, why should a film not being released for an entire year be allowed to have an article, and this not? This is less of a game and more of a simulation that is being created, something that has never been done before. That is why we feel it deserves notoriety. This isn't something being put together by two programmers in their basement. Currently there are six people on the team developing Zulu-Online and all but two of us are students going to school specifically for Gaming and Simulation Design. The sound person went to a Technical school, and now runs a camera and sound boom for ESPN Sports Center, and one of our mappers designed maps for simulations for the military. Zulu-Online will be the first Simulation of a zombie outbreak, there has yet to be any other computer game like this yet. As you stated, no the release is not until October. However, there are plenty of screenshots and information about it located on our website. More than enough to supplement a small wiki article about the basis of the game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.35.66.19 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.35.66.19_e9c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.35.66.19">contribs</a>)  13:20, 3 September 2006.</small></li>

<dd>Just to be clear, I also apologize if Logan took my post badly; I posted the quote of his announcement solely as part of the discussion of the article's notability. If this is something that really will be out soon, and is generating a lot of buzz in the gaming community, then it might be worth an aricle. I think it is more likely that we should hold off until the game actually comes out; if it becomes popular, then it will need an article.

<dd>Hi Alterion - I think you've misunderstood the guideline, sorry if I didn't make it clear. Allow me to quote, instead of paraphrase, in order to avoid ambiguity. "The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The Ghit you cite does not meet these criteria - it is a post by Logan advertising on a BBS. Can you provide any major published works where this software is referenced? --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 21:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok it may not have a published works where it is reference (that i know of) but i have to know, why would it be so bad for Zulu-Online to have a page on wikipedia.

<dd>There are so many people in the world who want something they've done or something they like or something a friend of theirs has done to get all the recognition it can get. Hosting all these pages at Wikipedia takes some money, and people donate that money to a non-profit foundation with the expectation that it will be used to provide web-space for some things but not other things. In order to talk about why movies get in before they're released and most software doesn't, I have to use the "notable" word so I won't talk about it! It would cost very very little to just sneak one more article into Wikipedia, but, like the grade-school teachers say, "If we make an exception for you then we have to make an exception for everyone else too." It's a really boring reason but it's the truth. Of course, for all I know, in a couple days when an administrator comes around to actually make the deletion, they might agree with you instead of us! <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 21:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Think of it as similar to an article about a battle of a war, like D-day, Gettysburg, and the such. Plus, an online competition like this that has been in plenty of newspapers around the world and has loads of media attention is just like American Idol. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29</a>.

<li>Take the World Cup of Soccer for example....that's a very popular sport that thirty-two countries take part in. This is an INTERNATIONAL lip-synching competition that takes place online, and ANYBODY (and I mean ANYBODY) can participate in it. You can call this the World Cup of Lip-Synching. And since a World Cup is a soccer war, Google Idol can also be considered a lip-synching war consisting of numerous battles (matches whether they be head-to-head or 4-way).Ovechkinfan4life</li>

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> Gidol is only six months old, but it's becoming popular and popular by the minute....and some people don't really know gidol at all, so this is needed to actually SHOW them what gidol is about. We can always TELL people what gidol is, but we wouldn't do so with as much accuracy as well as consistency. SHOWING is more efficient than TELLING. Think of it this way....you're trying to show a picture to a friend. Would you A) Simply let him see the picture itself or B) Describe the picture in a million or so words without letting him see the picture?Ovechkinfan4life
<ul>
<li>I don't see any non-trivial sources talking about it. I can't read the other links since they aren't in English, but the USA link is just the website of Gidol. So this doesn't appear to be notable at all. You cannot compare something as trivial as this to something that more than a few hundred(or MAYBE a few thousand) people have heard of to a competition that is covered by just about every sports channel and website covers and that is viewed by hundreds of millions of people. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> See Publicity section of googleidol.com. Gidol has been in newspapers and on television several times. It is less popular in the US than in Europe so a lot of the publicity isn't in English. There is still no reason to dismiss it as trivial, espeically since it's less than six months old and has garnered millions of hits and is and still ever-expanding. It is a worldwide phenomenon. The point is, many people around the world <b>will</b> want to know about Gidol. This is simply a documentation of the contests that have happened within the site which will allow them to do so.

<li>It has nothing to due with google, and you would know that if you knew anything about it.
<ul>
<li>So the they're deliberately trading on confusion, then. There's apotential "passing off" suit right there. Still doesn't make it significant. And having taken the time to survey the site, rather than simply read second-hand, I can say with even greater confidence that it's trivial nonsense not meriting a second glance, and certainly not warranting WP resources. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 20:11, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is named google idol because only google videos can be a part of it. There are other sites that support videos, like youtube, myspace, and photobucket. Stop making assumptions like that. It's like saying Baby Ruth the candy bar was named after Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino, the Sultan of Swat, the King of Crash, etc....the candy bar was not named after Babe Ruth. It was named after Ruth Cleveland, the first baby ever born in the White House. Or saying that Caesar salad dressing was named after Roman Emperor Julius Caesar. It wasn't. It was named after a chef named Caesar who founded the dressing. This is somewhat mundane if you ask me Ovechkinfan4life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just becuase you say it's trivial doesn't necessarily make it so. And besides, google idol is in a sense like myspace and facebook and digg.com. All three sites were founded by one person in particular (myspace by Tom Anderson, facebook by Matt Zuckerburg, and digg.com by Kevin Rose). Google Idol is similar in that one person founded this (Ben Petro). What has happened to myspace, facebook, and digg.com? They became very popular websites and one of the most popular in the world today. As for google idol, it's just in its infant stages. The reason you probably never heard of google idol is because many ppl have limited access to the media or simply they don't read. I myself had not really heard of digg.com until I read Business Week one time and heard about how Kevin Rose made $60 million in 18 months. Give it some time....Rome wasn't built in a day, so why should google idol be as popular as the World Cup in its rookie year? Not every rookie has to be an Alexander Ovechkin type of rookie (or in laymans terms a very popular rookie). Some websites are brand new and that's just fine. We all have to be new at something sooner or later. Ovechkinfan4life

<li>It is merged into Gidol as a link. If it was on the same page as gidol the home page would just become all messed up like Dexter Reed's Mondo Burgers at the beginning of the Good Burger movie. And the details are needed so people can see an example of formats for Gidol. If you're interested in sports you would be interested in scores as well. And if you're interested in statistics you could analyze these statistics for various tests (for example, you can do a chi-square test of homogeneity to see if getting a certain amount of votes is independent upon the country a performer is from).

<dd>Not in so many words, no. I'd argue, though, that being the first Lithuanian to compete is the contribution ahead of coming dead last. Either that or the more wishy-washy conception that anyone and everyone who competes in the ESC has made a contribution to the record of that field. The fact that an act fails to record a point is also notable, since the overwhelming majority do. Naturally, this makes them last. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 02:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Deletion of this article is absurd. It is an existing piece of animation history that , while not picked up as a series, is still be played at animation festivals around the world due to its innovated merging of animation techniques. Not to mention that it was created by a well known animaion studio FOR Disney studios. Your deletion time would be much better served looking for the ridiculously obsene and useless entries on this site. In case uyou haven';t noticed Kitty's Dish is an entry on IMDb, a website with MUCH stricker standards than Wikipedia's. Needless to say I STRONGLY OBJECT to this articles deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lesserredpanda (<a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELesserredpanda_204d.html" title="User talk:Lesserredpanda">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lesserredpanda_504d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lesserredpanda">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 15:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Lesserredpanda is heavily onvolved in the creation of the article. I am boldly marking her comment as a vote to keep. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 15:49, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I (BFJ) am also heavily involved in the creation of this article and working from the same IP address as lesserredpanda, but that doesn't make my objections to deletion any less valid. Yes, Disney did not pick up Kitty's Dish for series but it is still shown at film festivals and still has very real life as an animated short and very well may get picked up by another animation studio or network - it is very well regarded (see: wildbrain.com 's director page/ Nick Hewitt (art director) for an example. The fact that this article links to actors, director, studios and animation techniques within Wikipedia universe should also be considered before deletion. If deletion is decided upon, the Kitty's Dish info; photos, cast list, etc. should be merged with the director's entry (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Risley_0e6e.html" title="Mark Risley">Mark Risley</a>).</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> somewhat <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a>, and per other reasons given by BFJ. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHello32020_9b8b.html" title="User:Hello32020">Hello32020</a> 01:05, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> seems like a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a> short film, and it looks and sounds cool, too. I'd like to see it. Since it is a part of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a> history and was made by and starring notable people I'm for keeping it.Devourerofworlds 15:26, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Kitty's Dish is notable because of its known cast, crew, production companies and the simple fact that it is an existing animated short film, simple as that. Cgfan 17:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> its plausible that such a term might come into existence, but I've yet to hear of it and can't find any other reference to it.
