<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. Google it and see that there are several bands in the first few pages of results that describe themselves as death grind. At the very least, death grind deserves its own section in <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">Grindcore</a>. But since it's a musical style on its own, and as in rap, metalheads can be very supportive of one subgenre and very opposed to a very similar one (I am that way with several genres of metal myself) I don't think I or my fellow metalheads would take too kindly to combining the articles. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 07:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Question: I saw that, but I didn't get the impression that there was any specific meaning to the phrase. When you saw the Google hits, did you get the idea that this was a stable, critical genre, or just a couple of words combined by fans who were being informal in their use and therefore reflecting not an actual <i>genre</i> but merely a <i>slang word?</i> I thought it was the latter case. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:43, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's valid. It's similar to how <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a> is a combination of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">metal</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk_music.html" title="Hardcore punk music">hardcore</a>. Originally only a few bands billed themselves that way, and now the metal scene can't get away from it. The metal scene invents quite a few terms to describe mixed styles, but when (invariably) other bands come along and play the same genre of music, then it goes into more common use, as was the case here. Also compare <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybergrind.html" title="Cybergrind">cybergrind</a>, gothcore (mentioned in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a>), and their Google results; the terms are used sometimes in the scene, but with death-grind, bands are willing to describe themselves that way (this is not the case with cybergrind or gothcore, which appear to be terms made up by fans/reviewers/etc. ... gothcore was itself on VfD in April though, and kept). --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:35, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think you'll find Suffocation explicitly mentions Death-grind. This isn't a fictional genre, but I will admit I'm not a DM expert, more of a BM man. I only made it as a stub to fill out red links on <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_music.html" title="Extreme music">Extreme music</a>. If you want to delete it, fine, but it seems rather pointless, as it is an actual genre, and we have all sorts of far more tenuous genres listed here. Vampyric black metal for example, that seem to have escaped editation through being expanded beyond stub. I could almost certainly find printed references to it if I went through my magazine collection. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharBevNor_ad72.html" title="User:KharBevNor">KharBevNor</a> 14:11, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete and recreate: I know that seems like a lot, but I don't want to honor or maintain this junk in the history, and yet the term has a specific historical location and meaning. It's quite important in the rise of rock and roll and the consciousness of a youth culture (which then means marketing and money from that segment, which then affects all media, advertising, etc.).

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Teenyboppers" and their music can annoy me as much as the next person, but Wikipedia is supposed to be about accuracy and NPOV, not stereotyping. Plus "teenybopper" is somewhat of a derogitory term for early teens and pre-teens. (Is someone gonna write articles about "nigger music" and "cracker music"?) At any rate, most new musical genres are initially more popular among the younger demographics. The article lists rap as an example of teenybopper music, but that genre first got popular in the '80s, so it'll soon be played on the oldies stations - if it isn't already. So we should write factual info about the actual genres and not arbitary stereotypes of them. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 06:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Teenybopper is a generic term that has been applied and will continue to be applied to past and future teens. As such it is highly subjective, and constantly changing. Thus, teenybopper music will never fit a given definition, and furthermore will vary by region.

<li>A lot of this content is bunkum. In the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a></i> television series the Stargate was housed in a facility located beneath <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne_Mountain_e819.html" title="Cheyenne Mountain">Cheyenne Mountain</a>, for example, not in a government warehouse. On the other hand, this is a concept that is used in works of fiction, and we can certainly have an article on a common fictional plot device, <i>as a plot device</i>. Watching <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark_c5d6.html" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i> is enough to verify the existence of such a plot device. ☺ What we cannot verify is all the stuff about what governments <i>in reality</i> have such warehouses, what the rules of the secret society of caretakers are, and where they may be. All of that stuff is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">too secret for Wikipedia</a>. Moreover, the references that this article cites are entirely bogus. (From <a href="http://www.io.com/~jlockett/RPG/HEGGA/Stuff/warehouse.html" class="external text" title="http://www.io.com/~jlockett/RPG/HEGGA/Stuff/warehouse.html" rel="nofollow">an earlier version of that same "Government Warehouse List"</a>: "Recently, I decided to try to use this warehouse in a role-playing game, for fun. I've been trying to figure out things that should be in some of the boxes.".) At best, this article needs an industrial strength dose of <b>Cleanup</b>. Every single item needs to demonstrate exactly what work of fiction uses the government warehouse plot device in relation to it, or be mercilessly edited out. And the utter conjecture at the top needs to go, too. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:24, 2005 May 26 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a concept that exists in a lot of literature, media, etc. Therefore it's notable.

<p>This page is a promotional article for Oberon Microsystems, which is the seller of "Component Pascal". Further, "Component Pascal" is not in fact related to the language Pascal in any way, it is actually a variant of the language Oberon. In short, the page is promotional, and misleading, and should be deleted. I would suggest that the page be rewritten to be less misleading (and I have added a comment to the page to that effect). However, the page was clearly posted by, and has virtally all its references to, Oberon Microsystems. <i>(this VfD was started by 192.18.43.11, an anonymous user. --<a href="../../../k/e/t/User%7EKetsuban_cc56.html" title="User:Ketsuban">Ketsuban</a> <small><a href="../../../k/e/t/User_talk%7EKetsuban_7649.html" title="User talk:Ketsuban">(is better than you)</a></small> 01:54, 26 May 2005 (UTC))</i></p>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. The only part that looks promotional was the part added at the bottom, most likely by the initiator of this vote.

<li>Why would you bother to make that accuation (the part added at the bottom, most likely by the initiator of this vote). You can check that easily by simply looking at the history of the page. Scott A. Moore</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I make a Pascal, lets put that up front. I saw this companies article on their own Pascal, and thought "why not make one on my version of Pascal". Well, the rules clearly forbid that, so I didn't do it. However, that's just as clearly what the creator of that article did, create a self promoting peice. So please, tell me the difference. "Component Pascal" is not a widely implemented langauge, it is one company's product. All of the references at the bottom go back to that company. I'm ok with it. If thats ok, then I think you are basically telling me to go ahead and list my companies product (which is actually a Pascal language product, not just named that) as well. Am I slightly annoyed&#160;? Yes. Oberon Microsystems have been promoting "Component Pascal" even though their product had nothing to do with Pascal, and was in fact Oberon renamed. I emailed them about it, they told me "Pascal is dead, we can use the name". This, to me, clearly indicates that they wish to create confusion on the part of the reader. End of rant, sorry. Scott A. Moore</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll add: No, I would not list my Pascal implementation. I like and respect Wikipedia, and I will obey its laws and conventions. Too bad others don't feel the same way. Scott A. Moore.</li>

<dd>If these links are not what you are referring to, please state that. I also respectfully request that you refrain from making wild (and completely unfounded) attacks on me. I have a long history with Pascal, going back to 1979, and have worked extensively on the Pascal language page here at Wikipedia, which I have helped become more factual and less biased. I have every reason to be concerned that this page advances disinformation against the Language Pascal&gt; however, besides its disinformation aspect, it CLEARLY voilates the Wikipedia rules on posting to promote a company or product.

<p>This was originally created as a vanity article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14213623" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14213623" rel="nofollow">content as written by original author</a>). Rather than VfD it, an editor apparently ran MacGregor through Lexis and found a couple items, which were added to the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14214122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14214122" rel="nofollow">result</a>). The content added casts MacGregor in a rather negative light, and a complaint has been made to the Wikimedia Foundation implying the possibility of legal action.</p>
<p>Considering the complaint, we should only have an article on MacGregor, if at all, that we are confident meets our standards and is unimpeachably relevant and factual. I reviewed the article and removed the biographical material from the original author because it is not verifiable. For similar reasons, I removed information about his educational credentials that cannot be traced to a verifiable source without original research, and a paragraph whose only source has retracted the story. None of this content is acceptable for an encyclopedia — see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Dubious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Dubious sources</a>.</p>
<p>What is left is the present article (and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Institute_of_Pharmaceutical_Technology_084e.html" title="Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology">Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology</a>, included in this request). The verifiable facts about this man boil down to: 1) he runs a vocational school; 2) he was sued successfully by an employee for firing her when she was pregnant; and 3) he was found guilty of a domestic violence assault shortly before he was supposed to receive a local civic award. I submit that an article that amounts to nothing more than this is not one we should keep. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 02:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - It seems to me that aside from the legal scrapes, there's nothing notable here and even less that's verifiable. I was unable to find much of anything factually relating to either article. For Alexander, I found mention of the human rights issue and the wife beating. There was no indication of any research articles, lectures, conferences, or other items of scientific value that's come from him. And not a shred of biographical information to be found. The school doesn't seem notable to me... no mention of research or great academic achievements, although maybe it's notable because of it's post-secondary education? Not sure exactly what the policy on that is. Overall it doesn't seem like it will be possible to produce an article of the appropriate quality. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirGeneral_34ab.html" title="User:SirGeneral">SirGeneral</a> 17:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is not to be confused with "Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology", which yields 985 Google hits. I am not convinced that an evening class school with no notable alumni is encyclopedic but I am stone cold certain that the president of such an institution is not encyclopedic when his only verifiable achievement may be a conviction for a crime unrelated to the school.

<dd>Mea Culpa: I responded to the article itself rather than looking for independent verification, which I ought to have done. It appears that the band has released two singles and received some notice in the UK music press. There is a little promo video for them at the NME web site <a href="http://www.nme.com/features/108041.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nme.com/features/108041.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. (Not bad, at that.) I still question whether that is sufficient for a wikipedia entry: it isn't my impression that the goal is to provide an encyclopedia entry for everyone who ever released a record or published a book, is it? But clearly the band exists outside of the mind of the article writer, so it was not fair to dismiss it as sheer vanity. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 14:16, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He has some wild personal theory about Martin Bryant and the Port Arthur Massacre, cannot accept that the consensus does not support his unique POV and insists on trying to force it through creation of spurious pages and malicious vfds like this one. Nominator needs to be fully aware that (a) his POV is not widely accepted (b) he has failed to provide sufficient evidence or cogent argument to make it widely accepted (c) no amount of dissembling changes the fact that these repeated edits, page creations, and nominations for deletion are disruptive and contrary to policy regardless of how he feels about the matter (d) these tedious, bad faith, disruptive tactics will not work.

<p>The term "profundity" is not used in this manner in axiology, by Whitehead or as far as I'm aware in any field.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Seriously POV and specialized appropriation of the term in an article comprised of a number of sentence fragments. The problem I have is not that this is true or untrue, but rather that it is original research. This is one person's attempt at synthesizing and comprehending several philosophical approaches to a particular term/concept. The problem is that this represents new work, a new synthetic concept, and is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. Had the article been a point by point discussion of the term in this person's philosophy, that person's philosophy, and the other person's, it might have been ok, as then it would have been a <i>report.</i> However, once it takes up the cudgel of "it means," it goes over to original research. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:53, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hold on, this school is notable for failing, then not failing? You think this is notable? You think anyone outside of the small little catchment area of this school pays any attention to it whatsoever? It teaches the curriculum set for it, and even notable alumni would be irrelevent (it would be like listing supermarkets with notable shoppers, since the influence of one primary is much like another).

<li>No, it only has an effect in the immediate catchment area. The specified curriculum means that one non-failing primary is much like another non-failing primary.

<li>We have an article on every day of the year, and on every year, and on every tiny town in the United states, and on every minor character of many TV shows, books, films, and comic strips. What slippery slope were you concerned about? There is plenty of storage space. There were thousands of photographs uploaded to the Wikipedia commons. There is no problem of article collision, because no other article will be wanting to use those titles. I have no problem with having an article on each verse for each religion either. Why can't there be ten or even a hundred articles on each verse? Disk space is cheap.</li>
<li>R1w's argument is spurious. Deleting Bible verse 'to manitain NPOV' is silly - shall we delete articles on US TV episodes to maintain NPOV with other cultures, which don't have so many entries? The Bible has had an enormous cultural, religious and literary impact, rivaled by no religious text (other than the Qu'ran). There are fewer verses than schools in the US - and I suspect most of them (and certainly Gen 1:1) are more universaly notable. (I do, however, think that the parrallel translations should be deleted).

<p>In terms of the Bible verses articles (a perfect eg of a content issue!), my opinion (to get some list of opinions started) is that they are a waste of time/space on Wikipedia. Something like this belongs more on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>, as it is in essence the presentation of an extended primary text with detailed information about every part (assuming people add more verses...) - I saw a large article which did not contain much information that can't be found in other Wikipedia articles - and yet it covered so little of what could be said about the verse. If this keeps going, it will engulf Wikipedia. On Wikisource though, something in the style of the Mishna project (see <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mishnah" class="external free" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mishnah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mishnah</a> as an example) (with user contributed public domain translations, see <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Open_Mishnah_Project" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:The_Open_Mishnah_Project">Wikibooks:The Open Mishnah Project</a> at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:The_Open_Mishnah_Project" class="external free" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:The_Open_Mishnah_Project" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:The_Open_Mishnah_Project</a>) and concise summaries of commentaries, the uses of the verse in Jewish texts etc would be a good idea and I'd probably like to contribute to those. As it stands, I think <b>deletion or relocation to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a></b> is the way to go. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFrikle_e149.html" title="User:Frikle">Frikle</a> 11:47, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

(Except I am unable to do justice to the subsection on Christian exegesis, please edit and add.) I already voted to keep articles by key verse(s). The rewrite attempts to demonstrate why the article should not be merged (esp not w/Creationism) and why such articles would be useful to keep.

<li>The key overarching point of my proposal has been reverted/removed already. I had restructured the article to differentiate scholarly vs. religious views, and -- within religious views -- between Christian and Jewish (and Moslem, etc). Instead, the article showing now has sections entitled "Analysis" (aka Christian w/some academic) and "Jewish interpretation", with attendant POV issues.

<li>Actually that was me protecting the article which I'd been told was subject to a revert war. When I got there there was indeed a very silly revert war in progress. I protected <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">The Wrong Version</a>, as is my privilege, because of a perception, which I think was quite correct, that an attempt was being made to enforce a merge without consensus.

<li>Capitalist, I greatly respect the cleanup work you do, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect much improvement in this article. It's on its second trip through VfD, and its already got about 60 edits (of that total GRider has made about 20 and Tony about 5). It is what it is. Notable Alumni have been doubled by including a college volleyball player to go along with the original notable alumnus, Mr Biggs, a radio DJ. I guess some people might consider that an improvement. For some reason WP doesn't yet have an article on their cross-town rival, Bellevue East High School. It isn't even a redlink in the article, although Mr Biggs is. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:05, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, personally I don't find either of the alumni listed to be notable. The quality of an article can't be measured by number of edits and length, otherwise a rambling 30 paragraph long article of asides and irrelevency would be viewed as better than a one paragraph straight to the point article. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 18:13, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete: It's a school. It has students. The same could be said about the local donut shop. Why is this particular school needed in an encyclopedia? As for the desired moratorium on votes, I hate to be cynical, but this is the way I look at it: school votes end up with half and half (unless the valiant warriors of Schoolwatch get clued in, and then a dozen "OMG KEEEP!!!! Schools must never be deleted ever ever ever you trolls! Start an RfC on the nominator!" votes show up, and then it's about 60/40. True. However, the policy proposal can end no other way than a similar knot. Not to vote until a definitive conclusion to the policy discussion is, de facto, to vote "keep" on all and to welcome more stunningly profound entries as "Lincoln School is an elementary school in New Jersey" to the encyclopedia. I should rather say that a moratorium could be observed <i>after</i> a policy consensus is reached. Until then, these nasty fights will continue, with people acting entirely irrationally and hating each other over the absurd issue of meaningless stubs staying or going. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:42, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh I say, it's really not a hating matter, is it? A number of people make hopeless, doomed VfD listings and they fail to reach consensus (or, increasingly often, end up with a straight majority to keep). That's the beginnning and the end of it. None of us need hate or be hated, I should hope.

<li>If you go to the donations page you will see that the mission statement set out by Jimbo states that we are gathering the "sum of all human knowledge," I see no reason this excludes high schools. Wikipedia is not a directory so hundreds of lists of scientists by publication would probably not belong here. Personally I feel prose is a requirement for an article and if a list of publications is the only information that is verifiable it would be best to move such pages to another Wikiproject.

<p>There is no denying that Google, WP and the Web in general are awfully short of information on Africa. So I suppose the fact that some tripod pages seem to confirm the existance of this person are quite an achievement already. It is mostly the circumstances that make this article suspicious (beyond desperately needing a cleanup): The formatting makes the article look like a recreation of a deleted article scraped off some WP mirror. The creator of the article added this note to the article's talk page: "<i>This article appears factual and well written. More African biographies like this should be encouraged.</i>" The same editor also pushed the deleted Francis Okechukwu Ohanyido (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosopher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12662767" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosopher&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12662767" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, while Atomse who recently recreated said deleted article has edited the subject of this VfD with three of his five edits.

<li>We have to be conservative in these cases. If we cannot confirm it, we cannot have it. Therefore, I recommend <b>move to /temp</b> location until settled.

<li>I agree with you that it must be deleted if unverified. I'm only suggesting that in view of the fact that only a google search has been performed we need more time to perform due diligence. We have no reason to rule out the reference site and the language can be edited, or a "totallydisputed" template should be added meanwhile to reflect the tentative nature of the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I completely agree that this list is unencyclopedic.

In this case, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock_68e9.html" title="Little Rock">Little Rock</a>, and then modified (having a list wouldn't be suitable, but it will surely be nice to have a section about, for example, gastronomy, at <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock_68e9.html" title="Little Rock">Little Rock</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, I'm from Little Rock and I'm not sure I want to block deletion. I don't think there's much of a purpose for the article, although some of those restaurants (like <i>Restaurant 1620</i>) are a part of Little Rock history and do have an impact on the culture here. So, it's a difficult response for me because I agree it's not encyclopedic, but I think the information could be of some use. --<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolf530_e94b.html" title="User:Wolf530">Wolf530</a> 18:38, May 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If someone wants to write a new article about a restaurant that is part of Little Rock history and has had a verifiable impact on the culture there, I'm all for it. If there are several such restaurant articles I'd even find a "Little Rock restaurants" category reasonable. And if someone can write a good, NPOV, non-promotional section about gastronomy in Little Rock (that is not a simple listing), I'm all for that too. However, I'm rather convinced that deleting this unencyclopedic article will not decrease the chances of any of those things happening. It shouldn't be left hanging around just because we could use something fundamentally different, albeit on the same topic, that nobody has got around to writing yet. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 19:02, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this article must be deleted, moved or rederected to <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway.html" title="Motorway">Motorway</a>, you should do the same with the articles <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobahn.html" title="Autobahn">Autobahn</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autostrada.html" title="Autostrada">Autostrada</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoroute.html" title="Autoroute">Autoroute</a> and Autoput, because thats the same situation. /<a href="../../../e/7/0/User%7EE70_802d.html" title="User:E70">E70</a> 04:24, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't comment on Autoroute and Autoput, but Autobahn and Autostrada are very notable concepts even outside of Germany and Italy. As far as I know, they are also used almost as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_noun.html" title="Proper noun">proper nouns</a>; they are a concept in of themselves and are used to describe the road network in its entirety (as far as I know). <i>Motorväg</i> remains just a simple translation of "motorway", rendering it encyclopedic.&#160;:--<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 14:26, May 27, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just from a glance at Autoput it looks no more notable than <i>Motorväg</i> and IMO should be treated the same way. Autoroute and Autostrada are more debatable in my view, and Autobahn is a veritable institution. More generally -- at risk of digressing from the VFD debate -- how much depth is appropriate in Wikipedia documentation of national road systems? If Sweden's national road system were as aggressively documented as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_California_State_Routes_a40f.html" title="List of California State Routes">California's state routes</a>, would <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorv%C3%A4g.html" title="Motorväg">Motorväg</a> become legitimate? And if so, then isn't deleting it an example of geographical bias? I'm just a novice Wikipedian with a bunch of questions -- forgive me if I'm stepping out of line here. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipR_8272.html" title="User:PhilipR">PhilipR</a> 20:49, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hence my vote to move, but keep the content. I feel it is very reasonable to cover any numbered highway. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 20:57, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, then you've sold me. In re: Motorways in Scandinavia, how did Sweden get lumped in with Denmark here? Is <i>Motorväg</i> specifically a Swedish word? I think it would be preferable to document each country separately, e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorways_in_Sweden_ff09.html" title="Motorways in Sweden">Motorways in Sweden</a>, Motorways in Denmark. - <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipR_8272.html" title="User:PhilipR">PhilipR</a> 21:08, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just a slight nudge; it should be motorways of Sweden if it's to be on a national basis. But I must point out that many Swedish motorways are a part of a much larger European network of motorways that all have the designation EXX. These things run through all of Europe, and I think some of them even go all the way into non-Turkish Asia. See <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_route_E18_d5df.html" title="European route E18">European route E18</a> for a good example. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 06:41, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, I point to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation_in_Sweden_4d08.html" title="Transportation in Sweden">Transportation in Sweden</a> with its <i>Road Traffic</i> section waiting for something about motorways. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:03, 2005 May 29 (UTC)</li>

<p>Use the same standard on us as you would to on any other band. I don't think your personal Wikipedia pages are all that impressive either. There's thousands of other articles on bands here (see Distorted Mind) that are not any more or less notable than us. If you're going to work by a single standard, then enforce it fairly. Describing a band's sound is NOT vanity, it gives anyone who might be reading the article an idea of what we sound like. We're not out to get any undue promotion; I dont know anyone who goes on Wikipedia for the specific purpose of finding bands. Congratulations, you have your own pages on here, you treat it like a Myspace. That's not any less vain than what we're doing. Take that into consideration.</p>

<p>Hoo boy, this is bizarre. One, the title is extremely narrow and would almost never be found on a search. Two, it appears to be a slang dictdef.

<li>I think this should remain in wiki in some form, without the last paragraph, perhaps. I think adding it as a slang dicdef. would be the most appropriate.<i>keep</i>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. However, I think that perhaps Wiktionary would be appropriate- can someone clarify? I don't know Wiktionary policy as well. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bound_30fc.html" title="User:Mr Bound">Mr Bound</a> 21:31, May 26, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note that, despite the title, the article <i>actually</i> discusses "deez nuuutz", even though the song title appears to be "Deeez Nuuuts". Without doing the research, I'm fairly sure that <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deez" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:deez">deez</a> can be attested as a word that (whatever one may think of it) people use, and less sure, albeit still reasonably so, of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nutz" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nutz">nutz</a>. However, "deeez" is arguable, and both "nuuuts" and "nuuutz" very probably cannot be attested. As such:
<ul>
<li>"deez nuts" would just be a non-idiomatic combination of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deez" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:deez">deez</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nuts" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nuts">nuts</a> (the slang meaning for which was, predictably, the very first addition to that article, by the way).</li>
<li>"deez nutz" would similarly just be a non-idiomatic combination of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deez" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:deez">deez</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nutz" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nutz">nutz</a>.</li>
<li>As "deez nuuutz", what this article says it is discussing, pretty much doesn't occur at all, there's no question about its exclusion from Wiktionary.</li>
<li>"Deez Nuuuts", the <i>title</i> of this article (albeit not what is discussed in the body), appears to occur <i>only</i> as the title of an album track, as a reference to that title, or as a reference to the lyrics. As such, I believe that it falls foul of the Wiktionary requirement for occurrences in <i>independent</i> contexts. (Moreover: The assertion that it has an actual slang meaning is therefore, quite simply, false.)</li>
<li>"Deeez Nuuutz" occurs so infrequently that it probably wouldn't make it on that ground alone. It occurs as a mis-spelling of "Deeez Nuuuts", but that causes it to fall foul of the independence requirement, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: You are welcome to come and add <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deez" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:deez">deez</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nutz" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nutz">nutz</a> to Wiktionary. Please, if possible, provide <i>proper quotations</i>, as per <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:quotations" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:quotations">Wiktionary:quotations</a>, to stave off any disputes. The non-idiomatic combinations, or the album track title components that occur in no other independent contexts, would probably get nominated for deletion, though.</li>
<li>As for <i>this</i> article in <i>Wikipedia</i>: The assertion that "Deez Nuuuts" is a slang phrase is simply false. It's the name of a track on an album, nothing more. Unless the track was released as a hit single, <b>Merge</b> to the album seems the best idea.

<li>Im agree that <b>merge</b> would be appropriate, and don't see how that could be questioned, shouldn't the song titles be redirects to the article which contains the list of tracks and information about the album where the song is found. This seems to be the appropriate action for many, many article deletions, if they aren't offensive having redirects from deleted pages helps people to find the most relevant article to the topic they are searching for.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm still bothered by the idea of a spring being referred to in an article title as "&lt;creek&gt;,&lt;state&gt;". This seems especially problematic for small, unremarkable springs/streams/creeks as there are likely to be many replicate names if we were to use this model for article naming. It is certain this is not a town, so it is inappropriate for it to be named in the "&lt;town&gt;, &lt;state&gt;" convention. If it is a neighborhood/community (I still have my doubts) then perhaps it should follow the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willowbrook%2C_Staten_Island_eef2.html" title="Willowbrook, Staten Island">Willowbrook, Staten Island</a> model? --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:19, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is a place that has taken its name from the nearby springs. While it may not be much to see in the present day, it is a place that is identified as a locale on period maps from the 19th century.

<li><b>comment</b> This is me 81.153.177.193, I am afraid I have made multiple edits to this page entirely by accident and my own ignorance of the mechanics of vfd - I was trying to fix the stuff going on on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_May_26" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_May_26" rel="nofollow">this page</a> at the 'denialist' heading, but kept on editing this subpage as a result. I've fixed the problems now, and my own extraneous edits, I just hope my silly contributions to page histories today haven't confused everyone else as much as they've confused me 81.153.177.193 00:17, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A Google search turns up many people labelling others as "denialist", in relation to disputes such as whether HIV causes AIDS or whether there was a genocide in Armenia (Fun fact #1: The French for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/denialist" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:denialist">denialist</a> is apparently <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%A9gationniste" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:négationniste">négationniste</a>. Fun fact #2: Wiktionary outdoes dictionary.com here.), and as such this appears to be a real concept. A redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_lie.html" title="Big lie">big lie</a> would be biased, and a redirect to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial.html" title="Denial">denial</a> doesn't work because that's about a concept in psychology, not politics. The content of this article is indeed biased, inasmuch as it asserts that whatever denialists oppose is the truth. It also cites no sources for its assertion that being a denialist is a route to a successful political career, when there appear to be plenty of denialists around, of various flavours, who don't even get elected. <b>Redirect</b> (not merge) to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a>, and add a stub section there, is one option. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:15, 2005 May 27 (UTC)</li>
