<li>And one of those is a press release, so it's more like two. But that's exactly my threshold for notability. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 18:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> by a narrow margin. The coverage is not substantial, and largely in special interest publications (Toronto Jewish News).

<li>The Bank of Montreal is probably supporting it <i>because</i> its CEO is one of the co-founders, but its founder doesn't make it notable (do we even have an article on the CEO of the Bank of Montreal?) --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 07:57, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That may very well be true, but the fact remains that a CEO answers to a board of directors and the bank approved support for the programme. As for an article for the CEO, if you'll see the FAST article mentions him and links to the <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Anthony_Comper_b01c.html" title="F. Anthony Comper">article on him</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, so any organization made by a substub is notable? Doubtful. What does "supporting" it mean? They issued a statement in support? Why would they turn that down if the CEO asked for it? --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 19:33, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The BMO is not some mom-and-pop organization. They do not allow their goodwill, name, and trademarks to be taken lightly. In fact, I see that the BMO is not the only significant organization lending their support. If this organization was not notable, you wouldn't see all these people and organizations<a href="http://www.fightingantisemitism.com/hist_supporters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fightingantisemitism.com/hist_supporters.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> giving their support. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:44, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that while it is a rather cursory stub at the moment, time will make it a decent article. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> 23:10, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I can't see that it's gotten a lot of media attention. <a href="http://www.fightingantisemitism.com/related_Aug605.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fightingantisemitism.com/related_Aug605.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is supposedly reprinted from the Toronto Star, but I can't find anything on the Toronto Star's own website, and they're usually good about archiving everything there.
