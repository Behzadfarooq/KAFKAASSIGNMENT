<li><b>Weak delete and redirect</b>. There's not too much substantial text in this article- it could be summed up in two sentences in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King%27s_Timon_and_Pumbaa_4ac8.html#Season_2_Saturday_Episodes" title="The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa">the main article</a>. Also, the talk page appears to have been host for a vote for deletion and the outcome was "keep" based on&#160;!paper. Combined with the fact that it's an unlikely search term and has gotten pretty much no attention in three years, I think it would serve a better purpose in the main article. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:56, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Can you imagine the precedent keeping this would set; wikipedia can't possibly have a separate article for every single show out there, especially shows that aren't really notable in themselves--I could see a justification for having articles for particularly famous episodes of famous shows (for example, certain episodes of I Love Lucy). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as nominator. It's an animated cartoon that ceased to continue <b>seven</b> years ago. And a large proportion of the article is an analysis which seems to be orignal research. Common sense (<i>if common sense counts</i>) says that this will continue to be a lone episode, <i>still</i> unfit for this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta_Tango_8d22.html" title="User:Delta Tango">Delta Tango</a> • <a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelta_Tango_65b1.html" title="User talk:Delta Tango">Talk</a> 15:22, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an article for a episode of a tv show, just like any other article for a episode of a tv show. It seems that this was nominted only becuase it is "unlikely to be expanded".

<li><b>Keep</b> per above.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To reply to the above two editors; the primary reason this is up for AfD is because it violates Wikipedia guidelines on notability and TV shows (I don't have the links at hand but may be able to be convinced to find them). Wikipedia is also not around to provide information on every conceivable random thing. TV show articles that are simply summaries are not supposed to be around; only articles which explain how a particular episode caused a controversy, was news worthy or was a landmark in the series or in television in general should exist. Again, the fact that other shows have many articles does NOT in anyway imply that this article should exist. Indeed, according to Wikipedia's guidelines most of these other TV show articles should ALSO be deleted and I may get around to nominating them soon. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What are you disagreeing with? Should all episodes of notable TV series have their own article? And do you really disagree to "Wikipedia is also not around to provide information on every conceivable random thing"? <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta_Tango_8d22.html" title="User:Delta Tango">Delta Tango</a> • <a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelta_Tango_65b1.html" title="User talk:Delta Tango">Talk</a> 16:30, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, all episodes should have articles. And I don't agree with providing "information on every concievable random thing." I simply have a hard time believing that a well-known cartoon from Disney would fall under that umbrella. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:38, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Disk space is cheap, human effort isn't. Secondly, deleting something because "no other episodes are covered" is a profoundly stupid reason... Wikipedia always will have somewhat asymetric coverage because the editors/writers decide what is interesting to them. It is not a paper work, as has been brought out. The proper way to handle unreasonable asymetry is to focus on expanding the other content not to destroy what is already there! <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryce_2348.html" title="User:Bryce">Bryce</a> 14:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hopefully this is enough to end debate... In looking up specific Wikipedia policies you can find on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> the following rules which imply that this article should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Wikipedia articles can NOT simply be plot summaries. "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." Does this particular episode have a major, real-world context? Has it provoked controversy? Is it genre-defining? If not, then delete.</dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> Wikipedia is NOT a directory. "Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business" are not allowed. Essentially, having articles for individual TV episode falls under the category of 'TV guides' and amounts to a directory, therefore it is not allowed.</dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> According to Wikipedia's notability standards for fiction, "It is generally appropriate for a plot summary to remain part of the main article, not a lengthy page of its own." If the information in this article must be kept, then it really needs to be merged into the article about the television show itself. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the article is nothing but a plott summary. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 13:43, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per The Way. The show itself barely manages to be notable, individual episodes really are not. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 16:05, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
