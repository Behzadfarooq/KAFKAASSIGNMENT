<p>All churchs in goa offer grand mass on easter sunday. People exchange easter eggs which makes Easter family affair. The Christian festival of Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The spring festival has its roots in the Jewish Passover, which commemorates Israel's deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, and in the Christian reinterpretation of its meaning after the crucifixion of Jesus during the Passover of AD c.30 and the proclamation of his resurrection three days later.</p>
<p>easter_egg Early Christians observed Easter on the same day as Passover (14-15 Nisan, a date governed by a lunar calendar). In the 2d century, the Christian celebration was transferred to the Sunday following the 14-15 Nisan, if that day fell on a weekday. Originally, the Christian Easter was a unitive celebration, but in the 4th century Good Friday became a separate commemoration of the death of Christ, and Easter was thereafter devoted exclusively to the resurrection. According to the Venerable Bede, the name Easter is derived from the pagan spring festival of the Anglo- Saxon goddess Eostre, and many folk customs associated with Easter (for example, Easter eggs) are of pagan origin.</p>
<p>Easter Day is currently determined as the first Sunday after the full moon on or after March 21. The Eastern Orthodox churches, however, follow the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, so their celebration usually falls several weeks later than the Western Easter. Easter is preceded by the period of preparation called Lent.</p>

The Chutzpah Factory College of Entrpreneurship is a non-profit registered training organisation that provides accredited youth-entrepreneurship training throughout Australia.</p>
<p>The organisation was founded in 2002 by Louise Earnshaw after she had completed her PhD, researching the psychology of maverick youth and entrepreneurs. The research had found similarities between entrepreneurs and marginalised youth, prompting Earnshaw to create the training organisation to put youths' skills to good use, teaching them how to start their own business.</p>
<p>Earnshaw herself had run away from home at the age of 16, and knew first hand what it was like to live on the streets.</p>

Horsforth Fairweather started out in the 1970s playing friendlies against other teams in the North Leeds area. Their name derives from one game where it was called off prior to kick off due to rain and were nicknamed 'fairweather footballers'. The name stuck.</p>
<p>During the 1980s the team started playing in more organised leagues, starting in the Leeds SUnday League before moving to the Combination League. In 1999 the team joined the Wharfdale Triangle league where they continue to reside, playing teams from North-West Leeds, and over towards North-East Bradford.</p>
<p>Home games are played at the Bedquilts ground off Adel Lane, home to Leeds Met University on Sunday mornings. Train takes place at Horsforth School, Tuesday nights at 8pm.</p>
<p>The team is manager by Martin Woods, a mad Leeds Rhino's fan and holder of the record of being the only player to score a hat-trick of penalties in one game. Unfortunately he is now resigned to managing and regularly throwing his toys out of the pram when things go wrong! Steve Burns is the long-suffering secretary of the club and also kit manager.</p>
<p>Simon Parker is their overall leading goalscorer having bagged over 200 goals for the club at nearly a goal every other game, although perhaps their greatest player was one Richard Yarnold who played only for a season and a half before being cruelly cut down in his prime due to a serious knee injury. Yarny as he was known to the rest of the team was an integral part of the 2004/5 campaign, weighing in with a number of important and spectacular goals, the most notable being an audations 45 yard drive into the far top corner that won him goal of the season. Still loved by all at the club, Richie is fondly remembered as the most skillful forward Fairweather have ever had the fortune to have. Simon Parker undoubtedly scores in volume but Yarney delivered the quality.</p>

The office remained vacant until 1993, when then Sen. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_McClintock_87ec.html" title="Kenneth McClintock">Kenneth McClintock</a> authored a measure to reestablish the office. Upon its approval, Senate President Roberto Rexach Benítez and House Speaker Zaida Hernández Torres appointed Dr. Pilar Barbosa as the first Official Historian in the office's "modern era". The first female to hold the job, she held it until her death in 1997. At that time, Senate President Charlie Rodríguez and House Speaker <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edison_Misla_Aldarondo_2b70.html" title="Edison Misla Aldarondo">Edison Misla Aldarondo</a> appointed Dr. Luis González Vale, the current incumbent.</p>
<p>Under Dr. González Vale's leadership, the office has collaborated in multiple publications, including the letters of Resident Commissioner Félix Córdova Dávila, and several works regarding Puerto Rico's military history. In 2005, in collaboration with Puerto Rico's Endowment for the Humanities and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities_592a.html" title="National Endowment for the Humanities">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, his office published an eight-book "We, the People" Puerto Rican Series of books regarding the history of Puerto Rico during the first 30 years of US sovereignty.</p>

Rick would talk with the guys and they would all share insights, ideas and wisdom together.

<p>WBCO Radio, Bucyrus, Ohio, is the flagship station of Franklin Broadcasting. The station currently features a format of adult standards with a mix of religious talk and grunge rock.

Bucyrus Chamber of Commerce chief Deb Pinion sold advertising at one time, as did Charlie Brown (not the comic strip guy).</p>
<p>The station was founded by Orville Sather, who is rumored to still be alive and sharing a home with Elvis Presley in the Florida Keys. Upon Orville's reported death, ownership of the station was assumed by Tom (he of lone blue suit) and LaVonne Moore.</p>

<p>As of 2007, the station still boasted the talents of Jim Radke in mornings, whose claim to fame is the uncanny ability to interrupt a song in play with the announcement, "We have a winner. The trivia question has been answered, please hold your calls." The station also features the bible teachings of that preacher guy with the missing hand. Ruben somebody.</p>

<p>An implementation of VTEC-E and standard VTEC, the 3-Stage VTEC is present in the D15B engine. The engine is notable for its excellent economy alongwith good power output.</p>
<p>The technology is named so because of its 3 'stages' of VTEC implementation, explained below.</p>
<p><b>Stage 1 - VTEC-E</b></p>
<p>An implementation of VTEC for economy, it turns off one intake valve per cylinder in the 16valve engine, and attains Lean Burn mode. The lean burn mode gets the Air to Fuel ratio above the 12.4 Stichiometric ratio and thus enables extra fuel saving. This can lead to km/l averages of 30 if driven at a constant speed of 60km/h.</p>
<p>The VTEC-E mode engages in the D15B from 0-3000RPM.</p>
<p><b>Stage 2</b></p>
<p>From 3000-6000rpm, the VTEC-E mode turns off and all of the engines intake valves are used. The engine is now like any other normal VTEC engine when the VTEC isnt 'on'.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3 - VTEC</b></p>
<p>From 6000+rpm (till rev limit) the engines VTEC wild cam is engaged increasing performance and giving 130hp @ 7000rpm in the D15B</p>

<p>The Cut and Run is an annual trail race event hosted by AmeriCorps Cape Cod <a href="http://www.rdoac.org/americorps/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rdoac.org/americorps/index.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It is a two-day event that includes both the race itself (a distance of 5-kilometers around Long Pond in Falmouth), along with an additional 'pre-race clean-up' event. Each year, the Cut and Run pre-race clean-up recruits and engages countless volunteers in environmental stewardship activities on local conservation lands. It is important to note that not only is the race not-for-profit, but that in fact all financing is provided by independent donors. This is significant because it means that contributions from entrants (in the form of race fees) are dedicated entirely toward the the cause itself (e.g. the Cape Cod Pathways Project <a href="http://www.capecodcommission.org/pathways" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capecodcommission.org/pathways" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), allowing the participants to feel a genuine sense of economic investment in the cause.</p>
