<li>I don't see how in the world this violates an ArbCom ruling unless the ruling was that LaRouchites can't write about LaRouche. The only question I can see is whether it's notable enough to have an article. Since we already have lots of content on LaRouche, and since LaRouche does have an organization of some size, the answer to that seems to me to be that yes it is sufficiently notable. I suppose if this is a particularly obscure or marginal idea even by LaRouche standards I might change my mind. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:58, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

That is, merge it into the Economics section of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_views_of_Lyndon_LaRouche_3478.html" title="Political views of Lyndon LaRouche">Political views of Lyndon LaRouche</a>, but probably split that article into two, "Political views of..." and "Economic theories of..." That way, the first can be a place to dump, and rewrite in neutral prose, his general conspiracy theory nonsense, and the second can serve the same purpose for his self-aggrandizing fanciful economic models. Redirecting from the names of his individual theories and concepts depends on the circumstances.

<ul>
<li>There are plenty of articles on Wikipedia with a "lack of significance of or interest in them, except among believers". They still have articles. If the only available info on the web on these theories is LaRouche-approved text that's all the more reason why a neutral article on a non-LaRouche site discussing them might not be a bad thing, especially if there are LaRouche critics who have written criticisms or debunkings of these theories. Anyhow, isn't reliance on peer-reviewed journals to establish notability the sort of academic elitism that Wikipedia as a free encyclopedia is supposed to be making an end run around? <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 07:56, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe that the writer of the article has his/her facts wrong. What was seen in the <i>King Kong</i> production diary was almost certainly actual archival footage of ANZAC troops which was cleaned up by Weta Workshop to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in April this year. See this article <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Film/Into-the-trenches-with-a-cinecamera/2005/04/24/1114281447097.html?oneclick=true" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Film/Into-the-trenches-with-a-cinecamera/2005/04/24/1114281447097.html?oneclick=true" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information. AFAIK there is no planned movie on the ANZACs by Jackson - he is already in pre-production work on the next movie after <i>King Kong</i>, and it is nothing to do with World War I.

<li><b>Comment</b>. A "Homemade battery" article would be great.

This is what the guy is describing. There are different electrolytes that you could use (soda, lemon juice, salt water, etc.), but these all are not practical for use because the cell runs out of juice within a few hours, and the voltage generated is low, even when connected in series. There is almost no use for these homemade batteries except in a science fair project. In my opinion, they aren't really notable because they aren't really practical. <font size="1">(Preceding comment by <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 02:27, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC))</font>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Nuclear fusion, however, can produce large amounts of energy (like the Sun) whereas a homemade battery cannot. By "impractical", I assume the meaning <i>not useful</i>, or <i>not capable of being turned to use</i> instead of <i>not possible</i>. Nuclear fusion would indeed be useful, but a homemade battery would generate little voltage.

<dd>Hi,200.46.215.181
<dl>
<dd>The grammar is not the main reason I posted this article on the votes for deletion. I appreciate that people from all around the world want, and should, continue to collaborate to wikipedia. I myself am french-speaking, and you are right, it is difficult to stay on the frech wikipedia when almost all articles are more complete in english.</dd>
<dd>However, the problem with this particular article is that it is a justification of japanese nationalism and not a neutral description of events. I do not think this is justified in an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>For example, you say "this if motif for Russian-Japanese War of 1904-05,for why obtain some concessions socalled "Treated Rigths" in South Manchuria.in 1910,Korea having formally annexed,during first decades of century the territorial security are principal military motif." The way I read this, you imply that Japan had all rights to gain concessions in South Manchuria. This is a one-sided analysis.</dd>
<dd>If you want to try to re-write this article, you should at least cite sources, and put your sentences in the form "according to xxx, ...". But even then, it should be included in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_nationalism.html" title="Japanese nationalism">Japanese nationalism</a>, which is where it belongs. We do not need separate articles for different opinions on the same subject.</dd>
<dd>I hope I have the chance to read more of your work in the future,</dd>

<ul>
<li>-if one interested and logic point,but in particular i treated</li>
</ul>
<p>to present the japanese point of seeing,for comparing and analized your think at respect,with historical pourposes.</p>
<p>respect at much reading of my work,i am readed the material analized and writing the importants parts,(exist much informations) and still my grammar deficiences i understand your english writing form with correct gramar in clear form.</p>
<p>respect at another sides of question,for all exist the respectives analizes why present your respective side.i am no treated to enter in conflict with any side,i only treated to present the japanese viewpoint for knowed the respective ideas in these times,more diffrent at present days.</p>
<p>reiterally if your desired deleted,i no poses any problem for this. if part of the sistem and understand more well.</p>

<li>I propose a solution to this problem. We can correct the biased POV, by having both sides write parts of the article. Since the article currently is against "fake ivies," I suggest having NoHat, a representative of Cornell, one of these so called "Fake ivies" write his POV. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECancan101_7f6a.html" title="User:Cancan101">Cancan101</a> 04:28, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>"Yam HaTalmud" appears to be an expression or phrase that means something like "the ocean of Torah study". There also appears to be a book called "Yam HaTalmud". This article speaks of a "much storied torah journal of the Lander College for Men ... featuring Torah summaries and novellae from such luminaries as Asher Mendelsberg".</p>
<p>"Yam HaTalmud" gets no google hits when paired with any of "Lander College" or "Asher Mendelsberg". Also, the article speaks of its "pending publication is eagerly anticipated throughout the Diaspora", which could mean that the thing hasn't even been published at all.

The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>While I respect Jerzy's concerns, most of the early voters did <i>not</i> cite the copyvio as the dominant reason for deletion. They argued that this was "vanity" which, however prejudicial you consider that word, is the normal shorthand used here for an article about a person which is either <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">auto-biographical</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverifiable</a>. I find that there is concensus to delete this from the main article space on that basis.</p>
<p>Noting that there is an associated user who appears to be the same person, I am going to offer to move this to his user page. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:38, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I nom'ed this bio for n-n, and i'm a bit embarrassed to see "vanity" being tossed in, by the only three other del voters, as a reason. IMO we have here an honest misunderstanding (in fact, maybe only a <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> edited-in speculataion, rather than a disagreement) about notability here. We have here an apparently responsible professional, who realizes that stating the role of his personal leadership in innovation is part of the advancement of professionalism within his field. IMO there is such a difference in degree, between that and a student using WP for self assertion, as to constitute a difference in kind. We might be wise in general to consider including the word "vanity" (which presumes to determine a contributor's state of mind) a term of abuse worth mentioning as a form of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. In any case, vanity does not mean "n-n and autobio", and i am heartily sorry that the word is that popular, and that closely associated with "del", in this VfD. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a>·<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">t</a> 14:35, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have reverted to the copyvio boilerplate. The chief of police may be the <i>subject</i> of the article, but he is not the copyright holder.

<dd>This is boilerplate, probably to protect from mischevious use by less than admirable people (suspects angry at the sheriff, for example) The Sheriff wouldn't take copyright on a city site, but he can maintain practical control.

<li><b>Information</b>. Thank you for your feedback on the entry. The copywright on the Police Department website was requested by me in order to control distribution of material. The government code in CA views Police Chiefs differently from other governmental appointees in that the Chief is soley responsible for all aspects of the department until they resign, retire or are removed from office. While it's rare, the PD holds the copywrite for the website and its contents, much the same as the Los Angeles Police Department retains control over various use of its name and/or symbols. Such authority is vested in the chief. The Yuba City Police Department is recognized as one of the most technologically advanced agencies of its size in the U.S. We often host visitors from agencies throughout the U.S. and abroad. We are the only municipal police agency in the nation to have gained clearance from the U.S. National Security Agency to act as an area hub for the receipt and dissemination of classified Homeland Security data. While listing in Wikipedia assists significantly in allowing a resource for interested parties to gain detailed background data prior to interviews on techknology and/or Homeland Security topics, I am very willing to be guided by your decisions. If the article is delated, I appreciate the venue as it has helped our agency since its initial posting. Thank you for allowing me to clarify some details. <a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdoscherca_f20f.html" title="User:Rdoscherca">Rdoscherca</a> 02:29, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Especially since Xoloz's "probably" is not good enuf, this is a valuable clarification, answering Rick's "why would they need a copyright claim...?" To flesh it out slightly, "in order to control distribution of material" refers in part to what is quite explicit in the statute:
<ul>
<li>the copyright protections everyone knows about apply (contrary to popular belief) even without any copyright notice.</li>
<li>the right to have your lawyers paid by the copyright violator when you sue the violator exists only when there is a copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The YCPD lost virtually all its copyright protection (with respect to the bio only) when the chief put the bio under GDFL by his submission, since GDFL gives such broad permission. IMO the mayor or council, and the city attorney, would at most grumble about whether other city officials might infer an unwisely broader precedent from this pretty special case.</dd>
<dd>The chief's language about "copywright ... requested" is a little confusing, but i assume he is refering to <i>asserting</i> (or legally, giving notice of) the copyright.</dd>

Those who are following this page without following the article have been left without what would seem to be the required notice that the VfD notice has been removed there, and a CopyVio notice put in its place. While my judgement is that the Chief's claim to exercise the copyright holder's power to put this text under VfD should be assumed valid in the absence of contrary evidence that has not been offered, there is IMO no reason not to let this play out on the Copyright problems page; AFAIK it will just come back here in due time, if Rick turns out to be mistaken.<br />

<p>Dr. Economos clearly fits in this descritpion. The radio programming field, while narrow, has a large impact on society. Radio programmers decides what gets airplay, and radio has great influence in popular culture. Andrew Economos is a widely recognized figure as an innovator in the field.</p>
<p>Does somebody have to be a member of popular culture (baseball star or politician) to be included in Wikipedia&#160;? I hope not! I believe Dr. Economos is notabale, although certainly not a pop culture figure&#160;! The purpose of an Encyclopedia is to provide information on important and interesting subjects. Many people, IMHO are interested in mass media, broadcasting, radio and music. Music scheduling by computer was pioneered by Dr. Economos. 207.67.132.209</p>

<li>That would be unimaginative, if true. Reasonable criteria that would do so are relatively easy to imagine. ("Keep basic foodstuffs like <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peach.html" title="Peach">peach</a> and meals that have existed for over 100 years but not fast food restaurant menu items" would be one such criterion, for example.) I'm not convinced that that <i>was</i> the implication, however. It's certainly hard to read such an implication into the actual words there before us, which read more plainly as a straight dichotomy comprising "keep all articles about food" and "delete all articles about food", with no middle allowed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:11, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_Salad_6996.html" title="Waldorf Salad">Waldorf Salad</a> contains mayo and celery, and also began as a <b>commercial</b> product, bearing the name of a famous serving establishment. This is a distinct salad, also a commercial product, sold by a merchant as famous (or infamous) today as Waldorf's was in the past. To me, the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf.html" title="Waldorf">Waldorf</a> precedent supports a keep, and I stand by my vote above. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This one has a mayo substitute, albeit no celery; it is clearly an adaptation of the other. And to compare a product that was released a month ago with something that has been around for a century is just plain ridiculous. The Waldorf Salad has entered the lexicon; McDonalds fruit and walnut salad has not, and likely never will. At the <i>very least</i> this needs to be moved to a McDonalds specific title and disambiguated, because having a general food item like this indicate a specific menu item at a spcific restaurant is basically promoting McDonalds. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:38, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you'd expect, I don't find my contention "ridiculous."&#160;:) To my mind, McDonald's is (unfortunately) sufficiently powerful and ubiquitous such that any product they release, with major fanfare as a new marketing strategy centerpiece, is almost immediately notable (even if it fails -- see <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Coke_ee64.html" title="New Coke">New Coke</a>.) This article isn't advertising; it reflects the (sad) reality that these commercial product releases are notable in American life, pathetic though that may be. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hardly think anything Mcdonalds sells in inherently encyclopedic (and just about every product they release is marketed with great fanfare). The notion that if someone advertizes something sufficiently it belongs in an encyclopedia is a flawed notion: it would make an encyclopia would be be just another ad. I'm sure it took many years for Waldorf Salad (something quite new) to become widely known and popular enough to warrant an inclusion in an encyclopedia, and I hardly think McDonalds stealing the idea 100 years later puts them on the fast track. I've watched quite a bit of TV recently, I'm sorry to say, and I had not yet heard of this new item. That's hardly surprising, as fast food chains put out about a new item every few minutes and it's easy to ignore them. I think this article is indicitive of the tendency for people to write articles on everything as it appears without any regard of greater significance, while disregarding more important things of the past. Nevertheless, I would not entirely object to much of the content of this article being mentioned elsewhere, but currently it's the equivalent of finding an article on the KFC bucket meal when one types "fried chicken". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:52, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sad to say that, together with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Adorno_ccac.html" title="Theodor Adorno">Adorno</a>, I do think that a powerful capitalist entity can make something encyclopedic just by advertising it potently and widely. Advertising works -- as any <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propagandist.html" title="Propagandist">propagandist</a> in history can attest. The article can be revised to mention the salad is a partial response to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Size_Me_b2c5.html" title="Super Size Me">Super Size Me</a> and its backlash.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't mind a separate article on McDonald's Coporate Response to Health Concerns, although with a much better title.

<li><b>Delete</b>. To be honest, I find the idea of articles on one month old fast food restaurant menu items to be absolutely idiotic. I'm sure McDonalds appreciates the advertising, though. McDonalds has a few items that are culturally important (for example Big Mac and Quarter Pounder) that deserve articles. The cultural importance of <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_and_walnut_salad.html" title="Fruit and walnut salad">Fruit and walnut salad</a> is zero, and will probably remain zero forever. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 06:23, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: well, I am amazed to find that people have actually managed to rewrite this article to such a high standard. The current content should, of course, be kept. My one reservation now with leaving the article as is, is as per R. Fiend - this is a global encyclopedia, and <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a> do not have the <i>only</i> Fruit and walnut salad. That is a generic term, and if the article is to remain, should be made more generic. Maybe what would be more appropriate is to move to a Fruit and walnut salad (McDonalds) page, and create a list of McDonalds menu items (as described above). Fruit and walnut salad could contain generic blurb about what one is, and mention McDo listing it, linking accordingly. I would agree with Quale, however, that this is ultimately rather un-notable, and free advertising for McDo as it stands... he's right that the cultural importance is probably zero. However, we're not exactly runnin out of space, so I see no reason to totally remove this content now it's been re-written... we just need to decide where to put it! <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 07:45, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

If we have other cultural foods, we should definitely have Mashed Potatoes and Gravy. Note that this is not just two random foods put together [like celery and peanut butter], rather potatoes are one of the most [if not the most common] meals that gravy goes with. I think the problem with seeing why this is valid is that we simple fans of the dish didn't come up with some new inventive name for it. The Canucks take french fries and throw gravy on it and it becomes poutaine.

<p>Another web forum. Although this article is reasonably well written, I can't figure out why this is notable. Although I get about a thousand Google hits after weeding out the string "star wars", I still can't tell that this group is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Well if the Che-lives article covering the Rebel Alliance is shortend to say a link and this page stays would that not cover it? because it is not covered to any detail in the Che-Lives article. Remember this is a relatively new development in Che-Lives, you seem a bit too keen to get rid of the article.

Che-Lives has a rather lengthy page describing different aspects of it, and it's history... I don't see why the Rebel Alliance, a prominent division of it should be robbed of such a thing while che-live's history and information is allowed to remain. <i>(unsigned edit by 24.131.136.226)</i></p>

<p>Personally I think that this is an interesting development. If this infomation were to be merged into the main Che-lives page then it is possible that the page would be too long. However, so long as the infomation is kept (either on the Che-lives page or on its own page) I don't mind what is done. If things continue and this forum actually becomes a lot more active then there is reason to leave it as a seperate page. I vote to delete the page and merge the infomation back into the main Che-lives page until such time as the forums become more active. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrismw_46b5.html" title="User:Harrismw">harrismw</a> 01:58, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I vote no. The page itself stands for an independent website, not a sub-division of Che-Lives. It would be more appropriate to delete a part of the information regarding Rebel Alliance on the Che-Lives website. --User:RedStarOverChina</p>

<p>This page should definately have a stay. Aslong as there is something to write about it (Enough information), it should always stay because all articles need to be considered, atleast once, and allowed to exist..since this is Wikipedia, and we should strive to cover as most subject as possible and if someone does the bother to write a bit about it, why try to save a lil' bandwith 'cuz you don't like "small" boards, which could always become something bigger and more than a forum?

<p>The Rebel Alliance is not a website, as such. It is a community composed of people with a (roughly) shared political or philosophical leaning who happen to be divided by large distances and so communicate using the internet.</p>

<p>Seems to be too non-specific a slang/nickname for too many areas to be worth recording in an encyclopedia. <i>"Golden Corridor"</i> gets 7k hits, but <i>"Golden Corridor" dallas</i> only gets a fraction of those--there are apparently other areas sometimes called 'golden corridor' in Cabo, Mexico; India; Illinois, USA; Atlanta, USA; Cambridge, UK; gold country in CA/NV, USA; and somewhere in China; and that's just among the first 21 hits for <i>"golden corridor"</i>. Seems more like an over-used, hyperbolic adjective than a noun. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 23:48, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep, expand</b>. Sorry, but to me "slang/nickname for too many areas" is a reason to keep this as a general article on the use of this term to describe certain chunks of real estate based on certain characteristics. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 00:26, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as notability not established; this doesn't seem to be a very common usage. For example, "Golden Corridor" +Dallas gets me 1300 googles; in contrast, "Gold Coast" +Chicago (a comparable neighborhood in a comparable city) gets me 783,000. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 14:09, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Delete: It isn't a thing, but rather a coincidence of words. Next will be "golden ghetto." It's just a slang term that has no particular place to point. As such, its claims can only be either unverifiable or lexical, and both violate policy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:56, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
