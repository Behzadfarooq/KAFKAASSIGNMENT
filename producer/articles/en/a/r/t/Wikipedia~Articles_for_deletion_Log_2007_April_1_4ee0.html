First, there is little documentation on this (or, really, any) coloquialism phenom, and most of what's out there is...well, pretty much through word of mouth. The closest you'll get to documentation is, say, a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> novel, for the simple reason that King's books just kind of come out that way. Second, the only really good way to document this is to provide a list of examples with an explanation of the concept - and at the time of my&#160;!vote here, that's pretty much what the article does.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand the arguments against this article... wait a minute... there are none! Every "delete" vote is merely making fun of the article and/or calling it "ridiculous." Last time I checked the AfD is meant for discussion and arguments for deletion, not mocking the articles at hand. Now, there have been many articles (both newspaper and scholarly) written about the subject, so it easily fulfills both <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (see this article in the <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a></i>: <a href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=506b02ad7e26bc148cd45d04183e7ccd&amp;_docnum=3&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=85dc90e9fcdc15fc2d87d6f6a9643366" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=506b02ad7e26bc148cd45d04183e7ccd&amp;_docnum=3&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=85dc90e9fcdc15fc2d87d6f6a9643366" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and then add that to the already numerous mentions in JSTOR and Google Scholar).

<li><b>Keep</b> I added 2 articles from the Deseret News of Salt Lake City, which just meets the general requirement of "multiple independent reliable sources with substantial coverage." That said, it is a pretty impressive operation, with spaceship simulators to teach concepts in science and history to 16000 school children a year from around the U.S and around the world since 1990. The article could use a general rewrite from those and other sources, since it assumes too much familiarity with the subject. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:53, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It is easy to add references to support the notability of this center. Yes, it needs a cleanup but that is not a valid deletion reason. If kept, consideration should be given to moving this article and making this a dab page. Yes, there apparently are two different facilities with the same name.

<dd><b>comment</b> Naturally, what you're saying is that totally baseless and untrue facts can be presented as fact on Wikipedia. I know you're probably upset that something you created should be deleted.

<p>I apologize in advance for the long explanation. As much as I’m pained to do this (I’m a huge fan of both Danger Mouse’s and Jemini’s), I have to say that since the original announcement from <a href="http://www.lexrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lexrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">Lex Records</a>, there has been no further information released about this album. It originally had a release date for October of last year, which was later pushed back to March 19, 2007. However, that date passed without the release of the album, and neither party has made any announcement since. HMV (the sole site that carried any info to the album) had the release date at March 19, but now says that the album has been completely removed from the site and the title deleted (see release date and the line below on the site) <a href="http://www.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/simpleSearch.do?pGroupID=-1&amp;simpleSearchString=Kill+Your+Heroes&amp;primaryID=-1&amp;btnSubmitSearch.x=0&amp;btnSubmitSearch.y=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/simpleSearch.do?pGroupID=-1&amp;simpleSearchString=Kill+Your+Heroes&amp;primaryID=-1&amp;btnSubmitSearch.x=0&amp;btnSubmitSearch.y=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Amazon.com, allmusic.com, and Danger Mouse’s website all have no info on the album, or any notion that it even exists. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTAL" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>; the album might be released next week, next month, or in ten years – there is no source citing an official date. Because of this information, this article should be deleted until further, verifiable information is given. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 02:10, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Reason for gluten intolerance given by <i>The Penguin Dictionary of Biology</i> (10<sup>th</sup> ed., M. Thain &amp; M.

<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> Article's title is mispelled. Do a paper search on "Exorphin" -- no trailing E -- and you will find dozens of papers on the topic from reputable institutions, which at least demonstrates that exorphines exist and are documented science. Too bad none of these citations are in the article. What I am less sure of is the conclusions at the top of the article -- a quick browse of the research didn't immediately turn up any empirical link to the diseases mentioned -- but the article should be cited and supported, not struck. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECollabi_ffaf.html" title="User:Collabi">Collabi</a> 10:34, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>This article is not very sourced; however, this is not a reason for deletion. I believe that it is not "sourceable". If this article comes from documentation of unreleased songs that this band has released, then that should be referenced. This list is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#.23IINFO" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a>, because this band may not always indicate which songs they <i>won't</i> release, and this information probably won't come from a reliable source. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 03:46, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an article about a voice actor who does Spanish dubs. I don't know if this is notable on the English Wikipedia. We have a lot of articles about Japanese voice actors, but they're not notable for their dubbing roles (although a few of them have dub roles listed). I'm not entirely sure if the article should be here. At least, it's worth debating.

<dd>True, sorry to say I did not notice that. However, unfortunately I can not find his name in what I can read of the article to make any judgment. But assuming it is correct, is mention in the LA times and a few smaller papers enough? I am not sure. I would like to hear what other editors think.

<li>I agree, many sources are used. I have seen this young man on TV several times, on the City Channel. Although I'm not one for Public Access, I believe the man is legitimate in having an article.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Despite the sock-puppeting --- this article seems sourced and while I don't know of him --- there seems to be enough information available on him from various sources so that someone ELSE could redo his article and make it read less like a resumé. That to me seems like enough to keep the article. A quick glance around the internet and his named popped up a few times in major media outlets, and many times in his local outlets.

There is no out of universe information (which is against <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>) and likely no chance for this (I doubt there are developer interviews geared solely toward the masks seen in two Zelda games). Additionally, the page violates <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>; there are no sources attributed, and a couple cases of OR where speculation or suspected allusions are noted.</p>
<p>I'm certain this information is already in the Zelda Wikia; if not, and there is an agreement to transwiki and redirect to preserve edit history, then I'm fine with that. However, I posted a comment on the main article of Zelda items (<a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurring_weapons_and_items_from_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_ea71.html" title="Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series">Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series</a>) which yielded no response, so I assume that means nobody is interested in turning this part of Wikipedia into a section of an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a walkthrough or overly detailed database. I appreciate the effort people placed into this article, so again, if someone wants to transwiki and redirect the article (if mask info is not already in the Zelda Wikia), then that would be even better than pure deletion. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 06:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also adding this article to the AfD for the same reasons: <b>Masks, weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</b>. We don't normally have subarticles for all the items in a game (look at the Final Fantasy FAs for a good example), not to mention the policy issues previously explained. Because the main page is already detailed enough in terms of gameplay, a merger is unnecessary. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 06:32, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Addendum:</b> Many of the votes on this page seem to assume that there is content on the page that is "worth keeping". However, we cannot keep <i>anything</i> on this page that is unreliably sourced. I have requested sources over and over since the last AfD (two months ago) and got absolutely nothing. It's as if we have made a page about some guy who lives in New York who everyone is making big claims about that nobody can back up with evidence ("Oh, I talked to him last week and he told me he was a tenured professor").

<li><b>Keep</b> Why is Ashibaka alias Shii doing the same thing all over again? He already nominated it for delete and the result was Keep. Then he threatened to redirect it which would really mean deleting it in spite of the decision. Now he's doing it again! And how can we do anything to the article when it's protected anyway? This all started when Ashibaka alias Shii made some edits to the article that were reverted. Right after that he put it for delete. This article was created because before there was a separate article on <i>Apocrypha Discordia, Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht, A Discordian Coloring Book</i>, etc. Should we go back to having a separate article on each one of these, which is how it was before?

<p><b>Comment</b> Once again, I'm not taking sides on this third version of the debate about keeping or deleting this article due to my obvious bias. But as usual I can't resist throwing in a comment or two. Based on <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a>' comment, I did read through the procedures that Wikipedia policy suggests be followed before this stage. I would imagine that these policies existed the last time this article was put up for deletion by <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShii_2d87.html" title="User:Shii">Shii</a><small>formerly Ashibaka</small>.</p>
<p>I would suggest that those involved in this discussion might want to look through <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a> to see what is the recommended procedure, and if this was followed either this time or the first time <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShii_2d87.html" title="User:Shii">Shii</a><small>formerly Ashibaka</small> nominated this article for deletion. If you want more backgroup, you might want to check this user's previous attempt at deletion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Discordian_Works_%282nd_nomination%29_e916.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Discordian Works (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Discordian_Works_(2nd_nomination)</a> or the request for mediation at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2007-02-10_Discordian_Works_91e6.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2007-02-10 Discordian Works">Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2007-02-10_Discordian_Works</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note that people can very easily say is inappropriate for this page, I also plan to add a little section to my <a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7EReverend_Loveshade_79c1.html" title="User talk:Reverend Loveshade">User talk page</a> where I'll collect some of <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShii_2d87.html" title="User:Shii">Shii</a><small>formerly Ashibaka</small> comments about me. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverend_Loveshade_ce75.html" title="User:Reverend Loveshade">Reverend Loveshade</a> 04:32, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Middle Eastern American" is <b>not</b> an ethnic group. Just because <b>one</b> author (Joe Feagin) claims it is, does not make it so!</li>
<li>"Middle Eastern American" is <b>not</b> an official classification in the US, the US census doesn't use it, and vast majority of publications in the US do not use it.</li>
<li>No sources have been provided here that show Iranians, Turks, and other non-Arabs of the region identify overwhelmingly as "Middle Eastern American". That is because most Iranians, Turks, other non-Arabs <b>do not</b> identify with this British invention of a term.</li>
<li>No sources have been provided which show that "Middle Eastern" refers to anything except a geographic territory. In fact, almost all legitimate sources use "Middle East" <b>purely</b> as geographic marker, thats all! Its not the same as "European" or "Iranian" (which includes peoples who speak Iranian languages in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajikistan.html" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbekistan.html" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, etc!)</li>
<li>Iranian is <b>not</b> an ethnic group but a nationality and linguistic umbrella!</li>
<li>Only the southwestern portion of Iran is in the geography of the Middle East. The north is in the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and the east is in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>.</li>
<li>Half of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> is in Europe! Turkey is looking to joining the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>!</li>
<li>The article excludes Armenians, Azeris, Afghans, who are all culturally and historically related to Persians and Iran! They should not be included for the same reasons here, but also Iranians and Turks should not be included for the same reasons.</li>
<li>It goes without saying that there is <b>no</b> evidence whatsoever, none, to show that Iranians, Turks, Arabs, and whoever else some bigoted author wants to throw in, all share a common identity and culture! I mean, what the hell?! That is insane. Not even Arabs share the same culture or identity - they only share the same language.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other reasons that I can list, but overall it is purely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and borderline racism by the focus on racial classification. We are not in Nazi Germany and this is not the 1930s. And I stress again and again that the American government does <b>not</b> use this classication and <b>does not</b> lump all people from "Middle Eastern" countries into one category! <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 03:04, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This was discussed before, and there has been disputes in the article because of this: The concept is vague, and since Middle East is a vague geographical marker nobody has been able to produce a clear-cut definition of "Middle Eastern". Continents and nationalities (European-American, German-American etc) are clearly defined and depend on solid academic concensus. Even if we reduced the content of the article to this debate over its definition, than it is better off being transferred to Wikitionary. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, <b>Neutral</b> until I can finish looking into this a little more.

<ul>
<li>I personally know some people of Middle Eastern descent who chafe at having to check the Caucasian box on US government forms. And the presence of various "Middle Eastern Student Associations" indicates that it's not an overtly problematic label. But, that said, while I think the concept of the Middle Eastern experience in the US might warrant some sort of article, probably with a different title, there's just no salvaging what's currently here. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 00:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One cannot be of "Middle Eastern descent" since there is no Middle Eastern "race". There are tens of dozens of ethnic groups in the Middle East: many are White/Caucasian, many are not (in Iran for example we have people - the Turkmen - who are of Turkic-Mongol descent and thus look completely Asian), many are somewhere in-between. Many people in the West make the mistake of thinking that there is some kind of Middle Eastern "race" but its nonsense. Whatever "shared experience" there is, as you put it, is due to such prejudices, but even then you have a problem. For instance, after 9/11, many Hindus and Sikhs and Pakistanis were attacked and harassed, even though people descended from India and Pakistan cannot be considered "Middle Eastern" because of the geography. I have heard some Greeks and Greek Cypriots describe themselves as "Middle Eastern", but again this is due to prejudice at people scoffing at the notion that Greece is a truly European country. In the end it's nonsense and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to entertain such ideas here at Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia, not a <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapbox</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 15:44, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an attempt at creating a list of the story arcs in the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)</a> franchise. However, it is harmful to for several reasons:</p>

<li>Firstly, the "arcs" of the Bleach storyline are very ill-defined and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">unattributable</a>, making this page an exercise in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>Secondly, this page is utterly redundant to the existing pages <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_manga_chapters_d7cf.html" title="List of Bleach manga chapters">List of Bleach manga chapters</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_episodes_4f9c.html" title="List of Bleach episodes">List of Bleach episodes</a>.</li>
<li>Thirdly, it is an attempt at a plot summary, which has been repeatedly ruled against on <a href="../../../b/l/e/Talk%7EBleach_%28manga%29_22bc.html" title="Talk:Bleach (manga)">Talk:Bleach (manga)</a> by the subject editors because it is not only absolutely unnecessary and engenders <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">policy violation</a>, but that it actually takes less time to find the manga online than it does to read a prose summary of the events.</li>
<li>Fourthly and finally, it will reduce our ability to properly cover Bleach on Wikipedia by splitting the coverage across an even wider array of pages, resulting in more confusion for readers and more work for editors attempting to bring the pages into line with policy and consistency with each other.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I just want to head people off at the pass. Please do not just simply cite WP:NOT#IINFO point 7 and vote. This is article is obviously meant as an aspect of the larger <i><a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)</a></i> subject, so it does not instantly qualify for deletion under this clause. That said, please review the conversation here: <a href="../../../b/l/e/Talk%7EBleach_%28manga%29_22bc.html#Needs_a_plot_summary" title="Talk:Bleach (manga)">Talk:Bleach (manga)#Needs a plot summary</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - A few reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>So far, consensus seems to be in favour of not having a comprehensive summary.</li>
<li>Plot summaries are tricky things. Anyone who's read the series doesn't need it, anyone who doesn't care about the series doesn't need it, and anyone who wants to know it would, in the case of Bleach, probably find it easier to read the manga or watch the anime themselves, rather than read a bunch of prose. It's also more satisfying and much easier to understand the story when you see it for yourself.</li>
<li>The series is available in four different ways: Japanese manga, which is released weekly and scanslations are available; English manga, which volumes are released every couple of months; Japanese anime, which is again released weekly and fansubs are available; or English anime, which airs weekly. Which plot should we follow? They're all at VERY different places in the storyline. And if we did follow one specific storyline, what about the differences between the anime and the manga, i.e. the Bount arc?</li>
<li>A less solid reason, but since the story is ongoing and shows no signs of stopping, I feel that, especially since the plot is already available between other pages about the Bleach universe, and being updated weekly with the new Japanese chapters' information, a plot page would be extremely unwieldy and, as stated by <a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a>, redundant, causing even more hassle to keep all the pages consistent.</li>

<p>Unsuccessful congressional candidate from 2004. Received under 4% of the Democratic primary vote (placing last) and raised just $179. Googling him returns few results apart from Wikipedia and mirror sites.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm afraid that's not the basis on which decisions on deleting articles are made. Take a look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which explains Wikipedia's policies on deleting biographical articles. If you think the Travis Liles article meets the criteria for inclusion, then leave a message here explaining why. However, the fact that someone's put in the time to run for office is not, in and of itself, enough. Nor is the possibility (evidenced where?) that they may run again. -- <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELincolnite_dc5e.html" title="User:Lincolnite">Lincolnite</a> 16:53, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It looks like at least two of the Google Scholar hits are the result of the Wikipedia listing - a good reason to delete this before it establishes itself in the wild. I'd say the term has been used once in a book. As an expert in this field (really!) I can say confidently that while "Knightian uncertainty" is a standard term, Arrovian uncertainty is not - the usual terms here would be "risk" or "unambiguous/crisp uncertainty". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 05:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Late last night I was awake enough to put in GS and GB links, but not awake enough to explain why. Anyway, since it is used occasionally and thus might be a search term, it seems that it might be useful to put a redirect here. That way if someone is reading <i>The Economic Impact of Knowledge</i> and isn't paying much attention, WP will know where to send them, perhaps to <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncertainty.html" title="Uncertainty">uncertainty</a> or even as a part of developing <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knightian_uncertainty.html" title="Knightian uncertainty">Knightian uncertainty</a> or something similar into an article. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 12:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> as I'm willing to accept the sources but I'm not sure this is a notable name (at least, it isn't recorded widely). It is well known that the Wehrmacht was obsessed with STDs and operated its own brothel system but in France apparently they usually took over existing brothels, checked the women for disease, and then made them exclusively for the troops. That doesn't jibe with this story. They may have been part of this system, but better we have a full article on the cooptation of prostitution than this stub. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><strike>Weak</strike> keep</b> - the article could do with more sources and ATM I can't dig out more. I wrote it as a stub and stub it is, but it definitely is an encyclopaedic material. As to specific arguments listed above: original research is not the best way to confirm or deny anything in WP; Yad Vashem might not have anything about it since it doesn't seem related to the Holocaust; references are references, like them or not. Do we have any references disputing the ones we have? If not, the claim that such a thing did not exist would have to be proven first. Finally, as to Jadger's arguments - well, not every Nazi WWII crime was committed to slander Germans after WWII. The Nazis did not kill millions of people and rob millions of others to make them more prone to anti-German sentiments. And, contrary to what Jadger states, there are at least two sources cited in the article and two additional at the talk page. If four sources make an article "unreferenceable", then how many would do? <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 20:23, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A good question. I have no sources available here and it is possible that it were only rumors/half-truths.

The one link identified as a reference was to a website that required a paid membership to access (after a "trial membership"). I honestly did not realize that the other links were meant to be references; none of the links were related to any part of the text. There has been some effort to do that, as <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECiting_sources_1762.html" title="WP:Citing sources">WP:Citing sources</a> requires; however, there is still a long way to go, and now some of the links are listed in both the references section and other sections. It isn't enough to just list a bunch of sources at the bottom of the page and have the reader plow through all of them to find out where a particular piece of information came from; each piece of information needs to be tied to its source. I apologize for rushing to nominate; it was not a well-considered response on my part.<font color="#721227">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#DC5300"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#721227"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 01:26, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

He should stay on that basis alone, aside from the additional notoriety bestowed by his political activities. Since the rule is well established on Wikipedia that porn actors may have their own bio pages, Matt Sanchez stays. What is the basis for excluding Matt Sanchez while allowing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Carey_0db0.html" title="Mary Carey">Mary Carey</a> to have a standalone bio page? The fact that a subject is violating the rules and improperly editing his own bio is not sufficient to justify wholesale deletion.

<p>Effectively I am nominating on behalf of <a href="../../../h/u/w/User%7EHuw_Powell_976e.html" title="User:Huw Powell">User:Huw_Powell</a> who identified this as a deletion candidate but was unsure about how to nominate an article for deletion. His argument essentially ran that an organisation of only 40 people on whom the sole available source is a website last updated 2004 is ripe material for deletion. That certainly sounds like a reasonable assertion to me, so I'll give his proposal a chance in this forum, and slip him a message to let him know how to nominate articles in future. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 16:52, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> Hi, thanks for setting this up for me, Grappler. Most of my reasons are at the talk page, I will try to remember them and list them here, since I guess my entry is technically the nomination for deletion. <b>One</b>, the article is unsourced. <b>Two</b>, the web site of the subject organization consists of one file with no links, and was last updated (with an anniversary announcement!) several years ago. A google search yields one more file, a member listing. <b>Three</b>, lack of notability. This is related to #1, in that there does not appear to be any "activity" in the public sphere by the group. That is, it basically appears to be a private club. Also (not a real "reason for deletion"), the only WP file that links to it is the one on <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_IQ_society_5751.html" title="High IQ society">High IQ Societies</a>. I would, of course, fully support the page if it could be sourced to even a single article in a newspaper or journal about the organization. I hope I have explained myself clearly, and thank you all for your time in considering this issue. <a href="../../../h/u/w/User%7EHuw_Powell_976e.html" title="User:Huw Powell">Huw Powell</a> 03:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This entry should definitely NOT be deleted. This short film recently debuted at an independent film festival in Los Angeles to rave reviews, and I understand it is slated to be shown at more festivals in the States and Europe later this year. Furthermore, there are some very well-known people from the art world who appear in the film, making it more noteworthy than most short films. The artworks by Julian Scaff that are featured in the film have been included in major art exhibitions in Beirut and Amsterdam. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Taye talbot (<a href="../../../t/a/y/User_talk%7ETaye_talbot_1bc4.html" title="User talk:Taye talbot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taye_talbot_b8c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taye talbot">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Taye talbot (<a href="../../../t/a/y/User_talk%7ETaye_talbot_1bc4.html" title="User talk:Taye talbot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Taye_talbot_b8c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Taye talbot">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please note that the film festival mentioned as an indication of notability is under discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Film_is_dead_festival_2445.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Film is dead festival">at its own AfD</a> for not being notable itself. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 21:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. First and foremost, that a film is going to appear in a festival does not mean it is notable, it means it's going to appear in a festival - so declarations of future notability become <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystal ballisms</a>. User Jscaff above even notes that there aren't many sources yet - which brings me to point the second, notability. A lack of sources is a lack of sources - and regardless of who makes it and who is in the film, the film is still required to meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines. Third and finally, there is probably <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> in the article. I'm inclined to believe that the article may be a means of promotion of this film - which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">one of the things that WP is not for</a>. I have no prejudice against recreation in the future, but it must meet the guidelines. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:27, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, googling "piles of dirt scaff" gives one (1) result, unrelated, and nothing at all on Google News Archive. Non-notable, and who appears in something is not relevant as notability is not generally transferable. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:12, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Lack of an Internet Movie Database for this film implies that it has not yet attained notability. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:42, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: While I completely agree with your reasoning, just as an aside, the converse is not necessarily true. Since IMDB allows anyone to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/updates?update=title" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/updates?update=title" rel="nofollow">create new entries</a>, the existence of an IMDB listing is not a good indicator of notability, since it is not necessarily "independent." <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 01:50, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just for clarity, I consider an IMDb entry a <i>minimum</i> requirement for a film to have a Wikipedia article; I'm not saying that all films listed in IMDb are sufficiently notable to warrant articles in Wikipedia. However, IMDb is not a wiki; they have editors who confirm the eligibility of submitted titles before they appear on the web site. I've submitted a few films for listing in IMDb myself, and while most were accepted, one was not because the staff could not verify its eligibility. IMDb is an independent source and reasonably reliable, but listing in it does not automatically prove notability because they accept <i>any</i> film that has been commercially released to theaters or on home video, among other criteria. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:22, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Cool, thanks for the explanation. In case an IMDB entry appears before the end of the AfD, I didn't want someone to think that such an entry was some sort of defacto indicator of notability. (As I have seen on other AfD's). <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 02:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Due to salad shots just recently being created there is no possible way to cite sources other than by way of pictures or by video. When I looked in <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:Aunder</a> the Citing Yourself section it states "You may cite your own publications just as you would cite anyone else's". Our own publications happens to be our website which is located at myspace.com (which you can click on in the main salad shots page). This website gives a full description of what Salad Shots are, the history of them, and future plans for it. What more of a reliable source is there than that? We are not trying to patronize wikipedia or make it look bad, I'm just trying to establish an article that talks about a real thing in the real world. If you delete this article it wont effect the world but it shows that wikipedia in all honesty is a dictatorship that is not open to any new ideas.</li>

Shadowyze has been recognized nationally and internationally and is even featured in an Encyclodpedia on Contemporary Native American Music which will be used as a resource on this article in the future. How is this not notable? As you can see there are countless resources online and in print that note Shadowyze even if you are ignorant of the subject. <a href="../../../l/o/j/User%7ELojah_c242.html" title="User:Lojah">Lojah</a></p>

<p>---There's really no need to tag as a re-write, by the time that happens it will be ready to come down as I am and have been actively rewriting this article to bring it up to academic standards. The article was a stub when I found it, and being an expert as well as a primary resource on the subject I took it upon myself to cut and past his bio, with intention of returning and updating and reworking the article as I learned better how to do so on Wikipedia (which I am still doing). Since I am the author of the bio, I gave myself permission to do this. It was a fallacy to recommend this article for deletion as Ms. Japan assumed that since she had not heard of the Subject that he was not noteworthy. I’ve carried on a dialogue with Ms. Japan that you can read on our talk pages. She did not bother to do adequate research on the subject of which she is ignorant, assumed BAD faith and she never even bothered to open a dialogue with the editors about our resources which I was in the process of organizing before she wantonly through up a recommendation for deletion. Since that time I’ve posted resources that more than fit Wikipedia standards of notable persons and have begun a rewrite of the article. There really is no conflict of interest in the matter, simply because I happen to have been fortunate to work with Shadowyze—that’s what makes me a primary resource. I am also a trained anthropologist and I am involved in the Wikipedia Indigenous Peoples project and this article falls within that domain. Now if I could just figure out how to make footnotes in the article, all my edits in all subjects would benefit. <a href="../../../l/o/j/User%7ELojah_c242.html" title="User:Lojah">Lojah</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> with caveats.

If Lojah is personally involved in the ways that it is said, then he needs to be restricted from editing the article. I would have no prob with him putting reference links, etc on the talk page for others to then interpret and condense. — <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevRagnarok_d659.html" title="User:RevRagnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevRagnarok_2ee5.html" title="User talk:RevRagnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RevRagnarok_b9f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/RevRagnarok">Contrib</a></sup></span> 10:50, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>After assessing the COI guidelines I can understand the why some people may have concerns over COI, however knowing the limits of my affiliation with the subject I’d have to profess that I fall into one of the “grey areas” the COI article talks about. I see nothing that firmly and bindingly restricts me from editing the article <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowyze.html" title="Shadowyze">Shadowyze</a>, based solely on having worked with the man. The only thing that seems to be a BINDING rule is Neutrality. I am not paid to write this article. And I expect to receive absolutely nothing from Shadowyze or affiliated companies for this task. I also receive no monetary benefit for the sale of any Shadowyze merchandise, and I receive no royalties from Shadowyze music. I merely know the man and have been fortunate enough to work with him from time to time. My music company and his are not affiliated and our musical styles are nearly incompatible. I see nothing in the guidelines that &gt;&gt;requires&lt;&lt; that I be restricted even if was an employee of Shadowyze, simply that it is discouraged (not the same thing as forbidden) and those people who may appear to have a COI should be cautious about editing and if there is someone else who can do the job, to defer to them. I AGREE, but where are they?</p>
<p>It does say “As Wikipedians and encyclopedists, our job is to put the interests of the encyclopedia first.” And that is why I chose to sign up here to provide better information on subjects particularly in the Native American categories that were lacking. I just got lucky enough to find an article that I have direct knowledge about and direct access to archived resources as part of my personal collection on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_tribes.html" title="Southeastern tribes">Southeastern Indians</a> that apparently few if any one else on Wikipedia has. I did not create the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowyze.html" title="Shadowyze">Shadowyze</a> article and it has not even been my priority since I joined Wikipedia maybe two-weeks ago until someone ignorant of the significance of the man (particularly to Native Americans) tried to have it deleted. I’ve been more concerned with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomp_Dance_eea3.html" title="Stomp Dance">Stomp Dance</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Corn_Ceremony_459c.html" title="Green Corn Ceremony">Green Corn Ceremony</a>. Those two and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowyze.html" title="Shadowyze">Shadowyze</a> are subjects I have a heap of knowledge and resources about that were just crying for attention when I showed up. Clearly I did not come here to advertise for Shadowyze but somebody who cared enough about the subject needed to pay some attention to it.</p>
<p>If you read the article, it may be poorly formatted, but it’s fairly straight forward and talks mostly about facts and dates. As I've said before I found the stub, with nearly no information in it save for an incomplete discography (it’s still incomplete, but I’ve been sitting on adding too much that I don’t have immediate access to the reference material even though I KNOW the facts—that’s actually pretty neutral wouldn’t you agree?). It was originally written as part of a college journalism project and I attend to rewrite it as the time and source material presents itself.</p>
<p>Since there seems to be no one else knowledgeable enough or interested enough, with access to as many resources as I, restricting me from editing this article will only result in another limp and stagnant article which only harms it and does nothing to better Wikipedia. I can provide facts and resources that other people won’t have access to or inclination to research themselves. If there is someone on Wikipedia more qualified or even AS qualified to write about the subject please send them this way. I certainly would appreciate the help. And if anybody wants to check my resources and lives in Pensacola, Florida I'll gladly show them to you. I can even introduce you to the man and then other people can say that YOU should be restricted from editing the article. In the meantime if you or anyone else who is willing to take the time to assist in this article and is not just trying to cause me grief, I will welcome the advice and edits. <a href="../../../l/o/j/User%7ELojah_c242.html" title="User:Lojah">Lojah</a> 21:33, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Very weird articles created by User:Columbia Pictures (all of them today) - no notability presented or proven, external links given are false, and I advise everyone to read the articles and see if they can make a sense of it. It seems like some April Fool's Day joke of some sorts and there are bizarre sentences - apparently it is about a person named "Columbia Pictures", not the corporation. I have also listed other articles created by this user for deletion. Watch it carefully, the articles seem notable, but the joke, imo, is subtle - check the links etc..

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">At the start of Columbia Pictures, Tristar Pegasus is portrayed as an antisocial inward-looking character who cares for no-one but himself. However, throughout the course of the movie we find out that he is a compassionate character who has just been through a lot of trauma and despair, and is in fact a very caring mammoth.</td>

<p>The article is actually a self advertisement by an entity claiming to be an investment advising business whose principal is "John Mauldin". The text is copied from the biography page at "John Mauldin's" Web site. This company has been spamming me for a month now. It spams me from multiple email addresses: noreply@iipub.com, noreply@email.investorawareness.org, newsletters@investorsinsight.com, newsletters@inverstorawareness.org, and others. My stupid email provider can't seem to block these emails even though I've marked them as spam and the company uses the same four or five addresses. I never contacted any of "John Mauldin's" Websites (self named Website and Investor's Insight Publications), I never contacted any investment advisers. The article bears category tags like "biography of American writers", "financial writers". <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 18:03, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. There is nothing in the nom's statement that, after some brief investigation, can be substantiated, with the exception of the categories. No ties to investorawareness in the article or the page (or to iipub.com). If this is an AFJ, it's not a very good one. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:40, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Investigation was brief indeed. www.investorsinsight.com redirects to www.iipub.com. In the I.I. Publications's navigation bar, John Mauldin is listed under IIP Authors. Changing the subject, you say "AFJ" and I don't know what AFJ means. I'm finding Wikipedia to be too clubby. It's hard to find my way through the Commons and the policies and procedures, and hard to find out the meaning of acronyms. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 00:17, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Super Powerful Delete</b>. Unless improvement of reference source origins is occurring, this page is unacceptable. Person may create personal website of lies and propaganda, should not be used as reliable source, perhaps if sentences preface "person claiming to be name John Maudlin alleges...." it is OK but not in this Wikipedia Project.<a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWen_Hsing_5809.html" title="User:Wen Hsing">Wen Hsing</a> 06:08, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> based on the fact that there appears to be a dearth of sources out there on the man (although I'm willing to be proven wrong here). The reasons given by the nominator are almost entirely invalid (aside from the advertising claims), since removing an article from Wikipedia will not stop spammers from spamming. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:36, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and improve</b>. The reasons given by the nominator are invalid. But one should provide references to the books by John Mauldin.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:31, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Super Powerful Delete</b>. As the nominator, I must say I am surprised that I haven't found a statement in the Wikipedia rules that commercial promotions are forbidden or at least discouraged. I see now that I should have invoked "not notable". Nevertheless, nobody is going to flatly say that commercial promotion or self promotion *are* OK for Wikipedia articles, am I right? <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 23:58, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>As nominator, you're automatically assumed to be advocating deletion, so there's no need to preface your remarks with "Delete". In terms of commercial promotions et al, if it's unequivocally an ad then it's actually a Speedy Deletion criterion. In this particular case, however, it's not unequivocally an ad - although it's certainly more laudatory of the subject than the available references would suggest. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:03, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> in its present form, and unless an objective and unbiased source can be found to verify notability outside the investment community (and, possibly, the World Club of Spammers and 419-ers), continue deleting it for as long as it keeps being reposted. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a></li>
