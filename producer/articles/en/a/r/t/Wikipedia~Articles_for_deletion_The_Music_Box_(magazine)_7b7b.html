<p>Speedy tag and PROD tag were removed, but I still don't see evidence that this is notable enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>)</sup> 17:46, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails to assert notability. â€”<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 19:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Perhaps with a slight expansion to address whatever concerns there are. The reasoning is as follows:
<p>1) The guidelines for Resources under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a> are basically non-existent, so it is unclear as to what criteria are being utilized to judge the validity of this entry.</p>
<p>2) Even under the more general guidelines for articles/entries, it should be noted that The Music Box and its staff have been resources for and have provided content to other mainstream media outlets.</p>
<p>a) Print: Its editor and staff have been resources and contributors to at least a few mainstream publications/newspapers. Both the Florida Times-Union and the Louisville Courier-Journal, for example, are the major papers that serve their respective areas.</p>
<p>b) Radio: Its editor has made guest appearances on at least one major radio station, where he served as the co-host of a regular segment. <a href="../../../w/k/z/WKZE_cb6d.html" title="WKZE">WKZE 98.1 FM</a> is a large and well-respected commercial station in Connecticut.</p>
<p>That The Music Box has passed both the editorial and the commercial considerations of at least a few major print and radio outlets means that it has been recognized within the industry as being a notable, reputable, and authoritative media outlet in its own right.</p>
<p>Also, given that The Music Box is based in Illinois, these (Kentucky, Florida, Connecticut) are big geographic distances to traverse for a non-notable publication.</p>
<p>When combined with the <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/wkze.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/wkze.html" rel="nofollow">2-year duration of the radio segment</a>, these facts lend very strong credence to the notion that The Music Box has knowledgeable expertise that has been recognized outside the scope of its own existence, which therefore makes it a notable resource/publication.</p>
<p>In addition, I also submit the following:</p>
<p>3) The registered users who created the article in February 2006 (and have since worked on it and categorized it) clearly have felt that The Music Box was a notable resource. It is puzzling that after all this time, it now is being targeted for deletion with a simple 'nn' designation.</p>
<p>4) The Music Box has been published since 1994, and while one could argue that longevity is not necessarily indicative of notability, it also could be argued that its having a track record of 12+ years is.</p>
<p>5) The Music Box is well-written and informative, the latter being the very definition of a useful resource. Again, taken on its own, this might not refute the argument that it is not notable, but the publication's well-reasoned reviews and its attention to accurate historical detail make it worthwhile to include.</p>
<p>6) Perhaps it also is worth mentioning that in its 12+ year existence, The Music Box staff has conducted and published interviews with many well-known artists and music industry representatives, including <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html" rel="nofollow">Bruce Hornsby</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bspr-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bspr-int.html" rel="nofollow">Burning Spear</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/dm-long2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/dm-long2.html" rel="nofollow">author and historian Dennis McNally</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/po-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/po-int.html" rel="nofollow">Be Good Tanyas/Po Girl's Trish Klein</a> and <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/trainint.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/trainint.html" rel="nofollow">Train</a>. For years, The Music Box also has covered quite a few albums from major artists prior to their release. Clearly, the industry views The Music Box as a notable resource. 71.155.233.121 00:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> .121, you have the first few examples backwards. Its not whether MV contributes to other publications, it's whether other publications talk specifically about MB, and here significantly means more than just saying its the source of their articles. Have its interviews been written about elsewhere.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Music Box was quoted as a reference in an article written by Sarah Fritschner in the Louisville Courier Journal on July 29, 2006. The article was titled <i>Rogue Rocks</i>, and it was in regards to a beer named <i>Dead Guy Ale</i>. The beer's name is in reference to Jerry Garcia, and The Music Box was asked to provide comment about the Grateful Dead/Garcia. 71.155.229.125 14:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
