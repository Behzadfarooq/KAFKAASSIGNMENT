<li>Is there no possibility that there is more than one person with the same name? I have highlighted the results that correspond with this name but apart from that it is not my problem that other Mauritian born individuals share the common family name of Burkutally. I am not him, so do not ask me to come back when I am famous as that will never happen, however I am a private banker that used to work wwith him following the advice of the banking consortium to help publicise the indivudal as we believe he is worthy or more recognisable attention. He is a true character and anything you wish to flag up as a concern, feel free to. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.36.210.14 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.36.210.14.html" title="User talk:82.36.210.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.36.210.14_fbbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.36.210.14">contribs</a>) 00:18, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>Again may I emphasise this isnt to generate publicity, from what I know Adam has no real gain from Internet publicity as the majority of busienss conducted is in the real world away from the Internet, and only after his new conglomerate incorporation will he be joining the Internet "world" in terms of selective acquisitions in line, such as investopedia. So as I said, this is not publicity, this is an article to educate the people who read the wiki of Adam and also how to learn from thigns he has done. I intend on adding alognside my team, more of a biography on this article and get some of the journalists whoo have written about him to join up with links to their journals however that all takes time but it is goign to happen as Adam recently joined Panorama in the UK for an interview and is subject ot be broadcast later on this year. Panorama, as wikipedia, seek to educate, not publicise so heed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.36.210.14 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.36.210.14.html" title="User talk:82.36.210.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.36.210.14_fbbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.36.210.14">contribs</a>) 00:28, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Normal procedure is for it to be considered for five days. This allows time for people to find out about the VfD, research the topic, improve the article, and so forth. This is very beneficial to some articles and many end up being kept as a result. It's often embarrassing to the contributors of obvious vanity articles. The outcome of this VfD seems clear. If you are Adam Burkutally and you find this embarrassing, just try to stay away from the article and the VfD as much as you can. Shrug it off.</dd>
<dd>Articles of this kind are contributed all the time and get deleted all the time. Every time you create a new page it warns you "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business (see what Wikipedia is not)," but creating this kind of article is a very common newcomer's mistake. Regular Wikipedians see it all the time. We don't even mind it very much as long as the article creator doesn't make <i>too</i> much of a pest of himself.</dd>
<dd>If you're interested in contributing to Wikipedia, I suggest you create an account. It makes it easier to communicate. You get a User Page on which it is considered all right to put information about yourself and you get to create any user name you like. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:17, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Retain</b> Just to clear this up: the entry was written me, and not Simon Drage himself, to complement the various other entries listing him.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>, Simon might be active at a national level too, but so are many many hundreds of other people, most of which would not warrant an entry in Wikipedia either. And seeing the pages which link to Simon Drage and a search for 'Drage' on wikipedia, I can only find one other page which lsits him: that of York Union.

<li>Everyone agerees with this, i think. But what constitutes "notability". Is there such a thing as a real school that is not notable? <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 04:55, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, this school exists, it is a real school. It is even a fairly good school. It is also completely non-notable outside the local area. Not even everyone who lives in the school district knows of its existance. It happens that I live near this achool, and I assure you, the only notability it has is strictly local. It is also an <b>Elementary</b> school, with no students over 10 years of age. If we say that this school should pass VfD, we are in effect approving a policy that: <i>Any and every school the actual existance of which can be verified is notable enough for a Wikipedia article.</i> That isn't what our policy says now, at elast not in theory. Is that now our policy in practice? I think it shouldn't be. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 04:52, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> if they are so notable, then editors would express more interest in them and be able to at least provide noteable alumni.

<ul>
<li>It's not easy to find alumni of primary schools. Work to prevent Vfds removing articles is work to defend wikipedia users against editors who don't seem to have their interests at heart. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right on one point - the lack of alumni lists show that no-one cares. The cabal for unconditional keeps on the other hand is subversion of the vfd process through highly organised voting and intimidation of people with sense. It is therefore against wiki principles. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 17:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The principal of this wiki is that material should not be deleted without consensus.

<li><b>Delete</b> The Kahanists/Kach can be described as Jewish Supremacists (the first ones) and do deserve a wiki page imho, but the idea that Jewish Supremacy exists as an ideology forming an unbroken link since biblical times is a deeply troubling POV. This article seems to have been written by people trying to make the points that</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1.) A belief in Jewish supremacy is widely held by Jews</dd>
<dd>2.) Persecution of Jews is essentially linked to, if not caused by, aforesaid belief.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both of these are POV (not to mention offensive to Jews and completely untrue in my experience). Evidence for chip on shoulder are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>a)</i>Treating the bible as just a story when talking about God choosing Abraham, but as a historical document when talking about massacres by ancient Israelite soldiers.</dd>
<dd><i>b)</i>In the sentence "Most modern anti-semitism.." POV inexplicably ignoring anti-semitism arising both from widespread misinterpretations of the gospels (e. g. belief that modern Jews continue to bear responsibility for Jesus'death) and simple xenophobia from differences in culture and lifestyle.</dd>
<dd><i>c)</i>Suggesting Hitler's Jewish conspiracy theory has something to do with even an alleged belief by Jews that they are superior.. but trying to control the world through banking, or enslavement of other races, is not evidence that one believes oneself to be superior.</dd>
<dd><i>d)</i>"..was the consequence" deliberately ambiguous about whether the holocaust was the consequence of Hitler's/Ford's beliefs (which are not implied to be mistaken) or of actual widespread supremacist thinking among Jews (which is absurd POV).</dd>
<dd><i>e)</i>"Not until after.." the Kahanists were not around at Israel's creation and there is no evidence of Jewish supremacist movements at this time.. looks to me like an mischievous attempt to link Jewish supremacism with Zionism.</dd>
<dd><i>f)</i>"As Israel grew militarily strong .. " POV controversial and partial statement.</dd>
<dd><i>g)</i>" .. many Jews believed that .." absurd POV, more like a few nutcases.</dd>
<dd><i>h)</i> Jonathan Sacks (chief rabbi of UK I think) quote: deliberate misinterpretation. "jewish future" means future of Jews not a future world in which everyone is Jewish and this is completely obvious. (Warning-- newbie here!

<li><b>Comment</b> Relatively minor in its immediate effects, but a sign of worse to come. The cause was mechanical failure probably due to the actions of a loading personnel. The incident is cited as a prior cargo door incident in the <a href="../../../n/t/s/NTSB_298c.html" title="NTSB">NTSB</a>'s investigation into <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_Flight_811_916f.html" title="United Airlines Flight 811">United Airlines Flight 811</a>. In that accident, nine passengers were ejected from the plane by an explosive decompression, and lost their lives, and a further thirty passengers were injured. Boeing was criticised by NTSB for not taking Flight 125 as a warning and withdrawing its 747s from service. In 1990, Boeing finally replaced the cargo door assembly in all in-service 747s.</li>
<li>Remind me again, why are we considering deleting this article about a notable event in aviation history? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:20, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because the incident isn't notable? If it's noteworthy in relation to Flight 811, then there should be a brief mention of it in that article. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:09, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What if you link the Pan Am article to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_Flight_811_916f.html" title="United Airlines Flight 811">United Airlines Flight 811</a> to show the correlation? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltmomma_9b1d.html" title="User:Maltmomma">maltmomma</a> 00:35, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are many, many emulated UO shards (which are fan-run servers for Ultima Online, a massively-multiplayer online RPG).

<p>This HKIX article is a typo by it's name (which should refer to Hong Kong Internet eXchange, which is my fault on the typo), however, about the emulated UO shard problem. I am trying to write an article regarding the histroy of the non-profit MMORPG developement in Hong Kong, while linking it with the server names. (In which the shards are already <b>not in service</b> anymore regarding on adspam issues) I guess this kind of historical info about a virtual community growth worth its existence. --<a href="../../../z/e/k/User%7EZektonic_48c5.html" title="User:Zektonic"><font color="#0000FF">Z</font><font color="#2200DD">e</font><font color="#4400BB">k</font><font color="#660099">t</font><font color="#880077">o</font><font color="#AA0055">n</font><font color="#CC0033">i</font><font color="#EE0011">c</font></a> 07:16, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm confused. First you write an article about a UO server, then you say that it was a typo and change the article to something having nothing to do with UO servers, then you say you want to write about MMORPG servers? <b>Weak Delete</b>. If you refactor the article into something presentable, I'll change my vote. If you make up your mind on what you want to write about, you can always start over later. In the meantime, I have made a few edits to the article to wikify it.</li>
<li>I am really sorry about the fault, I'll try to explain it a little bit, I was trying to write another article at Emulated_Ultima_Online_Server_in_Hong_Kong, however I had made an error on typing one of the server name (which is ixuo rather than HKIX). thereafter I found out my error, and also found out that HKIX is another thing which I got mix up (since both two words I heard a lot), to mend my error I introduce the correct information on HKIX. (I am not trying to fool anyone on voting, sorry for confusion) Also, I wonder that should I use redirect to that article instead.

<li><b>Followup Comment</b>: I just did a major rewrite of the article that will hopefully clear up the confusion. I am not disputing any of the Russian sources. From what I gather, this is a hypothetical rank that could be bestowed if Russia ever had to appoint a 5 star naval position to be the equivalent to officers in other countries. Its not disputed there is currently no rank as this in the Russian military. Only that there could be. As there appears to be an established insignia, obtained from who knows where (it was on the Army's PDF file thats all I know), I dont think it can be called original research. Also, for the record, the knowledge of DmitryKo on this subject is very impressive. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 14:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In all honesty, I see little sense in describing ranks that "could exist", as well as its hypothetical insignia that just mimics <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_of_the_Soviet_Union_59fd.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union">Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union</a> layout.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Its never even been proposed or appointed by anyone" is the statement I challenge. How can you say that for 100 percent certianty? Why would this rank be in a U.S. Army publication? What are the procedures in Russia's military for appointment to a five star naval rank, when and if this became neccesary. I would agree that factual accuracy can be disputed here, but there is too much for this to simple be deleted. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 00:50, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>1. <i>Its never even been proposed or appointed by anyone"... how can you say that&#160;?</i> — I tried to search the Internet, along with governmental sites and major Russian newspapers, for "Адмирал Флота Российской Федерации" to see if there was a promotion to this rank or maybe a public discussion for it, and found nothing. Not even a single bit.</dd>
<dd>2. <i>Why would this rank be in a U.S. Army publication?</i> — I believe they imoly made a wild guess that since current Russian military ranks are largely based on Soviet system, a rank similar to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_of_the_Fleet_of_the_Soviet_Union_59fd.html" title="Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union">Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union</a> should exist.

<li>You seem very very quick to dismiss the U.S. Army source. Simply stating that they were wrong and calling that the end of it isnt good enough for me.

Saying that a major office of the U.S. Army, such as the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Heraldry_49ff.html" title="Institute of Heraldry">Institute of Heraldry</a>, made a "wild guess" is rather far fetched.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am going on a two week exercise on Friday so will simply say that I think this article warrants existence. There has been one champion for its deletion, citing Russian sources and Russian documents. If we want to put a "factual accuracy" tag on the article, thats fine, but there are sources both in hardcopy and on the internet for this ranks existence. I actually feel this was VFDed way too quickly, without any discussion, and I sense a strong feeling here of article ownership, from the VFD nominator, when it comes to Russian miltiary rank articles. Let's compromise, calm this down, and do some more research instead of calling for a VFD. See everyone in 2 weeks -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 00:50, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The US Army source makes this notable enough to warrant an entry, <i>even if they're wrong</i>. The controversy can be explained in the article. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:02, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem here is that the nominator of the VFD refuses to accept any information from a U.S. source, which may or may not be wrong. I still feel this rank originated through some regulation in the Russian military which calls for the appointment of a five star naval rank, to match appointments in similar militaries, when and if a war or emergency calles for it. As a compromise, I've been changing all entries to <i>clearly</i> reflect that the existence of this rank is mentioned only in United States sources and tends to contradict Russian regulations. However, the VFD nominator was not happy with that either, blatantly putting in an edit summary to "F- U.S. sources" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet_Admiral_%28Russia%29&amp;diff=20253362&amp;oldid=20228893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleet_Admiral_%28Russia%29&amp;diff=20253362&amp;oldid=20228893" rel="nofollow">1</a>. I probably wouldnt be happy if someone made an article on Supreme Grand General of the United States, since I would feel such a rank doesn't exist, but if they provided sources from other countries I would at least entertain that other nations believe there is such a rank. In any event, I leave tomorrow for my military duty. Who knows what I will find when I return! -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 14:44, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can say it again - ignore U.S. sources if they're telling unconfirmed nonsense. As for the <b>entertainment</b> value of this error, even if the decision will be to keep the article, exclusively for this single reason, I see no point in mentioning it in every article that discusses Russian naval ranks system.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is an invalid argument. Can you explain to my cousin why her still-born baby isn't mentioned in the encyclopedia?

<li>Was your cousin's baby or parent's neighbour's daughter on the front page of The Daily Mirror or The Independent? Did they replace suicide bombers as the nation's main headline? No. Mr Walker (RIP) is highly notable and the way this page is going with reasons why he should be deleted / excluded days after he died is in extremely poor taste. 62.254.64.14 12:14, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - for now.

<li><b>Keep</b>, one of the main reasons put forward for deletion is that Wikipedia cannot be a roll call of all victims of so-called 'hate' crime. Why not? If someone is murdered because he is black, Asian, white or gay, there is every reason why this crime of ignorance should be noted in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Major General seems to have an "outstanding" profile, perhaps even more than average of a typical military officer. I'm sure he has made a significant contribution in the U.S.'s military history and perhaps future; due to the fact of the many impressive military activities, events, and commands he has participated in.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Major Generals are far more notable than many of the minor actors and actresses (particularly in adult entertainment) who are featured in Wikipedia. If command over thousands of men and tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment in the most powerful military in the world doesn't make an individual notable, then I don't know what does. In my opinion, all General officers (Brig. Generals, Rear Admirals, on up) are notable. True, there are hundreds of officers who fall into this category, but there are thousands of other individuals on Wikipedia who would never be found in Britannica (professional athletes, porn actors, etc, aside from major stars). --Honorius</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, voting on the guy, not the rank. I don't think people are notable based on rank, but based on achievement. Generals are more likely to be notable because they have the power to do very notable things, like Patton, Longstreet, Ike, and many others. They all did something, This guy rose in the ranks, put together a nice resume, but did nothing, as far as I can tell, to impact the world. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:54, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's almost exactly my point. Have you seen this general on CNN? No. This gentleman is not Norman Schwartzkopf, who is the equivalent of Sammy Sosa in your reckoning.

<li>My point is not that he's wildly notable. It's there are vigoursly defended policies on creating and keeping articles for those very 3rd string athletes I mentioned.

<li>But what has he done with his command? As far as I can tell from the article he's never sent his men into battle, and anything short of that is going to be pretty minor.

There does seem to be a Foo Say Mui, but his only mention is of a shareholder of INTEGRA2000 LTD, which a Bill Foo is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and is Independent Director. The article claims that Bill Foo started PT ANZ Pennin bank in Indonesia but the web site states that that bank was operating well before that and was working in Indonesia starting in 1973. There is also no results from a search for Foo technologies Engenieering Corp (FTEC) or Foo resorts and casinos.

FTEC building a submarine that "cultivates crops [to] provide air for the crew seems a little fishy. I'm certainly willing to be proved wrong, but I can't find anything that confirms this entry. There's a group of articles about his companies that I'll have to add also.</p>

<p>(1) title misspelled (2) page "Hostel" already exists and has a great deal more content (3) article's creator included a link to a commercial site, which I presume was the actual intent behind the creation of the page <a href="../../../k/y/m/User%7EKymacpherson_d20d.html" title="User:Kymacpherson">Kymacpherson</a> 16:36, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Simply put, i gave the london bombing its own project after having been extreamly frustrated att the pure sencorship on the subject. Basic mainstream facts was deleted from the page, on the basis of it being "irrelevant", even though it hade been covered by several non-wiki articles and the removal of the mainstream facts was fiercly opposed by several editors, but the majority deleted it as "irrelevant". I strongly feelt that it needed a project where people dedicated to the conspiracy could find strenght and arguments in number, to evade being dissmised as "irrelevant". The The World Conspiracy Guild tries to paint with a broader brush trying to show the historical conspiracies to give credebility to the ongoing conspiracys. The project would be flooded if every conspiracy would have been dealt with there. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:34, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

While I'm loath to agree with the <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock puppets</a>, I don't see the rationale behind the nomination.

<ul>
<li>My rationale is that to be an <i>encyclopedia</i> article, it should be about the history and cultural significance of banoffee pie, not just a half-hearted recipe for it. WP is not a cookbook, and I find that restaurant's claim to have invented thing a little hard to take and in any case unverifiable.

<ul>
<li>Well that seems fair; if the pub did invent the thing then it's news to me. But it's still a well-known dessert and the claim can be rephrased or simply edited out if it's proven to be false.

The (older) "right wing" theory of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Civil_War_3f5f.html" title="European Civil War">European Civil War</a> was described by <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Nolte_94db.html" title="Ernst Nolte">Ernst Nolte</a>. I thaught the (Dutch inspired) "Eighty Years"-description could be the more neutral version. I think all this is not so much a question of very <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, but of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">neologism</a> indeed. If it is not allowed to create a "neutral neologism", I agree that the article should have another name. Anyway, in my view, Wikipedia can contribute to end the intolerance between "European left" and "European right", even make Europeans aware that their war ís (already) over (for ten, maybe fifteen years) and that their points of view can coexist, as well as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">catholicism</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">protestantism</a> coexisted in the Dutch <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Provinces_3b27.html" title="United Provinces">United Provinces</a> after their <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighty_Years%27_War_1f74.html" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarel_Anthonissen_c666.html" title="User:Karel Anthonissen">Karel Anthonissen</a> 15:04, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is a move of <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000000000000000000.html" title="1000000000000000000">1000000000000000000</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is ridiculous. IMHO, the previous VfD had a consensus to delete, and this should probably be taken up with the closing editor, or the on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:55, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Further to the above, my feeling was that the debate moved to bring out the policy that any article named by an integer was a year article, and it should, if not worthy of an article of it's own, redirect to the appropriate date type entity. Any article or redirect about the number should be in the XXXXXX (number) namespace. Possibly I over read the sense of development of a position, compared with the numbers of votes. If so I apologise.</li>
<li>My own thoughts differ from the result I interpreted anyway, I think this should also be a redirect, for the following reasons.
<ul>
<li>Redirects are cheap.</li>
<li>This is consistant with what has happened elsewhere.</li>
<li>There is little information for the number itself, and it is all in <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orders_of_magnitude_%28numbers%29.html" title="Orders of magnitude (numbers)">Orders of magnitude (numbers)</a>.</li>
<li>If these articles are totally deleted they will be perpetually recreated and deleted. It's more sense to have a redirect than a protected deleted page. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a> 00:47, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> You closed the previous discusion saying it should be made into a redirect. Why didn't you made it? <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 00:55, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I did. It redirects to the article concerned with far-future dates <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_millennium_and_beyond.html" title="11th millennium and beyond">11th millennium and beyond</a>. I also added a note at the top of that article to simpify matters for users who wondered "what is the correct name for 1000000000000000000" and entered the digits into wikipedia. This is still not a good solution, but probably less bad than what was there before. Elsewhere I will be (re)raising the policy question of having large integers interpreted as dates. For now, it's probably good to work with the policy. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a> 01:38, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see... so its just a matter of interpretation. From the previous discussion I concluded that <i>1...0</i> should be moved to <i>1...0 (number)</i> and this made into a redirect also. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 13:54, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Because when he moved the article, it created a redirect, as occurs automatically? The article <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000000000000000000.html" title="1000000000000000000">1000000000000000000</a> is a redirect page. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 01:03, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I see. Since we are where we are, we may as well continue from here (since we're debating the same article again, in effect). Still, whilst there was the consensus you describe among the <i>redirect</i> votes, the consensus of the process was still to delete, imo. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There were 12 votes to delete on the previous VFD, and five to redirect. Of the five to redirect, one was to redirect to Trillion, three to names of large numbers, and one was a redirect vote with no specification as to where. Seeing as a redirect is essentially a delete anyway - as nobody is voting to merge and maintain information - that's a unanymous delete vote. Far from a move vote. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 23:02, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<li>I didn't <i>personally disagree</i>. I saw an old VfD that had't been closed, and dealt with it, in the same way it seems you had previously. Maybe I got it wrong, as I have said above. As I also said above, the actions I took were not those I would have chosen without the VfD. These two articles/redirects are verging on the trivial - wikipedia is not consistant, and the VfD process doesn't stand or fall by one article alone. See <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> Moreover I encouraged Oleg to list this for VfD, and, had he not been so efficient (:-), I would have suggested changing the article into a redirect along the lines of established practice for 1000... .000 (number). <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a> 01:58, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete: I hate to be Sargeant Rock all the time, but I view this as an article that was deleted (by vote), whether anyone executed the VfD decision or not. Therefore, this would be a speedy delete as moving of previously VfD'd material. At any rate, we're not here to argue about the people who close votes -- that is a wp:an matter and <b>not</b> a VfD matter. Since any ambiguity at all will be misread, let me say <b>Delete.</b> (I think I had voted to redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orders_of_magnitude.html" title="Orders of magnitude">Orders of magnitude</a>. Note that 1,000 redirect votes is not a single "move" vote. Also note that a move does not merge (which is really the least anyone could conclude -- that the voters felt that the article was a multiplication of a single article into multiple locations).) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:05, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Primary source material belongs in Wikisource. This article is in the process of being transwiki'd. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 23:59, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is my first attempt to transwiki something, and I'm not at all sure I've gotten it right. The original article has been moved to a Transwiki: article on <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transwiki:Do_no_take_a_bath_in_Jordan%2C_Gordon%21" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Transwiki:Do_no_take_a_bath_in_Jordan,_Gordon!">Wikisource</a> but the many links in that article are now broken. I have not (yet) attempted to make them point back over to Wikipedia. I have placed entries in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html#Moved_to_en.wikisource.org" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">local transwiki log</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transwiki_log" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Transwiki_log">Wikisource transwiki log</a>. Any assistance or comments will be greatly appreciated, either here, or on my <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidConrad_b653.html" title="User talk:DavidConrad">talk page</a>. After the move is complete, the local article should either be deleted or redirected to Wikisource. Unless it is felt that the original article should remain on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 00:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Transwiki and delete</b>. Though transwiki it to its proper name: "Scottish Rhapsody", if I recall. A nice piece. Oh, and clean up the cute formatting when tranwiking. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:58, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> but <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Sitwell_5591.html" title="Edith Sitwell">Edith Sitwell</a> only died in 1964 - doesn't this mean it is still under copyright? -- <a href="../../../2/1/3/User%7E213.123.195.207.html" title="User:213.123.195.207">213.123.195.207</a> 05:09, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't considering that. Well, Walton's <i>Facade</i> was written in 1922, according to the article, so the poem must be older than that. I forget how copyright works, is it by the year of publication or the death of the author? And would even 83 years be long enough? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:34, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
