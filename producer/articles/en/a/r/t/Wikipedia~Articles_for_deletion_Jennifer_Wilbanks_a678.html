<li><b>Delete</b>. I am so sick hearing about that woman. With all the press coverage, the media treats her like she discovered radioactivity. She's already ruined most of my news magazine shows with the recent advent of 'jilted at the alter' stories. The news keeps wondering what kind of punishment she will receive for lying to the police and irritating so many people. <b>Delete</b> this stupid article. She's plain annoying and dumb and is definitely NOT ENCYCLOPEDIC. If anyone had any sense in their head, they would <b>Delete</b> this news trash before she starts polluting Wikipedia.

<li>A reason for deletion should NOT be that you are sick of it. Also, the fact that it is all over your favorite news magazine shows justifies that this article should be kept. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 04:03, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This is such a non-story. Wikipedia <i><b>should not</b></i> have an article on everything that the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream_media.html" title="Mainstream media">reality soap</a> channels broadcast.

<ul>
<li>She faked something and got national media attention. So did <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Ayala_4df5.html" title="Anna Ayala">Anna Ayala</a>, and we have an article for her. Wikipedia has all sorts of articles about hoaxes, missing people, and victims. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 04:46, 11 May 2005 (UTC) P.S. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Toft_e284.html" title="Mary Toft">Mary Toft</a> lied and said she gave birth to rabbits.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is significant because there was a nation-wide search that involved the FBI. It is also significant because she reported that her kidnapper was hispanic. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 04:03, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I absolutely hate this story which is why I stir clear from the U.S. 24 hours cable news channels because they always talked about her...24/7 in the recent weeks. It is in the U.S. news headlines so it is keep. We have an <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Fisher_1a66.html" title="Amy Fisher">Amy Fisher</a> article and her story is similar to Jennifer Wilbanks because of the "soap opera" type news story. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_Pill_Bill_4117.html" title="User:Chill Pill Bill">Chill Pill Bill</a> 04:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Boy. I hate having an article on this subject, but if somebody could work on the story as sensation, and not just on her non-notable biography, then I vote <b>weak keep</b>. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:40, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The issue isn't whether she merits the attention she's gotten (I agree she doesn't). For an objective encyclopedia, the issue is that she has in fact gotten the attention, and hence become notable. In addition to her own notability, the article will give the reader a good example of the nauseating superficiality of the mass media in the U.S. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 06:26, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, media attention makes this notable, so long as it is kept NPOV (none of the recent "wilbanked" slang terms which we VfD recently please). <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 06:29, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't understand why people are voting to keep this article. National attention is given to non-consequential things all the time which are not article worthy. She is not an important enough figure to warrant having an encyclopedia article. If the article is to be kept it should be to highlight the ridiculous "issues" that the media in the U.S concerns itself with so that people will forget more important problems, like the economy and the war in Iraq. <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.193.227.161_a6e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.193.227.161">24.193.227.161</a></small></li>

Hundreds of civilians are killed in the Middle East and Central Asia along with kidnappings of various people &amp; etc and this nonsense story with no merit or value is what most American households are worried about. This soul-sucking culture-eating demon of anti-thought should be eradicated before it threatens to infect us all with an inane sense of seeking the milquetoast epitome of vicarious passionately confused maleficence and socially destructive fantasies of banality and violence born of boredom and neglect. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 23:30, 14 May 2005 (UTC) Naturally, I understand how the argument goes that <i>because</i> she received such massive media attention she should receive an article, and, though I do hold many reservations about that line of reasoning in this particular instance, I would tend to agree with the idea. However, the length of the current article seems far too long to be justifiable given the importance of the subject-matter. I feel that I must revise my previously expressed sentiments on the matter and suggest that, even though I personally despise pretty much everything surrounding this whole issue, it should have its own article so long as it is short. I don't see why a picture is necessary in the article. In any event, my personal sentiments are still that it should be deleted entirely, but, in the interests of the necessarily-principled foundations of Wikipedia, I will not contend with those who would seek to include it on the basis of a certain notoriety. Again, I would like to express how I feel that the relevancy and importance of the subject-matter is not nearly great enough to justify the current length and depth of the article. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 00:17, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As a television free Canadian I don't get the relevance of this story and the article itself does nothing to clarify it. A woman ran away, she's got some issues. Hmm, sure glad I know that. As a few people mentioned this might have some value as part of a media circus article or somesuch but I hardly think it's weighty enough to merit a seperate heading of it's own. There's just nothing novel, interesting or memorable about this story. Does anyone seriously think that in 6 months (let alone 10 years) kids will be digging through Wikipedia for information on Jennifer Wilbanks for history reports? This is typical short term media frenzy crap. Of course maybe somebody can rewrite the article to illustrate the relevance and I'll change my mind. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabriel_40ce.html" title="User:Gabriel">Gabe</a> 07:22, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
