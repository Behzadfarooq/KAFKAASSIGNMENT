<dd>I guess the question isn't so much as to whether the concept exists — whether as an urban legend or not: it's clear that plenty of people mention it; e.g. in the newspaper editorial you mention. The issue would appear to be whether enough information about it has been published by reputable sources to be able to write an encyclopedia article about it. My suspicion is that there is not, but it's difficult to prove a negative. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Badgerpatrol or redirect and smerge (not sure to where) or transwiki to Wiktionary. I'm not sure how much of an Encyclopedia entry this could ever be. I'm curious as to where <i>Cassell's Dictionary</i> got its info, but I suppose it is an acceptable source. I think the unsourced stuff in the article (e.g. the players do not necessarily self-identify as homosexual) has got to go. I found another source of debatable reliability: ""Other popular variations of such games include ejaculating onto food (favorites are soggy biscuits, white bread, chocolate pudding, etc.). The last person to come has to eat it." Garbage, Greta (1999). <i>That's Disgusting&#160;: An Adult Guide to What's Gross, Tasteless, Rude, Crude, and Lewd,</i> page 71 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1580080944</a> The game also appears in <i>Goats: A Novel</i> by Mark Jude Poirier, page 106 and in the story "Soggy Biscuit" by Barry Lowe in <i>Flesh and the Word: An Anthology of Erotic Writing</i> by John Preston. It's also described in Devenish, Colin (2000). <i>Limp Bizkit,</i> page 26 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 031226349X</a>. Most of the other references to SBs in books (Amazon search) seem to be to biscuits that have become soggy from more conventional liquids, though some of them allow for probably inadvertant humor by double entendre. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 14:48, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>General comment</b> I think there is some misunderstanding here. Some voters appear to be objecting on the grounds that the entry is a neologism or 'pure' original research (ie that the original contributor, or a small group containing the contributor and a few friends, made up this term on the spot). Neither is true. 'Soggy biscuit' IS not a neologism. It is a widely-known and recognised name and concept, at least in the UK (as can be confirmed by even a cursory Google search, which returns multiple (thousands) independent hits). One may not have heard of a term, but that does not make it untrue. The question is not 'is this a real thing' but rather 'it IS a real concept, but should it be included in the encyclopaedia'? (ie, can it be verified?). The content is definitely true, but 'actual' truth is not 'objective' truth (ie verifiability). I have provided one ref above, and FGJ has suggested another; there is also the Blackadder sketch. There are numerous pages regarding individual urban legends and modern folklore on Wikipedia. The material should probably be kept in its current form; I feel there is too much for wiktionary, but a move would perhaps be one option as a compromise. As far as I can see, this term now fully satisifes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 19:56, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>... references provided are not sufficient. This concept exists; in the days of yore where I came up it was called "Circle Jerk" and the supposed target was a Saltine cracker. The problem is sourcing. We have one referenced article that mentions "soggy biscuit" with the 'wink-wink-nod-nod' that the reader already knows what it is. There is a a mention in a book, and a passing mention on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Adder_e6e1.html" title="Black Adder">Black Adder</a>. Unless someone can produce a source that verifiably describes the act of <a href="../../../s/o/g/Soggy_biscuit.html" title="Soggy biscuit">soggy biscuit</a> in reference to that name, and the other purported terms used for it, it simply does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s big old bold text: <b>Verifiability, not truth</b>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:25, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

I can confirm as a UK citizen that this game does exist, at least by word-of-mouth. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.130.143.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.130.143.187_1c83.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.130.143.187">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - If "felching" stays in, so should "the soggy biscuit". This is the sort of pop culture referance I utilize the wikipedia for. Settling arguments and such.

<li><b>Comment on Verification</b> OK, in a nostalgic reminder of my mis-spent youth, I spent part of today in the library looking up naughty words in the dictionary. The first (and I must confess, only- breaktime is special time!) dictionary I went to ('The Cassell Dictionary of Slang, Jonathon Green, 1998, page 1110) had this to say re 'Soggy Biscuit':</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Soggy Biscuit, n. 1960's, origin. Aus.: 'A masturbation game, popular among schoolboys, whereby the participants masturbate and then ejeculate upon a biscuit; the last to reach orgasm must eat the semen-covered bicuit'</dd>
</dl>

<dd>That is surely as exact a definition as <s>surely</s> wikipedia needs? As objective evidence, we now have: the Guardian article, which tells us that a) soggy biscuit is an embarassing activity; b) that it is sufficiently notable as to be suitable for inclusion in a major national newspaper without further explanation, the nod and wink conceit being that the reader will already know what it is and will not require further explanation. We have the BlackAdder reference. We also have FGJ's assertion that the game is mentioned in detail in The Liar. Finally, we have the precise definition in a reference work intended for a mass audience. This, as multiple correspondants above have asserted (not just the slightly unreliable anon. IPs), is a widely notable urban legend. I have no doubt, given the widespread notability of this game in British and Anglophone culture, that many other references are available and can be added to the article in the future. I did not have to look hard in order to find the definition above. I really do feel that we now have enough corroboratory evidence to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. There is no reason why this article should be held to higher standards of notability and verifiability (which surely have now been satisfied?) than any other on Wikipedia. It is a real concept, not a neologism, sufficiently notable for most readers of a national newspaper to be assumed to have heard of it, and can be verified with an exact definition. It is encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 19:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> or at worst merge - is there a page Stupid games people play, with apologies to <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Berne_24b2.html" title="Eric Berne">Eric Berne</a>, who would classify this one a type 3 game I think. It may be genuine - it has been mentioned in a newspaper, although the journalist didn't say what it was, so assuming that he meant the same thing as someone else is ... and assumption ... but it lacks the minimal element of <b>importance</b> sometimes called notability that distinguishes all-inclusiveness from encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 00:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>- No problem! I have now completely rewritten the article and included verification. It is never going to be <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_and_Peace_aca2.html" title="War and Peace">War and Peace</a>, but with a modicum of effort it could expand from the sizeable stub that it now is to a minor article. Note that I have included some no-wiki comments in the body of the text that are only visible when editing or in the history (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soggy_biscuit&amp;diff=47406371&amp;oldid=47394421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soggy_biscuit&amp;diff=47406371&amp;oldid=47394421" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>).
