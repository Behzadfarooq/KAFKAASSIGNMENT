<li><b>Comment</b>. I held off on this one, but while this isn't an ideal article due to it being source-less and stubby. What I would like is an article on the Intecsas industry, and it seems like it has made a lot of fonts. That being said, it doesn't look like a company that is that well-known. I'm torn on the delete/keep thing. (Only 589 results for aarcover and under 1000 for Intecsas make me want to say delete, but I'm a keepist so it's hard for me to say it for some reason on this one). --<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 01:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nikolay Kolpakov, can you please prove that it is an "original research"? Why do you call it "original research", if it explicitly cites so many sources?&#160;:) And more than that, I can easily prove that you regularly voted in Russian Wikipedia for deletion of just ANY LGBT-related article, calling any of it "original research", irrelevantly how many sources were there, about what was the article, etc. So I'm not surprised with your activity in deletion of this article there&#160;:) You also tried to remove LGBT flag from many articles, too. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERombik_0c7b.html" title="User:Rombik">rombik</a> 12:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. References are just irrelevant. Term <i>homophobic propaganda</i> is only mentioned in first one. Some are about homosexual discrimination in nazist Germany, some about anti-discrimination (homosexual and common), but not about propaganda. — <a href="../../../v/o/v/User%7EVovanium_50fa.html" title="User:Vovanium">Vovanium</a> 21:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They ARE relevant. And the discrimination in Nazi Germany didn't came alone and suddenly, it was the result and culmination of organised Nazi anti-homosexual propaganda. And the anti-discrimination laws are also relevant there as they explicitly prohibit hate speechs, defamations and alike, which constitute anti-gay propaganda. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERombik_0c7b.html" title="User:Rombik">rombik</a> 21:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, they are relevant only to discrimination. Moreover, article is just reword anoter articles, like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_homosexual_people_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Holocaust_7131.html" title="History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust">History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust</a>, so I have no idea, why sould exist another article. And... why article is not named <b>Heterosexual propaganda?</b> - <a href="../../../v/o/v/User%7EVovanium_50fa.html" title="User:Vovanium">Vovanium</a> 21:25, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, they are relevant not only to discrimination, as the discrimination itself results and arises from prejudice and stereotypes, which are widely distributed and supported by this same propaganda. And there IS material about 1) propaganda; 2) its relation to institutionalised homophobia; 3) the connection between discrimination, homophobia and propaganda. And this article ISN'T "just reword of another articles", it's spectrum is MUCH broader than, say, just <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_homosexual_people_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Holocaust_7131.html" title="History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust">History of homosexual people in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust</a>, so there is no need and no reason to merge these articles. And as to "heterosexual propaganda" - are you joking?&#160;:) It is NOT "heterosexual propaganda". At the very minimum, it is heterosexist (heterosexual supremacist, heterosexual chauvinist) propaganda. At the maximally radical end of this spectrum, it is homophobic hate speech. The article is NOT about "propaganda of heterosexual love" or what do you mean under the label of so-called "heterosexual propaganda". Nevertheless, heterosexual propaganda probably exists (not more not less than "homosexual propaganda", which is an usual accusation towards LGBT activists), but it is a distinct phenomenon from heterosexist propaganda. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERombik_0c7b.html" title="User:Rombik">rombik</a> 08:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Propaganda of illness (which is any phobia) is nonsence. — <a href="../../../v/o/v/User%7EVovanium_50fa.html" title="User:Vovanium">User:Vovanium</a>
<dl>
<dd>1. The term <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> is NOT related to phobias, and you should read first what it does mean. Homophobia is NOT an "illness", and this term means negative, intolerant attitude towards homosexuality. And anyway, your argument is void now, because the article is renamed to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antihomosexual_propaganda.html" title="Antihomosexual propaganda">antihomosexual propaganda</a>. And also, the term "homophobic propaganda" really exists (and antihomosexual propaganda, anti-gay propaganda too) - just look in Google. More than that, the term "homophobic propaganda" was used in scientific works, for example, in the work of historician Stefan Micheler. And also, there are people who at the same time consider that "homosexuality is an illness" and consider that "homosexual propaganda" exists&#160;:) So how is it compatible with your words?&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERombik_0c7b.html" title="User:Rombik">rombik</a> 12:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In any case there's no noticeable difference with any other propaganda or specifics (just like we will not write articles, named red cars, blue cars etc.) Article consist mainly of common words, which aplly to any propaganda though, like this template: <i>«* propaganda — organised social and political activity (public speech, public behavior, meetings and actions), based on negative and intolerant attitude towards *** ...»</i>. Some specific facts is not enough to article, so I now vote to <b>join</b> material with <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. — <a href="../../../v/o/v/User%7EVovanium_50fa.html" title="User:Vovanium">Vovanium</a> 20:20, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, there is a LOT of material, which just waits to come into the English article. Your own language is Russian, so you can easily check how much material is there in <a href="../../../../ru/%D0%BF/%D1%80/%D0%BE/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B8.html" class="extiw" title="ru:Пропаганда_гомофобии">ru:Пропаганда гомофобии</a>. So there's no reason to "join" any material with any of these aforementioned articles. Article does not "consist mainly of common words", it cites many sources and will cite more. And there are not just "some specific facts", there are a lot of facts, really. And there IS a difference and specifics. Religious propaganda or Communist propaganda, for example, CAN be different articles, while blue car and red car - not. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERombik_0c7b.html" title="User:Rombik">rombik</a> 20:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is a POV Fork and stems from POV Pushing. <u>Even the very term "homophobic" and "anti-homosexual" is utterly POV</u>. I think homosexuality is grossly deviant behavior that is bad for those who do the action and societies, and I do not want openly homosexual people around my kids. And I openly say all this to homosexuals. Is my view POV? Of course, just like this article. Yet now we have an article that says that when I tell people this it is "propaganda" and I am being "homophobic" or "anti-homosexual". Pure nonsense! I am being intelligent. The very premise of this article <i>is</i> POV and <u>is not a truly encyclopedic article</u>. It needs to be merged into articles without POV premises and titles, such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propoganda.html" title="Propoganda">propoganda</a> and/or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Societal_attitudes_towards_homosexuality.html" title="Societal attitudes towards homosexuality">Societal attitudes towards homosexuality</a>. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, because right in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a>'s Intro it clearly sates, <i>"The word homophobic, when when used to describe someone prejudiced against homosexual people, can be a <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> term, and the identification of a group or person as homophobic is nearly always controversial."</i> This asserts right from the get-go that the term <i>is</i> POV. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:36, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Now this article is in the process of translation and adaptation for English wiki with help of user Rombik and others.

<p>non-notable golf game. no reference to prove this game is notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Uber_Ninja_c2ab.html" title="User:The Uber Ninja">The Uber Ninja</a> 14:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Uber_Ninja_c2ab.html" title="User:The Uber Ninja">The Uber Ninja</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Uber_Ninja_1d85.html" title="User talk:The Uber Ninja">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Uber_Ninja_b8dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Uber Ninja">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> At the very least, PangYa is the basis for the Nintendo Wii game, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Swing_Golf_e381.html" title="Super Swing Golf">Super Swing Golf</a>. Super Swing Golf is notable, and PangYa would be considered notable because of that. Furthermore, I find it unlikely that there are absolutely no references available to cite PangYa's notability. Just because the editors have not cited them doesn't mean they don't exist. I do know that PangYa is quite popular, but the references needed might not be in English. 206.213.251.31 20:53, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"'Correct'" me if im wrong but does the fact that Super Swing Golf was created, which in fact is an off-line version of albatross12 season 2, not mean that PangYa is itself notable. After reading this i did a quick google search and found quite a bit of infromation pretaining to this game considering it is the only game of its kind. Though most of the sites, as mentioned above are not in English.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Keep</b> Pangya is a popular online multiplayer game, voted one of the most prolific downloads by Cnet in 2006. It clearly hurts no-one by having an article on wikipedia, nor is it irrelevant. Is this deletion discussion actually relevant in the least? Honestly.. --<a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnidiode_8910.html" title="User:Unidiode">Unidiode</a></p>
<p><b>Weak Keep</b> The game is relatively notable, but it's not proven in the article. Fix it, and I say the article stays. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 01:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Do remember Wikipedia's policy is to provide a world view. Just because there's lack of english site, with plenty of Korean sites, it's still relevant. That, and the fact that Super Swing Golf is here, means it should stay. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 03:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> This game is hugely popular yet there are few resources of information about it on the internet. A deletion of this article would eliminate one of the most useful and unbiased explanations of the game.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> The hell? This game is has thousands of people playing it, why wouldn't it deserve a page? It has even been translated and licensed in other countries. This deletion crap is retarded, seriously.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Nom fails to assert why the game is not notable. Research either way by the nom would provide a conclusion. If the article is lacking, tag it as such or fix it.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b>: I am inclined to believe that TUN has never touched the game itself before when making this seemingly ridiculous (but otherwise quite reasonable) assertion. As thus far there had been no clear explanation to its popularity, that much is noted and is something most of us would concede to. However, that said, it does not mean that this article is <b>entirely worthless</b> and should thus be deleted. As CyberSkull says, cleanup and deletion are two entirely different things. However, the article itself still requires more cleanup than what has already been done, the main thing being that it sounds more like a <b>source</b> article than an <b>encyclopaedic</b> one. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasonia_e6f6.html" title="User:Pasonia">Pasonia</a> 11:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>While the article is certainly notable inside the sci-fi and furry fandoms, I think therein lies the problem as well - he is notable <i>only</i> within that arena. Further, the text in the article is direct copy from the same article on WikiFur. Note, this has been deleted before and is accordingly eligible for a db-repost, but perhaps it's best kept in here. I must abstain, but I highly recommend a clean-up if it's to stay. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 20:37, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Reluctant <b>Weak Delete</b>. The test is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the phrase is "Widely recognized entertainment personalities"; and precedent shows that "througout the fandom" isn't sufficiently "wide". Evidence is needed - let's hope someone finds it. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. Not withstanding the current article status, which is somewhat promotional and would need a vicious copyediting regardless, this comes down largely to how we read the "widely recognized" clauses of WP:BIO (to wit: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field" / "Widely recognized entertainment personalities...."). He has been a featured guest (or equivalent) at nearly every convention in the genre and listed as a participant at one (apparently -- I don't know enough about furry to be certain) general-purpose science fiction convention.<a href="http://conclave.hamjudo.com/cc31/participants.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://conclave.hamjudo.com/cc31/participants.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Those sources are clearly independent <i>of him</i> but not of his subculture. As for wider references, I give up; the amount of Google to search through far outweighs the effort I'm willing to invest in an article that I have a "hunch" might have a source out there. For the hopeful: "2" is of course a worthless search term, and wider media would cite him by his name anyway (Matthew Davis), which he shares with at least two unrelated actors, an unrelated rant-style comedian (so much for using "rant" or "ranting" to narrow), an unrelated semi-professional journalist, an unrelated research scientist, and an unrelated university professor. I'm not convinced that the references available are enough to encourage a <i>keep</i> vote, but I am worried that the (generally justified) desire to purge the largely unverifiable content ported from Wikifur is resulting in a tightening of WP:BIO. For better or worse, we may lose quite a few (non-furry) biographies if we require a citation from outside the field of influence. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>For what it's worth, he's more or less a fixture at major furry conventions, including <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthrocon.html" title="Anthrocon">Anthrocon</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/r/Further_Confusion_04a5.html" title="Further Confusion">Further Confusion</a> (to cite some larger, better-known ones), and a popular one at that, often filling large rooms with onlookers. However, I'm still not sure that this translates into notability, and I haven't cited any verifiable sources yet. A large part of the problem, in fact, is likely to be that most of the discussion is in uncitable forms - LJ entries, forum posts, and IMs. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 10:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was present at ConClave 31, which has indeed been a general SciFi convention, and during his appearance there he asked for those people who didn't know about furry fandom to stick their hands up. About three people at the back did so. Now, there's a difference between "know" and "be a member of", but my opinion is that a majority of those attending his show (I estimate about 75-100, the room was full) were in the fandom, or at least knew 2 from there. His presence was part of an attempt to attract the furry contingent (and goths) to a convention which was faltering in terms of numbers. It should be noted that it was successful in doing so, with a 1/4 to 1/3 rise in attendance and part of this could be attributed to 2's presence. I can confirm that whenever 2 appears at a furry convention to present a show, it is something that people mention on the schedule. He is, in my opinion, the most notable dedicated comedian in the fandom, although I think he'd be in stiff competition with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Conway_1c0f.html" title="Samuel Conway">Uncle Kage</a> for the title of "most notable <i>entertainer</i> at conventions" (at least, he would be if they weren't good friends). He has made attempts to break out of this niche into more general comedy but I am not aware of any evidence that he has been successful so far. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 17:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I find myself unable to conclusively resolve whether the available material meets the notability criteria. To my mind, that suggests that the guideline may need to be revisited, and so I've outlined the issue at the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Criterion_discussion:_.22...enduring_historical_record_..._in_..._specific_field.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">WP:BIO talk page</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:27, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am the individual this article is written about. Perhaps I can clear up what it is that I do. I am a stand up comic who performs internationally within many specialized and main stream groups, not only the Sci Fi communities. I have performed main stream comedy clubs, universities, conventions, cruise ships and private parties since 1998. The main issue seems to be if my work is too confined within a specific sub-culture to be noted on Wikipedia. However, I am unsure of why this is an issue since there are literally hundreds of personalities noted here who work within one specific sub-culture. My work is certainly no less noted than any of the myriad of artists from the furry, sci fi or fantasy communities which are listed within Wikipedia. Of course, this does nothing to "prove" my notability. However, if you'll put the single word "ranting" into Google, you'll see my site is on the top of the list.</li>

<li>2, you raise good points, and thanks for chiming in on this. I personally will do what I can on this - but frankly, your article needs a good cleaning up into something other than an exact copy of what's on Wikifur. =^_^= See the original statement I give in the AFD post. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just checked around on google. The one article I can find that <i>might</i> make notability standards is <a href="http://www.cparchives.com/archive.cfm?type=Main%20Feature&amp;action=getComplete&amp;ref=6353" class="external text" title="http://www.cparchives.com/archive.cfm?type=Main%20Feature&amp;action=getComplete&amp;ref=6353" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, but you only get a fleeting mention in here that briefly describes you. I hate to say it, 2, but as much as I like you, at this time Wikipedia isn't going to hold an article on you - and if it's not me, then it's going to be somebody else putting this article up here. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I did not start this article (either time it was put up), I'm very happy to be recognized here on Wikipedia and I'd like to do what I can to help keep the article around. I've looked, but I cannot find a description of the notability standards you've mentioned. However, I can say that I've been a guest character in the webcomic "Jack", which has an entry here. I've performed multiple times for 11, been the Guest of Honor at 5, and am on staff at 2 of the conventions which have entries here. I've been interviewed in Vanity Fair magazine, which has an entry here. I've written fiction for publications that are listed here. I've produced 4 full length motion pictures and 2 CDs which are distributed by a company that is listed here. There is even a number of references to me in Wikipedia from other entries. I do admit to ignorance of these notability standards, but seeing the effort Wikipedia dedicates to quality, shouldn't it consider itself a notable source? There are many people listed on Wikipedia who have few online references at all, and they may be entries that will also eventually be noticed and deleted. But doesn't the fact that my entry has been discussed for deletion twice while others have gone ignored indicate that it IS notable? What exactly qualifies a person as "notable" on Wikipedia?</li>

<li>here's my though, the reasons given to delete this article are weak. some one must be bored, because they came up with lame excuses to delete this article. as for that "one specific sub-culture" thing, that the dumbest reason of all. is wikipedia that stuck up? thats not a good reason to delete an article. its about a real eprson, with a real website and who's done REAL stand up.

I'd conjecture fewer people know about Bremstrahlung radiation than know about Two, does that make it non-notable?

<dd>The guidelines are just that, guidelines. I think the real problem with this case is that the subject is probably notable, but doesn't fall under traditional notability criteria, to me that says there's a problem with the criteria, not the subject. It's unrealistic to expect someone in any fandom to be in news articles, ect. That does not mean they are not notable. In this case, I'm not sure if he is or isn't, but I think it's worth looking into. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 23:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is certainly true that a guideline carries less weight than a official policy. Guidelines can certainly be ignored if there is a good reason to do so. Still, in this case, I don't see any reason to ignore it. Anybody is notable if you look at them with a sufficiently narrow view. The trick is to have done something of sufficient significance that you are noted outside of your narrow area. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 23:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In particular, this one passes the criteria for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in that he has multiple non-trivial articles written about him, as noted in his article (the articles listed are here: <a href="http://www.jumponmarkslist.com/gio/2006/interviews/tory_mason.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jumponmarkslist.com/gio/2006/interviews/tory_mason.htm" rel="nofollow">Tory Mason Interview</a> and <a href="http://ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=karrnal&amp;article=72" class="external autonumber" title="http://ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=karrnal&amp;article=72" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>).

This article needs to CITE AND VERIFY notability, not simply have a collection of editors here make assertions that "it really IS a common term, really!". I'm aware there are a number of terms in every industry that are commonly used colloquially but hard to prove, but it strikes that if there is any industry where one should be able to verify via web-based sources, it would be the adult industry. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a>'s vote is the core problem with this debate at the moment, specifically for "so I've heard".

<li>By the same token, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a>, a bit of a problem arises in applying the same standards of verifiability to sexual colloquialisms (particularly of fringe sexual practices some may find unpleasant) as we do to, say, astronomical taxonomy. Sometimes "uh, doesn't <i>everybody</i> know what ass to mouth is" is what you have to work with, and you go from there. That's what that particular behavior <i>is</i> called (I can't think of a synonymous expression), and I really don't see why we need a citation from the New England Journal of Medicine to prove that. <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimjob.html" title="Rimjob">rimjob</a>, these are really not things you're going to have an easy time finding citations for, despite sexual behaviors occupying a central part in every culture that continues to produce babies (and orgasms). "Blowjob" is about 150 years old, and it's only very recently that etymologists have started to trace its origins. I don't think it would be a terrible idea to <b>move</b> this to a more encyclopedic-sounding title (although I can't begin to imagine what that would be Immediately-Post-Anal-Sex Oral Sex?), with a redirect from <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">ass to mouth</a>, a la, <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titty_fuck.html" title="Titty fuck">titty fuck</a> redirecting to <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammary_intercourse.html" title="Mammary intercourse">mammary intercourse</a>.

<li>None of the above editors have cited any sources. The article itself cites no sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I am 100% unsurprised that medical and psychological researched turned up nothing.

Continue to fail to do so, and you won't save the article, no matter how much you put forward irrelevant arguments about censorship. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 06:10, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to quote WP:AN page on why we should avoid neologisms- "[...]articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet — without attributing these claims to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true <b>even though there may be many examples of the term in use</b>." <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 00:45, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, in my opinion, and remember these are opinions that we have even though some present them as fact, this article is valid. This practice goes on and if Wikipedia is to have any credibility it must be complete, if we are to have a category on sexual practices it should give the prevalent ones. This is an example of where <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> (though I shudder to use it) is appropriate. There is a huge swathe of uses of Ass to mouth, ATM, A2M etc on the internet. There are interviews that include the term, it's not just in the "script" of a porn shoot, it is used verbally to communicate an idea. This is something real people do in their everyday lives, like it or not. Adherence to rules is ok but recognising when the rules don't serve the purpose for which they were written is essential. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 17:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>you do realize that "Ignore All Rules" is a controversial policy, right? and WP is not supposed to be about every single thing under the sun... If Wikipedia is to have any credibility, it should only have reliable, encyclopedic content that is not based on personal observation or research. The fact that this article violates so many policies and guidelines <i>must</i> raise at least one red flag in your head. And the phrase that this article is about just seems to be so unnotable -both from WP's standards and any layman's subjective viewpoint- even if it is often and only used in the porn industry. I mean, it clearly and without any wordplay or use of unconventional phrasing describes the act. It is unlikely to qualify for a copyright. It does not seem to be any special phrase whose history can be reliably traced. I mean, if this article is to exist, then we might as well create an article for "Guy On Guy" or something like that.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - maybe you just do not understand, Malla. For a source to be considered reliable in an article about a neologism, per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, which would justify an article about a neologism, the following must be followed: <u>"To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers **about** the term — <b>not books and papers that **use** the term.</b></u> The source you added to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">Ass to mouth</a> is merely an article that uses the term by noting "there is currently a trendy fetish for ass-to-mouth contact."

<li><b>I call shenanigans</b>. A colloquial sexual term is never going to be verifiable to the standard of a scientific article, but that doesn't make it unworthy of inclusion. This article already survived one VfD. I believe Cyberanth is cunningly pushing a personal agenda by using overly strict interpretation of the rules with no regard to context. Note that he/she has recently nominated several long-standing sexual-practise type articles on similar grounds. Note also that his/her major contributions have been to articles about Christian views on contraception. You do the math.

<li>Keep - per Mallanox. To Student7, Wikipedia is not censored. We have articles on most sexual fetishes; this is pretty mild in comparison to some of them, and it _is_ an established term in the industry. Tevildo 03:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Censorship is not the issue. Satisfying <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is the core matter. "Mild" or "extreme" is irrelevant. "An established term in the [porn] industry is what defines it as a neologism per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>: "Neologisms are words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, <i>but may be used widely or within certain communities</i>" (emphasis added). For an article to be justified, more than that is needed.

You appear to be demanding nothing short of multiple peer-reviewed academic research papers on the subject, which is totally unreasonable in this context, and just adds to the impression that you are attempting to effectively censor the article by setting unattainable standards. As for your your edit to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">Anal-oral contact</a>, did you even read it first? The second paragraph of that article says: <i>"It is a distinct practice from anal sex followed by fellatio, which is often referred to as ass to mouth."</i></dd>

<dd>I have to agree, multiple source have been provided that the practice exists. It is real beyond doubt. As already stated, the source doesn't have to be about the origins of the term. If I added a source to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> it should prove there is a country called England on the island of Great Britain not why it's called England and where the term comes from. The crux of argument, correct me if I'm wrong, is that we don't know what to call it. It seems to have no proper name. In this instance I suggest we use a term that brings back a massive number of Google hits and move on to another subject who's verifiability and notability are in doubt. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 13:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Because originally the article claimed it was a multi-platinum selling band with no.1 hits in North America and 9million CDs sold worldwide. Even though these claims are false, likely hoax content <u>is not covered</u> by <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">the criteria for speedy deletion</a>. Having even a dubious claim to encyclopedic notability is sufficient to fail speedy deletion tagging criteria. I originally prodded this article and it was contested.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>Without addressing the merits</i> of this article, I'm concerned that the mast deletion is trying to define a consensus cutoff by sequential deletion of all towers and masts until the community says "stop". That is unlikely to recognize the appropriate cutoff, however, because of the overwhelmingly large number of inarguable legitimate deletions that have dominated this field for the last few weeks. I know the US masts nominations are up to everythign less then 500', and this one is edging up closer to corresponding landmark buildings like the Space Needle. That doesn't necessarily imply that I'd argue to keep this one (as the article stands, its pretty unpersuasive -- anyone able to search the Norwegian press?), but we might want to think about where we want to stop before we actually get there ... inertia being what it is. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>OK, I'll admit</b>: I was the one so impressed by the... (gasp!) ... revolving restaurant that I deprodded this. I also deprodded the probably very unremarkable <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernsehturm_Kulpenberg_771d.html" title="Fernsehturm Kulpenberg">Fernsehturm Kulpenberg</a> which could very smoothly be merged to the one-line substub on the <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kulpenberg.html" title="Kulpenberg">Kulpenberg</a>, the mountain it stands on. Not being an expert on these things, my intuition still tells me that there is a difference between a <i>mast</i> and a <i>tower</i>, especially one with a ... (gasp!) ... revolving restaurant. A tower which is the highest in its region and has a... (gasp!) ... revolving restaurant is obviously a frequently visited landmark in that area. However else would the restaurant make a profit? I wonder why whoever prodded these towers, if s/he felt they were unworthy of articles of their own, did not consider <i>merging</i> (or simply redirecting) them somewhere. It doesn't save any server space to have them go through the deletion process. And the most obvious merge target here is not the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_towers.html" title="List of towers">List of towers</a>, but the article on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trondheim.html" title="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up◦land</a> 08:06, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>there is indeed a distinction between a guyed mast (which is basically a big antenna, right?) and a tower supporting a revolving restaurant. I didn't care for the "gasp" wisecrack either, btw. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 08:52, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><strike>*<b>Merge</b> into List of Towers <b>AND</b> article on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trondheim.html" title="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, per above suggestion. I've supplied a link from the Fodors website to the tower article, indicating that it is a bone fide attraction in the region, so a merge into the main city article is indicated, in my view.

<dd>Okay, <b>Keep</b>. I wanted to sleep on this and see if anyone from Norway came in and spoke out in favour of retaining. Eivind, below, is good enough for me.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am leaning towards a weak keep for the subject.

<li>Can anyone <i>please</i> properly define "TV guide?" In <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, the only expample on "guide" is on a radio guide. "For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable."(~From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>) which makes the discussion of a TV guide issue very hard. But judging from the given example, listing radio stations is <i>not</i> included. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_channels_available_on_SkyCable_123b.html" title="List of channels available on SkyCable">This article</a> does not show any "upcoming events, current promotions, telephone numbers, schedules, etc." From my level of knowledge (3rd year high school student), a TV guide is a guide of <i>program schedules</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_channels_available_on_SkyCable_123b.html" title="List of channels available on SkyCable">This</a> is a channel lineup.

<dd>I think you missed the parts where people said why a list of channels is not a TV guide then. There are several quite relevant arguments made there, much more substantial than ILIKEIT. A list of channels or even a list of programs is not the kind of TV guide that's been warned against. Now if this network used a wide variety of different programming blocks, then there might be arguments against this list, but it wouldn't be because it's a TV Guide.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, This is an old discussion. The DirecTV listing was nominated for deletion along with lists of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CW, MNTV, Dish Network and XM channels less than two months ago. The general consensus was that the lists of channels offered by each service, as long as they did not include detailed guide-type listings, did <b>not</b> constitute TV Guide as noted in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Nothing has changed since that point. Each of those nominations resulted in a finding of <b>keep</b>. I urge those prior decisions to be upheld, as nothing has changed in the interim. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 07:06, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Each of these listings (I can't speak for SkyCable) grew out of their parent articles. They do not constitute a TV Guide-type listing; they are an indication as to what stations are associated with the network/satellite company, not unlike the list of teams in the NFL or the templates of stations in each television/radio market. I want to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but this AfD feels more arbitrary than anything else. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 17:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>POI.</b> There are lots of things that are ever-changing that are in Wikipedia. Politics is ever changing, culture is ever changing. There is an article on the War in Somalia. That's a war in progress. How about the article on the War on Terror, the War in Iraq? Also, there are other people who might want to read this article, who are not subscribers. I think it's valid information to include a list of channels that DirecTV provides as their service.

As far as I'm concerned, as I read it and interpret <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, <b>DIR</b> only refers to TV guides such as what's in the newspaper, or the aforementioned magazine.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is absolutely not crystal ballism. We can predict this event with extreme accuracy, and the content of the page is quite good--it traces precisely where and when the eclipse is going to take place. It even includes scientific data about the nature of the eclipse. Not only is this event notable because it's a sufficiently rare event in and of itself as a total eclipse, but it will be the first total eclipse visible from the contiguous United States since the '70s. If that isn't enough, then please keep in mind that eclipse-hunters get together yearly to chase down these remarkable events--planning them years in advance--and this article is both relevant and of practical use. My college physics teacher is among them, and I know she keeps track of when, where, what kind, and how long eclipses will happen and then coordinates with other friends and researchers. So as something of important scientific and cultural merit, I believe this article should stay. Torie 04:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think it sounds notable enough to be mentioned in such a list or article but not have an article on its own.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I scanned some of the comments. I agree that future astronomical events are not in the crystal ball category because the scientific community agrees that they will happen according to very specific details. I also agree that solar eclipses are notable. The cutoff can be debated -- should we go to 2040, 2050, or even forever into the future? But this one is close enough to be relevant. 129.98.212.73 17:52, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> We can predict a lot of things way into the future, and scientists may agree on the details, but that does not make them notable. We do not need articles now for every future astronomical event for which computer models can grind out the details. If it is notable at this time, then add articles which provide more than passing reference about it from the New York Times, Newsweek or perhaps astonomy or science magazines. Blogs do not count. All that is provided is one NASA site, which is reliable and verifiable, but not "multiple." This is a filter to prevent someone from adding articles about every lunar or solar eclipse for the next 10,000 years. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:06, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Again from the guideline: <i>the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred.</i> All of this is satisfied. Is this almost certain to take place? You bet. There is no requirement anywhere that notability requires that independent reliable sources <i>claim</i> notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are dozens of sources going back to the 1970's that highlight the 2017 eclipse as the first chance for many in the continental United States to view a total solar eclipse for almost four decades. References have been added to the article that indicate American astronomers and interested amateurs taking cruises and traveling to view other eclipses, noting that the next chance in the 48 states would be in 2017. A reference from 1991 cites that year's eclipse that crossed Hawaii and Mexico as the best until 2017. This is not just one total solar eclipse in an unending string of such eclipses that will take place somewhere on Earth until the Sun burns out. It has been deemed notable for decades as the first total solar eclipse in the continental United States to take place in 38 years. It is clear to me that notability has been established for this event. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:24, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> does not apply for the most part, as eclipses can be accurately predicted and their path very well described. Instead the issues are notabity and whether the topic is encyclopedic. As an event which will occur in well-populated areas, it immediately is potentially notable. As for it's occurring over 10 years from now: That is more of an issue, but I am not sure where the line should be drawn on this kind of article. Obviously an article on a 22nd century eclipse would be a joke, but if this eclipse was to occur in 2007 it would already be a topic of some interest. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 23:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable album of a non-notable band The Indix, which fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. I am from India, and I can assure you that neither the band nor the album are notable. Google results are about albums by other artists such as Mike Stand, Jeff Kashiwa etc. The band and the album were mentioned in some local newspapers in 2000, because the group claimed that they were the first pop-band from Kerala and that they were the first to release a 3D music video in India. That doesn't make them notable enough to warrant an article on Wikipedia. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a> 03:25, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've noticed that there is a series of AfDs that all pertain to this band and related articles. While they are not very good articles and their notability is shakey, is there anyway we could condense all of the articles into a single article? That way we do not have to completely wipe what could <i>possibly</i> be a notable band (possibly in italics for emphasis) from the entire Wikipedia, but their less notable articles can be deleted. I think that would be a good idea. --<a href="../../../s/b/r/User%7ESbrools_1fae.html" title="User:Sbrools"><b>Sbrools</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/b/r/User_talk%7ESbrools_398a.html" title="User talk:Sbrools"><b><font color="red">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sbrools_c965.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sbrools"><b><font color="green">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 06:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It looks like this article falls under the category of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">"Articles which may resemble crap but could contain a pearl"</a>. You don't delete pages if they are in bad quality but still have the potential to become an encyclopedia article. From your nomination, I can see that you gathered <i>some</i> information about the subject in the article, if nothing else, trim down and rewrite the article. Feel free to nominate it for deletion once you can reason that the article does not belong in the encyclopedia. I therefore <b>suggest withdrawing</b> this nomination for now. <b><a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>)</b> 04:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Nice work on the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonny_Hicks_c39e.html" title="Bonny Hicks">Bonny Hicks</a> article. But personally, Campfire stories aren't something I know enough about to avoid OR. There is nothing to stop the original author from copying the current article to userspace and turning it into something readable, but at the moment it isn't the basis for an article. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 12:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would generally agree with you except that your assertion assumes that only the initiating author(s) or a currently reading editor or expert exists that is qualified or is likely to expand it. Stubs or very poorly written articles exist for a reason per Wikipedia guidelines, and such articles are frequently expanded upon by persons other than the initiator, e.g., my "adoption" of the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonny_Hicks_c39e.html" title="Bonny Hicks">Bonny Hicks</a> article, who I was acquainted with in only a minor way before delving into her life and contributions, although I consider myself an expert on literatures of discontent (which is a <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissing_cousin.html" title="Kissing cousin">kissing cousin</a> of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-colonial_literature.html" title="Post-colonial literature">post-colonial literature</a>) and had a fair understanding of Singapore culture going in, which made things a bit easier. Bottom line: Generally, if a poor but potential-ridden article remains on article space, adoption by others can and frequently does happen, even by new Wikipedians who happen upon the article. Still: <u>Author, are you listening?</u> Prepare for the worst in the probably likely case that deletion happens: You can copy AND SHOULD RIGHT NOW copy this article on to your user space which I created for you at User:Nmfmets92/Campfire stories. Then, you can get it up to Wikipedia standards and repost it without any fear of it being deleted. It will definitely be a learning experience for you in either case. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 12:42, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I turned down a speedy deletion request on this page a while back. After looking closely at the article though, this page is edited heavily by a User:Lucy Parker and the info in the article is overwhelmingly trivial and/or unverifiable. Whether or not one-time subjects of TV shows are worthy of inclusion has been up for debate many times before on this forum, with mixed results. However, I think we can agree that a subject mentioned in one press release (that doesn't include Lucy's last name) for an <i>upcoming</i> show cannot meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>Totally non-notable and written as an advertisement for the Natural History Museum, London, an institution that hardly needs clumsy linkspam from Wikipedia. The subject of the article isn't an especially large specimen of a giant squid, nor a historically important one. It hasn't provided any unique scientific insight, and isn't the type specimen for a new species. The "Archie" name has the ring of something coined by the marketing department, and without a reference to its use by the national press is pointless. All except the first paragraph read like marketing-speak and add nothing to the value of the article. Will every stuffed bird or preserved fish deserve an article of its own on Wikipedia?</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Does not deserve its own article. This might be included in the museam's article itself, but in its own article it just sounds like an advertisement. It's blatantly POV too. --<a href="../../../s/b/r/User%7ESbrools_1fae.html" title="User:Sbrools"><b>Sbrools</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/b/r/User_talk%7ESbrools_398a.html" title="User talk:Sbrools"><b><font color="red">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sbrools_c965.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sbrools"><b><font color="green">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 05:59, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><del>Keep</del> Merge</b> Doesn't particularly read like advertising to me. I did a google search and found a number of articles referring to the specimin, including major news sources such as the BBC. Apparently this particular specimin is notable for having been caught alive, as well as its general size and condition; the organism itself is extremely rare. See: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4756514.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4756514.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4756514.stm</a> <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 06:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment from proposer.</b> I know Wikipedia doesn't particularly respect "experts" but I happen to have been a cephalopod palaeontologist and I also know the NHM well, having done my PhD and post-doc there.<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/ammonites/scientificpublic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/ammonites/scientificpublic.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> I've explored the modern cephalopod collection at length and am reasonably familiar with the breadth and depth of the material preserved there. There is nothing the least unusual about this specimen (the NHM has several other <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_squid.html" title="Giant squid">giant</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossal_squid.html" title="Colossal squid">colossal squid</a> specimens, and these specimens lack entries on Wikipedia. Even more ridiculous, there is already a photograph of a one other museum specimen of this species on the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_squid.html" title="Giant squid">Giant squid</a> page already, and it doesn't have its own page! Whilst not an expert on modern squids, my understanding is that giant squid are far from rare, and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of preserved bits of giant squid in museum collections around the world. Admittedly, many are unexciting fragments taken from beached carcasses or sperm whale stomachs, for example. But the uncommon preservation of this specimen doesn't make this specimen notable. If it does, there'd need to be entries for nice but not special cuneiform tablets or Egyptian mummies! Simply because a museum is proud of a specimen doesn't make it worthy of its own article. If the thing was featured as a photograph on the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architeuthis.html" title="Architeuthis">Architeuthis</a> page along with some comments on its size and preservation, that would be one thing, and as an interesting addition to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_History_Museum_6eb4.html" title="Natural History Museum">Natural History Museum</a> page under "things to see" that would make sense too. But simply giving one, non-unique, and non-scientifically revolutionary specimen its own page just strikes me as absurd.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Neale, I can understand your viewpoint, and I agree that the article comes off as a bit silly. Nevertheless, there's some precedent for giving common human names to famous museum specimens (<a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_%28Australopithecus%29_51da.html" title="Lucy (Australopithecus)">Lucy (Australopithecus)</a>) and scientific specimens (<a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_the_Sheep_2416.html" title="Dolly the Sheep">Dolly the Sheep</a>). Since news entities like the BBC have made this particular specimen well-known, it leads one to expect that a person might search for this. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 15:41, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tarinth, I agree that some specimens are so special that they do have common names. I'd also agree that these specimens are so important and well-known that they deserve Wikipedia pages. I'd add to your list things like the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosetta_Stone_d392.html" title="Rosetta Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> at the British Museum and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephenson%27s_Rocket_0674.html" title="Stephenson's Rocket">Stephenson's Rocket</a> at the Science Museum. But this squid isn't even close to that level of importance. It's just one, nicely preserved but otherwise unremarkable, giant squid. Unlike Lucy, this squid hasn't redefined our understanding of an aspect of biology (as the article notes, because it's preserved intact, it hasn't yielded even basic information like whether it's a male or female!). It isn't the first giant squid or the largest, so it isn't notable in that way either. It's just a nice specimen; nothing more, nothing less.

<dd>Here is my concern--I'll take your word for it that the specimen has little or no notability within the community of cephalopod biologists; but on the other hand, there seems to be notability within the popular-science-press. I have no expertise on the subject and no particular desire to keep it around (other than that I find cephalopods extremely interesting), but what I'm attempting to do is see whether it meets Wikipedia's minimum standards. WP's standards for inclusion of an article on a named museum specimen is considerably lower than something of profound historical value such as <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosetta_Stone_d392.html" title="Rosetta Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>, or even a more current example like <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_the_Sheep_2416.html" title="Dolly the Sheep">Dolly the Sheep</a>. I think this is an example of an article which falls into the category of "we probably don't really need it, but it meets the minimum anyway." It does seem to satisfy the minimal inclusion criteria (mentions of it in several non-trivial media sources). As a comparison, imagine if the BBC did a write-up on a new musical band; that band would easily meet notability on that basis alone, and could claim a page on Wikipedia. Because WP is not a print encyclopedia, it can be far more liberal. A compromise worthy of consideration may be to include a sentence on Archie within the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_squid.html" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a> article, and then change this to a Redirect.

<dd>Hello Tarinth! I have no argument at all with having "Archie" mentioned in the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Squid_8f78.html" title="Giant Squid">Giant Squid</a> article. The difficulties involved in photographing, capturing, and displaying these animals are very interesting. There's an excellent book partly on this topic by Richard Ellis, <i>The Search for the Giant Squid</i>, that has chapters on the 'evolution' of model giant squids in museums. But the place for such discussion would be in the Giant Squid article, where there could be a proper discussion of how the first specimens were found and displayed. The Museum itself has a very nice 3D model in the marine invertebrates gallery that is one of my favourite things there. It really gives you a good idea of how big these things are! Anyway, there could be explanations of why they're not easy to find (live in deep water), recover whole (not robust, rather gloopy ammoniacal tissues), or put on display (not hard parts and no easy to 'stuff' like bird or mammal). In such a context, figuring "Archie" along with an outline of the good luck that led to its capture together with discriptions of how it is preserved and displayed would be perfectly logical. My problem is that given that this squid is otherwise completely non-notable, it justifies any museum or historical society creating a page for any specimen in their collections. While they're free to do so on their own web pages as advertisements or science communication, on Wikipedia there needs to be at least some level of discrimination, surely?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am against a merge, I think it should stay with its own article. At first glance everything Neale says about Archie's non-notability as a specimen seems to make sense and he certainly talks like an expert.. but the press coverage strongly suggests otherwise. I also got slightly suspicious when Neale used Archies intact state to begin a line of argument that ended with Archie being less valuable to science.. ultimately they could always open him up, and anyway in 20 years time there will likely be non-invasive methods of imaging Archie's insides. A disingenuous argument, I think. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 20:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zargulon, press coverage is a debateable standard for the value of something being included in Wikipedia. There are presumably millions of events around the world that don't get included in the Encyclopaedia Britannica or in Wikipedia. Should there be an entry for every amusing dog or every beached whale? As for the "intact condition" of the specimen, my argument is basically this: in science, the value of something comes from the information it provides. This specimen has not yet provided anything exceptional, and since we don't even know the sex of the specimen, it has actually provided <i>less</i> information than the average NHM specimen that is dissected and studied more closely. Note that I'm not saying the article contains <i>nothing</i> of value, but I do think that it could be used more productively as material for the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Squid_8f78.html" title="Giant Squid">Giant Squid</a> article where it can be used to illustrate the issues surrounding the exhibition of giant squids in museums. Instead of focusing on this specimen and how wonderful the NHM is (which I don't disagree with) why not explain the problems with finding specimens and why specimens such as "Archie" are so rare and thus newsworthy.

<dd>Neale, the key word which you are glossing over is <i>yet</i>. Your argument would treat a scientific artifact of no value the same as one so valuable that people have to prepare very carefully to analyse it. Then you say "instead of A why not B?" but there is plenty of room in Wikipedia for both A and B. Provided there is no misleading glorification of Archie, I don't see how you can begrudge a perfectly coherent and informative article. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 21:24, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zargulon, there are lots of objects in museums and elsewhere that may yet yield useful information. I dare-say there are still interesting fossil hominids in the ground that are yet to be discovered, and perhaps there are letters by Dickens and sketches by Picasso lying around in attics that will tell us more about them. But they don't deserve an encyclopaedia entry until that time. I am not an expert on giant squid, but I know the NHM collections (at least during the 1990s) somewhat, and know for a fact they have lots of more material of this species as well as other large squids. The single thing that makes this specimen unusual is that it is in good condition. But it isn't unique in this regard. By all means create a section on the Giant Squid article about specimens in museums, but there's no point having an entry on just one specimen, especially when a similarly well preserved specimen in the Melbourne Aquarium is featured on the Giant Squid page! Should that specimen have a Wikipedia entry as well? Cheers, Neale <a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENeale_Monks_a934.html" title="User:Neale Monks">Neale Monks</a> 22:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. With respect to the resident expert here, the article does assert some notable things about this squid: That it was captured alive, and that it's the best preserved <i>whole</i> specimen in existence. Giant squids may be numerous, but my understanding is they are nevertheless rarely seen whole even when dead, let alone alive. I would be happy if the salient facts about this squid were merged into the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_squid.html" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a> article or somewhere else appropriate. I don't mind seeing the article deleted as long as the relevant content still exists somewhere. As long as the content is to be found in this article, it should stay, but if it's merged somewhere else, it should be deleted. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 06:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Guidelines call for non-trivial and independent sources. There is no specification that the source be independent of her political beliefs, just independent of her control.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see the notability here not strictly as a musician, but but as a representative of social movements, both in nationalism and in racism. That her notability has penetrated to the point of being mentioned on US TV and as deep within US culture as to be on Minnesota Public Radio (known as a liberal medium), is significant. Perhaps a more pertinent article would be about Swedish nationalism or Swedish neo-nazism. To me an internationally recognized Swedish neo-nazi singer is of notable concern--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Three reliable sources? The Minnesota Radio show has been discounted above, it does not assert notability. Second reference is exactly the same. It's an interview from a far right radio show (of unknown broadcast status), where her name is mentioned in one sentence, and does not assert notability. That only leaves the incredibly short clip from Discovery, which does not assert notability. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 08:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hackney, you are starting to cite your own statements of opinion as sources of reference. You have stated above your concern about the sourcese, but you can't cite your own opinions as "discounting" the credibilty of the source -- this is circular logic.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I'm just not the one saying that simply because Saga is mentioned in passing on a couple of radio station by people who run record companies that distribute her music (which are therefore not independent, and are not reliable sources) she is notable. If you wish to carry on this charade, I suggest first reading <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and especially <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Extremist_sources" title="WP:RS">using extremist sources</a>. Extremist sources can only be used as primary sources, and articles may use primary sources, but only to make descriptive points about the topic. Any interpretive claims require secondary sources. Without independent third party sources, there's no way of proving she's notable. And <b>yet again</b> not one of the sources (be they credible or otherwise) made any assertion of notability that she meets any of the criteria for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 08:56, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As the various criteria at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> are merely guidelines, we must look to the overarching spirit of Wikipedia, especially when someone's notability crosses among genres and borders. In this case Saga is more than a musician, she is a symbol within an international cult. By your own statement above her "distributors" are getting her press in the US, as far reaching as the ultra-liberal Public Radio and the reactionary National Alliance, with a significant interview on Discovery Channel in the middle, which is a big deal on this side of the Pond. How can you question the independence of Public Radio and Discovery Channel? What is the risk of inclusion?

If she is an important singer, please produce evidence to support this. Not one of the sources suggests she is notable. The Southern Poverty Law Centre merely has her in a list of over a hundred acts, with no information apart from her name. That isn't a source, other than to prove she actually exists. Please produce sources that assert notability. If she is notable as you allege, you should be able to produce sources to support this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_One_Night_In_Hackney_55a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/One Night In Hackney">contribs</a>) 00:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Missing the Point</b> Hackney continues to miss the point or try to throw the discussion off track with non sequitur discussion and ad hominem conclusions. Focusing on Saga as only a singer ignores the political symbolism for which she is most notable. The perponderance of sources makes Hackney's arguments about the weaknesses of several irrelevant. By the heated level of discussion here and vandalism at the article, it appears that the Saga issue is controvercial enough to qualify by that alone. If you look back to the Notability guidelines, there is very little specification of what makes media mention notable; the concern is mostly that the medium be independent and that the mention be non-trivial. When the US Southern Poverty Law Center <s>puts</s> published a list including a Swedish singer, along with an article expressing deep concern <s>on a list of concerns</s>, that is notable from a highly credible liberal source, not to mention public radio. Hackney may not respect the neo-conservative press, but they are independent of Saga herself, and are discussing her clearly in more than a trivial way. Hackney seems to be taking this to a level of prosecution rather than nomination --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 00:36, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Some white power websites list a 'Nazi Top Ten' - Viking is a regular chart-topper. Frequently appearing in the same hit parade is another racialist chanteuse called Saga - or the 'Swedish Madonna of the far right' as she's been nicknamed thanks to her stunning looks. Her philosophy, she told me simply, was: 'I just don't want people that are not like me around me.' We met in Stockholm, where she was feted in the streets by skinheads. She has deliberately concocted a 'mainstream' look - not for her the 'skin-girl' haircut and bovver boots - despite her celebrity status in the white power underground. She's immaculately coiffed and made up - and alludes to something terrible happening to her in her past, that she won't talk about explicitly, which turned her towards the politics of hate.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Saga flew secretly to the UK to play a white power concert in yet another run-down former mining town in the north of England. Most gigs are arranged surreptitiously through a series of mobile phone calls, like football hooligan rucks. Those in the know phone their mates, and then they phone their mates, and so on until everyone in the white power scene knows where and when the latest gig will be.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Saga's biggest thrill is giving the Nazi salute to her fans. I watch while a moshpit of smitten British skinheads salute her back - including a child aged about eight. 'Raising your right arm is like - we all do that, you know, to greet each other,' she says later. 'They greet me and I greet them. It is a victory salute. For me, it is a really honourable thing to do. There is a lot of honour in doing that.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>At gigs such as the one played by Saga in Britain, all profits from merchandising and ticket sales go to the BNP. 'You do something to make a difference,' she says. 'I sing because that's what I do. If I was any good at politics I would probably do that, but I am not so I am doing my bit the musical way.</i></dd>

<li>Saga appears on the cover of Resistance Magazine, which is visible on the webpage; the article is linked to that visual. Another editor referred to the interview, but that has now been removed and only the reference to the cover page remains. Hackney should not have removed the entire discussion and reference. However, Hackney also removed the reference to the Jewish Defense League which mentions Saga at it's webpage.

What we could do is limit the season pages to Football League tables (i've noticed 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 are missing tables), and only optionally include the Premiership tables or link to them. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESurge79uwf_ea01.html" title="User:Surge79uwf">Surge79uwf</a> 05:34, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much like the article above, this article consists of a couple of unsourced statements indicating that a song of this title "is most likely to be the next single" off of Ciara's album (which kind of contradicts the statement at similarly unsourced <a href="../../../l/i/k/Like_A_Boy_50e2.html" title="Like A Boy">Like A Boy</a>).

<dd>Isn't that taking the guideline a little too rigidly? He's notable enough to be remembered by the media after 10 years. He was mentioned mostly in 1993 for the train thing, again in 1994 for stabbing, and again compared to others in 2003 for his "daredevil-ness". Has survived the "test of time", so to speak. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 03:56, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The first is a trivial mention - no byline that I can see, amounts to a review only. The second three links all are <b>very</b> slim indeed: perhaps enough to rate a mention in a paragraph on "DDR clones" in the DDR article at the most. More to the point, they are <u>not in the article</u>. Quit faffing around here and write something <i><b>in the article</b></i> as I have painfully pointed out time and again on the talk page.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> I would doubt that this is truly original research, but rather it is at this point undocumented research. The establishment of notability and the task of providing references are subtly different, although the latter seems to accomplish the former in many cases. Unfortuantely our standards may be biased against a culture which does not have a large repository of online information. We may want to look to the spirit of the guidelines and consider the assumption of good faith. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 12:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have a pretty good amount of expertise on the Pacific. The Turaga Na Rasau is to Fijians roughly as the Queen of England is to Brits. Deletion is thus pretty ethnocentric. However, the article needs sourcing and it could perhaps be merged into Turaga Na Rasau. And I am sure good sources exist that could be cited, even if some of them need to be primary. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 01:53, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I do not want to interfere in this debate in which I would not be able to say if the information is the truth or not, but this is an interesting question. We all know how oral tradition is important in all South Pacific and how it can vary from one narrator to another. We could have the same debate about New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, Cook Islands... The question is, should Wikipedia tolerate informations when there are no written sources&#160;? I think it should, if the author of the article explains where and how he had the information and if the tribe concerned or the clan, or any legitime owner of the story is agreed to reveal it. If I well understood, the author of those articles is himself involved in it. So what is the problem&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>i think in this case we should let someone outside our community document this information and publish it (where it will get peer reviewed by other experts in the field). Otherwise what you are asking is for us (the wikipedia community) to judge the quality of the author's research methods in collecting oral histories and the quality of his synthesis and conclusion. We should not be doing this - we are simply not qualified. This one reason why we ban <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> here - so that such issues are dealt with outside the community, and the information comes to us reliably and <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">verified</a>. --<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXorkl000_020b.html" title="User:Xorkl000">Xorkl000</a> 01:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would add, that I really appreciate the articles (from all contributors) about fidji in the english wikipedia. It helps me a lot in my modest constributions in the french one and reminds me a great trip in fidji more than ten years ago. Vinaka and keep on the good job&#160;!</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> This article, right now, does not assert its importance, but I feel that it could possibly be made into something that shows wht it needs an article more. And what's the connection between fetuses and genocide? Sure they're both disgusting pictures, but I'm not sure how that got dragged into the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: with the lead Google hit on this being from www.abortionno.org and the second lead hit from genocideawarenessproject.blogspot.com, I'm unconvinced on the alleged "consideable [sic] publicity." Certainly there's a buzz on both sides of the abortion wars blogosphere and on campus bulletin boards, but might we see some citations to reliable mainstream sources? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Definition of Encyclopedia: "A <b>comprehensive</b> reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.". The information that we are adding is referenced and well organised information which could be viewed as useful. How this information strays from the meaning of the word encyclopedia I don't know. You should try to go on the internet to find detailed results of matches from the internet as we were doing and discover how hard it actually is to find such detailed information. I also put the word comprehensive in bold. More detail is what we need here and not less.<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 13:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

My concern is, are these more detailed "results" pages necessary to understand the broad topic, or even admissible according to WP guidelines. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidbspalding_e14a.html" title="User:Davidbspalding">David Spalding</a>&#160;(<big><font color="darkred"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidbspalding_3442.html" title="User talk:Davidbspalding">☎</a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Davidbspalding_8ef5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Davidbspalding">✉</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_davidbspalding_bb1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/davidbspalding">✍</a></font></big>) 18:30, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dictionary.com gives a definition for Encyclopedic; "comprehending a wide variety of information; comprehensive".

<li>In a sports encyclopedia, yes. In a general-reference encyclopedia, no. Is a monthly sports scoresheet is what you would expect to find in an encyclopedia? Would Britannica carry a list of game results of all <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> games? I frankly think these types of information are suitable for world sporting championships, but for sporting events that occur every year, I guess this is too much. Would high school students research on the score of a Charlton-Wigan match? Perhaps what happened on the Juventus-Liverpool riot, but not necessarily the score of Wigan-Charlton matches (although I do think a list of historical scores of derbies will do). 12:25, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>So, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia about everything <i>but</i> sports, or what? I'm confused. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 14:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not that a Wikipedia is an encyclopedia about everything <i>but</i> sports, but you'd have to draw the line. Is a Wigan-Charlton match that important, say 10 years from now?

</li>
<li>No, not 'everything <i>but</i> sports', but I think the reasons for deletion are that it's according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, saying that WP is not a collection of indiscriminate information. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsanephantom_93dd.html" title="User:Insanephantom"><b><font color="#006040">Insane</font></b></a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInsanephantom_69e0.html" title="User talk:Insanephantom"><font color="#906C5A">phantom</font></a> 14:05, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And I would further <b>comment</b> that <i>encyclopedic</i> does not equal <i>everything about everything.</i> I continue to feel that an article <b>about</b> the season, summarizing competitions, developments, overturns, <i>whatever,</i> would be encyclopedic. One critieria I use is "effort in writing," not to be confused with effort in <i>formatting.</i> IOW, if you spend an hour writing a narrative description of the season, fine. If you spent an hour copying results data in to a table, with no editorial discrimination, it's "almanac-like," and deviating from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. (BTW, I'm presuming that each of these pages has — or will have — <b>verifiable information</b> with references to back it up.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Wikipedia isn't an all-soccer-related website, especially statistics of every match in history of football. I think an article for a season is enough. I can't imagine if after a lot of years we have such statistics for every month or such statistics of 20 years ago. And there is also danger to have such detailed information for every league in the world! --<a href="../../../k/r/b/User%7EKRBN_3818.html" title="User:KRBN">KRBN</a> 13:17, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thing is, we don't have a summary of the results in the article for the season, so we need to merge the results to a page, in my opinion. And I suppose it's fine to have results of notable leagues (such as the English one)?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I believe that just a results table isn't enough. That's why these results pages were created, I think. Readers would expect maybe a brief summary of the game when they click on the wikilinks (which link to the results pages). Without these results pages, readers wanting to know about how the games went on would (maybe) be upset because the timelines of the games are gone.

<p>The entire article is just a list, and likely will never be more than that. There is also no discussion or context provided by the article, and a number of the individuals on the list do not have more than a stub's worth of information in their own articles, or no article at all. Thus, the list by itself will not be helpful to many readers. Providing this information in this form doesn't seem encyclopedic given <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - seems to be a term that might be gaining in usage, but to qualify as a neologism that's notable enough for Wikipedia, there needs to be some secondary sources that discuss the use of the term (rather than articles that make a passing usage of the term).

<p>Not noteworthy</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per above. With regard to the no doubt large number of mast enthusiasts who will suggest keep let me remind you of <a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">WP:NBD</a>. The "consensus" that will be brought up is from January 2006. The recent deletion of a large number of US masts clearly demonstrates our current attitude towards these articles. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 22:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not so sure. There has been one strong dissenting voice on the recent US mast nominations, and the even more recent ones in the UK (26th) are contested leaning towards keep. My own view has changed. I now believe if the article is nothing but a stub giving height and location then it should go; at worst it takes a few minutes to recreate. But if someone has added a photo and has something interesting to say about notability then I lean towards keep. They are likely to be local landmarks. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 22:46, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that we should be careful about possible trainwrecks here. A picture does not grant notability, the fact that a particular mast has played some important role may. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 22:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're correct, but a photo does indicate that someone's interested in the mast in question, making it that much more likely to be expanded beyond raw information. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:52, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. Anyone who lives near to or goes to the location can take a photo, and still does not guarantee an encyclopaedic article. Please bear in mind that the Wikipedia test per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is that the "<i>subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself</i>". <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think you are more right when bringing up <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> which also supports the merge argument for the notable masts and in any case would have reduced this to a content dispute within another article rather than an AfD. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:15, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> These fungible utilitarian structures lack multiple sources to show they are notable. Being in a database of masts, or someone taking pictures of it, does not make it notable. I could take pictures of the mailbox at the corner and enter data from a database of mailboxes, but it would still be a non-notable mailbox.

<p>This article was prodded a few days ago. I oppose the prod, but I would like to get some consensus or precedent on this, as there are already many such articles on wikipedia, and many more are created as we speak. That is why I am moving this to AfD. The concern raised in the prod was "Has not been continued throughout the season. Wikipedia is not a collection of information and is not a football results database". I believe that the article adds to the encyclopedic content of wikipedia. It provides an overview of results, goal scorers, winning streaks, losing streaks, etcetera. As such, it provides documented data, which others can use for whatever they need it for. This discussion should probably also cover Football League Championship results September 2006. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 00:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - article is a stub, and could do with a rewrite, but it seems odd that we should be looking to delete the article of a large church in a large city. As per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>, a better course of action would be to tag with {{<a href="../../../l/o/c/Template%7ELocal_b40a.html" title="Template:Local">local</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}} in the first instance to allow someone with more local knowledge to expand the article, rather than to go straight to an AFD. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">robwingfield</a>&#160;<sup>«<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">T</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robwingfield_5b3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robwingfield">C</a>»</sup> 20:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, to clarify further, you tagged for speedy delete rather than take a more constructive approach. You've now nominated for deletion. That's what I mean by "straight to AFD". You haven't attempted to improve the article, or encourage others to do so. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">robwingfield</a>&#160;<sup>«<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">T</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robwingfield_5b3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robwingfield">C</a>»</sup> 20:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Robwingfield: this unfortunately appears to be Nuttah68's <i>modus operandi</i>. The extent of contributions are a list of speedy deletes followed by AFD if the speedy doesn't take hold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nuttah68" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nuttah68" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Further, despite repeated requests (see <a href="../../../n/u/t/User_talk%7ENuttah68_269b.html" title="User talk:Nuttah68">User_talk:Nuttah68</a>) of the value of <b>"common courtesy,"</b> this user does not notify the author(s) of attempts to delete said articles. Per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a>, <i>"It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the article that you are nominating the article."</i> It might be that it is easier for some to delete articles rather than attempt to improve articles for the good of the community.

<dd>Lists can give you a snippet on each person so you can find out if you want to learn more. Like say you see a name on a list that says "She was in XYZ movie" and you go "Oh yeah I remember her." You may not remember her name on its own. Likewise it allows for expansion on neglected areas.

<dd>No problem. I kind of like working on lists here. Although there has been lists I went against. Like if the topic would not be worthy of an article in itself, can never be verified, or is based on a very subjective or POV bias. (Like a hypothetical "List of Jamaican haberdashers" on the first, List of virgins being an actual example of the second, and "List of people who. were ugly as babies" as a made-up one on the third)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>do not delete</b> this is of importance to the people of LOMALOMA TIKINA TO WHO THIS HISTORY BELONGS please also note my entry on the Turaga Na Rasau "Ai Cavuti vaka tikina" lists the "Turaga na Ravunisa" wrongly as when it was written there was a period between when Ratu Viliam Fonolahi died and then when Ratu Keni was then nominated by the Vanua of LOMALOMA THE LAU PROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND THE FIJIAN AFFAIRS BOARD WHO HAVE RECORDS AND WILL CONFIRM THIS, THIS IS A LONG ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND REQUIRES THE SIGNTURES OF ALL THE CHIEFLY FAMILY OF VALELEVU OF LOMALOMA TIKINA this process has already been completed. and the traditional installation would have taken place this year but current political events have changed this and next year looks like a more likely period. there are also early records that are kept by the Fijian affairs board also records in the "Au vola ni kawa bula" (the book holds all the records of titles and title holders and villages and their various families) at the Fijian affairs board which will confirm the soverenty of the "Turaga Na Rasau" please contact them direct before considering this and related articles for deletion. Actually all titles and articles on Fiji should be confirmed by the FAB (Fijian Affairs Board) and the variuos provincial councils to which they belong. many people entering information regarding Fijian traditional titles and history on wikipedia do not have expressed permission of the provinicial councils and the Fijian affairs board and therefore should all be re-considered and reviewed pending the endorsement of the respective councils and Tikinas to which this history and information belongs and it should be endorsed by the Great Council of Chiefs not just of one or two books written by individuals or one or two independant sources Thank you FROM USER MAIKELI <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikeli_7ec6.html" title="User:Maikeli">Maikeli</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/i/User_talk%7EMaikeli_f1b9.html" title="User talk:Maikeli">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maikeli_c2f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maikeli">contribs</a>).</small> 16:18, 2006 December 27

<li><b>Keep the page.</b> I am new to adding to / editing Wikipedia, but I am a long time user and fan of the site. I created the page about The Shire in Bend, Oregon. It is true that The Shire in Bend is a small development in a small town. But what warrants "notability" if not an unsolicited interview on the BBC, an unsolicited interview with The Economist, unsolicited interviews with various newspapers in the US and Canada who then feature The Shire in print, blogs around the world talking about The Shire, and a consistent #1 return on Google without a paid adword, etc? No advertising has been paid for, yet people are talking about The Shire located in little old Bend, Oregon. I agree that the writing needs to be improved. I am working on better copy for the page. Rather than deleting the page, keep it up and give me (and others) time to improve the content. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bendshire (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBendshire_9f85.html" title="User talk:Bendshire">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bendshire_86da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bendshire">contribs</a>) 09:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> AfD is not cleanup, so the quality of this article (which is indeed poor) should not be a factor. The development does seem reasonable notable though, considering the multiple news reports. Maybe a merge to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bend%2C_Oregon_75cc.html" title="Bend, Oregon">Bend, Oregon</a> though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:41, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I have likewise been in print, been interviewed and been on TV. That doesn't make me <i>prima facie</i> notable. Probably there'd be some press coverage if I named a housing development "Dick Cheney Must Be Set On Fire Village" or "George Bush Is The Son Of God Tower," but I don't see why this outfit's self-promotion and unsourced assertions should get any more space than I would. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, give way more details, and clean up. The biggest problem I have with this article is that, while it certainly asserts notability, it <i>doesn't actually say precisely what this is</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, even giving the benefit of the doubt that <i>"over two million maps...have been created"</i> is an assertion of notability, the only sources are the site itself and a Wikipedia mirror of the previously speedied article.

<li><b>Keep and stubify</b>, 6M+ google hits, and it's pretty clear from even a cursory examination of those that it's gotten fairly widespread use and recognition.

<li><b>Delete without prejudice against recreation</b> This article is spam, does not assert notability, and shows no third-party coverage.

<li><b>Comment</b> My concern about this approach is that it creates a lot of wasted effort. Why not leave it and give some editors an opportunity to make the article better?

<li>But then it's still an advertisement.

<li>Calling it an advert is still a bit of a subjective judgement, but you could address that by marking it with {{advert}}. I'm not sure it's reasonable to compare it to <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> which has had the benefit of a long period of editing, versus this relatively new article which probably should get the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to improve. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>6M Ghits just suggests to me a notability of near-obviousness. Yes, the article can be improved. Continuously deleting it will never give it that chance. Stubify, mark as unsourced if needed, and let it be and see how it fares after a few months. As with many of these cases, time spent in AfD debates is better spent improving articles. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Counting Google hits is not research, and Google hits are not a measure of notability.

You've put the name into the search engine. What sources did Google turn up for you? How much time have you spent responding with fallacious arguments based upon nothing but counting hits that you could have spent simply citing what Google turned up when you did your search?

<li>You have plenty of time in 5 days to do so over this AFD run. If the article can not be cleaned up in that time, it most likely never will. It's had how long to be cleaned up and it hasn't? At some point you have to put your foot down and say, "Source it, clean it up, and make it encyclopedic" You are right, time spend in AfD debates can be spent improving articles. If you feel so strongly to keep it, then heed your own advice and improve the article. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. <b>AFD is not a vote.</b> If you're arguing to keep something, you have to say <i>why</i> - you can't just go "keep" or "keep, it exists". Even discounting those "votes", it is impossible to determine a consensus to do anything here. Nonetheless, the article has POV problems, and these need to be dealt with as soon as possible, or the article may be renominated. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 23:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Actually, it's not a problem of sourcing (it's not too difficult to prove the existence of most of stated instances of crimes): the article tries (and certainly would continue, if the future permits) to establish the common link between all crimes commited against an ethnic group — that link, inferred or spelled out, is the hint to the eternal hate of Our Evil Neighbours against Poor Us.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The topic is notable enough and the article is well-sourced. Although the title might not be used that frequently, the subject it refers to a well-known topic.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. the nomination is misguided: the nominator ironically says <i>the eternal hate of Our Evil Neighbours against Poor Us.</i> He confuses two issues: whether the "eternal hate" exists with whether "some think that the ethernal hate exists".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If there are balance/NPOV problems with the article or if it needs more of an academic/historical perspective, this should be corrected through cleanup not outright deletion. There is evidence that, besides any historical incidents "anti-Serbism", the specific term of "Serbophobia" is at least encyclopedically notable for being a key term in the historical discourse of Serbian nationalism <i>as used by Serbian nationalists themselves</i> both during the 1990s wars in the Former Yugoslavia (and since) and as part of the internal tensions of Yugoslavia when it still existed as a functioning Communist state. Non-trivial examples of its use can be found at the level of governmental relations, academic institutions, party politics and international relations in recent decades. (I don't know what the phrase is in Serbo-Croat, but "Serbo-Croat" is used by reliable direct English translation sources). The term then is important for understanding the history of late 20th century Serbian nationalism. (There was also an inaccessible references from google books search that on the face of the listed search description suggested the term may have been around during the beginning of the First World War)</li>

I don't see any of those references Bwithh produces being 'non-trivial references' - simply mentioning the word is not the same as a legitimate source <i>about</i> the term and its connotations. When the topic is as loaded with POV warriors on both sides, all we can do is be stringent in requiring decent references and do our best to maintain a neutral perspective, stating the facts and not attempting to draw any form of conclusion. Unfortunately, none of the references that are provided are anything other than uses of the term, and the extrapolation of these, as well as being used to push nationalistic propaganda (and the other 'side' to this are no better), is tantamount to original research as well as being a hopeless and counterproductive POV fest. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 23:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Excellent catch, and a good book, on the first sight. Now, if we had an article <i>akin</i> or <i>summarizing</i> the Macdonald's book, which goes into the great detail of the conflict and its history, causes, related myths, propaganda, etc. I'd be perfectly happy. But that's not what we have, and we're very far from that. Like I said on AN/I, having a "Serbo-Croatian relations", "Serbo-Bosniak relations" or like could be a good thing potentially, as it would enable to <i>contextualize</i> the phobias and give an outline of thoughts and actions of both sides in proper historic contexts. What we have here, though, are lists of misdeeds without context, hinting at presupposed phobias and hatred by the neighbors as the reason for the conflict. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 13:58, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment - Leaning towards Weak Keep</b> - Neologism or not "serbophobia" is a notable term, even outside Serbia. Having lived very closely from Greece (Greek medias were very interested in these events; sometimes in a pro-Serbian POV way) the tense days of the Bosnian War and of the NATO air strikes in Kosovo, I do know that this term was notable in my country. So, the argument of not-notability is not convincing for me. Now, the POV and edit-wars concerns are important. But are these reasons strong enough in order to delete a notable article which has been in Wikipedia for more than one year and has survived three (or four?) previous nominations? I'm not sure. My experience in Wikipedia has taught me that we should try to resolve POV and edit conflicts, and not just delete notable articles, when such problems appear. Tag the article as POV if necessary! On the other side, maybe Eusebeus has understood better than anyone here the essence of this article's problems. He had said in a previous nomination and I quote: "The attempt to accommodate NPOV and OR objections has stripped it of any value and the content has moved from the encyclopedic to the ridiculous. This is choir-preaching and it seems to me that no one stumbling across this would be able to make much sense if it one way or the other. Articles that become subject to such disputes usually make themselves irrelevant in this way". As it is now the article tends indeed to become irrelevant, and, therefore, deletion will soon be indifferent.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 12:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - there is an immense number of possible phobias and every ethnic or other group has its own "phobia", mostly in sporadic use (notable exception being the antisemitism and perhaps a few others).

While I don't have a global strategy at the moment, a better approach could be to establish few precedents, formulate a kind of guideline on the basis of that, then apply the principle everywhere it's applicable.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the fact that this article is being nominated for a fourth time (!) should be enough to keep it.

<dd>The redirect from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">serbophobia</a> would I think be sufficient in this case.

I think a consonant example is the article for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>--which is <i>strictly</i> about the neologism itself (if <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">serbophobia</a> were so amended, I'd be fine with that--and then then sister article for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">anti-Arabism</a>, which discusses the conceptual prejudice against Arabs contained within the neologism <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 18:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already knew that and, as usual, you're missing the point. Krleža used the word a few times, but never in the sense of some wide-spread and established phobia as you're trying to portray here. The "Serbophobia" Krleža talked of (or rather, "mentioned") could be applied to any nation; a Croatian intellectual today in 2006 could just as easily combine "Bosniaks" and "phobia" to create "Bosniakophobia." He could then even use the word in some interview, but this would hardly make it a subject of encyclopedic value. If you still disagree, could you please provide examples of other Croatian intellectuals using Serbophobia during this time period? I mean, surely your mention of Krleža is simply one part of a complex argument grounded on an impressive knowledge of early Yugoslav political circles - it's not as if you simply took the information from Mir Harven and then tried to twist it to suit your goals. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 23:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

I didn't get this information from "Mir Harven" but from the very article you're so anxious to have deleted.

<dd>1) Yes, the article should be deleted. 2) Krleza's occasional (i.e. sparse) mention of "Serbophobia" does not make it a term of encyclopedic value, and either way it is quite separate from the far more relevant (but equally worthless) definition of "Serbophobia" - the one invented in the 80s and the one that, after several months of existence, this article proves to consistently return to. 3) I have followed the article. In fact, apparently far closer (or more scrutinizingly) than you have, for I know that the brief mention of Krleža and Matoš was brought up by Mir Harven in discussion. If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't even have this pathetic excuse to fall back on; you'd simply resort to the same recycled greater Serbian garbage from earlier. 4.) I had read the article and I was just waiting for you to bring up Matoš. Nonetheless, I asked you for more than "one given" example, because I just don't believe that two brief mentions of a (then) utter neologism make it encyclopedic or give the later propaganda term some sort of historical foundation. 5) The good faith guideline does not require me to continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 20:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I explained reasons in in my comments above. To sum it up: notability of the sentiment and the word used to describe it seem fairly well established and that is not disputed by the nomination anyway. What is disputed, and what was the point of the HappyCamper's closure, is that "The article itself...is little more than a focus for edit warring...". I don't think that that should be reason for deletion of any article, ever. If edit warring and POV pushing is a problem, preventing edit warring and POV pushing is the solution, not deleting articles so that people would have nowhere to edit war. Heck, we could probably delete the article on Bush for the same reason. People who think that other articles would be a better solution should maybe try to write those other articles first and see how that comes out. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 16:43, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But in my opinion, you simply cannot compare the well-based history of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a> to the much more recent and somehow dubious term (and theories about) <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a>. You can say what you want, but the fact is that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> was a tragedy much more bigger to the Jews than <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasenovac.html" title="Jasenovac">Jasenovac</a> was to the Orthodox Yugoslavs. Besides, I ask myself how many people do believe in Serbophobia outside Serbia? Sometimes it’s seems to be more a case of Serbian ultra-nationalist sense of <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exceptionalism.html" title="Exceptionalism">exceptionalism</a> and auto-<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimization.html" title="Victimization">victimization</a>.--<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMaGioZal_830d.html" title="User:MaGioZal">MaGioZal</a> 11:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How many times do I have to repeat myself? The word has been used for decades, by Croats as well as Serbs. Try reading the other comments on the page. It has also been used by Western commentators:</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Friedman_9ada.html" title="Thomas Friedman">Thomas Friedman</a> (who himself has quite a little aversion towards "the Serbs") used the word Serbophobia in the New York Times <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FB385D0C728DDDA90994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FB385D0C728DDDA90994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>:</dd>
<dd><i>"But then the German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, acting on the long love affair between Germany and Croatia (and traditional German <b>Serbophobia</b>), told the E.C. that Germany would recognize Croatia by Christmas 1991 -- no matter what."</i> (TimesSelect membership required to read the article.)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, it's not a question of "belief", but sources - and there are many sources showing that the term has been relatively widely used for decades. Finally, your casual dismissal of a death camp for Serbs (whom you futher insult by only deigning to call them "Orthodox Yugoslavs"), is just the kind of comment that has no place in any civilised discussion. You don't need to care yourself, but I would appreciate some respect for the dead.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstavisti_9746.html" title="User:Estavisti">Еstavisti</a> 12:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I mean that I don't care what you think in private, just try to keep your ignorant views to yourself.

<li>As the writer of this article let me say first I clearly needed to do more research on creating a Wikipedia article before submitting. I am new to this as evidenced by I just made an edit to the article accidentally forgetting to sign in first. Having said that I did add more references for you to review but the problem is that although Mr. Hogan has done some work in traditional movie and theatrical acting, his main body of work and that which he is notable for is in the field of voice-over for television and radio advertising. Something that doesn't get you lots of google hits and entries in IMdb etc. Therefore references such as the IMdb one make him look like a minor player. In reality Mr. Hogan has been one of the top voice over actors in the advertising field for 30+ years. You can review the article for some of the famous commercials and advertising campaigns he has done. I daresay there is not a one of you who has not heard Mr. Hogan over and over again over the course of your lifetime (not to mention your parents). More importantly as Mr. Hogan has done and continues to do voice overs for many of the top brands in the US on the national level he has diverted untold millions of dollars of purchasing power to those companies. He rightfully has been called a "legend" by peers in his industry as evidenced by the fact he is called back for ads for major corporations over and over again to this day 30 years after he started in this industry. Again, this doesn't get you a lot of google hits but I think in terms of the effect on the public's buying habits and the culture of the advertising media it does make him notable. So please, all I ask is to take this into consideration. Please do me the favor to respond as to whether first you believe the basis of notability as outlined above has merit and if so whether I have presented enough evidence to show Mr. Hogan merits inclusion based upon this. I am certainly willing to keep working on the article to bring it up to your standards. Thank you. <a href="../../../w/b/k/User%7EWbking_21e0.html" title="User:Wbking">Wbking</a> 17:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as benefit of doubt. There are some subjects that, despite notability, will be intrinsically difficult digging up sources on.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I actually really like the videos but it doesn't seem notable enough to deserve its own article. Also there are just too many problems with the article itself.

<p>The page really isn't about Boulder opal itself, it is more about the region in which it is mined and the mining process. The discussion page even says that it is copy-and-pasted. I tried to wikify it, but realized that it really should be deleted. There was a bit of first-person writing that I removed, but there still might be POV that I missed. It's pretty much redundant with <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opal.html" title="Opal">Opal</a>. I think that this might be useful as a section under <a href="../../../o/p/a/Opal.html" title="Opal">Opal</a>, but does not deserve its own page. Maybe we could merge or redirect it. <a href="../../../s/b/r/User%7ESbrools_1fae.html" title="User:Sbrools"><b>Sbrools</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/b/r/User_talk%7ESbrools_398a.html" title="User talk:Sbrools"><b><font color="red">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sbrools_c965.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sbrools"><b><font color="green">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 17:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep &amp; provide sources</b> I think that the Kennedy/Goldwater connection lends some ironic notability. Coupled with his other exploits this seems to creep into notability.

<li>According to the article, Kennedy and Goldwater were associated with the Jay Six Ranch, not to Speiden personally.

<p>He is a real director - I have met him. His projects are also very real. Just because films are not released internationally or commercially, it does not mean that they don't exist. IMDB rejected Dingsdale's page because none of his projects have been released theatrically (to general audiences) or on general home video release. Deleting his page would be pointless.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm reasonably satisfied the bloke is real. I just see nothing to suggest he's <i>notable</i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. On the chance that in fact this might not be a case of a man-and-a-camera, I did some further checking on some of the details contained in both the two film articles and the main Dingsdale one. Here are some results: Ghits on "PBGA Film Syndicate," production company for <i>Last Evil</i> = 0. Second production company named, "UO Film Investors," Ghits = 0 (fuller name, "United Orme Film Investors"; Ghits = WP only). Of the <i>Evil</i> cast listed (the first two are the listed cast of <i>Sky Raiders</i>, as well), actor Andrew Etches appears to be a teenager in <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llandudno.html" title="Llandudno">Llandudno</a>, Dan Galston has Ghits only to the WP article and mirrors, and, while there is a UK musician named James Wilde (and an actor of the name had an uncredited role in a UK comedy and with it an IMDb page), there's also at least one online profile that hints that the person here may, too, be a Llandudno-based teen. In short, I don't think there's even enough here for a merge/redirect. Jamezcd, the originating editor of all three articles has himself said above that none of the director's projects have been released to general audiences, which about sums it up. Students having fun with a camera is great, but it's not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 03:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The picture Ghits on Andrew Etches and Dan Galston are very old photos which were included on a bio page on Global International's old website. When I say that the projects are unreleased, I meant that they were not in cinemas. They have been shown in screenings. Also, projects which Dingsdale worked on during his time as a professional editor have been released commercially.

<li>I don't think the {{Original Research}} tagging of the page is event justified; the issue seems to be more about a complain regarding the quality of the source that is used, rather than whether it truly qualifies as OR.

<dd>If the article was simply about a neologism, I might be inclined to agree; but the article appears to be a well-sourced article documenting the <i>phenomena.</i> If the article was renamed to "Roads with Incomplete Ramps" I doubt we'd be having this discussion (in which case perhaps only a rename, followed by a Redirect, is in order). On a related note, are you seriously announcing that as closing-admin you'll delete an article even in a case where the overwhelming plurality of AfD commenters have presented well-reasoned arguments in favor of keep (please don't present 'AfD is not a vote', which I don't think is the case here--because that reason is not synonymous with 'AfD is a way for admins to disregard comments and make up their own mind'). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 01:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not my major area of subject-matter expertise, so I don't know what print resources one would seek out to locate terminology of this nature. I could see a redirect to "stub ramp" (rather than vice versa) as an outcome here if that is used more commonly. But we are dealing with something that certainly exists, and is entitled to an article, irrespective of what it's called.</dd>
<dd>To overintellectualize this more than it might deserve, there are three separate issues here. One is whether the type of ramp described is entitled to its own article. The consensus is yes. Second is what to call the article. "Ghost ramp" seems to be supported by at least some non-Wikipedia sources; the term isn't a hoax or anything of that nature, even if no one has yet checked the Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Highway Terminology or whatever might exist for such a thing. Third is whether the listing of examples is accurate. The list itself seems to be reasonably sourced, and to the extent individual sources are inadequate they should evolve over time consistent with the standards applicable to other roads and highways articles.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I would like to think I am as strong a proponent of maintaining the standards of the encyclopedia as anyone, but I don't see a sufficiently serious violation of policy here to justify deleting against not just consensus but pretty much unanimity, and I will personally <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">climb the Reichstag dressed as Spider-Man</a> should you do so. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:25, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm pretty sure that we can find sources (newspaper articles, etc) that describe specific examples of the connecting road never being built.

<dd>Unused highway is a neologism in the sense of not being used anywhere to refer to these unused ramps. It is verifyable that there are web and print uses of "Ghost ramp" and "Stub ramp". The article refers to highway ramps, not highways as a whole. An unused or abandoned highway article is fine, but it's not a redo of this article. <b>Unused highway ramps</b> would be more more precisely aligned, but again, it's not what's used out there: people use "Ghost ramp" and "Stub ramp". Creating a new article title, even if it's self-evident, when that's not what is used in practice, is committing neologism. Please don't! Thanks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Florida_railroads_5e38.html" title="List of Florida railroads">list of Florida railroads</a> is a neologism? <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commuter_rail_in_North_America_e1dd.html" title="Commuter rail in North America">Commuter rail in North America</a> is a neologism? --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 00:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, because "railroad" and "commuter rail" are the standard terms used widely for those technologies. 'Unused highway ramp' has 7 ghits, none of which are official documents; '"Ghost ramp" freeway' 1,340, and '"stub ramp" freeway' 74. The only reason "stub ramp" is a valid option is that a couple of those hits are US state highway department publications, one of which I noted and cited in the article. Ghost ramp wins. The term is past the line from mere neologism into common usage, even if it is not verifyably referenced yet. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? "Unused" and "highway" are common words, just as "commuter rail" and "North America" are. "Ghost ramp", on the other hand, would mean a sloped surface related to ghosts, unless someone can find a reliable source that says otherwise. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 03:04, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am backing NE2 on the neologism issue. Unused is defined as something that is "not yet used" or "not finished." Highway is defined as "road or way open to the use of the public." Combine the two and you have: "Not finished road (snip)." Not hard to determine that from those two words, and from the contributions and the widespread use, it's appearant others have no problems putting two and two together. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 04:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - What the article describes is real; I've seen them. The instances are slowly being sourced. We should not delete articles over a concern over the article title.

<li><b>Comment</b>: So is the issue now not on full deletion but on moving the article to a more appropriate name and adding sources? If so, the topic shifts away from one that isn't pertant to Wikipedia to one that can be improved upon; this AFD should be closed and a more detailed discussion regarding the name and sourcing should be instigated. Having an AFD looming over isn't very conductive to conversations on naming, etc. if one thinks that it has a chance of failing IMO. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 04:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't get the site to work right now (I hope it does, I heard a song the other night that I forgot the name of), but I think if we can show that it's been played in a way that isn't on a specialty show, we'd be in good shape. <a href="http://www.dogstarradio.com/search_playlist.php?artist=blak+jak&amp;month=&amp;date=&amp;title=&amp;shour=&amp;sampm=&amp;stz=&amp;channel=&amp;ehour=&amp;eampm=" class="external text" title="http://www.dogstarradio.com/search_playlist.php?artist=blak+jak&amp;month=&amp;date=&amp;title=&amp;shour=&amp;sampm=&amp;stz=&amp;channel=&amp;ehour=&amp;eampm=" rel="nofollow">DogStar Radio.com</a> is the one I've been using, and it shows multiple plays on the hip-hop station.

<p>This article was originally Prod'ed by myself, but the originating editor removed the tag without explanation (although he did put a message on my talk page asking me to help him improve the article). Another editor then re-prod'ed the article and the originating editor again removed the tag. I am therefore bringing the debate to AfD. My original reason for Prod'ing the article was that I feel that, given the general quality of football in Wales, a village team that plays in one of the amateur county leagues (four levels below the League of Wales) is not notable <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 21:03, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Currently no sources are cited in the article. The article claims that the show's format has been copied in other countries. I would say that if sources could be found to verify that and some other claims; then notability would be established. As for the copyvio concerns; the talk page of the article says that the show's staff wrote the page the article was copied from, and that they are the same ones contributing the article. The source website doesn't have any sort of copyright notice, so my guess is that they are agreeing to the GFDL by posting it here, negating the copyright worries. The thing that that leaves me with is <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest concerns</a>. However, <b>if</b> they can source their information to reliable published sources, then POV problems can be cleaned up later. Assuming the article evolves during the AFD to be sourced, then I see no reason it shouldn't be <s><b>kept</b></s>. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 16:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(The following comment copied from the AFD talk page)Many of the facts posted in this wiki we are posting from our own memories although there is an article written by the Daily Camera ( local newspaper) about Basementalism that contained many of these facts as well, though they were given to the reporter from us over the course of interviews.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> The article has changed somewhat from the original version. It now cites some sources (though the citations are not in line), at least one of which can be considered a reliable source which is independant of the article subject. However, it only cites 3 sources total, and one of them is still the history on the Basementalism website. I'd like to see more independant sources cited. I've gone over the article and tried to reduce the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a> problems, copy-edited it, and wikified it; but it still needs more clean up. I'm not sure why this AFD's still open; usually they are closed after 5 days and it's now been 8. The concensus seems to be at this point to <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">merge</a> the information into the article about the radio station, and if you can't find more sources that are independent of the show and station themselves, then that's what I would recomend doing at this point. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 20:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would urge the two of you who said are pushing for a deletion because it's simply a "radio show on a university station" to read the entry a little more thoroughly. Basementalism is also a record label and promotions company.</p>
<p>Also there is no school paper linked as a ciatation. The Daily Camera is a Colorado newspaper, as is the Westword. Neither one of them are affiliated with the University Of Colorado. They are both reliable sources. If you like, I will remove the citation of the Basementalism website. Although the website's history section contains much of the same information found in the other two articles.</p>
<p>I don't think that adding all of the Basementalism info to the KVCU page is a good idea because KVCU has several specialty shows and should they all decide to start making entries it will create a logjam on the KVCU entry that is probably not all that worthy of multiple entries and links. We started the Basementalism entry not to promote the radio show but to give a history on Basementalism's place in the hip hop community in Colorado, the United States, and beyond. Calling what Basementalism is now "something that we just made up in school" is insulting, a.) because we, the people working on this entry did not make it up and b.) it has become far more than just a college radio show.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your input and I look forward to working with you.</p>

<p>Actually the Daily Camera is based out of Boulder, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And aren't most newspapers local papers? Does each article have to be from USAToday or the AP? It doesn't say that in the rules anywhere. I have to be honest I'm very suprised that so many of you want to delete this entry. The articles do explain the history of the station as well as the show and the facts that are explained in the entry, what does it matter if the papers are based out of the same state?

<li>I'm inclined to believe the latter, since most references are to or rehashes of that one press release, and appear to have come out around that time. If this was a reality (or at the least, a legitimate topic for an article, i.e. a notable hoax), I'm sure more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> would be found, not limited to that one week period around April 1. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 23:20, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>CONFUSED, wait</b>. This smells hoaxy, as stated above. HOWEVER, there are also signs that it is either real, or a hoax so elaborate that it is worth exposing.

Wikipedia should probably have articles on both, since they both appear to meet inclusion criteria.

<ul>
<li>You are misunderstanding WP:CORP - when it says "the published works", it means the works that are being used to establish notability. Nobody from Stardock wrote the material that is used as references within the article - just the article itself. The latter is only a problem because people closely involved with a topic are considered <i>more likely</i> to make contributions that result in non-neutral articles - hence the guideline against making such contributions. If it <i>is</i> a bad article, then it should get deleted whoever wrote it. Conversely, if it's not, it shouldn't. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 03:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your opinion may be strongly biased here. Additionally, if <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> should not be enough, it additionally violates <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.

<li>I've not seen the MaxiVista article - I am not an administrator here, and do not have access to deleted revisions. However, reading through the deletion discussion, there seem to be several reasons proposed for its deletion, some of which ("promotional" phrasing, attempts to keep mentions of other products out of the article) may have only applied to that particular instance of the article, or to the actions of certain editors over a certain period. What I would suggest is that you create a copy of the article that you would <i>like</i> to be there at User:Merithb/MaxiVista, and then invite others to consider it at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>. If it is well-written, contains appropriate references to demonstrate the notability of the product, and if you can assure the community that the other problems highlighted in the initial deletion ("references to competing products, alternatives or even the general kvm page are frequently removed by company officials", and possibly <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> issues) will no longer occur, then you have a strong chance of being be able to overturn the deletion at review. Taking it to review has already been suggested by <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> at <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerithb_503a.html" title="User talk:Merithb">your talk page</a>, and he offered some help in doing so. You don't have to create the copy of the article first, but doing so may improve your chances, as people will be far more likely to believe that a neutral article can be written if it already <i>has</i> been written.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 18:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
