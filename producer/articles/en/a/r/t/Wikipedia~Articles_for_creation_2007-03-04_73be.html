<p><br />
Emily, born October 24th, 1989 and Manuela born February 20th 1989 in Detroit, Michigan have been best of friends for 10 years. They met in ZHP (polish scouting org.) as little girls that didnt talk much to each other out of being shy. They soon started talking to each other and found out they had many things in common. They both decided to take a trip to Poland the summer of 2004 together also with Manuela's twin brothers. During this time they really bonded. This trip was beyond amazing. "AMAZING, one of the best trips i took with you (Emily) and full of adventures." says Manuela to Emily.</p>
<pre>
They were  with Manuela's family for a week, then spent two weeks among other polish scouters at Zlot. There were a lot of new people met within those two weeks, in which Manuela and Emily were sadly seperated and rarly saw each other. After those two weeks Emily spent a week with her family and Manuela went back to hers. Emily was very upset she had to be yet anouther week she explains to <i>Crazy Sources</i> Emily and Manuela were reunited again when she went to Manuela's family's house again in Poland for a half a week. There are too many memories to  write of that summer, "It was truly an amazing trip i wouldn't change a thing, besides being with Manuela more." Emily adds. 
</pre>
<p>Anouther scout related trip they took was to Maryland in the summer of 2006. The 13 hour bus ride was spent together side by side. Which included many fun road trip memories and sleeping 5 minutes long, while the rest of the bus slept the whole time. Within the bus ride it also included fun times of their summmer song "Boten Anna" by their favorite Swedish singer Basshunter. When asking Manuela about this trip she replies laughing "Um interesting,the sleeping on the bus,mcdonalds at 4, hot fun and yeah." She lists. When they reached Maryland, they again were seperated sadly but saw each other more constantly then the last time. Manuela and Emily spend as much time as possible together. The disadvantage is the distance of living so far apart. Mostly the only time they can see each other is thursday or other polish scouting events. "If it werent for Harcerstwo, (polish scouting) i don't know if we would of ever met, which would be a shame, i don't know what I'd do without her." Said Emily being gratefull." They love being together every chance possible and hope there will be more to come.They plan spending the summer of 2007 together and plan attending college together in the Fall of 2007 as roomates. They will be spending everyday and night together."It's very exciting." says Emily, "We try to see each other as often as possible and now we will see each other all the time and be able to catch up, i don't think we'll ever get sick of each other." That's good news for sure. Emily and Maneula talk every day either on the computer typing or on web cam or just using the microphone or a regular phone. They discuss many important issues to them which include gossiping, and talkign about British people. "12:00pm is our make fun of people hour" said Emily laughing. "We make each other smile and laugh, when we feel down we are there for each other." When asked if they ever get into fights Manuela responded by saying; "No. Unless that one time in bed."- referring to them sleeping in the same bed in Poland where they jokingly fought. Emily and Manuela laughed at the mention of this. "We are going to be 80 and still be laughing about our times together, everytime we are together is always a memory." Emily says smiling. Manuela adds by saying; "There fun and we just made our own fun. amazing." When asking about their future and if it is planned together, Manuela looks as if it is a stupid question and says "Yeah." Emily agrees with confidence;"Of course it is! I mean we're planning on the same college and have been planned for more than a couple years now that we will be neighbors and be at each others every life changing event. We are going to be old babcie (grandmas) going to Bialowieza (polish scouting camp in Michigan) watching our grand kids running around in their mundury (polish scouting uniforms)" As a closing statement they were asked for a quote describing their friendship. Manuela instantly replies ; "We kinda have this FRIENDSHIP were i can call her a BITCH and she can call me a SLUT but were still ♥ BESTFRIENDS♥."</p>
<pre>
WE now have the reason to believe Emily and Manuela will stay best friends forever.
</pre>
<p><br />
When leaving this interview they asked if they could make a "shout-out" to Minnie Quay, their favorite ghost friend from Bialowieza. "Minnie Quay is a Sexy Beast." They both said with pure delight. "We dressed like her for halloween, she's our best friend." Emily said jokingly laughing.</p>

<p>The Shakepseare Series consists of three books, The Shakespeare Stealer, The Shakespeare Scribe, and The Shakespeare Spy. The Books were written by Gary Blackwood, starting with The Shakepeare Stealer, in 1998.</p>
<p>The books are based to an audience of 9+, but may be enjoyed by teens, usually resulting in the want to read actual plays by Shakespeare. The content of the book is rather harmless, without cussing, or sexual content, but does contain drinking by the older men, and teens. There are scenes of sword fighting and does contain death, from swordfights and the black plague, for the book is set in the early 1600's.</p>

<p><b>The Shakepeare Stealer: SPOLIERS</b></p>
<p>Young Widge had been born into the world, without knowing his father, and his mother having died during his birth, an orphan. At a young age, he had been bought by Dr. Bright, the inventor of a writing called Swift Writing, allowing the writer to write as fast as someone could speak. The only reason he had been tooken in by the cold Doctor, was to learn this writing. When Widge had become 14, a man showed at Dr. Bright's home, and within only minutes, bought Widge and brought him to his own home. Widge was given the job to go and attend a play by William Shakepeare, and using the Swift Writing, copy the play down. Being that Widge had never seen a play, he often got to caught up in the play to actually write down most of it, and thus he had to go and attend the play once more. The second attempt lead him to being found out, and ended in him being tooken into Mr. Pope's home, so that he may have a home. Widge becomes a prentice, learning the ways of acting, and learning how to either get himself out of lying to the actors so much, or out of the fact he must return to his new master.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Shakespeare Scribe: SPOILERS</b></p>
<p>In the second book of The Shakespeare Series, Widge has escaped his master's graspe, and become a trusted member of Cross Keys. Only now the Black Plague has become a threat, leaving all theatres to close. The company travels from town to town, putting on plays for a small living. William Shakepeare finds himself in a reck, trying to write a play for the queen, but has a broken arm, meaning Widge has to help write the play.</p>
<p><b>The Shakespeare Spy: SPOILERS</b></p>
<p>The Third book of The Shakepeare Series has less of a plot, but a few in fact. The acting company Widge is with, has come to a dilema because someone is stealer their costumes and attempting to steal a play. The queen has become ill, leaving everyone in shambles, because the sure to be King has not one acting company in his homeland. Julia, a young girl pretending to be a boy in the first book, is in trouble and requires a hefty sum, but has not an address for it to be sent too. Many of the chracters in the book leave, to either better things or an after life. Widge finds himself a real name, and best of yet, a family he is sure to stay.</p>

<p>February 13, 2007 -- A recent downturn in the real estate market has prompted the creation of www.FreeTitleQuote.com, a consumer driven Web site for competitive pricing of title insurance.</p>
<pre>
By accessing FreeTitleQuote.com potential sellers and buyers have the opportunity to connect with title insurance companies across the country, so they can compare prices and save hundreds to even thousands of dollars -- while driving more business to those title insurance companies who sign up with us.   
</pre>
<p><br />
"Our goal is to help save home sellers and buyers hundreds to even thousands in title insurance costs," said Joshua C. Cahill, owner and creator of FreeTitleQuote.com. "By accessing FreeTitleQuote.com potential sellers and buyers have the opportunity to connect with title insurance companies across the country, so they can compare prices and save hundreds to even thousands of dollars -- while driving more business to those title insurance companies who sign up with us."</p>
<p>The Web site has formed in response to market demands brought on by a sluggish housing market, he added, in which home sales are down and more sellers are trying to save on title insurance and other closing-related fees.</p>
<p>www.FreeTitleQuote.com offers up to five free title insurance quotes for the consumer at absolutely no charge. There is no cost to join and, by shopping around for a title insurance company, home purchasers will save thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Title providers also benefit by signing up with FreeTitleQuote.com, a Web site that advertises on all the major search engines such as Google, Yahoo and MSN. Doing so means they receive scads of additional leads. There is no initial sign up fee and the first title lead is absolutely free of charge. Thousands of homeowners are online each day searching for competitive title insurance quotes. FreeTitleQuote.com connects reliable title insurance companies with these homeowners. The Web site already sends out hundreds of quotes each day. As a preferred title insurance provider, it matches the county of the homeowner to the provider's coverage area and sends them the contact information immediately so they can follow up and close the sale.</p>
<p>To learn more or to sign up, visit www.FreeTitleQuote.com.</p>
<p>About FreeTitleQuote.com: Joshua C. Cahill, decided to start up FreeTitleQuote.com because he believes the consumer has the right to price out competitive title insurance rates. The company is based in Lithia, Florida, and launched on January 22, 2007 It has already signed up more than 450 title insurance providers and typically issues hundreds of quotes each day.</p>

On March 2, 2007, the residents of State College, Pennsylvania celebrated St Patrick's Day on the wrong day. During the Spring 2007 semester at Pennsylvania State University, the school decided to schedule spring break to include St. Patrick's Day. Upon realizing the nature of this situation, several students banded together to form a group on Facebook.com with the intent of moving St. Patrick's Day to March 2nd. The movement was successful despite hurdles from the university and the township and March 2nd 2007 became State Patty's Day.</p>

<p>A Convicted Killer who denied any involvement in the murder of a woman Pedro Cruz Muniz, convicted by a Williamson County jury of killing a Southwestern University student in 1976, is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday in Huntsville.</p>
<p><br />
Muniz, 41, will the be the 1st person from Williamson County to be executed since the 1940s, authorities say.</p>
<p><br />
Muniz was sentenced to death in 1986 for the rape and bludgeoning of Janis Bickham, a 19-year-old freshman from Van Vleck in Matagorda County. Muniz, a Georgetown resident, told police that he grabbed Bickham from behind as she walked across a bridge that spans the North Fork of the San Gabriel River on the night of Dec. 20, 1976.</p>
<p><br />
A survey crew found Bickham's wallet, poncho shoes and Bible near the bridge the next morning. The discovery triggered a search that ended Dec. 22 when Bickham's nude body was discovered underneath a pile of limbs and leaves.</p>
<p><br />
"It was a cold, calculated crime -- the kind that is behind the reason we have the death penalty," said District Attorney Ken Anderson, who prosecuted Muniz in 1986. "This wasn't a matter of a fit of rage that lasted 30 seconds. It was an attack on a totally innocent stranger that lasted at least 30 minutes. And he had many opportunities to back out at any time."</p>
<p><br />
In his written confession, Muniz said he forced Bickham down to the river bank and into an abandoned tin building where he raped her and beat her until she was unconscious. He dragged her from the shed about 150 yards down the river bank, through thick brush, and pushed her against a fence.</p>
<p><br />
Bickham died from a fractured skull, caused by 5 blows to her head by someone wielding a large rock, an autopsy showed.</p>
<p><br />
Shoe prints found near Bickham's body matched the pattern on the bottom of Muniz's tennis shoes, and material scraped from her fingernails appeared to match the blue jeans Muniz was wearing that night. 1 witness said he saw Muniz following Bickham on the bridge, and another saw him walking out of the woods near the Blue Hole swimming area where her clothes were found.</p>
<p><br />
Lt. Robert Hernandez is the only officer still working for the Georgetown Police Department who was involved in the murder investigation. Muniz also had been charged with raping a Georgetown woman and was out on bond when he killed Bickham, Hernandez said.</p>
<p><br />
The rape was similar to the attack on Bickham in that Muniz grabbed a woman off the street and pulled her into some tall weeds, Hernandez said.</p>
<p><br />
"He beat up that girl real bad," Hernandez said. "She said she played dead and that's when he stopped beating her."</p>
<p><br />
Hernandez said he feels sorry for the family members Muniz leave behind. "But for what he did, I think he made his choice."</p>
<p><br />
Muniz's family did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
<p><br />
Former Georgetown officer Mike Loney said he is going to Huntsville to see Muniz's execution.</p>
<p><br />
"It's closure," Loney said. "I've seen what happened to (the Bickham) family and to other officers involved with this case. This will close it."</p>
<p><br />
Loney said Bickham's younger brother, Paul, who lives in Van Vleck, and her aunt and uncle are expected to be at the execution. Her father died a few years ago, and her mother is in a nursing home in poor health, Loney said.</p>
<p><br />
Muniz was first convicted of Bickham's killing in July 1977, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck down that verdict because Muniz was not warned that results of a psychiatric exam could be used against him. Anderson said the evidence, and brutality, led to his decision to pursue the death penalty.</p>
<p><br />
"You can't hear this evidence and not realize Pedro Muniz should not be put to death," Anderson said. "The facts were so horrible."</p>

WASHINGTON, D.C.:</p>
<p><br />
A federal law intended to speed the pace of executions does not restrict some claims by death-row inmates that they are too insane to be put to death, the Supreme Court said today.</p>
<p><br />
The court's 7-2 ruling in an Arizona case said inmates whose previous claims of insanity were dismissed as premature can raise the issue again when their execution is imminent.</p>
<p><br />
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act generally limits state inmates to one federal appeal. But the court said Ramon Martinez- Villareal's insanity claim should not be considered a 2nd appeal and therefore, is not barred by the federal law.</p>
<p><br />
"To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a 1st...petition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal...review," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.</p>
<p><br />
Today's ruling upheld a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that halted Martinez-Villareal's execution hours before it was to occur in May 1997 and gave him a chance to pursue his insanity claim.</p>
<p><br />
The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the execution of an insane person would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p><br />
Martinez-Villareal, a Mexican citizen, was convicted in Arizona of killing James Thomas McGrew and Fernando Estrada-Babichi in 1982. Prosecutors said he shot the 2 to prove his manhood.</p>
<p><br />
Other federal appeals by Martinez-Villareal had been rejected previously. His 1st federal appeal had tried to raise the insanity issue but it was dismissed as premature because no execution date had been set.</p>
<p><br />
When the claim was renewed, a federal judge ruled that under the new death penalty law, Martinez-Villareal must get approval from a federal appeals court to file a second appeal on the insanity issue.</p>
<p><br />
But the 9th Circuit court ruled that the federal law did not bar Martinez-Villareal from raising the insanity issue again, and the Supreme Court agreed.</p>
<p><br />
The inmate's 1st claim was dismissed as premature "because his execution was not imminent and therefore his competency to be executed could not be determined at that time," Rehnquist wrote.</p>
<p><br />
Because Martinez-Villareal did not get a ruling the 1st time he raised the insanity issue, his new claim cannot be considered a 2nd petition under federal law, Rehnquist said.</p>
<p><br />
His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</p>
<p><br />
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, contending the law bars inmates from filing claims that previously had been presented to a federal court.</p>
<p><br />
The case is Stewart vs. Martinez-Villareal, 97-300.</p>

<p>The bridge was built in 1928 and crosses the Maribyrnong River from Keilor East on the North side to Sunshine on the South side of the river. It is 54.6 metres above the river and 400 metres long, hence the Quarter Mile name. The girders were sunk up to 20 metres below ground level to obtain firm foundations for the concrete pedestals, onto which the big steel towers were erected. The bridge is noteworthy for its unusual K frame bracing. In its construction, 1,600 tons of steel and 6,000 cubic metres of concrete were used. Since standardisation of the Victoria/N.S.W. line, all Sydney trains cross the bridge. It is located near the E.J. Whitten Bridge on the Western Ring Road.</p>

<p>St Mary's Church, Billingshurst is an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> church in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billingshurst.html" title="Billingshurst">Billingshurst</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Sussex_237a.html" title="West Sussex">West Sussex</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. It is part of the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Chichester_e55b.html" title="Diocese of Chichester">Diocese of Chichester</a>.</p>
<p>The church building has been a focal point for Christian worship in the village for more than 800 years. The earliest parts of the church date back to the 12th century but it is likely that there was earlier occupation of the site. Over the centuries, there has been extensive development. The main feature of the nave is the fine 15th/16th century wagon roof with over 30 different designs of carved oak bosses, including the arms of the Percy, Beaufort and Neville families. The two tie beams may date from the 13th century. The spire, 120 feet high, was added to the tower in the 15th century. The eight sides are covered with wooden shingles.</p>
<p>Today, the church is made up of a congregation that is around 150 strong. There are four main services every Sunday: the 8:00am service is a traditional <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> service of Holy Communion; the 9:30am service is a traditional (sung) <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Worship_74eb.html" title="Common Worship">Common Worship</a> service of Holy Communion; the 11:00am service is an informal family-friendly service of worship, teaching and ministry; and the 6:30pm service varies from week to week.</p>

<p><b>Our Guardian the Wolf</b> <i>(Ow-ur GARD-E-un tha woo-lf)</i>, a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-hardcore.html" title="Post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a>/<a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive.html" title="Progressive">progressive</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> band, was formed in early 2007, formerly known as Before the War with members Tyler Wable (Vocals) and Daniel Kuzmenko (Guitar). Only a month after the creatin of Before the War, it ended as Tyler Wable and Daniel Kuzmenko quit. Without a singer and guitarist, things were looking bleak for Before the War.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of inactivity, Before the War inducted John Washer as their lead vocals. With a new "crew", a new name was needed. It took about a month to discover a new name. Before the War was then on known as Our Guardian the Wolf. After trying their bassist, Jacob Tyler on guitar, they decided to go with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guests_bf85.html" title="The Guests">The Guests</a>' bassist, Brendan O'Carroll. This has been the line-up since, it is supposedly supposed to stay that way.</p>
<p>With such influences as underOATH and Chiodos, Our Guardian the Wolf is something totally different from anything you have ever heard, wWith John Washer screaming and Darrell McLendon (Drums) singing. Cory Fischer will make your head explode in the pit with some of the most amazing breakdowns. And, Jacob Tyler and Brendan O'Carroll will have you tapping your foot and sweating. The term "everyone loves a guy with curly hair" takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to him.</p>
<p>Our Guardian the Wolf is rumored to be playing a show in May with A Plea for Purging and Sonset Down.</p>

<p>The Royal Hospital Haslar (RHH)is the name of the former Royal Naval Hospital founded on the same site in 1753. The RHH is the last owned acute hospital owned by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Together with Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust (PHT) it provides acute medical care to both military and local civilian populations. The hospital has continually been under threat of closure, which now seems iminant after the MOD pulls out of the hospital this year and PHT transfer services to Queen Alexandra Hospital in the next few years.</p>

<pre>
   It all started in October 1997 when my mom and I were making hair clips for me to wear to gymnastics. They were so pretty that I thought I could sell them.
</pre>
<pre>
   I wanted to use the money I earned so that I could buy teddy bears that I would give away to sick children fighting cancer.
</pre>
<pre>
   I began to sell my hair clips at my school. Since the teachers liked my clips, I decided to try to sell to even more people. So I went to a local store and was able to sell enough hairclips to buy 5 TayBears.
</pre>
<pre>
   I knew my business was very small. But I still needed to organize just like the big businesses. I had to know exactly where my money was being spent. So I learned some Quicken to keep better control of my money and went to the bank to get a business account. I learned that it is hard to start a business with very little money. I started to look at my expenses in a way that I could understand. For every $5 spent… that would be one child without a bear. So I am very careful with the money.
   When I started I didn't know anything about business. In school I was learning to add small numbers and stuff. That worked fine in the beginning. There were only small numbers to add. $2.50 per hair clip times 2 makes $5, and I could add by 5's pretty well. Then the numbers started getting bigger and I learned to add bigger numbers. It happened just like that.
</pre>
<pre>
   I just learned what I needed to know to be able to do what I needed to do when I needed to do it. I really have learned a lot about business since I started. I am always asking questions of my parents (and some very special grown-up mentors) about the best way to do stuff. I know I don't really know all that much stuff, I'm just learning. But I always try to do things the right way from the beginning. I think that's why I have been able to have TayBear grow to help so many kids.
</pre>
<pre>
   Pretty soon I found out that I couldn't keep up with the inventory. I knew that people wanted to buy my hair clips but I was selling them faster than I could make them. I needed help fast! So I asked my friends to help and I set up several "painting parties" at my house. Once word got out, I began setting up art classes in my school and in the community. I now have had over 1,600 kids that have helped me. Everybody has different skills… some paint, some stamp the cards and some help with folding fabric. I've even had some help me to sell the clips. I've sold over thousands and thousands of hair clips!
</pre>
<pre>
   My parents say that they want to make sure that my life is balanced. They always tell me that it is important to have a "good head" and a "good heart." I don't really think what I do with TayBear is all that special, it's just what I do.
</pre>

<p>Alyce is a very cool ginger person from Fulham Broadway, which is not so cool. She like to dress up as tribesmen and gnomes. She works in a cafe. She served Prince William. I bet you didn't know that. She forgets where she lives when she's drunk. Which is most of the time.</p>
<p>While some people may think that owning a pashmina qualifies one to be a sloane, Alyce does not and maintains her un-sloaneyness. She lies.</p>

<p>2) Surgical Hospital Leverages Expertise in Millennium Surgical to Economize Lincoln Surgical Hospital, located in Lincoln, Neb., wanted to efficiently utilize its resources. The facility, which conducts close to 10,000 procedures per year, delegated the procurement of surgical instruments to medical personnel without significant purchasing expertise, but still needed to make an effective transition. Furthermore, existing suppliers offered high-priced instruments with expensive mark-ups. Clinical director Jay Sveen leveraged Millennium Surgical Corp.'s expertise to ease the transition into the purchasing position, and eventually, to seamlessly delegate the position to other personnel Source <a href="http://www.surgicenteronline.com/hotnews/6ah41042996356.html" class="external free" title="http://www.surgicenteronline.com/hotnews/6ah41042996356.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.surgicenteronline.com/hotnews/6ah41042996356.html</a></p>

<p>4) Weigh instruments costs against patient safety. Although instrument sets can be a significant investment, the cost pales in comparison to the detriment associated with declining patient safety. Not only does this risk the patient health, but also the facility’s reputation, possibly leaving it vulnerable to lawsuits and compromised accreditation.</p>

<p>Formed in 1988 in London with the early line up of Andy Heintz (vocals), Tally (bass), Paul Scanlan (guitar), Lindy Reid (drums) and Roy Jenkins (drums). The band's music consisted of a fusion of Metal, Punk, Goth and Hardcore. The bands lyrics frequently concerned with religion, murder, vegetarianism and other social issues were satirical in nature and would see them repeatedly offend both the media and public.The band released their 1st E.P. 'Nailed Up For Nothing' on the House Of Dolls label in 1989. The 3 tracks being about Ted Bundy, Michael Ryan and teenage murder. By October 1989 the band had moved to Jungle Records for the 'Mug' E.P. This time the songs subject matter was predominantly religion. 1990 saw the release of what is their most well known record the 'Bark' E.P. which contained a cover of The Cure's 'A Forest' with a much heavier musical arrangement. This was the final release to feature Paul &amp; Lindy who left over musical/personal differences.The band quickly recruited Mario Figueiredo (guitar) and Richard Cordon (guitars) in time for the album 'Too Fat To Run, To Stupid To Hide'. Almost constantly playing live in London or nearby the band gained a cult following which lead to a support tour for Fields Of The Nephilim and the addiion of a 2nd drummer once again in the form of Des.The band returned in late 1990 and early 1991 with the E.P.'s 'Deadtime' and 'Ditch Dweller IV' the latter featuring a cover of The Sisters Of Mercy's Temple Of Love. 1992 saw the release of their 2nd album 'Guilt By Association' and the Headrush E.P. by which time Des had left to be replaced by Roger Hunt. The band then embarked on their 1st major European dates which resulted in some arrests whilst in Germany and the subsequent single 'Hamburg' which preceded the final studio album 'Chaos For The Converted'. The album was much darker in tone than anything they'd released before with more complex arrangements and a broadening of styles. By this time however the band were disintegrating and even the addition of violinist Ffion didn't change matters. The band played their final gig at The Venue in New Cross, London on March 3r 1995.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-04_73be.html" title="Edit section: Evan Weiner">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evan Weiner</span></h2>
<p>Janice630 23:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC) Evan Weiner (born April 2, 1956 in New York, NY) is an American journalist who covers the business and politics of sports. He is the author of "The Business and Politics of Sports."</p>
<p>Weiner is a columnist for the New York Sun, "The Business of Sport." He also is a contributor to msnbc.com and numerous newspapers and magazines around the United States. Between June 14, 1999 and June 23, 2006, he did a daily commentary for radio's Westwood One's Metro Network called "the Business of Sports." He is also a regular television and international radio guest discussing the connection between the United States Federal Government, state and local governments and sports owners. In 2005, Weiner was a recurring guest on Sam Donaldson's ABC News Now Internet program, "Politics Live." He is recognized as one of America's foremost authorities on sports business and is a regular on the college lecture circuit.</p>
<p><br />
The book, "The Business &amp; Politics of Sports" contains over 100 of Weiner's columns written between 1998 and 2005 that describe the power plays, media and political (federal, state and local) connections which rule the 19 billion dollar a year business of sports. At the heart of Evan Weiner's writing lies his belief that "it's great to watch a game and report on it, but democracy deserves more than a box score when it comes to scrutinizing the business of sports." "The public," Weiner suggests, "needs to be aware of the relationship between politics, government, the media and sports ownership. Americans generally view sports as fans and do not realize how many hundreds of millions of their tax dollars go to big sports." He calls upon editors and TV progrmmers to look at sports as more than an entertainment forum and opines that journalists also need to examine the sports industry because, "in the end, just about every American citizen has some money directly or indirectly invested in the sports industry." In The Business &amp; Politics of Sports Mr. Weiner's columns are divided into ten thematic chapters entitled Business, Colleges, Endorsement/Sponsorship, Labor, Events, Politics, Media, Stadiums, Olympics, and Fans and the Public. Laid out in an easy to read format, they progress in chronological order from 1998 to the present, showing the fascinating evolution of sports business. (1)</p>
<p><br />
Weiner contends that the mindset of newspaper and magazine editors, along with radio and TV programmers, is that sports are merely games, the toy store of life. He disagrees, “More than ever sports is a multi-billion dollar business with global implications. General Electric is spending billions of dollars so that its NBC-TV network can broadcast the 2010 and 2012 Olympics. Communities all over America have created special tax districts, raised hotel, motel rent-a-car, restaurant, cigarette and beer taxes to fund stadiums and arenas. Congress may take up discrimination legislation against men-only member golf courses, change tax exemption laws as they apply to companies that are Olympic sponsors, and legislate the boxing industry. The House Committee on Government Reform has held hearings on sports leagues drug testing, specifically testing for anabolic steroids. Those issues aren’t found in the sandbox or the playground.”</p>
<p>From locker rooms to boardrooms to hearing rooms, Weiner has covered the gritty, pragmatic, dollar driven sports industry by asking consistently probing, difficult and controversial questions. Along the way he has won two Associated Press awards for News Coverage in 1978 and 1979. As the worlds of sports, politics and business rapidly change and coalesce, Weiner, on a daily basis, speaks with the owners, players, lawyers and broadcasters responsible for this steamroller synergy.</p>
<p>At a time when the public’s opinion of the media is at an all time low, Weiner believes, “One by one, we as journalists have to rebuild the industry piece by piece. We have such a bad reputation now, we have to get out there and reassure people we are not all the Washington media.” A persistent reporter with a prodigious memory, Evan calls the shots as he sees them and describes the power plays, players and connections which rule the business of sports.

<p>Weiner received a Distinguished Journalist Award from the United States Sports Academy in 2003 and is a 1977 graduate of Ramapo College of New Jersey.</p>

<p>What People Are Saying About Evan Weiner’s Writing</p>
<p>“You always come up with a new angle that no one seems to hit upon.”</p>
<pre>
       —Ron Varrial, Sports Editor, Metro, New York
</pre>
<p>“Evan Weiner is a uniquely talented writer with an amazing ability to pull everything together for the reader. With his astonishing knowledge of and insight into the sports marketplace, he is able to investigate and simplify complex story lines through his award winning journalism. He is a strong voice and an expert in his field.”</p>
<pre>
       —Thomas P. Rosandich Ph.D., President &amp; CEO, United States Sports Academy
</pre>
<p>“We broadcast “The Business of Sports” as a feature in our local newscast as a good segue from our caller-driven talk show to our 6 PM sports talk show.”</p>
<pre>
       —Charles Geer, Program Director, WGNU, St. Louis
</pre>
<p>“Your stuff is good. What you need is for someone in a position of power with TV to take a shot with you and stand behind you. That person for Cosell was Roone Arledge. But there are no Arledge’s on the scene in television these days. Keep plugging and maybe that person will come along.”</p>
<pre>
       —Shelby Whitfield, author, broadcast executive and sports consultant.
</pre>
<p>“Evan Weiner presented a one credit mini-course. The material presented was provocative given that Mr. Weiner provides social, business and political commentary on the business of sports that is not typical of what is found in the mainstream media. Students indicated a high degree of learning.”</p>
<pre>
       —Joel Maxcy, Graduate Program Chair, Dept. of Sport Management &amp; Media, Ithaca College, Ithaca, New York (3)
