The Tornadocane was a hurricane shaped and tornadic supercell thunderstorm that took place on April 15, 1999 over Duplin County, North Carolina. Tornadocane is a portmanteau of the words hurricane and tornado due to the fact that the storm was hurricane shaped and was tornadic. This was one of the most unusual and bizarre supercell thunderstorms ever observed. The tornadoes spawned from this supercell did major damage and resulted in death along with a thirty mile damage track and a 165 M.P.H. wind gust. This wind gust is thought to have come from a direct hit to the anemometer by a tornado, making the tornado an F3. The reason this storm took on such an unusual shape was because the storm produced a gust front on its rear flank which triggered more storms to develop. These newly triggered storms, in combination with the frontal flank of the storm, curved into spiral bands which rotated and thus created the shape of a hurricane on the Doppler radar. Please note that this storm was not in any way related to a hurricane other than the fact that it was shaped similarly to one.</p>

<p>Concerning <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">heraldry</a> is important to know the basic principle that no <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_Arms_daf9.html" title="Coat of Arms">Coat of Arms</a> belongs to a whole surname; but only belongs to the family ennobled by the monarch, and no one else –even collateral relatives– is able to use it. So that, the image shown above, is only for curiosity. On this way, this emblem could be used by non-ennobled people (out of Minorca) without exclusive noblemen details: the shape of heraldic shield, the helmet and its accessories. On the other hand there is no prohibition on substitute the surname for the siver swan on blue field inside a seal, a circle, an oval, a rectangle, a square, etc.</p>

They release a demo on Tortuga Records available on cassette only. Shortly after Espo Records pressed the demo on 7" vinyl. The band then recorded an EP with East Coast Empire records called "Open Roads and Broken Dreams". By this time, Brendan Maguire had replaced Nick on guitar.<br />
The band went through a few drummers before settling on Bob Mahoney. From their EP the band received interest from various labels. They signed with Victory Records, and released a 7" titled "Everybodys Hero". Their first full length was released in 1999 and was titled "So Far From Home". The toured extensively throughout the states, and even played the last Ten Yard Fight show in Boston, MA. This was also the last show for original bassist, Dan Tammik.<br />
The band went on as a 4 piece, Maguire moving to bass, and continued to tour, and record yet another full length titled "Friend, Lies, and the End of the World". They opened for such acts as The Dropkick Murphys, Sick of It All, Madball, Sum 41, Earth Crisis, Misfits, and many many others.<br />
The band recorded a split release on Indecision Records with tourmates Buried Alive soon after. Then, and finally, a 4 song EP on Victory titled "The Transient Hearts". This was their last recording, and was limited to 4000 copies. Their final show was in Worcester, MA in 2003 with Some Kind of Hate, Most Precious Blood, Terror, The Promise, and Bane. They toured in over 15 countries, and 48 states.<br />
Bob Mahoney went on to play drums in the Boston hardcore band BANE. Chris Chasse went on to play guitar in the Chicago punk band RISE AGAINST. Ian Larrabee went on to start and sing in a band called STAND ACCUSED. Brendan Maguire now works for the Dropkick Murphys, and SICK OF IT ALL.<br /></p>

<p>Clea Bella is a 15 1/2" fashion doll similar to Gene Marshall, Madame Alexander's Alex, and Tonner's Tyler fashion dolls.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-18_22c3.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h3>
<p>Clea Bella is a theatre-based doll, created in 2001 by Christina "Bogie" Bougas, of the Bella! Productions Doll Company. Christina's love of theatre and dance inspired her to create a doll reflecting the grace, beauty and dignity of performing arts. The very first Clea Bella doll she sculpted was called "Peacock Paradise" and was an "en pointe" foot doll with straight, non-bending arms and legs. The doll featured theatrical style make-up, a blue and green dance costume with bird feathers, a matching headdress fashioned after the peacock's crest, white tights and pink en pointe ballet shoes. This was the original en pointe 16" dancer doll.</p>
<p>Clea Bella is the name of the main character doll, and is a shortening of her full name, Cleopatra Bellisimo. The doll's character is dubbed a "triple threat", as she can dance, sing and act equally well. The main drive of the Bella! Productions Doll Company is the story line behind each character, outfit and dressed doll. Each Bella! Productions product comes with a story card about that item, which allows collectors to fully immerse themselves in this world, if they choose.</p>

<p>The current style of articulated dolls features multiple points of articulation at the shoulders, waist, hips and knees. The dolls currently come in two body types: a "fashion foot" doll with arched feet for wearing high heeled shoes, and an en pointe style foot for wearing en pointe ballet shoes.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are two body constructions: The original style with non-bending straight legs and arms. They come in both the "fashion foot" and en pointe ballet foot styles. The doll bodies were made of plastic and their head molded of softer vinyl with rooted hair. Their legs were strung together with a rubber band joint in the hips, allowing for a large range of movement in the legs. These older dolls were produced from 2001 through 2004, and are still carried in many online stores.</p>
<p>In 2005, the company introduced their second body construction type, which was the first wave of articulated dolls, and featured bending knees that swivel, an improved rotational hip, and swivel waists which tilt slightly in all directions, offering a dropped-shoulder pose, as well as a more arched back for an arabesque pose for their ballet dancers.</p>
<p>The doll creators decided to change the construction material with these new articulated dolls and turned to rotomolding for the manufacture of their dolls in the softer vinyl material, allowing their dolls to be seamless.</p>
<p>At this time, they also introduced a new character, Clea Bella's best friend, DeeDee Hunt, a Native American doll of Haida Gwaii original. Clea and DeeDee share the same body type. The DeeDee character is not currently offered on an en pointe body.</p>

<p>In April 2007, Bella! Productions will debut their fully articulated doll body, featuring bending elbows and wrists. These dolls will have the same articulated lower-body type bodies introduced in 2005, and will be fully strung with elastic. This is the first vinyl doll to be strung instead of hard jointed.</p>
<p>Later in 2007, Bella! Productions plans to unveil two more characters: James Windslow, Clea Bella's love interest and archeologist, and his mother, Lady Windslow, a patronress of Clea Bella.</p>
<p>Clea Bella and friends have a stylish wardrobe in a variety of genres, from contemporary casual and formal to theatrical stage costumes.</p>

<pre>
     Conrad Savail, he was a leader of a tribe in northern Germany in the year 23 A.D. . 
</pre>
<p>He lead one of the first attacks on Rome and fled to the Gauls after battles.</p>
<pre>
 People who ever some him would say he was Asian by his eye slant, 
</pre>
<p>but he wore plate armor that he had taken off a Roman nobleman he had spiky hair, mostly because of the use of tree sap to comb his hair. In his small area he had defended decided to make a larger tribe and join forces with some Franco men in lower Gauls after an attack on Rome.</p>
<pre>
     Conrad after fighting the Romans was chased 
</pre>
<p>by his men after so many defeats they were outraged and betrayed him at his camp sight and poisoned his food. But, good thing for him he didn't eat it and threw it to his servant. Later his servant had died in a matter of minutes. But, his men then came to terms that if they wanted to get rid of him they would have to do it in battle.</p>
<pre>
     On Conrad Savails' last moments in battle attacking the Romans 
</pre>
<p>his Lords Knight then Ran by on his horse, Machuia and shived his sword in his stomach. In shock the king pulled the sword out and grabbed his bow to kill this knight and the archers on the surrounding buildings fired theres bows. Then Conrad Savails last words were "Why is the world so unfair." then after these words his body froze while he was siting open his horse. After this battle the Germanic tribe known as the Savailians joined with the Romans on the battle</p>

Joshingrahmites are an intelligent cult who believs we shall someday be "rescued" by the creator of the light. They have very little tolerance, ironically, fo sunlight. Joshingrahmites are peaceful and beautiful people whose beliefs in mankind are skeptical yet optimistic. The environmental status of the universe is of little concern to these cheerful, at worst, people. They believe in doing what is right for you is the right thing to do, as long as no physical harm is done to others. Mental damage caused by an "Ingy" is said to be the fault of the one suffering, for they are not strong enough and should not should not have put themselves in the way of such harmful possibilities. It is a way of life many try to achieve but few are able.</p>

<p>Since their humble beginnings they have been the without a doubt largest and greatest band of all time.A band so great not even words can describe them, maybe with the exception of the word: MEGAAWESOMEORGANZANGERZONEORGANPSYCHEDELICORGANCOLLOSALCHUCKNORRISGREATESTBANDOFALLTIME, but even then it still will never even come close to properly describing how great The Organstra truly is.</p>
<p>With a whopping 77 million members the band have a unique sound which can only be created properly with a minimum of 50 million members, so avoid all imitators like Joel and the Nazi variety hour, for lets face it noone can possibly try and emulate the Organstra using only a kazoo, three bottles and Joel's 24/7 bad smell (similar to shit).</p>
<p>The Organstra was formed in 51 BC by stupidly/amazingly talented chums; Chris Campion and Sam Wightman, and almost immediately rivalled the Roman Empire for sheer power. This sentence you are currently reading does not need to be here but it is anyway. Over the past 2,057 years some 48 billion people have gone through The Organstra's ranks. The Organstra has featured many different celebrities throughout time, including:</p>
<p>Chuck Norris Abraham Lincoln Batman Your Mum Woon Kim His Mum The Incredible Hulk Iggy Pop All of Jefferson Airplane James Brown John Howard (Fired the day he joined by the rest of the band) Shane Warn (Cricket is shit) The Spice Girls 50 Cent (Killed by Sam) Eminem (Killed by Sam) Puff Daddy (Killed by Sam) Snoop Dogg (Killed by Sam) P. Diddy (Killed by Sam) Jay-Z (Killed by Sam) All of Cock Sparrer (Joined to breifly to record an ORGANized version of "Droogs Don't Run") JFK CIA KFC FBI USA IRA AUS Bill Clinton Johnny Ramone Johnny Thunders Johnny Depp Johnny Rotten Johnny Knoxville John Lennon John Entwistle John Paul Jones Pope John Paul (It's argued that the real reason he died, was because he was trying to impress Chris, and jumped off Chris's 9 story Mega Death Church Organ of Collosal Massacre)</p>

<p>In 1967, The Organstra chose to work with mediocre pop band "The Beatles"(For no other reason apart from just doing it to humour the clearly TALENTLESS band) on a concept album to be titled: "Vinnie fights the Mighty Deathbots of ultimate death all the while doing other badass shit, like eating, crapping, running, jogging, walking, walking slightly faster, walking pretty fast but not fast enough to constitute running OR EVEN jogging." Tension arose immediately when after their first meeting the boyishly handsome CHRIS CAMPION drew attention to Paul McCartney clearly girlish appearance, record states his exact words were: "Woah, you look like a chick...Make me a sandwich" But the tension truely rose when Sam Wightman (as a joke) traveled to the future and killed John Lennon (and alot of other people who were annoying him at the time), with a wet and very humourously sized Trout (John Lennon's lawyers made sure to make it "official" that he died from a gunshot because him being killed by a trout was too fucking hilarious, that the world would probably cease to exist and then Chris would take over, and have sex with all the supermodels except for the plus sized ones BECAUSE NOONE LIKES FAT CHICKS(If anyone is angry about that previous statement it was written by Joel Bruce). True story)(Sam also had sex with all the supermodels except for the plus size ones, but he did it first, 5 times). But hit boiling point when Chris mispelt the Beatles' name: The Bqqqueakkkorganorganuitsrollingstonesarebettersadfuckthisimgoingtogoeatsomeicecreamntlesbkjtles. This sparked a legal war between both bands, to decide who gets the rights to the music they made together. Sadly The Organstra, when the courts ruled that they could only submit a defense if they had signatures from all band members, A sheer impossible task(considering that the band at the time contained 69,097,048 members). The Beatles won by default and deleted the original name and artwork ( depicting a naked woman flying a 800 headed dragon pillaging a small Cambodian village while masturbating with across with all the band members names carved on to it) to the boring and slightly homosexual white surface that adorns it to this very day.</p>

<p>After all the crap The Beatles did to the Organstra(Not really, The Organstra didnt give a shit, they just pretended to care that way Paul McCartney could feel like a man for once in his life), The Organstra was in disarray(Again not really, all that happened was Joel shat himself which isn't a big deal because he does it ALL the time, and he isn't even IN the Organstra). But anyway The Organstra being as awesome and great as they were, decided to work with ANOTHER shitty pop band: The Rolling Stones. At first The Rolling Stones refused to work with the Organstra because the Stones' manager Allen Klein had a beef with Chris (BUT WHO'S DEAD NOW BITCH????), But the Stones had to cooperate with The Organstra's decision after Sam killed Brian Jones JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM. The Organstra sick of having to constantly record stuff in studio, wanted to return to its roots: Playing Live(Remember that the Organstra spent 80 million years before the dawn of man playing live, and only truely received the respect they deserved when the shitty looking slugs they were playing to evolved into people). The Stones and Organstra's first show together didn't go down well. They ORGANised a free concert in Altamont, and killed a young black man with their sheer ORGAN power (we're not rascist, Nazi Punks, Nazi Punks, Nazi Punks, Fuuuuck Off!!!!). And their second show was also unsuccessful only because The Organstra stumbled upon 21 tonnes of Chris's lethal Homestyle Death Cocaine, an amount so big and so lethal, could kill 248 elephants, which Organstra preceded to do, just for kicks. Only they coudn't find any elephants so they travelled back in time and killed all the Unicorns. And that's the story of how The Organstra killed all the Unicorns. The end.</p>

<p>Johnny Thunders was orginally the front man of popular teen girl band - The Monkees, until he met The Organstra, who as a joke stuck 200 heroin filled syringes in his arms while he slept. This forced him into a spiral of awesomeness ending with him making a new band named - JOHNNY THUNDERS AND THE HEARTBREAKERS. By now he was addicted to heroin so much, he could shoot webs out of wrists like that guy in that movie about the MAN who has the abilities of a SPIDER. I think it was called CRAZY WEB SHOOTING MAN OF DOOOOOOM. 2 years and no hit singles later The Heartbreakers broke up, citing not being enough like The Organstra as its main reason. In 1991, After an attempt by The Organstra to attempt to stick 200 needles into his arms while he slept failed, cutting off his arm with an axe. He lost all his blood and died. This didn't slow down the beast of a man that was Johnny Thunders. He replaced all his blood with heroin, killed Kurt Cobain and tours to this day with The Organstra.</p>

<p>The story of The Organstra and The Ramones starts in 1933 when Joel bruce set up a Gay Nightclub on 53rd &amp; 3rd street in New York he called it: Cocks, Butts and Gay Boys also known as C-B-G-Bs. Unfortunetly for Joel (and hilarious for everyone else) his Nightclub was shut down almost immediately for various complicated reasons.</p>
<p>Joel was so enraged by the shut down of his nightclub (he even affectionately called it the "Fruit of his love", then Chris made a joke about him Loving Fruits((You see Fruits is also a term for a homosexual)), and Joel agreed, then winked at him, then touched his leg. True Story) that he travelled to Germany, grew a moustache(One of the few manly things Joel can do) died his hair and started his own Gay-friendly government party he called The Nazis. The Nazi Party started out well but then Joel went nuts with power and used it as a way to kill off his arch nemesis: the Jewish race and the rest of the world in general. Anyway back to the Organstra and The Ramones. CBGBs became a live music club and hosted awesome bands like The Ramones, Television, Talking Heads and Richard Hell and The Voidoids. One night The Organstra saw The Ramones play, and they said to them: "Hey, You guys are pretty good." Then Johnny went: "Hey thanks that means alot to us, but seriously how gay is Joel?" Then Chris and Sam agreed because they're awesome. The end.</p>

<p>One day Sam and Chris got lost in the future while hunting Velocer Raptors, Terrordactils, Brontosauruses and various other Dinosaurs from the past (yeah, Chris &amp; Sam are THAT awesome), all the Dinosaurs got killed,there was no big bang. Anyway while Sam &amp; Chris were in the future/past they managed to record another album, this time collaborating with a friendly dinosaur and his band, more commenly known as T-Rex. They ended up releasing this album 200 milleniums before it was recorded, and it was an absolute masterpeice, the title was "Prehistoric Organ Sounds". Many years previously The Saints, a rock 'n' roll band from Brisbane, Australia ripped-off the album...completly re-writing the songs and not including any organ (worst mistake ever) and then releasing the album with the very bland and flamingly homosexual title "Prehistoric Sounds", there version of the album was a commercial flop, causing the band to implode outwards and kill themselves and many others all at the same time not dying. Die hards fans do not care for The Saints cover album version. To get back from the future Chris and Sam merely jumped.</p>

<p>Usually when the entire band needs to bust out some gnarly time travel, every member plays Sam &amp; Chris's legendary "X Chord" at the same time, invented at the first jam the band ever had (it lasted 4 years)...No one who is not in the band can possibly play this chord, it has been attempted by many...all have died...some of these people where - Jimi Hendrix (before he joined the band,he came back from the dead just because Sam gave him permission, then he joined the band and was properly taught how to play an X Chord by Chris, precision accuracy takes 5 years to master and even then its still doesnt sound quite right), Jim Morrison tried to somehow hit an X Chord whilst singing, this being impossible and therefore causing his death (Contrary to popular belief he did NOT get gunned down buy an F1 Fighter Jet....anyway he came back to life and learnt to play an X Chord on a sitar), Joel Bruce attempted to play an X Chord on his toy plastic guitar, which he believes is real, the guitar exploded ...missing Joel completly but hitting a small Cobra, causing it to jump and bite Joel's head off, no one ever could be bothered bringing him back to life. Travis described the explosion as being "somewhat similiar to a Nuclear Bomb". The X Chord was invented for the soul purpose of catering for the bands over-the-top schedule. The Organstra's average songs tends to be an hour in length, with an average live set consisting of 24 songs, and The Organstra usually plays at leeeeast 300 different gigs per day, taking at least four hours extra to assemble all the band members in the one place, thus the X Chord was invented so that Sam, Chris and Colonel Sanders could all travel into 18 other dimensions at the same time to calm down &amp; get everything under control. Once they had it under control they would return to there REAL dimension, where they would play a totally rockin' live show, when they were playing, there exact doubles would go into the other dimensions and do the same thing....so everything was under control and there is no need for any of you reading this to panic, so dont. The song "Dimension" by hip-hop band "Wolfmother" is actually about the legend of the X Chord, and is not about flying canary-yellow coloured aeroplanes around the barn in your mum's backyard on the moon as Wolfmother's die-hard fans believe it really is.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief Sam &amp; Chris WERE the masterminds behind the famous Woodstock Festival of 1969, but Joel Bruce and his clan of homosexual friends (including CJ) were the masterminds behind Woodstock '94 and '99. This is the reason that Woodstock '69 had fuckin' awesome bands play such as The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Ten Years After &amp; The Jimi Hendrix Experience, wereas on the other hand horrible/talentless/gay/emo/shit bands like Green Day played at the events ...ized (Yes, your eyes are not deceiving you, this word is supposed to spell 'ORGANized' except no ORGAN in the history of everything would ever want to be involved with Joel Bruce in any way) by Joel Bruce &amp; Co. The Clash actually came from the future to play at Woodstock '69, because Sam asked them to. No one is aware of this for the reason that CJ (Somehow responsible for recording and filming the whole concert) failed to capture any footage or sound recording of the band playing that night. Joe Strummer later tried to kill CJ but did not succeed, because Joe Strummer was already dead when he attempted this. The Stooges also played Woodstock '69 but no one knows this because there performance was to awesome/violent to ever be witnessed again. Ron Asheton hired Travis to play ORGAN for them that night. The Stooges took so many drugs that night that they still thought they were playing the same gig 3 months later, turns out they were playing to a pack of wild dogs sitting in the backyard of there house. These dogs could all shred the ORGAN. Of course in the end Woodstock 1969 was a HUUUUGE success, and yes, as you probably predicted, Woodstock 1994 &amp; 1999 were very large wastes of time.</p>

<p>One time CJ farted really loudly (It smelled like shit too) and accidently rose the dead. He was promptly eaten/killed and according to one of the zombies he tasted like shit too. Once the Ghostbusters were eaten there was no one left to call to destroy the zombie plague...except for perhaps THE MIGHTY ORGANSTRA. The Organstra stepped their plan into action - they barricaded themselves in a closeby mall (Dawn Of The Dead is ripped-off from The Organstra) to protect themselves from the zombies (They werent afraid of the zombies, they just pretended to be so the zombies could feel good about themselves, in fact they werent afraid so much that Sam Wightman was even heard saying "I'd find it hard to be scared of zombies man...They're fucking losers."). Whilst in the mall Chris, Sam, Vinnie, Travis, Carl, Rupert, Ollie &amp; various other members of the band did stupid/fun things like breaking into sports stores, wearing american football helmets, stealing bikes, and jousting up and down escalators with golf clubs that were on fire. They all had green hair. After that they were joined by Keith Richards and Iggy Pop, who managed to walk through the zombie hordes unscathed because the zombies mistook them both for one of their own. The Organstra was as safe as it had ever been, Sam &amp; Chris discovered that the zombies could easily be killed if you ran them over with a tank. So Sam &amp; Chris stole a tank. Before they killed the zombies they realised that emos look identical to zombies, so THEY KILLED EVERY EMO, EVER. FIVE TIMES. Then after they'd had there fun, they destroyed the zombies, i took a total of six seconds. Zombies never, ever have returned since, nowadays they're equally as scared as the FUCKING FAGGOT EMOS that threatened Sam &amp; Chris were when they realised that their completly shit plan backfired and they woulda got the shit kicked outta them buy over 30 people.</p>

<p>The most controversal song The Organstra ever created (With the exception of the 1939 album: All hail our Nazi overlords, They will command us to a better tommorow (This album was written by Joel, recorded as a joke &amp; was fake anyway)).The whole track is an instrumental but has one line at the end of the song: THE ORGANSTRA IS FAR BETTER THAN LED ZEPPELIN. When the song came out in 12 AD there was great confusion and controversy over the above lyric, confusion because a Lead Zeppelin would make no sense due to the fact that a zeppelin made of lead wouldn't be able to float, and controversy in 1937 when some motherfucker made a zeppelin out of lead that he called the Hindinburg, which blew up. When Led Zeppelin covered it (poorly) they changed the words to: SHE'S BUYING THE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, Which makes no fucking sense.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: The album this track comes from: The Satanic Organ Verses coined the word Satan which was used by the catholic church as the name for their badass dude. In reality it was a word Chris used whenever he got a kickass Chicken and Cheese sandwich.</p>

<p>A student of jazz, Zac blends its language with the inflection of soul music, the immediacy of folk music, and the vernacular-purpose of rap music. Having shared the stage with artists as diverse as KRS-One, Roomful of Blues, Steve Lacy, RJD2 and the Benevento/Russo Duo, Zac has felt most at home performing, thriving on the relationship with audiences around the world and utilizing the connection between fellow musicians within bands like Peoples Republic of Monsters, Old Man Benjamin, The Lorax, The Plurals, Men Without Class, The Mumbles, and many more. As a solo performer he has captivated thousands all over the globe with personal tales of love, melancholy, and affirmation, including deeply retrospective interpretation of past masters and heroes such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell, and Nick Drake, not to mention currently instant standards by Common, Gnarls Barkley, Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, Beyonce, The Postal Service and others in the project called "Zac Galen Plays New Standards". The live show incorporates elements of folk, jazz, blues, funk, hip-hop, and many other genres to combine for a performance which is at once genuine and also full of surprises. Accomplished singer, guitarist, song-writer, improviser... Zac Galen emerges as a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary music scene and will be making meaningful expression for years to come...</p>
<p>Here's what others are saying:</p>
<p>"From Queens to Philly; The Woo town to Berlin they all shoutin for him to do it again - Zac Galen is Eric Krasno meets Ben Harper... add Steve Mossberg on the organ and some boom-bap from yours truly and you've got a high powered trio of soulful cookin... have gigs, will travel...".... Thus spoke drummer Ethan Shorter, peep son on the traps...</p>
<p>The critics weigh in; here's what Carl J. Tietze had to say for Pulse Magazine in Worcester: "Listening to Galen perform, it is easy to hear American music icon Stevie Wonder's influence on songwriting, arrangement, and vocal tone. Galen's voice is as soulful and deep as it is pure, and his ability to hit upper registers with ease makes it very obvious that this young man has a voice and knows how to use it. His vocal talent, coupled with his abilities as a first rate guitar player, puts this young man a cut, or two, above the rest."........</p>
<p>and there's no press like German Press, take Carsten Purfürst in Kiel: "Zac Galen, Amerikaner und Wahlberliner, stärkt sich derweil mit einem letzten Schluck aus der grünen Buddel, dann entlässt er seinen angejazzten Soul in die Nacht. Nicht nur stimmlich, auch optisch erinnert er ein wenig an den Kollegen Everlast, seine Songs haben jene typisch flockig-folkrockigen Anklänge, wobei auch der Blues mal wieder seine Rolle spielt. Zac Galen tanzelt mit traumwandlerischer Finesse übers Griffbrett, schmunzelt Richtung Tresen, wo May und Cremer (die andere Band des Abends) ihm zuprosten, versinkt in seinen Melodien. Der gebürtige Bostoner, den man in den Staaten schon "A Rising Star" getauft hatte und der nun sein Studium der Jazzgitarre in Berlin fortsetzt, bleibt bescheiden. Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell und Radiohead zugleich stehen seinen Songs Pate. Eine fast abstrus zu nennende Mischung, die jedoch hervorragend zu harmonieren versteht. Ein schönes Konzert.".............</p>
<p>and H.P. Daniels for the Tagesspiegel in Berlin: "In knittrigem Hemd und mit bunter Kappe steht er aufrecht da, mit der Akustikgitarre, und bewegt den massiven Körper zu massiven Songs. Lässiges Fingerstyle-Picking, harter Anschlag, rhythmisches Saitenknallen. Jazzig, latino-funkelig. Und singt sehr cool und schön, mit einer Stimme irgendwo zwischen Jack Johnson und James Taylor. Zwischen Sonne und Melancholie.".........</p>

<p>Team S is a group cosisting of four amazing distance swimmers at Sugarloaf Swim Atlanta swim club. These members are Will Freeman, Kemp Greenwood, Zach Tilman (ZT), and John McWirter (who recently moved to Pennsylvania). Team S is lead by the legendary distance coach Scot Davis. Team S also has one honorary member, Eric Madden (Moose), who is not really a distance swimmer; however, he will become a full member after he completes a 10,000 for time. Team S is a very selective and elite team, and although many people would like to join some never in their life will, such as Bruce Janzen. Team S has T-shirts and would be willing to sell them to fans and supporters for $300.00 for half a shirt, and $750.99 for a whole shirt. Team S has many slogans such as:</p>
<pre>
1. Don't mess with Team S!
2. Team S for life!
3. Let's do work!
4. Whoa, spread 'em!
5. We'll steal your money and eat your lunch! 
6. We'll ride your bike!
as well as many others.
</pre>
<p>Remember: Team S always wins by default!</p>

<p>Solid - tend to keep its form rather than to flow or spread out like a liquid or gas; relatively firm or compact. Liquid - readily flowing; fluid; specif., having its molecules moving freely with respect to each other so as not to flow readily, unlike a solid, but because of cohesive forces not expanding indefinitely like a gas. Gas - the fluid form of a substance in which it can expand indefinitely and completely fill its container; form that is neither liquid nor solid; vapor</p>

<p>The First World War lasted so long for a number of reasons. Firstly, because of the industrial revolution, which enabled mass production of weapons and an almost ongoing supply of money. The railways also provided a constant supply of troops’ food and weapons. Most would think that the invention of new weapons such as gas and tanks would overcome the stalemate, However this was not the case because both sides had them.</p>
<p>No one in 1914 would have predicted that the war would turn into a stalemate lasting from 1915-1918 it was a common belief back home in Britain that it would all be 'over by Christmas'. The Germans had similar views at the start of the war; they thought they could rapidly capture France before invading Russia, therefore preventing a war on two fronts. But the failure of the Schlieffen plan was a big blow for Germany in 1914. This critical failure was one of the main reasons the war was such a long drawn out affair. It was no longer each side trying to capture the other in a war movement but, trench warfare. Defense was now the key.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting in open land trench warfare was developed for protection of shells. This meant that, although the flies, rats and trench foot were a big problem, deaths were reduced. Between the trenches lay a "no man's land" of barbed wire shattered trees, shell craters, and rotting corpses. When ordered to attack, soldiers climbed out of their trenches, ran across no man's land toward the enemy trenches, and were mowed down by machine gun, rifle, and artillery fire. In just one engagement, the Battle of the Somme in Northern France, 1,100,000 soldiers died. Soldiers were being killed in their thousands, and neither side was gaining ground. This then made it exceedingly difficult for any advances to be made and any new land to be secured by either side.</p>
<p>Although thousands of soldiers were being killed, thousands more were also quickly being shipped in by railways. Railways also enabled food, weapons and medicine to be transported to where they were needed quickly and efficiently.</p>
<pre>
The invention of new weapons and the ability to mass produce them should have quickly won the war for Britain. However, we were not the only nation to have an industrial revolution. Also the amount of money that was being made by trade and by easier methods of production meant that there was a very low risk of either side running out of money. This meant that both sides could fund the war and  quickly produce any weapons they needed.
</pre>
<p>Recent inventions, such as artillery, although they had range and accuracy failed to overcome the stalemate because the war became reliant on defence rather than attack. The machine gun, although one single gun could kill hundreds of men, was used not to advance but to hold back any advancing soldiers.</p>
<p>The main reason why new methods and inventions, such as barbed wire, undermining, machine guns, poison gas and tanks failed to overcome the stalemate was simply because both sides had them. The Germans introduced poison gas (chlorine gas) in 1915 which soon became a weapon of both sides. The invention of tanks was another attempt to break the stalemate. Tanks were mainly used by the British and the French, however the Germans used a small number of captured tanks and a few of their own design. Also aeroplanes were used to drop small milk bottle size bombs on enemy cities, trenches and soldiers. Again, these were used on both sides.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the stalemate of 1915 finally ended in 1918, The reason it went on so long was because defending your position in 1915 was less dangerous than attacking. When attacking you would have to leave the safety and concealment of the trenches. You were out in the open practically defenceless, facing a barren stretch of no man’s land, and the enemies’ guns. So attacking was known as suicidal. Staying in the trench was the safer option because you were hidden there and highly armed. The trenches were also well supplied. Food and reinforcements could arrive by rail at any time. So because of all these reasons the stalemate lasted for four years with seemingly nothing able to break it.</p>

LuzArius was one of the very first player killers and griefers from Ultima Online on the Pacific server during the pre-trammel days. Having also conquered Siege Perilous with his known companion Persian and his guild the Nex Imperium, he desperately tries to spread his legacy of grief &amp; chaos. He now ventures from MMORPG to MMORPG in hopes of finding another environment that will allow him the same destructive powers he had in Ultima Online before it became known as carebear.</p>
<p>Luzarius is a very outspoken MMORPG player who tries to bring Free For All PVP(FFA PVP) to the online gaming community. FFA PVP allows players in a MMORPG to openly kill each other and rob each other of all loot. This promotes a very chaotic environment that naturally brings about order in a world of chaos. Players truly decide if they are good or evil in a FFA PVP environment.</p>
<p>One of his most memorable quotes are:</p>
<p>"How do you know if a player is truly your friend if they don't even have a chance to betray you?".</p>
<p>What he is trying to show is in this quote is that friendship in mmorpg is meaningless if the friendship cannot be put to the simple test of betrayal.</p>
<p>Luzarius also believes that once you remove the evil human element from a MMORPG you will also be removing the good human element. There can be no heroes in a fantasy based MMORPG if there are no evil players. This leads to a poor and lifeless community that lacks any type of controversey or conflict.</p>

<p>Medinatainu Brigadiers is a very pro zionist group that have a number of programmes devoted in helping Israel. Altogether, they have raised £26,000 and have about 1,850 members. The number of collectors/devotees has not been publically recorded to the public; however some say that there are about 80.</p>
<p>There has been some dispute, however, with the quality of their website, hosted for free by freewebs; The Chief Collector has said that "there is no need to spend money when thre is a free option that only requires a public domain name." Some people deem this untrue and claimed that they were only using free hosting services because thay had insufficent funds.</p>

The Boston Grammar School Schuhplattler Gruppe are a German dancing group, based in Boston, Lincolnshire, and the only one of its type in the country!</p>
<p>They have been running for seventeen years, and started as what can only be described as a "one off" activity at a holiday reunion cabaret after a school trip to Germany. The first 'full time' Troupe was formed in late 1990's and instantly took off, proving extremely successful, winning local, county, national and international prizes in language festivals. A 10 Second appearance on BBC1's "The Clothes Show" in the early 1990's really started the phones ringing and since then, the various troupes throughout the years have performed at what must now be around 600 gigs at all kinds of of events, ranging from galas, fetes and parades to churches and old peoples' homes!</p>
<p>The first ever Troupe, numbering just 9 people were invited to perform in Munich in 1992 at the world famous Oktoberfest. The next year, the Troupe won the Boston Lions' Youth Award and, following this, a troupe of 29 lads auditioned at Hull Truck Theatre for Michael Barrymore's "My Kind of People" show, going on to perform at the regional final at Sheffield's Medowhall, going down to great acclaim and meeting one very young, very nervous, Gareth Gates! More recently, the Troupe caught the roving eye of the BBC's Blue Peter children's show and enjoyed an exciting day out at Shepherd's Bush studios rehearsing for their live performance at 5 pm, and again, delighted both the people of Britain and the then presenters Matt and Simon, who were provided with costumes and danced our routine with them. Such was the interest in the act, that we were also featured in the Christmas show of the presenters favourite moments of the year.</p>
<p>One of their most grueling gig's, which they have been invited to for the past three years now, is the Spalding Flower Parade where they can be seen performing with the Spalding Apfeltizers Oompah Band. This is always a great gig even though a very tiring one. They now stand in the year 2007, with group leader Jon Coupland, after losing a couple of members last year along with their two sound engineers Nathan Talbot and Jason Smalley.</p>
<p>Very recently they have had a successful application for an audition for "Britain's Got Talent" the new X Factor type show starring the one and only 'Mr. Nasty', Simon Cowell. Their first audition was successful, however when we returned for a second, despite being a big hit with the audience and camera crew, it wasn't to be and Simon Cowell turned them down (though they didn't go without a fight). Stephen Mulhern loved them though, so keep an eye out for "Britain's Got More Talent" on ITV2 and you might see them there!</p>

<p>&lt;/gallery&gt; Volador was an Aztec bungee-jump in honour of their Sun god, Tonatiuh, this is still practised to this day.</p>
<p>Four men dressed as birds called voladores climbed up a maypole and once at the top they tied ropes to their legs and jumped. They then twirled around the pole fourteen times each which makes up the Aztecs lucky number fifty-two. The idea of this was that if the number was made up it would please the Tonatiuh so that he would keep lying around the Earth. (This was the point to human sacrifice )</p>
