<dd>Well, that was a problem for me: it's a redirect, so it should go to RfD; but it's a <i>soft</i> redirect, so probably RfD wouldn't accept it, so it should go to AfD; except that it's not an article, so it should go to MfD; and we also have CSD, PROD and IAR.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This article is—or at least could be—a very useful source of information, e.g. for people who want to avoid using expressions that are based on stereotypes. It has been established, I think, that it is distinct from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, however, I think each entry should be required to have at least one respectable reference associated with it: a source that verifies that the phrase is or has been in reasonably wide use in some community and is indeed based on a stereotype. Any phrase not satisfying this criterion should be removed from the list. That's my opinion, anyway. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 02:18, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While that sounds like a great idea, this isn't really something that gets reported around in the media. Slang for Eskimos and Aleuts is 'Tundra-monkeys'... sucking on a can with big wet lips is called 'nigger-lipping'.

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted;</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a>. The subject is a real person (and does possess a doctorate) but is does not in any way meet wikipedia's notability guidelines (see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29#People_still_alive|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29#People_still_alive|" rel="nofollow">biographies of living persons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies/Academics|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies/Academics|" rel="nofollow">academic guidelines</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29#People_still_alive|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29#People_still_alive|" rel="nofollow">notability</a>. However, I can at least vouch for his appearance on television (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Challenge_413e.html" title="University Challenge">University Challenge</a>). It is not clear from google whether or not he has any academic publications whatsoever (no publications in peer-reviewed journals according to googlescholar [<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Liam+Herringshaw%22+&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Liam+Herringshaw%22+&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>], will update with results of WOS search to confirm), and according to what I can find, he appears to hold no academic post (and certainly no tenured post) in the UK or elsewhere, and nor has he ever, beyond his doctoral studies. Many google hits are either wiki-mirrors or self-submitted reviews and comments, although some do indeed pertain to the subject's academic work (conference abstracts and the like). His last known employment seems to have been as an administrator (non-academic) in the University of Leicester's School of Management. Much of the text of the article is clearly spurious (ie cricketing exploits); and contains obvious puffery (certainly the subject is not widely known in academic circles for his research, nor is he <s>'reknowned'</s> <u>'renowned'</u> for anything). It is my strong suspicion that the page has been written or edited by the subject himself or by a close associate for a joke. The subject is not notable enough for either his media appearances (of which there are two, both quiz shows where he appeared as a member of the public) )or his academic work to be included in wikipedia, imho.

<dd>Closing admin's rationale, in response to query: <i>AfD is about whether a particular topic is appropriate for Wikipedia and not about the current state of the article. If there are excessive redlinks or inappropriate bluelinks, or if the article is incomplete, these are content issues that can be remedied through normal editing processes outside AfD. In determining whether an article topic is suitable for Wikipedia, the closing admin's responsibility is to determine whether there is consensus on the issue, rather than to decide which side is right. Rationales contrary to Wikipedia policy should not be viewed as contributing to the consensus, and certain egregious flaws in an article (e.g., copyvio) trump consensus, but I don't really see that here: for the most part the debate seemed to be about whether or not this list served a function separate from that of a category. I saw no consensus on this issue (certainly no <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermajority.html" title="Supermajority">supermajority</a>) so I closed it as a "no consensus". You can request that the decision be reviewed at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>, if you like.

<li>Additional - Many of the pages that are bluelinks here are not aimed at articles about the games they describe (presumably because such articles don't exist), simply the main page of that name... e.g "1942", "The Addams Family", "Anarchy", "The A-Team" to name a few... So there would be even more redlinks here if someone was prepared to go through this listcruftian disaster of mis-links and sort it out. The list is also incredibly incomplete, featuring only games beginning with numbers and A, B, I, U, V, W, X, Y and Z.

<li>Lists and categories do entirely separate jobs when there is information in the list that wouldn't be found in a category. When an incomplete list exists as a massive repository of a) redlinks and b) misdirected blue links, without significant supplementary information (the name of the software company that produced the game is a start but not much of one) it doesn't belong on WP. If you can't see that you aren't reading the policies correctly. Anybody who is voting to "keep" this list is presumably personally guaranteeing that they will undertake work to bring this list in line with WP policy (see WP style guide above).

<p>This was previously deleted as a neologism. I'd like to reiterate that argument, and also add that this page is mostly original research. A google search for "amerime" gets about 1640 hits.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Googled for it; gets a little bit of use on chat boards. If kept the top of the article should note that the term is a nelogism and not widely recognised.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I've heard this term for close to 20 years now (it was first [mis]applied to <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotech.html" title="Robotech">Robotech</a></i>), but is gaining stronger use as "true Amerime" comes out. I will agree that the article is going to need some hefty revamping (and I'll see about that myself), but to get rid of it would mean we'd have to get rid of other "non-Japanese" anime and manga forms like <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerimanga.html" title="Amerimanga">Amerimanga</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_nouvelle_manga.html" title="La nouvelle manga">La nouvelle manga</a>, etc.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 19:04, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is the fourth incarnation of an article named after a word I made up. I checked, shortly after I created the article, and there were a few independent hits on Google, so while I can take some credit/blame for this term, it's <b>not really a true neologism</b> if it's been around for twenty years. I'd say the only thing going against this article is that it's been deleted three times before. Stranger still is that my original goal, which was struck out upon around two years ago, may be coming to fruitation: <i>this word has been sufficiently forced into circulation that it has actually taken root.</i> Cool. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 19:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as nn neologism, unless someone can provide references and proof of it being in widespread usage.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although this a pioneering term that is just beginning to become known, American Anime or Amerime will put up dozens of results on google, AOL and yahoo so how could it possibly still be considered as neologism? As one of the world's largest online encyclopedias, I believe that it would do Wikipedia good to retain the solid, groundbreaking information Amerime provides and thusly increase its reputation as an online encyclopedia to both old and new <b>valuable</b> information.Walter Nwaokolo 1:00, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fiction it is certainly not; it's an archaic neurologic term (but then again, most neurologic terms are sort of obscure.) Astasia refers to the inability to maintain station (stand upright) unassisted; abasia means that the base of gait (the lateral distance between the two feet) is inconstant or unmeasurable. It's not always caused by conversion disorder; there are organic syndromes, such as those which destroy or inactivate the cerebellum, which cause it too.

<li>Female nude wrestling is different to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catfight.html" title="Catfight">catfight</a>. Only Catfight seems more sexuel motivated, Female Nude Wrestling not.

I put my whole heart and soul into that audition and would have gotten it too if John Bennet Perry hadn't walked in and taken it from me. I'll admit it his physic, his charm, his aroma, he had it all. He's better than me I knew that anybody knew that. When I saw his article up for deletion I thought it was too good to be true, the ultimate revenge. But now it's looking like John Bennet Perry has defeated me once again. This should have been my article and the great Mathew Perry son of the great John Bennet Perry should have been Mathew ColenFace son of the great Colenface. My life is in shambles.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Rosenfeld isn't hugely notable, but he's on the periphery of something that is, and that affects the way people view WP. I'm trying to lean in the direction of information-rich here.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These sort of things are weirdly worshipped by those in the geek community such as myself. The people that do something small that something huge results out of. Don't think theres any danger of it quite blossoming into jargon-file-on-wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> there seems to be some disagreement about the founding of Wikipedia, i.e. Larry Sanger's involvement, whose idea was it really, etc. This article comes dangerously close to being a self-reference, so maybe should be moved. But it is <s>generally agreed</s> my understanding that the person who set an important movement in motion is important. Thus, this guy is notable for setting the stone of wikipedia rolling, if wikipedia is notable, which according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it is. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 07:50, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>A-bit-stronger-than-weak Keep</b> there exist a controversy about who presented Jimbo with idea about wiki. Therefore, this guy is controversial enough to became notable. I'd keep the article and add more links as references, so person interested in the "who's idea wikipedia was" thingy can do some reading. i fact, that's what I'm gonna do right now. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 16:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: It's hard to call four mallet playing "unconvential", since it's the basis of the (Western) marimba as a solo instrument. Not saying it would be a bad redirect, just that what's there now is something that is done by every classically trained percussionist on the face of the earth (though some of the things in extended technique, like multiple stops, are common, as well). –&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamurai_ba1f.html" title="User:Flamurai">flamurai</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamurai_f545.html" title="User talk:Flamurai">t</a>) 07:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reaction</b> I've added some new links to the article, hopefully making it more notable. It is quite a 'young' approach, but I personally find it way more interesting than other description of Gen X cinema. Maybe it should be transferred there?</li>

<li><b>Do not delete:</b> I believe the internet, especially Wikipedia, should have full liberty of content. User-submitted content should not be modified or deleted. If we were to go about deleting content because it has slang terms for drugs, then why not just go ahead and delete any page with any drug references or profanity? Why not just remove every contraversial subject on Wikipedia including images on human reproductive anatomy? The reason is because it would just be further depriving people of their liberties and placing greater abridgements on our rights. Furthermore, the entire reason for limiting speech is to "protect our children." Our children are not being protected by being blinded. Please Wikipedia, understand that ieveryone should have the freedom to provide whatever information they wish on the internet and that this site, especially, should be no exeption. User:Morthian 22:18 EST, 15 February 2006
<ul>
<li>I did not suggest deletion because there were references to drugs. I suggested deletion because wikipedia is not for lists of slangs. See <b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a></b> for more details. It specifically says in section 1.2 this is not a dictionary and not for slangs. Make it into a proper article (like the one on <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhang.html" title="Bhang">Bhang</a>) and it might be a candidate for retention. Wikipedia is not for anything anyone wants to post but an encyclopedia and there are guideleines that must be followed. See 1.2 in above link for details. I said nothing about limitng speech or protecting children in my vote to delete, but voted to delete because this is not an article, just a list of non-notable slang. Other drug references or articles on human anatomy are real articles, not lists of slangs. If they aren't, they should also be deleted or placed within a sensible context. <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a> 11:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see. Sorry about that. Although, I would think that a list like this would be in an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary or thesaurus, as these terms are not just synonyms. I suppose the definitions of the slang terms could be defined in a dictionary under each word, but then that defeats the purpose of a list. Perhaps some people like reading up on the list and learning various street terms. I haven't really looked into this type of situation too much, so perhaps I am wrong about the article's placement. As long as the deletion of the article has nothing to do with limitations of content, I am not really bothered. User:Morthian 15:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I believe Wikipedia runs on the US "fair use" doctrine which is significantly more relaxed and so the inclusion is more likely to be OK.

<li>Sorry you perceive it as "thinly-veiled newbie bullying" going on, but Wikipedia perceives this well-established practice of noting "votes" from very new users as its protection against "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>", "meatpuppets", and other attempts to make the AfD reflect the views and perhaps the ulterior motives of a small group of newcomers, rather than the experience and judgement of established Wikipedians. You may think this is "unfair", but I suggest to you that that is an illusion caused by the fact that Wikipedia offers you uncommon latitude in editing its pages.

<p>I wrote this stub, and you would have to have been paying no attention to the aftermath of 9/11 to have failed to have encountered widespread reports of "coincidences" or "synchronicities" surrounding the events of that day. Bear in mind that those two words are often used as synonyms for one another but they carry opposite implications -- a "coincidence" is considered to be pure happenstance, with no implied actual connection between events that are coinciding; "synchronicity" on the other hand implies that there may be an actual connection. The distinction is in the eye of the beholder, and I'm not suggesting that any perceived connection is verifiably so.</p>
<p><b>The bottom line is this: Coincidences surrounding 9/11 have been widely noted and have had a presence and impact culturally at the very least.</b></p>
<p>My piece IS A STUB -- I defined the topic and provided two categorically different examples, and that is what they are -- examples only. This is followed by an invitation to add to these examples. I do think the quality of the examples added would need to be monitored, but the topic itself is legitimate AS a topic -- I make no claims, and the article makes no claims, as to the significance of any coincidences described or discussed.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. I respectfuly ask you, and everyone else who has already voted, to reconsider your vote.</p>

<p>My main point is this: "Coincidences surrounding 9/11 have been widely noted and have had a presence and impact culturally at the very least." "Widely noted" means a cultural phenomenon is occurring and to that extent is an "object" in the world and hence worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia that purports to cover objects in the world.</p>
<p>I am new to the site, and have only just now skimmed the policy statement, which seems sensible and I wish to support it. It may be the article should be revised in light of it. But it's not a "pet theory" of mine, merely a fact of cultural life in the time since 9/11, one that deserves to be documented accurately and in an unbiased manner.</p>

<dd>OK, but for something to be encyclopedic, it needs to be supported by a verifiable, independent source. What I mean by that is there needs to be an exterior website, scientific journal, etc that has already covered this topic (in the case of your comments above, the supposed cultural phenomenon of "Coincidences or Synchornicities surrounding 9/11"). Generally speaking, message boards, blogs, and personal websites are not seen as a verifable, neutral source. For even a rewritten article on this topic to exist here and not be subjected to an AfD, you will need to demonstrate that a credible source has already documented this as a cultural phenomenon. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> will help you understand the criteria. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:41, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To give an example, when one person notices the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln-Kennedy_coincidences_3593.html" title="Lincoln-Kennedy coincidences">Lincoln-Kennedy coincidences</a>, it doesn't get an article. After it's been discussed in magazines and mentioned in books about the two presidents and been made the subject of a <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Guido_Sarducci_81e8.html" title="Father Guido Sarducci">Father Guido Sarducci</a> comedy special, then it gets an article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:46, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isotope23, Thatcher131, thank you for your sensible comments. Thatcher131, your point on Lincoln/Kennedy coincidences is apt, and I certainly agree with you. I believe that the verification you request can be provided; clearly, though, I should have done more research before posting. I will endeavor to track down the qualtiy of verification required. How long can you give me? Or should my article be taken down in the interim? Just for starters, though, anyone googling "9/11 coincidences" will certainly get an eyeful, if not a laugh!

<dd>Well, the AfD process takes about a week, however by the end of that time many fewer people are paying attention and it would be hard to change the <i>delete</i> consensus that has developed. Also, if the article is deleted via the AfD process and you put it up again later, it may be nominated for speedy deletion. If I were you (and I was, when I first joined) I would swallow my pride, blank the page, and tag it yourself for <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a>. (Unfortunately since other people have edited it you can't use G7 only author, you have to use G1 patent nonsense.) You can then set up the article on your own user page and work on it without interference until you've got it in a more encylopedic format, then put it up again in the main space. If you speedied your own first attempt then your second attempt should get a fair hearing based on its new content. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike> -- the web site has received coverage in the New York Daily News (link on article page), which already makes it meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The article author claims the web site has received several blog awards, but has not included them on the page, yet. This deletion nomination is too early to be one based on the quality of the article; it was only written hours ago. Note that I suggested the creation of this page (see <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexHarris_e573.html" title="User talk:AlexHarris">User talk:AlexHarris</a>) because the blog does appear to be notable, but its creators are not, except under the blog's article.

<ul>
<li><strike>Change that to <b>Weak keep</b></strike> -- WP:WEB mentions multiple coverages, so the one alone isn't enough, and I couldn't find the blog awards, so that's up to the author to find. Also, let me note that the site is hosted at blogger.com, which explains its alexa rank: it actually does have an Alexa rank of 696K-something: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=rebelution.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=rebelution.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, which isn't too bad for a blog. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

Also, my nom is based solely on the article's <i>topic</i>, not the current content. My opinion so far is that the topic of this article is an unremarkable website. If the article is going to go away for having an unencyclopedic topic, I'd hate for the poor guys to put lots of work into it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The site in question just switched domains.

<li>The article has been briefly updated, but may be removed if either of you consider it unencylopedic. It was only written as an edit to an inaccurate (and slightly deragatory) article created by a third party. AlexHarris 00:30, 17 February 2006 (UTC) <b>Update:</b> The blog in question was awarded a <a href="http://www.weblogawards.org" class="external text" title="http://www.weblogawards.org" rel="nofollow">2005 Weblog Award</a> (a well-known, annual event in the blogosphere) for its TTLB category, hosted by <a href="http://www.wizbangblog.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wizbangblog.com" rel="nofollow">Wizbang</a>.

<li>It's a great blog, keep the article. The Rebelution is very popular among young teens. bethbookitty 08:41, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comments</b>: I have no idea what's considered a "reputable" blog award, so if someone who knows about this can comment, that would be great. Also, I see mention of Alexa has been moved out of WP:WEB, so I think I was remembering an older version when I was thinking the number should be far lower than 700K (10K was the rule of thumb I was remembering.) In comparision, a site who's webserver I administer has an alexa rank of 53K and has been around for over 10 years, but we would never consider for a second trying to make a wikipedia article about it- it's an insignificant website in the grand scheme of things. BTW- we don't care how great the blog is - that's completely irrelevant to our purposes here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:04, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This Is a great blog! You really should keep the article. Very popular, won awards, loved by many. I think that the Rebelution article should stay. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKara_Gemmill_4493.html" title="User:Kara Gemmill">Kara Gemmill</a> 21:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In reply to a former comment: With all due respect, someone said that, "it [the Rebelution]is an insignificant website in the grand scheme of things." Aren't spoons insignifiant in the "Grand scheme of things?" You have an article about them. Why can't you have an article about a highly influencial website?<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKara_Gemmill_4493.html" title="User:Kara Gemmill">Kara Gemmill</a> 02:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I agree with the previous user. What exactly is the purpose of Wikipedia but to inform? Would not a popular blog article inform more, than an eraser article? Yes, within Wikipedia an article concerning erasers exists. How can this possibly be useful information? Bethbookitty 03:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>UPDATE:</b> Thank you everyone for your support. I personally don't think that therebelution.com can claim the same encylopedic relevance as erasers or spoons, but rest assured that I am very grateful for your defense of the article. I know each of you will verify that absolutely no attempt was made to alert anyone of the article or its status. As was said before, this article was written as an edit/rewrite of a slightly humorous version of the same by a third party. Our blog does not need, and arguably does not deserve, an entry on Wikipedia. Therefore, I think it would be best to remove the article for the time being. Thank you again.

<p>If you read the categories for articles that should be deleted I think you will find that this does not fall into one of them. It is not a prank, it is a piece of art, and is notable by 12,000 students. I imagine you can find better things to do with your time, or more useless articles to put up for deletion. It was actually still a work in progress with more information about the building when you started medling with my article.

<p>Neologism. This is my academic field, and I have never heard the term. It appears to be a neologism from a class at MIT: <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Biological-Engineering-Division/BE-104JSpring-2005/LectureNotes/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Biological-Engineering-Division/BE-104JSpring-2005/LectureNotes/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> This term is not used in the field. The hits in google scholar (14 total) are for products by companies with the apparently popular name "environetics". There are no hits for the word in <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/" class="external text" title="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">Environmental Health Perspectives</a>, the best-known journal of the field of <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_health.html" title="Environmental health">environmental health</a> (which encompasses toxicology, environmental epidemiology of toxic exposures, and logical issues of causation deriving from environmental exposures). I hate to rain on the parade of anyone in this field, but I don't see any sense in confusing people with unused terminology made up by a professor for reasons which are very unclear.

<p>This page should be deleted because the information it contains is factually inaccurate; the combined totals of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Olympics_medal_count_09c2.html" title="Winter Olympics medal count">Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympics_medal_count_0d44.html" title="Summer Olympics medal count">Summer Olympics</a> medal pages add to more that what this page shows. While this can be fixed, the fact still remains that Winter Olmypic Medals and Summer Olympic Medals should not be added together because they are two totally different things. Further, many countries who participate in the Summer games do not participate in the winter ones, and vice versa. Blatently, the two cannot be compared. --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 22:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 22:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep but fix</b> I agree with some of Jared's points, however, I feel that this list is quite relevant given that it is part of an article entitled "Olympic Games." Therefore, the two games can be compared and seen in the same context because they are both "Olympic Games" with a difference in season and sports. Their medal counts can be added together because they have this in common, and I think some people would find such a tally interesting and I'm also sure most everyone who is interested in the Olympic Games has pondered at least once about what the all-time Olympic medal tallies would be for each participating nation. I feel that we should have separate lists for all-time medal counts for both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games and then also have a list with the two games' medal counts combined. In doing so, we must make sure that when we produce these medal rankings that they are complete, accurate, and that every Games is included so that the numbers aren't grossly miscalculated and that countries are not erroneously left out. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 00:32, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Neutral</b>. I do agree with you. In a way, I think that the page should be kept, but somehow I dont think it is as important to keep because people will only look at it because they "pondered at least once about [it]." It doesn't contain information that could be used for anything but self knowledge, and even the all of the data is wrong! --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 00:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Keep but fix.</b> Caponer is right: the Games absolutely are comparable. They are run by the same organization (the IOC), and the only reason that we have separate Winter and Summer Olympics now is because of the impracticality of finding one location at which to host all of the possible events for Winter and Summer Sports at the same time. Before the First "Winter" Olympics were held in 1924, there was no such thing as 'Summer' or 'Winter' Olympic Games, they were just the Olympic Games. In fact, some of the very early Olympic Games (i.e., 'Summer' Games, but before they were called that) included events like Figure Skating and Ice Hockey. Should those medals for Figure Skating and Ice Hockey then be counted with the 'Summer' Games because that's where they were awarded, or with the 'Winter' Games because Figure Skating and Ice Hockey are Winter Sports? The point of the Olympics Medal lists is to compare the athletic nature of different Countries, and given that all of the events at every Olympics are athletic in nature, there is a totally valid reason to combine the Medal counts from Winter and Summer Olympic Games. I would also support pages comparing Medal totals for individual Sports, like skiing, track &amp; field, etc. That said, I agree that the Medal totals should be accurate. But it still leaves us with problems like whether or not to include the Intercalated Games of 1906, what to do with medals awarded to teams of people from different countries (allowed at early Olympic Games, but not in the past 100 years), etc.Bojangles04 06:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using the all-time charts for both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games, I've corrected the combined chart down to #73 which is currently Liechtenstein. I would appreciate if others who would like to see the chart stay could assist me with the final count corrections and assist in double-checking the totals I have corrected (as I am very sleepy and it is possible I could have made a few mistakes).

<p>Total Keeper: It is totally harmless and quite informative at the same time. As long as a seperate list of Summer and Winter Games exists, there is no harm. Would like further clarification on what data is incorrect? The Intercalated Games of 1906 are not recognized by the IOC thus should not be included.</p>

There are no 'case-by-case' issues. There is a listing there of things that do not require deletion, such as inaccuracy, and things that do require it. Inconveniance is not listed anywhere near that list. I urge you to read the relevent policies and guidelines first. And if he's accusing us of libel, and we see that we are guilty of that behavior, then change it. If he just wants a nice, positive article with no negatives, he can go jump in a lake.

<li>Three things:
<dl>
<dd>1. The page is unmaintainable for no other reason than the fact that (i) there are a number of people who want to use the article to push POV and defamation, and (ii) nobody wants to do the hard work of understanding the issues around Schwartz so that they can look after the article. Uninformed editors looking out for the page has not worked in the past, it will not work in the future.</dd>
<dd>2. If someone competent turns up who would be willing to do the work necessary to fill the roile I described, great. Then the case for the AfD would vanish and we could look forward to having a decent article on Schwartz.</dd>
<dd>3. Jimbo would like us to have a decent article on Schwartz, but he knows about my plans to put forward this AfD and has not objected to it. There's some kudos for anyone willing to look after the article. --- <b>Charles Stewart</b><sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChalst_00d6.html" title="User talk:Chalst">(talk)</a></sup> 15:31, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Schwartz obviously merits a page here and the article is not too bad as it stands.

<p>Article ranges from untrue to unverifiable. Supposedly a musician. Also supposedly "more notorious as an Internet phenomenon than as a musician". Let's put it this way, a mere 932 Google hits, inflated by Wikipedia mirrors and postings on a message board that is itself barely notable at best (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_I_Love_Music_ce99.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/I Love Music">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/I Love Music</a>), does not qualify as an Internet phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination. She shouldn't have an article as an Internet phenomenon, is there any reason she should have one as a musician? The top external link, her "attack" on Norah Jones, does not refer to even so much as a review she wrote, but a sentence she put in the comments section of someone else's review. Many of the links, including anything SF Weekly may have written about her, do not work. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:15, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This gallery has collaborated with Unicef, is very well-known and esteemed among those who study children's art, and has collected over 1,000 pictures and paintings from 66 countries over a 9-year period, the largest such collection on the Internet. What definition of "noteworthy" does this website not meet? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Jennie7 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jennie7_68b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jennie7">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> True but it wouldn't exist without the 9 years of donated time Jason has given to this project (I've had the good fortune to meet this very dedicated young man). 1000+ children around the world have been given the joy and encouragement of seeing their artwork on the Internet. Where else could we find the future artists of the world than among the children of today? If anyone who has voted "delete" has an unfulfilled childhood dream, please reconsider.
