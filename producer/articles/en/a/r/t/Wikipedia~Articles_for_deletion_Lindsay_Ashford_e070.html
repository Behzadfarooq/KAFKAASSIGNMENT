<li>I vote KEEP! This man is so brave to put himself in a position of being burned at the stake for his beliefs, and his position that all humans - even pedophiles - have basic human rights. Anyone voting to delete this page is against liberty. - Kaliko Kat (By the way, I have an account, kalikokat, but I do not know how to post replies here.) By the way, I had this account for a half a month before posting this vote here, so it is not a sock puppet vote.</li>
<li>Whether the article is notable or not, "disgusting" is not a criteria for removing something from Wikipedia. I'm going to <b>abstain</b> for now. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 01:29, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whatever you think of Ashford and his "self-identified pedophilia", you can't get away from the fact that he's a well-known individual.

<li>Disgusting-ness is not a deletion criteria. It's not our place as editors to judge this fellow's activities or interests.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Lindsay Ashford is <i>very</i> notable--among <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girllover.html" title="Girllover">girllovers</a>. He returns few google hits, but in this case the google test is inaccurate; two pages define virtually half his "encyclopedic" importance. The first is his own site, <a href="http://www.puellula.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.puellula.org/" rel="nofollow"><i>puellula: a celebration of the splendor of little girls</i></a> (and its central section <a href="http://hfp.puellula.org/" class="external text" title="http://hfp.puellula.org/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Human Face of Pedophilia</i></a>). This page was the first of its kind, and remains the most important by far. It made him the first girllover to leverage the power of the internet to spread the moral girllove movement. The second is the online hub of the online English-speaking girllove world, <a href="http://www.annabelleigh.net" class="external text" title="http://www.annabelleigh.net" rel="nofollow"><i>Girl Chat</i></a>, on which he was a former moderator and frequent contributor (under the psudeonym <i>Amator Puellularum</i>). The online girllove community is, by necessity, small, tight-knit, and heavily defended. There are only half a dozen serious English pro-girllove sites on the internet, and for obvious reasons they have few outside linkers to boost their google ratings. In addition, much of the girllove community's ineractions are invisible to google, consisting of emails, etc. To delete this article would be an act of bigotry or ignorance, and I hope I've removed any chance of the latter. 24.17.5.50 18:43, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So being important to a small, tightnit group of pedophiles makes someone notable?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:13, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. Being (very) <i>notable</i> to a "small, tight[k]nit group" which is itself very notable gives him <i>encyclopedic importance</i>. Compare <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Thorstad_8a83.html" title="David Thorstad">David Thorstad</a> from <a href="../../../n/a/m/NAMBLA_7d55.html" title="NAMBLA">NAMBLA</a>. (I'll link <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove.html" title="Childlove">Childlove</a> here for general reference.)
<dl>
<dd>I really don't think that's what it means to be notable. I'm not suggesting a person has to be known all over the world, but if he's only signifincant within a small movement like "childlove" then perhaps he warrants a mention on that page, but not his own article.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:54, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain from processing</b>. I was about to process this, but we have to look at consensus, not mere numbers. I count 20 delete votes plus nominator, eight keep votes, and four abstentions. Disgusting is not a criteria for deletion, far from it - however, being disgusting does not make you notable by default. Also, even if his website is notable - which has not been shown - that does not make the creator of the website notable. If the notability of the subject is only due to his pedophilia, and if his website is not similarly notable, then delete is the only option. However, he may be notable <i>within the movement</i> - and since we have articles on the movement, then the movement is sufficiently notable. I do not know, and the vote was not unanimous, though it was obviously tilted towards delete. So I abstain from picking an outcome to this debate. Too close to call between "err towards keep" and "consensus to delete". <b>I suggest the debate be extended.</b> --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:06, May 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If your concern is that editors are voting to delete out of disgust rather than for valid reasons, I think it is misplaced; IMHO, only two delete votes focus more on "disgusting" than "not notable" or "self-promotion" (that is, the original nominator's vote, and perhaps Doc Glasgow's). Also, I submit that, even though 24.17.5.50 suggests that the subject is notable, the subject is not <i>verifiably</i> so through the private emails, etc., that he cites. The Google Test, for what it's worth, points to "not notable," and I don't feel the lone newspaper interview is an indication of significant notability. The self-promotion aspect concerns me greatly, as well. I don't have a problem with an extended debate, but I think the correct course of action is pretty clear in this case. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 22:20, May 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how it can be said there is not a consensus with the vote being 20 to 8 in favor of deletion. Also it is unfair in my opinon, to discount a vote because the voter expressed disgust. Yes it's possible that their opinion was tainted by their disgust, but it's also possible that their disgust did not influence their vote. Some people expressed disgust and voted "keep". Do we assume that their disgust influenced their vote? Can we therefore automatically assume that those who voted "delete" where influenced by their own disgust?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:50, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
