<li><b>Keep</b>, I think there is precedent that we can have both. Lists can do things that categories can't--such as have both romanji and kanji/kana. It's easier and nicer to browse than a category in many ways. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How so? I find it difficult to search through so many different individual articles when I could just have all the notable musicians in one category. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In categories you may have to go "next 200" several times before finding what you want. On a list you just have to scroll down. Also lists allow for annotation and red-links. The red-links on the list could include significant J-Pop artists. Japanese people are, surprisingly, underrepresented at Wikipedia when you consider that Japan is a large and modern nation.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 02:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I wasn't going to use T. Anthony's argument... but... In a category you will see a link to Hitomi Yaida. On a list page you can see "Hitomi Yaida (矢井田瞳)" You may not think that's a big deal... but, it can be useful I believe. Lists are more versatile and I just don't see a reason to delete it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 13:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I find that being split up into 26 articles is less convenient than pressing a button a few times. I also don't see how catering to lazy users is a reason for keeping such articles. Also, if an artist is notable enough, an article will be created for him/her/them. If not, then including a red link does nothing but spam up Wikipedia when some random obsessed fan decides to clog up the AfD process by writing an article about a non-notable musician. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Red-links can help when you're interested in improving coverage of a style of music even if you don't know every individual in it. For example I found <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_pianists.html" title="List of jazz pianists">List of jazz pianists</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brazilian_musicians_19e6.html" title="List of Brazilian musicians">List of Brazilian musicians</a> useful in starting articles. I saw a name I wasn't familiar with and then checked if it was notable at music sites I know. Then on creating it the article is now available for those who know more. That's how the article on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cables_0a54.html" title="George Cables">George Cables</a> got started.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'll concede that, but the article gives <a href="http://wiki.theppn.org/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://wiki.theppn.org/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">this website</a> as the source for most of the names. If nothing else, that link can be saved while the rest can be deleted and each musician judged on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 03:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As there <i>is</i> no kanji/kana names in the list right now, we have no way to argue for or against such an addition because we don't know what it will look like. Also, the threshold of "J-POP" is not defined well in the list. Remember, J-POP covers rock, soul, R&amp;B, and other genres, so it's a very wide category. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 03:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Indiscriminate list that's better served by a category. The kana argument is invalid. There are two or three entries on the list which use kana. It's not a big loss. The red link argument is invalid as these titles can be added to the Japan requested articles red link farm where they can be properly fed and looked after: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested_articles/Japan</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 13:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not invalid... just hasn't been done yet. There is a big difference. Someday this will be the best of featured lists... no doubt... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 14:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think both gren's kana/kanji argument and the red link argument are valid. It does serve good as a good starting point when I find wikipedia has zero information on a particular artist. Also converting this to a category is uncessary since it is largely covered by <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_musicians_733b.html" title="Category:Japanese musicians">Category:Japanese musicians</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_musical_groups_5f53.html" title="Category:Japanese musical groups">Category:Japanese musical groups</a>. This list should be preserved for the unique value it presents not available in these categories. -<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydia_1367.html" title="User:Rydia">rydia</a> 14:22, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hey, guess what? This is EN Wikipedia, not a place to cater to Japanophile interests. Most people will not know the Japanese kana or kanji. Per <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">User:Kunzite</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a> is a much better place to store red links and since this list has zero information on any artist besides the name, this article is a terrible place to start research on them. A sub-category for J-pop musicians is entirely feasible too. In conclusion, this list does nothing unique. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I always use this list over the wiki generated category list because the wiki category generated list sucks. Delete that one how am I suppose to know what Jap related artists I need to be working on if there isn't a list like this to fucking tell me.

<li>First of all, I like how the reasoning has changed since the AFD was opened. "not notable enough to have their own article" has morphed to "well, list them someplace else". So, are all red links in articles a bad idea? Red links should just be added to a project which may or may not be accessed by the users who read the article (list) and would otherwise have an incentive to create new information for Wikipedia? And the premise that there is no room for both categories and lists for a topic has been debated many times in the past, and judging from the 110 lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_musicians_by_genre_f63f.html" title="Category:Lists of musicians by genre">Category:Lists of musicians by genre</a> alone, I would have to assume that there must be a good reason to keep both the lists and categories. Adding kanji to the name in the categorization is an interesting idea (a rarity for AFD lately, it seems), and I think I'll bring that up at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> where Japanese naming conventions are discussed. It still wouldn't change the fact that the list is useful. The 26 sub-lists are less useful, and I agree that they can be deleted, because they duplicate info on the main list. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added that addendum because <a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">User:T. Anthony</a> explained that some notable artists may not have articles simply because of Wikipedia's systemic bias against non-English speaking subjects. The notability of a person is independent of the state of having an article and I changed my argument to say that this list is not the proper place where articles should be requested and that <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a> is the proper place to do that. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you. However there are reasons some of us prefer working on lists rather than requested articles. I worked on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_music_7fa9.html#Jazz" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/music">Wikipedia:Requested_articles/music#Jazz</a> for a time, but then went back to working on lists. Why? Because frankly lists are usually better done. Requested articles is often just a dumping ground that mixes notable people with some local musician someone like. Lists actually tend to have more legitimately notable people because lists are

<li><b>Keep</b> Lists can be more informative than categories, by adding more information than a simple article title, and by arranging the subjects in a more informative way than a category can. However, beyond the red links, this list does not yet take advantage of the advantages a list can have over a category. Keep, but make the list more useful. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 23:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categories can have organization too. It's not too difficult to simply have sub-cats for a Category:J-pop artists which would include things like Category:J-rock artists, or the like. In that way, the categories could organize the articles in the same way you mentioned, if not better. For example, if someone wanted to find other visual kei artists, they could simply click on the sub-cat "Visual kei artists" and be linked to all the other artists in that group. However, unless you want to spam the link to this article on every single J-pop artist's page, it would be difficult to locate this page in the first place and even then, it would be difficult to find the artist you're looking for. If there's something else you'd like to add, please do. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep, with stipulations</b> (Edit conflict) This list has the potential to be useful, but needs some serious work first. First and foremost, the list needs to be renamed, to something along the lines of Japanese musical artists. It includes not only J-pop artists, but it also claims to include <a href="../../../j/-/r/J-Rock_a7c7.html" title="J-Rock">J-Rock</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_Kei_fa9d.html" title="Visual Kei">Visual Kei</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_hip_hop.html" title="Japanese hip hop">Japanese hip hop</a> artists as well. Second, loose the sublists. All the information contained in them can be found in the main article, really the only reason for a sublist in this case would be if the page over the size limit, which it is not. If there are any sublists to be in there, I would say that this should be made into a hierachical list, because the list says it includes 4 distinct genres. Third, the article needs to have some serious clean-up work done. Mainly, it directly conflicts with <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a>, specifically the section on <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html#Names_of_modern_figures" title="WP:MOS-JA">modern names</a> by going in Japanese, rather than Western order. If people have a problem with all the red links, there probably wouldn't be any problem with them being summarily moved over to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Japan_48b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan</a>; somebody wanted them, might as well see if someone can make a decent article on them. I personally don't have a problem with them, though, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_violinists.html" title="List of violinists">List of violinists</a> has plenty of red links, and its more well-done than this list. Finally the list should definantly note that it is incomplete; I'm sure that some of the Japanese musical artists we have on Wikipedia who fall into the genres covered by this list. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 02:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I never said that it was too broad, just improperly titled. I find that lists are generally tend to be, when well-maintained, much more user-friendly, which is the basis of why I feel it should be kept. It needs clean-up, but lists have value in that it make it more accessable for the average user. If you take note, most musical genres have both lists of aritsts within them and categories relating to them; this seems to be standard in almost every single case. To give a <i>very</i> abbreviated list, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_metalcore_bands.html" title="List of metalcore bands">List of metalcore bands</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetalcore_musical_groups_1c0a.html" title="Category:Metalcore musical groups">Category:Metalcore musical groups</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_death_metal_bands.html" title="List of death metal bands">List of death metal bands</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Category%7EDeath_metal_musical_groups_7a2b.html" title="Category:Death metal musical groups">Category:Death metal musical groups</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_musicians.html" title="List of jazz musicians">List of jazz musicians</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_jazz_musicians_47ee.html" title="Category:Lists of jazz musicians">Category:Lists of jazz musicians</a>, etc. There doesn't seem to be any reason why there cannot both be a list and a category.

<li>For the sake of argument, is there anything those lists provides that the categories don't? Personally, I find it easier to navigate between articles within a category. For example, let's say that hypothetically, I wanted to from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Precious_Blood_%28band%29_e4ee.html" title="Most Precious Blood (band)">Most Precious Blood</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_by_Stereo_e69b.html" title="Death by Stereo">Death by Stereo</a>. With a category, I could simply click on the category link at the bottom to see a list of articles within the category. For the list option, I would fist have to know that a list exists (which most people who randomly browse Wikipedia don't), then find it, then find the person I was looking for, if I didn't already know the name. That seems like a much more involved and unintuitive process compared to just having a category. The point is that we don't have two articles on Isaac Newton so we shouldn't have two articles documenting the same thing (in this case, J-pop artists), especially since one of them seems to do it better. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 03:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Umm no. When I first started here lists were easier for me. I'd heard of listing things well before I came here and Encyclopedias themselves have index. In addition to that type <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_pianists.html" title="Jazz pianists">Jazz pianists</a> and you get redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_jazz_pianists.html" title="List of jazz pianists">List of jazz pianists</a>. Or if you prefer type in "heavy metal bands" and you will get redirected to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_bands.html" title="List of heavy metal bands">List of heavy metal bands</a>. Now if I'm thinking "who is that jazz pianist whose obituary I saw in 2001?", how is a category going to help me?

<li>I think all those lists fail to grasp what it means to actually be a list, by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia's standards</a>. Now, let's take a look at a list that isn't redundant with its category: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a>. While <a href="../../../h/i/v/Category%7EHIV-positive_people_3d33.html" title="Category:HIV-positive people">Category:HIV-positive people</a> exists and is useful, this list goes beyond simply listing the name for the sake of having that person's name there. It provides a <i>substantial</i> amount of useful information that can't be achieved with a category and is also well-referenced. In its current state, this and all the other list articles that have been mentioned fail to justify their existence by including such information that a list would be required at all. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 20:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not about how long it is, it's about the J-Pop artists! I'm sorry if i sound stupid, but I believe we need to keep this list, because i've used it before, and it is very helpful, sometimes I try to find new and exciting bands using this very list. What would be the main point of destoying it? Would it be to long? There are plenty of other categories where the list is far more longer than this <i>mere</i> list, eg.

<li>Are you saying that if this article does not exist that they will be any less than J-pop artists? Do you have any specific reasons why a list is preferable to a category? The presence of another list does not justify this one's. It simply means that someone with a critical eye has not yet questioned its value.

Splitting might be a good idea, but I'm really not sure <i>how</i> this list would be split. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 04:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of lists by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia's standards</a>. Lists should provide a substantial amount of relevant information about each entry on it in order to separate it from its related category. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a> is a good example of a list of people which provides enough relevant information about each person to warrant separation from its parent category: <a href="../../../h/i/v/Category%7EHIV-positive_people_3d33.html" title="Category:HIV-positive people">Category:HIV-positive people</a>. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then how about instead of senselessly arguing for 4 more days about how little relevant information is contained in this list you go through ever artist and put in a table a brief summary on each artist. You know just because it isn't relevant to you doesn't mean it's not relevant to the other whatever million people that use this encyclopedia.<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColenFace_0146.html" title="User:ColenFace">ColenFace</a> 08:35, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I don't think I'm misunderstanding anything. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists">Wikipedia:Lists#Purpose of lists</a>, particularly item 3: "Development." I'm not saying this list couldn't be done better, but it is <i>already</i> a useful resource for development, and could readily be made even more valuable in that regard (for example, by adding entries from other (reliable) online J-pop lists). -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 10:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is roughly the point I tried to make above. A list doesn't magically begin in the best format. It has been established that lists can be done well, and just because this list is not done well, it is not suitable grounds for deletion either. Grounds for improvement, yes. I'd prefer to encourage the development of the article, not removing it because it is not up to the standards of some other lists. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 09:13, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that the pro-deletion and pro-keeping people are basically making the same argument: This list is not worth keeping <i>as it stands now.</i> The "keepers" say, let's keep it and improve it. The "deleters" say, it's not useful <i>now,</i> so let's delete it. I won't be working on the list, but my vote remains "keep," and those editors who are interested in the list should work on it. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that's a good summary of the arguments. The list in unmanageable in scope. There are lots of J-pop artists and even if the article were cleaned up or expanded beyond a mere list of artists, it would be unmanageable, out of date, or a red link farm inviting people to submit articles for artists who really aren't notable. There are a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a> style arguments here with people expressing a desire to keep because they find it easier to edit or keep track of a list. Those are not reasons to keep as you can easily do the same thing with a category. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 03:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I had to hazard a guess, I think that the number of J-Pop artists is significantly LOWER than the number of HIV infected people. I don't like making that comparison, but, since that list has been pointed to above, seems to be a good example of a list, and also seems to be managed well, claiming that the J-Pop list is unmanageable is a flawed argument. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 11:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. This whole situation is totally counter productive we're all volunteering our time to build wikipedia, a large number of hours have already been put into this page. An example of a well compiled list was given and can be replicated with the J-pop artists but for some reason the push to delete this list continues. It's easy to argue to delete a list you yourself have put 0 hours of work into but it's extremely difficult for those of us who have dedicated solid hours into building this page to see it all go completely to waste for what appears to be totally selfish reasons. This list holds extreme potential and that potential will be displayed as soon as this hostage crisis is resolved.<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColenFace_0146.html" title="User:ColenFace">ColenFace</a> 05:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't do the same thing with a category. The reason for this is simple: a category is not a list; aside from the intro text and cat tags, a category is simply the result of a live database query. Thus, a category cannot be reliable monitored, because it is impossible to track when articles have been removed from a category, and for what reasons.

<li>Actually, I think this list is worth keeping as it stands now. It could be done better, but that applies to everything on WP. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 10:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for pointing this out. And all this time, I've been trying to convince them as to <i>why</i> this article is redundant when their reason for keeping doesn't even hold a candle up to the official deletion policy. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 04:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP the list. Also, what is wrong with people creating articles for artists that "aren't notable"? Who decides who is notable and who isn't? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxedo_Mark_7674.html" title="User:Tuxedo Mark">Tuxedo Mark</a> (<a href="../../../t/u/x/User_talk%7ETuxedo_Mark_64cd.html" title="User talk:Tuxedo Mark">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tuxedo_Mark_2131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tuxedo Mark">contribs</a>) 04:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>Ummm... I think we do. Seriously, we have stuff like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to prevent a bazillion articles about random nobodies from being created. There are 5 billion people on this planet. Not every one of them deserves an article.
