<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. If I were closing it factoring purely the strength of argument, it would probably be a delete anyway, as most of the 'keep' arguments are based on "I like it".

<dd><b>Keep and cleanup</b> (and maybe rename) List of Hmong surnames. It's actually a listing of the Hmong clans, of which 18 exist; this can be cited (e.g. "18 hmong clans" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">GBooks</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:zh-TW:official&amp;client=firefox" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2218+Hmong+Clans%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:zh-TW:official&amp;client=firefox" rel="nofollow">Google</a>). So this one has definite criteria for inclusion in the list, as well as being at least a weakly notable topic. However, <b>Delete</b> the others (including List of Japanese surnames which I voted weak keep above) as being collections of random information without any particular sourcing or criteria for inclusion, and also being fairly useless for navigation given that half the links in question go to placename articles or disambiguation pages instead of articles about the surnames in question. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 14:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Others have argued there's no encyclopedic content at all here, just a list of names, and I won't disagree. The main additional point I want to raise is that there's no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> at all. Without sources, how we tell whether an item on the list really is a common name or not? The claim that particular names are common (iand others not on the list are presumably not) appears to be entirely based on editor's own <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Editors who wish the lists kept need, at a minimum, to show that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> exist capable of making <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> possible.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I just had a look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames_de0f.html" title="List of common Chinese surnames">List of common Chinese surnames</a>, and I cannot image any other reason why people want to discuss this page separately other than the fact that we are distracted by the visuality of Chinese characters. Sure, Chinese characters are used for Korean and Vietnamese surnames. But are we to assume that people with these surnames are related to their namesakes in China? If yes, please give a source for that claim. Or are they listed for no other reasons that they correspond to the Chinese surnames. Well, then we are dealing with a typical dictionary article.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 15:57, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well firstly, that article has been delisted. But secondly, perhaps that article was misnamed, but it's not a list that's been gathered together by WP editors like most other lists. That list is actually a researched and published list in real life, and the article is about that list. The fact that it gives a commonality ranking for each surname for both 1990 and 2006, so readers can look at the rankings comparatively, already makes that article encyclopedic. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I beg to differ and I want to relist the article. This article is a hodge-podge of unencyclopedic assumptions. Most common surname where? In the PRC? Taiwan? In the Chinese-speaking world as a whole? It seems that the list of common surnames is based on the PRC, which begs the question why Korean and Vietnamese names should be ranked according to the commonality in the PRC. If this article should be kept at all he only way this article should be moved to List of common surnames in the PRC, because that is what this article is about.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 18:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't stop you from re-listing it, but the issues you brought up are not criteria for deletion, they're just editorial issues, and the article is far from perfect and could use more work. Like I said, the commonality rankings alone would make the article encyclopedic, plus, the list is a researched and published list. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all and cleanup.</b> The purpose of having these lists on WP is that the articles can add extra dimensions to the names and how the culture uses them.

<li>Well, an article on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> adds little to our understanding of presidencies outside of the USA.

<dd>The burden of proof is not on me, but on those who want to keep it. The article has already been transwikied, so the information will not be lost. If the article is not be kept in Wikipedia, it should be moved to List of common surnames in the PRC, referring to the only verfied encyclopedic value of the text, which is really just a figleaf as far as I am concerned.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 19:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the burden of showing how an article meets criteria for deletion falls on the nominator. Also, without further research by WP editors, there is no evidence that the list is applicable <i>only</i> to the PRC. Furthermore, believing that the article should be renamed is not criteria for deletion. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 19:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't make the discussion more confused than it is, and please respond to my substantive arguments. I have already told you what policy I think this group of articles violate and I have also stated why I think this article is inappropriately named. To the extent that the burden of proof is on me, I have already fulfilled my part. Now the ball is in your court.</dd>
<dd>As for applicability to the PRC, I note that the article for 2006 states "调查涉及全国１１１０个县和市，得到了２．９６亿人口的数据，共获得姓氏４１００个。" I also note that the book quoted for 1990 is published in Beijing and I think it is reasonable to assume that this book is based on PRC data only.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 21:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um... You haven't really said anything substantive. You've cited <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, but as I've said, the listing is a researched and published list, it has comparative commonality rankings, etc etc. More than one editor have stated that this is not just a mere list with no other information. And this article is not a genealogy. Please actually read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, the genealogy clause pertains to biological articles or listings of persons to show only genealogical relations. It doesn't even apply to this list because it's not a biographical article, nor is it a genealogy. And again, believing that the article is misnamed is not criteria for deletion - simply to say, do you believe the article should be renamed, or do you believe it should be deleted? There are two completely different sets of criteria for the two. Also, just because it was published in Beijing, and that it says it's about common surnames in the whole country does not necessarily mean it excludes Taiwan. If this publication is PRC-government related at all, I'm pretty sure it will claim to include Taiwan. But this whole issue is a different discussion altogether. You've mentioned nothing that actually warrants the deletion of this article. It just seems like you don't like it, that's all. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Personally I think it was way to early for Japanes surnames to be transwikied, considering there are way over 200,000 Japanese surnames in existence. If this list was deleted, what you would have is a very incomplete list that has been transwikied with no access to the easiest of the wikies, and the information on a much less used wiki, to edit on to help fill in gaps and finish it.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamb_4927.html" title="User:Williamb">Williamb</a> 22:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand this comment at all. Could you please explain why the articles are encyclopedic?

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the creator of the List of Luo surnames, I can say that the comment "no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose" does not apply there.
