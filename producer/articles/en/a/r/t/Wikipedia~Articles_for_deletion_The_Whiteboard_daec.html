<li>Requiring paper sales or references would greatly handicap the ability to list any web-based medium...even Wikipedia...should we delete that, too? (/sarcasm). But seriously, Baen's Universe, SF.com and several other publications are web-based only. There are a number of other web-based comics listed here, including (forex) Schlock Mercenary. I agree the character backgrounds could be a bit less sales-y, but that's an easy fix. There's no direct marketing, and the strip does have a large international readership.209.43.8.126 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)Michael Z. Williamson</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this is a good example of a failing in the WP:WEB current policy. This is a paintball-themed web comic, and is NOTABLE and WELL-KNOWN within the paintball community. The problem that WP:WEB fails to address is that even though 10 million people play paintball every year, the industry has underdeveloped traditional media outlets, so being well-known and notable does not transfer to being published due to a lack of traditional publishing outlets for paintball.

<li>I hate to ask this, but feel I must. The books are clearly posted on the site and have legitimate ISBNs. Fan following is worldwide. References and reprints exist in industry magazines with large readership. Comic is highly ranked on multiple webcomic surveys and award lists.

So the question is, since you make a point of claiming veganism, is this an attempt to delete a comic that just recently had an extended thread extolling the virtues of killing, cooking and eating animals in a vicarious fashion?

<li>Agreeing here - Based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> there has been a citation of sources. This goes back to my original point - these magazines are worldwide distributed, but does not replicate all content online... how does one "prove" the citation other than mailing a copy of the said magazine to the person that tags the article as non-cited?--Nitehawk337 18:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The unreferenced tag leads you to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing_sources</a> which explains citing sources. The short version is that it's done through standard footnotes (with issue numbers, dates of publication, page numbers, etc).

<li><b>Reply:</b> Important to the article, or important as a reference <i>for</i> the article? As far as the average <i>online</i> reader is concerned, the publication or nonpublication is of lesser relevance than a description of the strip itself. The data is not irrelevant, and clearly satisfies Wikipedia's notability standards, but in regards to the readability and clarity of the article, it probably doesn't necessarily need to be "above the fold". DocsMachine 05:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the reason this comic is important is that it has been published in these magazines, then that ought to be mentioned in the introduction. See <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> -- a featured article on a webcomic -- and note how the intro talks about the reason why it's important (its popularity, its print publication by DC comics, its review by The New York Times, etc.) long before the characters and plots are described. Descriptions of real world impact and historical significance are more important than plot summaries and character descriptions. This has little to do with whether the article ought to be deleted, so let's continue this on the article's talk page if this needs to be continued. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If that is the case, looking at the article for <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a>, an obviously notable webcomic, nothing is stated at the top of the article about the notability and importance of the comic that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiteboard_2e57.html" title="The Whiteboard">The Whiteboard</a> doesn't have (Readership statistics, longevity statements, publications, etc). So by that reasoning, either <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a> is not a notable webcomic and fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiteboard_2e57.html" title="The Whiteboard">The Whiteboard</a> IS notable and passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightfalke_7d56.html" title="User:Nightfalke">Nightfalke</a> 15:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The second sentence of <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a> is sourced to the Washington Post.

<p><b>Addendum:</b> As noted above, high-resolution snapshots of each magazine example can be <a href="http://docsmachine.smugmug.com/gallery/2235336" class="external text" title="http://docsmachine.smugmug.com/gallery/2235336" rel="nofollow">found here</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> Doc, you may want to put a copyright notice saying you release the photo of the book for use on this page.Sniper1rfa 05:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply:</b> Noted. Actually, I'd prefer an image more representative of the strip, and less a "buy my book!" ad. I wasn't necessarily interested in a direct-to-the-sales-page link to the books, as I agree with Wikipedia in that this article isn't intended to be advertising. Though for notability discussion reasons, it's probably necessary for the moment. Could someone show me how to change the image, or where to upload a new image to?

</ul>
<ul>
<li>'<b>Query:</b> Who decides a discussion is "closed"? As far as I can tell, this article meets Wikipedia standards for notability, at least for a webcomic, so who offically declares the Article for Deletion open, closed or kept or deleted? DocsMachine 07:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>About five days after the discussion is opened, a few more if there's a backlog. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 08:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
