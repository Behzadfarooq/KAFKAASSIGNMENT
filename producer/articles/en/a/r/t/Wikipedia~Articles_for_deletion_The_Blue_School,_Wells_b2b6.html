<li>Update: The article has since had information and sources added. This should remove the deletion concerns. As far as age equaling notability, at least in America those structures that have stood the test of time are given a special place of prominence. During our Bicentennial celebration, houses that could be shown to have been around before a certain time period were allowed to be marked and tours could be given. <a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbagot_183b.html" title="User:Bbagot">Bbagot</a> 04:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>None of the links make it notable. The press release doesn't count, because it's not independent. There are thousands of buidings from around that time in the UK - a little cottage I lived in dated from that time, and that was in no way notable! (Not that that counts as evidence fot my argument, I know.) There's not claim that the school is still in the old building, anyway. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="blue">ConDem</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability neither asserted nor demonstrated. The assertion made above that just because something is old it is automatically notable is just silly: imagine applying the same reasoning to people - my grandmother would immediately get her own Wikipedia entry. Just possibly the "oldest" of a category may be notable, but to claim notability for being the "umpteen-th oldest item" is very peculiar indeed. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 11:03, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Quite the contrary: my grandmother is old, but she is not notable because she is not adequately documented by independent sources. Here on Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wp:notability">notability is not subjective</a>. This is a well-established principle. Simply because something is old, or big, or small, or young, or <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wp:notability">you happen to like it</a> does not make it notable. It bears repeating in virtually every debate on schools articles: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html#The_common_notability_criterion" title="Wp:notability">a topic is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable</a> to support an article about it. Every other article in Wikipedia has to stick to these principles, but in every school debate we get variants of the line "all schools are notable", or "I think this is notable", or "I like it". This is fine, and if anyone wants to set up a directory of all schools on the planet they're very welcome to do so, but the criteria we have here are different: we have a technical definition of notability that is independent of your preferences, or mine, or any other editor's. But there is a small, vocal, number of editors who think that their preferences should over-ride this fundamental principle, simply because "they like it". One of the great tragedies of Wikipedia is that the "pro school" people think that there's a bunch of people out there who are "anti school": I'm certainly not, as my record shows, and I'm highly confident that neither are most people. All I want, and I suspect all that most people want, is for the same rules on notability to be applied to the subjects of all articles. We can indulge in technical quibbles about whether school sports results in local newspapers count as adequate references if you like, but the bottom line is that what I want is fairness, and not to have the particular preferences of one group imposed on the project as a whole. You say that I am missing the point, but it is you who is missing the point: Wikipedia is a shared, collective endeavour in which we all agree to be bound by common standards. When you try to impose your views by claiming that all X are per se notable it is you, not I, who is breaking the social contract that unites Wikipedia editors, because you are not accepting the general principle of notability that guides and binds us, but imposing your own. To say "I like this, so it must be so" is not the mark of someone who wants to be part of a larger commonweal, but the mark of the unco-operative, the petulant or the dictatorial. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not denying that this article needs sources, but I still say that a School with a history of over 350 years is asserting notability. That history needs verifying. The guideline you quote "is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable" is all very well, but in my opinion it is confusing notability with verifiability. Something can have lots of sources which are reliable, in the sense of reporting something correctly, but they can be sources about something that is trivial. I am not saying "I like this". I know nothing about the School. Nor am I saying "All Schools are notable". I am saying that very old Schools are at least asserting notability. People should be adding reliable sources and developing this article. A very old School will have had many notable alumni and will have played a significant role in its community. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A very old school need not have had any notbale alumni. If there are notbale alumni, then this is very probably a notable school. But this doesn't follow on from the fact that it's old. Something can very easily be old and not notable. Basically, a mention of notable alumni would be an assertion of notability. It doesn't mention any. Simply being old is not enough. There are no other assertions of notability. Therefore, it doesn't assert notability. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="blue">ConDem</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></sup> 00:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, and it actually works <i>against</i> the "keep" vote that the citing editor gave... no time limit means we wait until something is clearly notable before including it.
