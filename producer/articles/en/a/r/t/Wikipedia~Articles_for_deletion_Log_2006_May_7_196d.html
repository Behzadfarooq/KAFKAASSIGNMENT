<p>This was prodded by Anon 66.167.136.142 with the comment "His notability is unclear." - which isn't the same as "non notable", and google suggests that he may be borderline enough for those in the know to suggest saving.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> A7. Whether he's notable may be questionable. However, clearly the article does not assert any notability. I'm unable to google anything that really seems to point to the right person. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:34, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No To Speedy Delete, A Qualified Yes to Delete</b> If the author can be contacted to ask about what makes Norman Shapiro notable, he ought to be. At the least, the "considered for deletion" should be there long enough that if someone knows what makes him notable he has time to explain. If we still don't know a week from now anything notable about him, then...yes, delete. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/1/3/User%7EK13060_cf37.html" title="User:K13060">K13060</a> (<a href="../../../k/1/3/User_talk%7EK13060_137f.html" title="User talk:K13060">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_K13060_a2a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/K13060">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>There a few separate movements noted here. But the title of this article implies that there's one, reasonably unified movement. Which (depite the opening paragraph blurb about "for the purposes of this article...") gives a false impression that I don't think a good encyclopedia should be giving. Maybe the different individuals and groups will become more unified at some point, and at that point an article with this title would be fair. But right now this article, through its title, gives an impression which does not reflect reality. In my view, it's wrong for an encyclopedia to do that. Perhaps my objection is only with the title rather than the info outlined in the article. But I still think that's a reasonable objection for me to raise. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 03:54, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are extensive discussions in the archives about the article title and attempts to rename it. Article titles are place-holders, matters of convenience. They do not specify that something "exists". For example you will find encyclopedia articles called <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_science.html" title="Medieval science">medieval science</a> in many encyclopedias, but science did not even exist until the modern era - but we call it that because people know what it means (it was actually called "natural philosophy"). The text of the article is what is most important. Many professional encyclopedias use the phrase "for the purposes of this article" in the first paragraph, commonly done, it is a useful tool. The article really goes out of its way to define exactly what is meant and makes no claim what so ever of a "unified" movement. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 04:04, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nevertheless this article's title gives a false impression about something very current. I still think that's wrong for an encyclopedia of the quality that Wikipedia aspires to be. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 04:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Über-strong Keep</b> This article has <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_0daf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Movement to impeach George W. Bush">already survived VfD</a>. Articles cannot violate WP:CIVIL, WP:NPA. (Nor do they personally attack Bush in an uncivil manner, but instead cite people and articles who dispute his policies' legality.) WP:BEANS is just an essay, not a guideline nor policy. Furthermore, WP:BEANS only advises us, in a somewhat humorous way, not to do give ideas out on how to disrupt Wikipedia. (I guess, though, we are giving ideas on how to disrupt the govt of the US, but that's not the issue here.) "No chance in hell of this being reality" is wrong. Perhaps you are disputing the chances of impeachment, but that is not what this article is about. This article is about people who called for Bush to be impeached. There are some people calling for impeachment, thus the reality of the movement's existence is at 100%. If the article were titled "Impeachment of Bush", then you would have a point. Now to attack the contentions of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR. A read of the article reveals many sources, from which information has been taken and collected in this article. There are some 65 external links in the article text. Clearly, original research just isn't here. There are no personal interviews, personal polls conducted, nor uncited lawyerly thinkings. As for WP:NPOV, this article is as detached from the issue and neutral as I have seen. I believe it provides a third party accounting of the issue at hand. The article has not made assertions that were found elsewhere from reliable sources, but instead simply reports on what other people say. The only possible problem that I see, would be the lack of discussion about the people who are against this movement, however, as some have pointed on the article's Talk page, it is nonexistent, and the article does mention a little bit about a <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html#White_House_reaction" title="Movement to impeach George W.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've read most of the current article and see a neutral reporting of why some people think the President should be impeached.

This article is becoming quite comprehensive and has several pages of citations for it to just be a soapbox for the mythological liberal bias.

<li><b>Keep and Clean Up</b> - I agree with Nescio (gasp!) in that this looks like an abuse of the AfD system. I do have problems with this article but they are problems that can be remedied through constructive editing by level-headed editors from both points of view (ideally, from editors neutral on the topic). I've always had a vague discomfort with the title (mostly with the connotations of "movement") as well as the fact that all the examples given are far-left objections. The article should also mention that at 31% approval rating, there are some Conservatives that are calling for investigations on issues like failing to secure the borders, uncontrolled spending, etc. There <i>are</i> a few noteworthy people calling for impeachment and a few in Congress that are willing to listen...and if the Dems win a majority in November, hearings could become a reality. I think it's worthy of an article here, but as presently written, needs to be cleaned up, NPOV-ized, and de-soapboxed.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 16:30, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - better to have a stub than nothing. Google Scholar gives 40 hits, most under JSTOR which I can't access. Appears to possibly have another meaning in current usage based on Google Book results. It was in 1902 important enough to be covered in text books for the New York City schoolchildren. Term appears in records of U.S. appellate courts from as recently as the 1990s. Has appeared as a term of importance in U.S. Supreme court cases. Appears in course curriculum descriptions for some U.S. law school courses. "sofixit" appears to apply to those who feel it has been a stub for too long. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:11, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

It can be delivered at any range within this point, but it requires that the body-tensing be performed earlier, upon impact wherever it occurs. Timing is critical, unlike with the twisting punch, which thrusts through whatever it hits, if it is not jammed early. In either case the punch is not rising but horizontal. This article does make some unsubstantiated generalizations. I agree with some of them, others don't make much sense. Ultimaely, I have to agree with above. I'm not even sure why the entry for Karate punch should exist. In Karate, there are a number of punches, including straight punches, jabs, crossing punches, uppercusts, hooks, and descending punches. Perhaps there could be a section under punch in general, but I don't think there's such a thing as a Karate punch. It kind of reminds me of the Austin Powers Judo Chop.

<p>Page consists of 1) a vague and POV paragraph that doesn't contain any useful or relevant information, 2) a list of arbitrarily selected historical figures considered important, together with a possible copyvio from VH1 of dubious importance and notability. why should we be especially interested in VH1's opinions, as opposed to any other source?

The information written by Waffelknocker is real, truthful, and accurate. It has nothing to do with any fake bank or scam in London, nor is it a scam, or part of a scam. Executor-usa</p>

<p><b>Reply</b>: OITC did not initiate the original article about it. It is a victim of a misinformation campaign. Replies were written to present accurate facts that will stand up as truthful evidence, and historical facts. You suggest that a pr campaign is being undertaken by OITC. Nonsense. The replies and writings are facts in response to anothers' misinformation and defamation. My comments are mine alone. On my talk page I have stated that factual documents were sent to the parent of Wikipedia, and am sure that the same are available to Wikipedia's parent corporate lawyers and Board of Trustees. I support the writing of a factual, accurate article as a historical necessity. However, if such is to be written, its tenure would be the opposite of the current ideas being espoused that it is either a fraud or a hoax. It is a very important organization, and is quite real. signed Executor-usa <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExecutor-usa_49d9.html" title="User:Executor-usa">Executor-usa</a> (<a href="../../../e/x/e/User_talk%7EExecutor-usa_6dee.html" title="User talk:Executor-usa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Executor-usa_a959.html" title="Special:Contributions/Executor-usa">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>\ Reply: Most of the people voicing their beliefs here are very young. Please be aware that the people who are knowledgable about OITC and CCB are very senior people in governments, central banks, and major banks.The degree of experience to make such judgements by the majority of the commentors is just deficient. I suggest that you refrain from calling something a hoax, a fraud, or not real, when you have no basis, or knowledge, to make such pronouncements. In the end the facts support OITC and CCB whether you like it or not. Executor-usa</p>

<dd>Uh huh.

<p>Reply: The intentional disregard of facts and documents sent to Wikimedia and Wikipedia is not a virtue. Perhaps your self description on your talk page as being insane is accurate. Further, if you think Google results will provide you the truth you are very mistaken.Labelling an institution a fake bank and a scam is very defamatory and is unsupported by fact or truth.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Rules can be established, yes, and we already have one: No "new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position." But most pages like this one are full of original research. They rely far too heavily on primary sources and become link farms. For many of these things, there just aren't a whole lot of secondary sources anyway. What can we do? The pages are followed by the people who care most about them, and this is what we get. Wikipedia seems to have, de facto, two tiers: Real encyclopedia articles, and sandbox articles. This is one of the latter. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:02, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The theory is <b>not</b> that "Bush killed JFK." I think it is that right-wing anti-Castro extremists did so, and that Bush knew them for both business (oil drilling between Florida and Cuba) and political reasons. I don't share this view, but it is one of many theories about the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination</a>. Btw, are you suggesting that Bush Sr had <b>no</b> prior experience with the CIA before he became CIA Director on 30 January 1976 (until 20 January 1977),<a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/bush.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cia.gov/cia/information/bush.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and that based on this mere 355 days on the job the CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA was permanently named after him? Just curious. No-one credible suggests that "Bush orchestrated 9/11" -- but this false belief is widely held, hence it is important to debunk.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article clearly and expressly presents these as conspiracy theories, it does not assert that all are true. (Indeed, it seems to go overboard in this.) Many are widely-believed. This is a great place to debunk any false charges. Actual conspiracies do abound, "tin-hat" pejoratives notwithstanding. Every accusation of a criminal or covert operation is initially a "conspiracy theory" until, bit by bit, the evidence mounts that it is likely true or false. (Some die-hards will always deny this truth, so it is almost never black-and-white. Many actual conspiracies are never proven -- false negatives. So there will always remain a grey area.) Some proven examples include the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Contra_Affair_3376.html" title="Iran-Contra Affair">Iran-Contra Affair</a> (illegal arms sales to Iran as an attempt to free hostages from Hezbollah and obtain money to illegally fund the Nicaraguan contras); the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Pigs_2c0b.html" title="Bay of Pigs">Bay of Pigs</a>; the CIA-supported overthrow of Iran's democratically-elected leader, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Mossadegh_24b7.html" title="Mohammed Mossadegh">Mossadegh</a> (who was replaced by Shah Pahlavi, whose repression led to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and current rule by mullahs); the CIA-supported overthrow of Guatemala's democratically-elected <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n_48fa.html" title="Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán">Arbenz</a> (who won Guatemala's first universal-suffrage election with 60% of the vote, marking the first peaceful transition of power in Guatemala's history); the CIA-supported overthrow (and murder) of Chile's democratically-elected <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Allende_6d40.html" title="Salvador Allende">Allende</a>; <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enron.html" title="Enron">Enron</a>'s manipulation of energy markets with fraudulent business practices like "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_%28Business%29_2fb1.html" title="Death Star (Business)">Death Star</a>"; the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Incident_a0b8.html" title="Gulf of Tonkin Incident">Gulf of Tonkin Incident</a> (a fabrication which prompted <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B.

Given the role of GHW Bush as CIA Director, it strains credulity to believe that the full truth is yet known about operations he supported then and as President. The revolutionary beauty of Wikipedia is that it is both a repository of knowledge developed from the grass-roots (unlike top-down knowledge which stems from goverment- or corporate-funded research), and a platform for the development of that grass-roots knowledge.

Contrast that family network with Bill: you have Hillary and Roger. That's it. This article belongs here precisely because of the power the Bush family has exercised.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Regardless of whether you agree with the theories, some of the theories mentioned have been taken seriously in the world's media. And in particular the linking of Oil to the Iraq invasion is accepted my almost everyone in the UK regardless of whether they support the war or not, certainly friends of the Bush family if not the Bush family itself will profit from Iraqi oil. I think it is accepted that there are links between the Bush family and some relatives of Osma Bin Laden in Saudi Arabia too.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Clearly the article would need a lot of work.

Also <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_crime_family.html" title="Bush crime family">Bush crime family</a> which redirects to this seems to be a more common term (187,000 hits on Google for +"bush crime family" -wikipedia). The concept of a <a href="../../../g/u/c/GUCT_303b.html" title="GUCT">Unified Conspiracy Theory</a> linking all the crimes and alleged crimes committed by or connected to the Bushes, as the title suggests, would appear to be a less common concept.

The issue here as I see it is whether or not this particular phrase is reflective of an aspect of the Scottish national psyche. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 13:41, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Shouldn't there be an article on Scottish egalitarian sentiment, rather than on a phrase describing it? I also note that very few, if any, online Scottish dictionaries and phrasebooks carry this phrase. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Scottish+phrases%22+%22Jock+Tamson%27s+bairns%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Scottish+phrases%22+%22Jock+Tamson%27s+bairns%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> --<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 14:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you want to write such an article, then feel free to do so and then request a merge. I personally feel that an article on the phrase itself, and its background, performs the same or similar function in a much more elegant manner and crucially provides a greater degree of verifiability. As for notability- there are numerous websites discussing the etymology, e.g .<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/23/messages/222.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/23/messages/222.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=69809&amp;messages=17" class="external autonumber" title="http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=69809&amp;messages=17" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://www.greatclanross.org/icons5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatclanross.org/icons5.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://daily.presbycan.ca/devotions/2006/06-03-07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://daily.presbycan.ca/devotions/2006/06-03-07.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, and many others. Searching for alternative spellings and phraseology may also be rewarding. This aphorism will be found in ANY worthwhile Scots phrasebook. From the look of your user page it sounds like you may be a Scot- if so, I'm surprised that you are not familiar with this phrase. It is very widely used, and notability is not an issue. Whether of not the phrase is culturally significant <i>is</i>; I do believe however believe that JTB satisfies those requirements. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 14:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He sounds more than notable enough to be worth a biography. His landscape paintings are worth thousands and he's in the Tate Collection. But, the article as it stands contains nothing whatsoever about him (in fact, it's somewhat misleading). There's no way this article is going to be deleted, but I would strongly suggest that it be rewritten as a biography (including the phrase) rather than a culturally significant dicdef. He certainly merits it, and it's much more in the style of an encyclopedia to do so.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 17:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure why you've discounted them, although I would agree that they are probably not of sufficient merit to be included as sources in the actual article- they were not intended as such. I agree that hopefully the article will be retained- an additional Jock Thomson article sounds like a fine idea; if and when it's created there may be scope to discuss a merge and redirect. As for the notability of the phrase- I don't mean to press the point if you don't wish to say, but are you Scottish? I make no claims that the aphorism is widely-used internationally, but it certainly is in Scotland. I do accept that a foreigner or one who has not spent a reasonable amount of time in the country or around Scots is unlikely to have come across the phrase. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 18:37, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a dictionary definition, and I have serious doubts that it can be expanded. The book cited is a 64 page picture book that aids the reader in furtling.

That said, I have no particular objection to having it nominated on AfD and, should the consensus be such, deleted.

Nonetheless, someone could do that, and presumably someone might be able to locate other references to the subject. In the mean time, the article in its present form is doing no harm to Wikipedia. Deleting it, though insignificant in the grand scheme if things, would nonetheless be a net loss for the encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 19:57, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are hundreds of games licensed by Nintendo out there though. This list is just the cusp of what is out there. It focuses a lot on the arcade games and a few of the NES games, but doesn't include any of the other consoles such as 64 and Gamecube.

<p><b>Delete</b> I deprodded this because I felt consensus was needed to delete an article about a radio station. This appears to be a webcast-only station, which I was unable to confirm at the time of deprodding, since their website was down. It's now back up. It seems to me impossible to confirm listenership or significance, and therefore I vote delete, but would be glad to change my vote if more information becomes available. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 18:44, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Using the definition in the article, the any number would be a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjugate_quantities.html" title="Conjugate quantities">Conjugate quantity</a> under the unary negation operator. In other words, if you take the number 10, negate it and you get -10, negate it again and you get 10 back. But according to Google, the term "conjugate quantities" means (if I am reading technobabble correctly) two related quantities. In other words, in the field of quantum mechanics, time and energy are directly proportional and so they are "conjugate quantites". An article on the correct meaning of "conjugate quantites" might be interesting, but this article is not. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:58, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Even if you met requirements mentioned thus far, please note that it is still a biased article. No matter how much you know that it is all true, you have yet to prove it. The article has no citations and references to any information outside of wikipedia that isn't a myspace website, and the main reason for that is because outside of your claim that the band was mentioned on a radio station, band has not been mentioned or talked about on any reliable source. No, even if you saved ticket stubs from Unseen Vision shows, they are not good enough. It is probably best to just let it go, and create a website for the band using Geocities or something. Please also note that the supernatural is not proven "to the full extent," as you say, but it does meet Wikipedia's standards. By the way, the Wikipedia standards are available for anyone to read. If you could just read the standards, there would be no debate as to what "the full extent" is, because what is important is the extent that wikipedia has asked for, the extent which has not been met... As it stands it is quite clearly suitable for deletion for an orgy of reasons. -- SB 06:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think I was confused by the recent cut-and-paste move in the article "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Final_Appeal_bc98.html" title="Court of Final Appeal">Court of Final Appeal</a>". The "court of appeal" and the "court of final appeal" are two different courts. Anyway, this article is too short.

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. While "long" and "descriptive" are technically words that could be applied to this article, I suppose, it's actually a pretty good example of why nearly all forum articles are deleted. Very little that happens on forums is encyclopedic, or of interest to those outside the forum itself. As a result, forum articles tend to get padded out with utterly trivial trivia. Here's a sample from this article: "<i>Then about 4 months afterwards, Ryan made an account called "imcoolcuzicuff", and pretty much said some revealing stuff towards Dread (For example, his penis is 5 inches, his nickname is Russtard and Rusty Bucket {because his name is Russell}, and Russell Sprouts), and even after that Dread was barely angry at Ryan.</i>" Now, can <i>anyone</i> out there think of any reason why the information I quoted, whether factual or not, would be of any interest to anyone outside the forum? I certainly cannot. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Although the article was originally put up for deletion when it was totally irrelevant and advertisement for its forum (the article was later edited by one of the members to include actual information as to <i>avoid</i> deletion), the article is still totally useless for anything except the glorification of the website.

I am one of the forum members of this site, so that should be taken info consideration when reading my thoughts)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.44.11.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.53.11.29_2fb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.53.11.29">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>So what if it isn't encyclopediac enough? I thought an encyclopedia was about INFORMATION. Oh and the P.S. guy that says he's a forum member. You aren't a forum member.&#160;:-p. If so which one? Anyway, if the person isn't notable or well known, now you know him. What if someone wanted to look up Kamain's World on Wikipedia or something and it wasn't there. See, if the article has some stuff, as long as it's descriptive etc, it should stay. You guys are just pompous.</p>

<li>You've brought up a very good point there, perhaps unintentionally: "<i>What if someone wanted to look up Kamain's World on Wikipedia or something and it wasn't there.</i>" For a moment, imagine that you're someone who's just heard of Kamain's World and wants to know more about it. Which of the following would you <i>most logically</i> use to get your information? (a) Go directly to the Kamain's World website. (b) Look it up on Google. (c) Check a website about forums, such as Big-Boards.com. (d) Check an internet directory. (e) Check an encyclopedia. Here's a hint: <i>the answer isn't (e).</i> <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:14, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, a little <b>comment:</b> Even though this forum shouldn't be included in Wikipedia, it does not mean that it isn't a great community.

<li>Codename Eagle is a mod too, based on the original game. Perhaps someone relinked the url from the BF1942-mod-page then. Empires was a mod for BF42 originally.

<p>I listed this page for proposal but the author disputed it. I believe that the article, which claims to describe an obscure act of sexual deviance, is non-notable and unverifiable.

<li><b>Save This!</b> Now I am furious. Does something have to be a pop culture icon to be notable? Isn't wikipedia for the free exchange of all knowledge, however ubscure and remote? Of course you wouldn't be able to find any of this stuff on google because it is an underground thing. If you base credability off of google searches you are not fit to oversee any intellectual exchange of ideas. There is information that hasnt been put onto the internet yet because some people want to keep things secret. I dare you to look into the public records of Pike County, and delete this only if you can prove me wrong, because public records are far more legitamate than google searches. And also, the parade isnt observed on main street Troy. The Troy Messanger published the article, but that is because it was the closest newspaper to the town of incident. The events happened in Banks Alabama. Also the parade is observed by a remote group of locals, and doesnt really attract too much media attention. Does your town newspaper announce every pumpkin carving contest? or every school dance? Please look actually do research before you discriminate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.235.245.200 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.235.245.200_8879.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.235.245.200">contribs</a>) 20:56, 8 May 2006 (UTC).</small> <font size="1">(user's first edit)</font></li>

<dd>Ugh.. this isn't a ethnic dispute, ok? Nobody is trying to silence anybody. It has nothing to with what I think about NATO aggression or anything like that, it's about Wikipedia standards for articles. We can keep the part at the top but the lyrics don't really need to be listed. We can provide an external link to it. As for the links your providing, I don't speak the language and can't understand what the page is saying and don't have a translator so I can't confirm any of this. The rights to the song is what is questionable though. <a href="../../../d/g/x/User%7EDGX_7ea7.html" title="User:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">D</font><font color="#000000">G</font></a><a href="../../../d/g/x/User_talk%7EDGX_0a84.html" title="User talk:DGX"><font color="#00FF00">X</font></a> 23:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> as fake/neologism. The name <i>Mongolia</i> has never signified a <i>region</i>. The introduction tries to establish a made-up definition based on an arbitrary combination of criteria, which isn't confirmed by any sources. The second part of the article lists administrative trivia from a very specific time period of doubtful relevance (where all ethnic mongols were under Manchu rule). None of the red links have much chance of ever turning into articles of their own. Almost all of the few blue links are misdirected to other subjects of the respective same names (usually people instead of geographic or administrative entities). I'm not sure what purpose this article serves other than to confuse its readers. Questions on the discussion page to this regard have yet to be answered. Unfortunately, several other language WPs seem to have copied the false definition, though none of the translations has turned into much more than a stub. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 22:44, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> From the link I just mentioned: <i>"China, which earlier had gained control of Inner Mongolia, subjugated Outer Mongolia in the late 17th cent., but in the succeeding years struggled with Russia for control. Outer Mongolia finally broke away in 1921 to form the Mongolian People’s Republic (now Mongolia). Inner Mongolia remained under Chinese control, although the Japanese conquered Rehe (1933), which they included in Manchukuo, and Chahar and Suiyuan (1937), which they formed into Mengjiang (Mongol Border Land). These areas were returned to China after World War II. In 1944, Tannu Tuva (see Tuva Republic), long recognized as part of Mongolia but under Russian influence since 1911, was incorporated within the USSR (now Russia). The Chinese Communists joined most of Inner Mongolia to N Rehe prov. and W Heilongjiang prov. to form the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region in 1949."</i></dd>
<dd>It is clear to me that the larger region of Mongolia has a rich history and is worthy of its own article, and the current one should probably be expanded. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 04:12, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> - A little more research revealed that <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Mongolia_60d9.html" title="Greater Mongolia">Greater Mongolia</a> is a somewhat established term. The title was previously a redirect to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolia_%28region%29.html" title="Mongolia (region)">Mongolia (region)</a>, but it has a more substantial meaning in historical and political terms.

<p>I navigated to this page at random to help with clean-up work, as it was included on the "NPOV" list. As it stands, it is not a Wikipedia article at all, but a strongly POV political diatribe. I started to try to rewrite it in a more neutral manner. I Googled the term and only got 396 hits, almost all of them simply uses of the phrase in a discussion.</p>
<p>Upon due reflection, I don't think the phrase merits a separate entry, as it is not a subject different from "gender roles" and is already well-treated in the article of that name. It is not a distinct area of inquiry or knowledge, and treating the phrase with a NPOV appears to require that it be part of a more comprehensive article. Certainly, as it is written, it is unsalvagable; the article must be completely erased and rewritten if the title is kept. I started to do it, but felt (after trying to do some research) that the resulting article would have little if any intellectual value. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonbarge_c30f.html" title="User:Masonbarge">Apollo</a> 23:13, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are you saying that the band has to be "commercial" in order to be eligible for a Wiki article? I have mentioned upfront that Saampan is a non-commercial band. It has more to do with the Bengali <b>community</b> in the US. I have also mentioned that Saampan's members are real people with day jobs. They are doing this for a completely different purpose. I really like your definition of "notability"!!! You know what? I think the article <i>should be deleted</i> ... I don't think we want to be part of something where notability is defined thus.

<li>No, it doesn't have to be commercial. It has to be <i>notable</i>.

<li>I also wanted to respond to each person here voting for deletion. For Richard Cavell, this is not copyright violation by any means. The band creates its own music or recreates popular Bengali songs. Where do you see violation??? For all others who are questioning the "notability" of this band, I want to ask whether all other bands listed on Wikipedia are "notable" bands. I can point you to atleast a couple of dozen band related articles that are not ... including Keppa's (Ryan's) six that are listed on his <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">User:Keppa</a> page. Can someone please tell me what I need to do to help this article live on Wikipedia ... rather than simply shooting at it? Where can someone vote to keep the article?

<li>If there are other articles of non-notable bands, then by all means they should be deleted.

<li>Alright, first of all, my name's not Ryan. Don't know where that one came from. Let's just refer to me as <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a>, shall we? Second, the four (not six; one of those articles is a <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Vaughn_Williams_fb77.html" title="Ralph Vaughn Williams">Ralph Vaughn Williams</a> song cycle, and the other is an event) bands on my page are notable, if a little controversial. Two of them have been through AfD and survived; of the other two, one performed in the Salt Lake City Olympics, and one has a song on the soundtrack of a major motion picture. Please do not take these deletion proceedings personally. No one here has anything against your band. I understand how that is, as I have had articles that I put time and effort into nominated for deletion as well. As a newcomer it can be hard. But community consensus exists to ensure that the rules are enforced, and your band simply does not meet the requirements (see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) to have an article. <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a> 04:33, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pseudohistory_6036.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pseudohistory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistory.html" title="Pseudohistory">pseudohistory</a></span></h3>
<p>Firstly, <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistory.html" title="Pseudohistory">pseudohistory</a> isn't, even on the face of the article, a movement or abstract philosophical concept, but merely a pejorative label applied to something one thinks is shoddy. It's a <i>word</i>, not a <i>concept</i>. So, technically, it would be a suitable only for a dictionary entry, not an encyclopaedia entry. (well, consider: who would call <i>themselves</i> a pseudohistorian?).</p>
<p>Secondly, nevertheless it's linked from other articles as if it <i>were</i> some sort of movement - for example, the currently vogue <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Blood%2C_Holy_Grail_fae0.html" title="Holy Blood, Holy Grail">Holy Blood, Holy Grail</a> described as being "a conspirational work of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudohistory.html" title="Pseudohistory">Pseudohistory</a>" as if it were some sort of academic discipline, and cross-referenced to the article (but not for long!). That is clearly an unequivocally pejorative reference - as it isn't sourced, it's a non-neutral point of view (though if some notable writer has accused HBHG of being pseudohistory then that's a different thing - but this should be listed in a criticism section, not in the introduction).</p>
<p>Thirdly, it's a snipey, bitchy article, which amounts to little more than original research, wherein editors have just taken potshots at theories they don't like. Now I should put my cards on the table here: I'm a card carrying skeptic, and I think these theories (and books like HBHG) are a pile of rubbish too, <i>but that doesn't mean there is any justification whatsoever for this article</i>.</p>
<p>Consider the following statements from the article, which make up the core of the article, none of which are sourced:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pseudohistory does not do justice to mainstream interpretations. Pseudohistory involves the inappropriate treatment of source material. It typically reflects the effort to justify a foregone conclusion. Pseudohistory often inflates the importance of a few unreliable sources while ignoring mountains of contradictory evidence. Pseudohistory may pull irrelevant facts out of context. Pseudohistory may distort the meaning of legitimate source material. Pseudohistory sometimes manufactures fraudulent evidence. It may blend real history with myth, legend, or rumor.</i></li>
<li><i>Many people who engage in pseudohistory are sincere in their beliefs. They may believe the surviving body of evidence gives a false picture of the truth. They may have drawn their views from a body of fringe literature. They may be ignorant of proper historical method. They may understand academic standards but regard certain events as exempt from that analysis. Conspiracy theories are a popular theme for pseudohistory. Pseudohistory sometimes serves a political, nationalist, or religious agenda.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, regardless of sourcing, this in no way distinguishes "pseudohistory" from "real" history that one doesn't agree with - each one of these qualities could be attributed to pretty much any disputed work of history, so it's not even a good dictonary definition.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is "examples of pseudohistory" - none of them carry any citations for someone notable even accusing them of being pseudohistory, and many of the examnples don't meet even the loose criteria set out above, being not controversial published works but "urban legends" or just plain myths (like Atlantis).</p>
<p>In short, this pseudohistory article is rubbish on stilts - pseudo-encyclopaedic, if you will - and it has to go. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 22:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As far as I know, an AfD does not decide whether the article is a good article; it decides whether the topic of the article is one we need. So most of your comment is irrelevant. While one can accuse any author of manufacturing fradulent evidence and depending on rumor and myth, that doesn't mean that it's true; one can check whether the evidence is from good sources or not. Likewise with whether or not they regard certain events exempt from normal historial anaylsis. So the definition is solid. Atlantis is covered in a number of controversial published works; it's far more than just a "myth".</li>
<li>Just as importantly, a concept that is seen only from the outside is still valid. The fact that few people would call themselves terrorists or pedophiles does not make those people not terrorists or pedophiles.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 23:07, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry, but whether you think it's a "useful" article, it isn't an encyclopaedia article - it's just a definition, and a poor one at that. Definitions belong in dictionaries.

Ergo, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 23:14, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies for seeming uncivil, but that's utter codswallop. Some Wikipedia users just added some random things they think are stupid. That doesn't give it a "history" (other than - ha! - a <i>pseudo</i>history) or a "bibliography". Has anyone actually written a <i>book</i> on it? None show up on Amazon (well, it's mentioned in two articles and one out-of-print book, none of them purport to be about pseudohistory per se.

<p>OK, OK - you win. ElectricRay in the tiny minority yet again. I'll work on a re-write. I will, however, say pseudo-history seems to amount to nothing more than a label, though, and there is no consistent or externally sourced consensus as to the criteria for something to qualify as pseudo-history. At the end of the day, the concept's value as an formal operator on the sum total of human knowledge is pretty slight (the concept of "history" is slippery enough, so the idea of "pretends to be history but isn't" is slipperier - like I say, the only thing that instances of pseudo-history have in common mentioned in the article as it currently stands are that they have all been labelled as pseudo-history by someone. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 18:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Filipinos are a people with a long history in the U.S.A. dating as far back as the 1500s, yet their achievements and struggles have largely gone unnoticed. This article can undue such an injustice by giving credence to the only existing college fraternity in the U.S.A. dedicated to the largely unrecognized and underrepresented Filipino community. To delete XPO from wikipedia would only repeat the injustice of denying the historical significance of Filipinos in the U.S.A. I do agree, however, that the article's biases should be corrected to present a neutral point of view. Filipinos have endured a long history of oppression, slavery, and degradation. When will they have the chance to let their achievements and successes be seen? s.smith 13:36, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - First become notable, then get an encyclopedia article. I assume there are significant achievements by Filipinos, but those need their own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> While the level 3 section entitled "Pilipino culture, history, and heritage" asserts notability, the three linked to web-sites make no reference to this fraternity. A quick search found no evidence of notability and no reliable sources that could be used to establish notability. There were no links on google news, none on google scholar, two campus guides on google book, and no reliable sources on the top few pages of google web. The practice is, first become notable, then get a wikipedia article, not the other way around. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment and Keep</b> - My question is: What is notable? Figures outstanding in numerous non-European communities throughout the world have been overlooked because society has historically been biased towards Eurocentric perceptions. Is not being of the first, if not the only, Fraternities with a Filipino cultural emphasis in the U.S.A., to be incorporated by the state of California -a rigorous and lengthy process- and established at seven major universities in California "notable" enough? I would also ask how credible can Google be in establishing notability for anything at all? If the age of technology is limited to predominantly "Western" developed societies, then the vast majority of internet data would exclude the perspectives of non-European groups the world over. Because of this, internet searches are in and of themselves biased and unreliable in searching for credibility. Look to the respective institutions where such groups would be established, the state of California and the universities for this matter. The representation of an underrepresented group, Filipinos, by Chi Rho Omicron, Inc., is notable enough since they have been incorporated within the state of California and established at seven major universities in that state. However, I do adamantly agree that this page is riddled with biases and non-neutrality and should be purged of them. Keep and correct the page so that it may present a NPOV. s.smith 17:38, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_11.html" title="May 11">11 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> move to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi_Rho_Omicron_2122.html" title="Chi Rho Omicron">Chi Rho Omicron</a> and clean it up for NPOV. Many fraternity articles read too much like brochures (unfortunately). This one needs a lot of work, both in NPOV and citing sources; however, I'd rather see it cleaned up than lost. The organization is eleven years old and has existed at seven universities, with six chapters being active on campus, today. I guess a lot of my oppinion of "notability" depends on how "notable" it is on those campuses. If it's not, then it likely only matters to a couple hundred people. If it's "notable" on those campuses, it's "notable" to perhaps over 100,000, right? And, most of those people would not be <i>in</i> the organization. My oppinion's not too strong in either direction, but I lean towards keep and fix.&#160;—&#160;<a href="../../../v/r/k/User%7EVrkaul_a410.html" title="User:Vrkaul">vijay</a> 12:39, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Here we go again with the fraternity and sorority Afd noms. In the past I've voted to both keep and delete certain fraternity articles so even though I always edit those type of articles I'm not biased for or against them. I tend to look at their notability and neutrality. In looking at this article, I'm having a hard time understanding how a regional fraternity with 7 chapters lacks Wiki's criteria for notability. Regional fraternities and even some local (i.e. a fraternity with only one chapter. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_William_Penn_Society_8f49.html" title="The William Penn Society">The William Penn Society</a>) have articles on Wiki and some of them are not that well written in comparison to this AfD nominated article. If you want to see <i>another</i> fraternity that is also Filipino and also a regional fraternity, survived AfD and not even written with the same amount of info as this article please take a look at <a href="../../../z/e/t/Zeta_Phi_Rho_6172.html" title="Zeta Phi Rho">Zeta Phi Rho</a>. What this article does lack is a NPOV. Fraternity and sorority articles are often riddled with self-congratulatory remarks which is why they often get AfD in the the first place.

I would be inclined to vote to keep an article about <a href="http://www.betamax.com/about.php" class="external text" title="http://www.betamax.com/about.php" rel="nofollow">BetaMax</a> itself if such an article existed, but I can't see an article about every rate plan for every telecommunications company. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page was created a year ago by an anonymous user and has since had only a handful of minor contributions, my own being the longest. I came to the conclusion, however, that it would be wasted effort to put any more time into the article, as it provides no additional useful information. All we see is the episode's title, two actors (frequently not the leading players, but the first two names copied from the alphabetically-arranged IMDb list) and the date of the broadcast. All of that information (and much more) can be obtained from IMDb. Finally, as I indicated in the edit summary, this article has already been tagged as being overlong.

<li>A few additional comments—after having edited hundreds of articles in the past four months, this is the first nomination for deletion that I made. As a lifelong listmaker, I did not make it lightly. The first warning was the tag: "This page is 48 [now 50] kilobytes long. This may be longer than is preferable; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">article size</a>". The only articles of that size are (primarily, with a few exceptions) scholarly dissertations on key topics of knowledge. Wikipedia has thousands of lists, but the few plus-size ones should justify their existence with an original viewpoint on subjects that cannot be easily found anywhere else. Otherwise, a link is sufficient, especially as it relates to IMDb, the most frequently consulted film and TV site. There is no need to import wholesale filmographies and lists of TV episodes, unless, of course, they are accompanied by original critical analyses. The <i>Hitchcock Presents</i> list is unique in that it is the only one of that size that has apparently been copied verbatim from IMDb (or one of four books that list the episodes) without any accompanying content. There is nothing similar for any other TV show. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanspinner_a058.html" title="User:Romanspinner">Romanspinner</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomanspinner_3dc6.html" title="User talk:Romanspinner">talk</a>) 07:10, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This brief and incomplete list was created by an anonymous user a year ago. In the intervening time very few editors have done very little work on it. The same anonymous user created on the same day the extensive <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_episodes_9782.html" title="List of Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes">List of Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes</a></i>, which lists all the episodes of the half-hour show. That list has already been tagged for exceeding 48 kilobytes and, as in this case, attracted very little editing interest save for my own meager effort to improve the cast details for the first season and put links into the two-cast-member-per-episode list that the entry contains. I am a fan of the Hitchcock shows and appreciate the amount of work the creator of the articles put into them, but I had to nominate both lists for deletion, because neither contains any information that goes beyond what can found via the IMDb link. In fact, many of the cast entries list an episode's two minor players (which I corrected in the first season listings), apparently as a result of copying from IMDb without realizing that its policy is to list casts of TV episodes alphabetically. I appreciate rare and specialized lists (such as the same anonymous user's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scottish_writers_c0fa.html" title="List of Scottish writers">List of Scottish writers</a>), but these two lists use up Wikipedia space without earning their keep. Many entries on individual episodes of TV series have been well done, as witness <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twilight_Zone_97ab.html" title="The Twilight Zone">The Twilight Zone</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_The_Original_Series_822f.html" title="Star Trek The Original Series">Star Trek The Original Series</a></i> and someday I hope the <i>Hitchcock</i> shows will come in for the same detailed treatment, but for now I suggest that the <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_e1cc.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock Presents">descriptive entry</a> about the show (started by a different user two years ago) is sufficient.
