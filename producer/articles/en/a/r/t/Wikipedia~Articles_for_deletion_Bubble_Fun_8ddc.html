<li><b>Comment</b> My point was not that the username was silly (though it is) but that user opinions on open forums don't make the case for notability. You need to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> and you need to add them to the article, not here. For example, has the game had been reviewed by one of the leading reputable game magazines? If so, provide a link to the review. As far as I can tell none of the links above is that, so none of them show this game is notable in the Wikipedia sense. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 17:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>But isn't the whole idea behind Wikipedia that the opinions and contributions of unpaid volunteers and regular citizens are of equal, if not greater, value than that of some paid editor? Case in point: how many of you who voted for deletion actually <b>played</b> the game? Shouldn't the opinions of people who did play it hold some value?</p>
<p>And shouldn't the fact that Bubble Fun is available on many popular high-traffic game sites and the fact that so many users gave it rave reviews account for something and lift it above the countless pacman, space invaders, and tetris clones you usually find on game sites?</p>
<p>How about if I add this to the entry:</p>
<p>"Bubble Fun is noteworthy for its unique concept and being the first game to combine the satisfaction of popping virtual bubble wrap with a strategic element."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> per nom as recreated SD'd article; how about if I add that a list of alleged reviews from anonymous reviewers doesn't establish, and has no bearing upon, notability? Nor is notability established by us playing the game, or any other irrelevant factor. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:41, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Being the first of its kind doesn't make it notable? Wasn't Tetris notable for being the first of its kind?</p>
<p>And I find these comments trying to disqualify the opinions of those people who actually played the game and gave it positive reviews a bit elitist. How are your opinions more valuable than their opinions? Isn't this the type of attitute Wikipedia is faced with so often, when people dismiss Wikipedia as nothing more than a bunch of unqualified volunteers? Isn't that exactly what you're doing when you dismiss the opinions of dozens of Newsgrounds users and webmasters who reviewed the game? If all those Newgrounds users became editors at Wikipedia, would that suddenly make their opinions more valuable?</p>
<p>Take a look at this list: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games</a> How do any of these games qualify to be listed in Wikipedia as "noteworthy" but Bubble Fun doesn't? Bubble Fun has a unique game concept. Most of the games on that list do not. They're mostly clones of each other or of older game concepts.</p>

<p>They're almost all clones of each other, yet they're listed in Wikipedia. By the same standard Bubble Fun should be listed. In fact it has more merit to be listed than a bunch of Tetris and Bejeweled clones, because it is not a clone but an original. But I guess presenting a logical argument for the inclusion of Bubble Fun is a lost cause, because you guys have made up your mind without ever even looking at the game.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would really help if you actually looked at Wikipedia's standards before posting the same argument over and over and over again. It would also help if you would actually read what people write before replying. <i>Originality</i> is not a standard for an article to be retained. <i>Notability</i> is. You could have the most original game in the world, played by six people, and it would not qualify for an article. Can you provide evidence on the number of people playing this game that would make it comparable to the other listed games? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:16, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Frank6783 I listed a bunch of high traffic websites with very high Alexa ratings who all feature this game. Those sites get millions of visitors. The site Newgrounds.com is the source of the reviews I quoted, and it's listed as #596 in Alexa. How much higher do you want to set the standard for notability? And do all those other puzzle game clones listed in Wikipedia meet that standard?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> but these Alexa rankings provide notability for the sites, not for the game hosted on them. I could upload software to download.com (which is one of the highest traffic websites there is) and 3 people might download it. Does that mean my software is notable? No. Please read Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guidelines</a> and in particular look at the criteria for including <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">websites</a>. Can you provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> that show that Bubble Fun meets any of these criteria? Has it for example "... been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." or has it "won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation."? If you can show it meeting one or more of the notability criteria then people will change their opinion. By the way, insulting the very people whose mind you seek to change is a highly ineffective approach to getting what you want...

<p>The game has been published on dozens of popular websites. You say the high Alexa rankings provide notability for those sites, correct? So we established that numerous notable sources have published the game.</p>
<p>I understand your analogy about uploading a file on Download.com, which is not downloaded by anyone, but the many player reviews prove that a lot of people have played the game. And the fact that many different webmasters commented on the game or published the game also shows that this is not just a file downloaded by only 3 people.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I provided you the link to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web notability guidelines</a> and a summary of the specific criterion that you quote. Please read it carefully. Appearing on a website like Newgrounds.com does <b>not</b> count as being "...the subject of a non-trivial <i>published</i> work" (emphasis mine). The criterion "includes newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations". In other words it is referring to reviews of work published in reputable non-web sources. Again, go back to what I said before: if your game had been reviewed in a major print magazine or on TV it would be notable. Simply appearing on a high-traffic website that is an indescriminate collection of web games does <i>not</i> provide notability for the game.

<li><b>Question</b> to continue the analagy of download.com, that site provides statistics on how many people download a particular piece of software. I get the impression that many of these sites, again like download.com, pretty much include any game that's offered to them, so merely being offered on a site isn't, in itself, an endorsement. Do any of these sites provide statistics on how many people play each game? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is absolutely nothing "notable" about any of the games listed there, with the exception of Tetris and Lemmings. Yet, somehow those hurdles, hoops and strict interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines you impose on Bubble Fun don't seem to apply to any of the other Flash puzzle games listed in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now, if I were to strictly apply Wikipedia "notability guidelines" to all the games on that list, and deleted 95% of the games on that list, that would be considered vandalism, not proper editing, right? I have to admit, the logic here escapes me. I guess that's why I'm just a "newbie" and you guys are the "experts."</p>
