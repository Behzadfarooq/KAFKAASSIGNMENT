<dd>Surely the important thing is that independent third parties think that this is a notable product. These include the Royal Television Society, who thought it was the most signficant of any product anywhere for advancing the process of video post production, and awarded it as such, as well as the biggest production company in the world, the BBC (FORscene works on their 27,000 desktops).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The product is widely used, with distributors in six countries on three continents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the product pushes the boundary of what is possible on the web - a complete web-based editing and publishing system for web and mobile phones (cell phones in the US). By using Java in novel and powerful ways, the client takes the strain rather than the server, giving the internet its first complete (ie from shooting through editing to publishing and viewing) browser-based real time video application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in short, I'd like to contest this deletion, which removes from Wikipedia what has been judged by senior independent people in the industry a very significant product.</dd>

<p>Do you have anything specific in mind? The original version said a lot more about the system and why it was significant, but this was deemed to salesy. This version says a lot more third parties views and usage. Perhaps something looking more like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Premiere_10d5.html" title="Adobe Premiere">Adobe Premiere</a> would be preferable, showing development history back to 1990.</p>
<p>I notice that other similar UK listed companies have entries eg <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vividas.html" title="Vividas">Vividas</a>.

</ul>
<p>I'm not after removing Vividas, but thinking of adding Forbidden. Are there any guidelines on what makes a company notable?</p>
<p>I would rather read about a company or product on Wikipedia, where independent third parties can amend or write their own content, than rely on the company website or literature.</p>
<p>To me, notable is not the same as popular or established. In particular, some novel products can be very notable. Judging by the response from independent third parties in the industry, FORscene would appear to fall into this category ie novel and notable.</p>
<p>I've included a couple of third party articles which mention FORscene, and which give a broader picture than the current FORscene article.</p>
<p>I notice in the guidelines that there is no prohibition per se to writing articles about products you are involved in. I know that this has been controversial when applied to biographies and such like, but I would have thought a web based product is relatively simple to verify and so much less prone to bias.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> provides guidelines for notability, further broken up into subpages for different categories (companies, products, etc). <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 18:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks. I'll have another look. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 19:01, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Notability pages themselves mention some discussion as to how important notability is, but I don't think anyone is concerned with this here. More useful is the criteria for notability expressed in the guidelines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28companies_and_corporations%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28companies_and_corporations%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In particular the sufficient criteria for notability which is for multiple independent non-trivial published works including newspaper articles.</p>
<p>Forbidden Technologies, which has been around for a few years, easily meets this notability criterion, with numerous articles including in the national press eg Telegraph, Independent, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_Times_8705.html" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Business_%28newspaper%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Business_%28newspaper%29" rel="nofollow">The Business</a>, Investors Chronicle, The Daily Mail and the Sun as well as the trade press articles which talk about FORscene (see next paragragh), and thousands of "articles" in invesment websites. <a href="../../../a/d/v/ADVFN_587d.html" title="ADVFN">ADVFN</a> alone has over 4,000 since the beginning of last year (Forbidden Technologies does not post on these boards).</p>
<p>FORscene itself, although relatively new, has also received multiple independent articles, both on the web and printed trade press particularly eg Broadcast, Televisual, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Media_Age_5338.html" title="New Media Age">New Media Age</a> and Showreel magazine, as well as winning multiple independent awards (the RTS being the most recent and important).</p>
<p>So if people here are happy with these notability guidelines, I'll fish out references to some of these press articles.</p>
<p>Moving on to the VSCA question. The guidelines suggest that although desirable, it is not required, that the author of the article is not an investor in the company.</p>
<p>I've been tidying up the entry, with the objective of making it more encyclopaedic. This process is still ongoing. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 00:02, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
History section added showing developments since 1990. This could be thinned, but launch date in 1990 is significant because it shows FORscene is not some random new idea, but the result of many years of development in the industry.</p>
<p>I've included Eidos plc developments NOT because I founded Eidos plc (which had reached UKP 1Bn market cap the year I left to found Forbidden), but because thousands of broadcast TV programmes were made on it. One of the reasons for the success of FORscene is that Optima developments had responded to vast numbers of criticsms from professional editors over many years, and this knowhow is incorporated into FORscene. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 10:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Thanks for the alexa information in particular, which shows a significant recent rise. However it's not obvious to me that links to Forbidden Technologies website directly relate to the importance of FORscene. Most FORscene users have locked down systems and would not register at all in alexa, which may in any case be weighted towards the US, where FORscene is not available.</p>
<p>It's true that FORscene is not widely linked to in Wikipedia. In fact, the original article was deleted after about 1 minute, so I wouldn't expect many links in Wikipedia! No one will link to an article recommended for deletion, so I think the link point is spurious.</p>
<p>The notablity guidelines suggest that the large number of printed press reports, both in the national press and trade journals, should be enough for notability.</p>
<p>Now I've got to know Wikipedia a bit more, I acknowledge that independence is an important issue though, which can only be resolved either by either:</p>
<p>a) people who are independent (such as customers) writing an article; or</p>
<p>b) reducing the article to a stub which contains little information.</p>
<p>As FORscene itself is still a new product, I suspect that over time some of the growing FORscene user base will also be a Wikipedia contributors, so a) will happen at some point.</p>
<p>In the mean time, seeing as I'm me, the most constructive thing I can do is to reduce the page to a non controversial stub, and wait for other Wikipedia users familiar with FORscene to add to it as they see fit.</p>
<p>I was thinking along the lines of:</p>
<p>FORscene is an award winning <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_platform.html" title="Java platform">Java</a> internet video platform, enabling users to edit and publish for web and mobile.</p>
