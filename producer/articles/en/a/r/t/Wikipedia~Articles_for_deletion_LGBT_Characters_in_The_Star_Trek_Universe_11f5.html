<p>I know this'll start a huge controversy, but whatever. This article is nothing about a long non-encyclopedic essay on why the creators of Star Trek don't have gay characters. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">User:Luigi30</a> (<a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuigi30_5295.html" title="User talk:Luigi30">Ταλκ</a>) 17:45, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's actually an interesting essay with real world connections, and analyses the series and its attempts to introduce gay characters quite well. Could do with a less clunky title, maybe, but I don't see why it's "not encyclopedic". --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 18:04, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Category:Gay icons and other homosexuality-related articles aren't really part of this discussion. The article needs some editing--it is not unbiased, but at the same time seems to be describing a real debate, and has sources to back at least some of this up. I'm not even sure it needs a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} tag, so I'm voting <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 18:11, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> that is a debate that I already encountered years and years ago, and this is not an essay, but a summary of all the related things, both in the series and behind the screen. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 18:18, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I say that almost reluctantly, because it's a long, thorough, well-written and presumably well-researched article. However, the whole thing could basically be summarized by "Star Trek doesn't have any gay characters" though it takes quite a few paragraphs to get there. Much of the padding material consists of speculation and descriptions of characters who kinda-sorta might have been gay. At best, it's a well-intentioned article which really needs to document its sources better. At worst, it veers dangerously close to libel: "<i>Some fans feel that...Berman and Paramount of selling out the progressive Roddenberry dream in favor of contemporary bigotry and a hypocritical commercial cop-out.</i>" See also <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">Weasel words</a>. I definitely feel this is an interesting subject and should be posted and discussed somewhere, but isn't an encyclopedic topic. If it absolutely must stay, I suggest squeezing it down into a paragraph or two and putting it in one of the main Trek articles or into a GLBT in culture article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:19, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite somewhat as the insertion of sections looks somewhat forced in the flow of the text, and they should be able to be read out of order. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 19:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Liberally condense and <b>Merge</b>. There's not much meat to this article, and most of it is original research couched in language like "some fans believe...", etc. This whole concept could easily be summarized in a paragraph or section in one of the main Star Trek articles, such as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_and_Star_Trek_1149.html" title="Society and Star Trek">Society and Star Trek</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 20:12, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but revise to remove original research and filter for possible POV. There were some attempts to add LGBT sections to each of the series articles, but I think the issue is best left discussed all at once, as is the case here. I don't know if it's necessary to have subcategories. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:14, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not <b>move</b> to a title that does not assert that there are, in fact, such characters? Although I would also support <b>deleting</b>. I'm wavering on whether it is encyclopedic, but the current title doesn't make sense. 68.165.6.18 02:05, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>An interesting topic, and a fairly unbiased approach. Oddly enough, by restricting itself to the TV series, it ignores that controversy about a TNG movie character who was supposed to be "gay", and the overt gayness of one of the SCE characters, in the (supposedly) authorised Pocket e-books series. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, the article now addresses Lt. Hawk, of Star Trek: First Contact, the "almost" gay movie character, under the TNG section. I'm not sure if this is a recent edit. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:37, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am going to have a section on the Star Trek comic books/novels and one on the video games. Both are brief. I fail to see how my article has "gone to far" it is simply explaing the factual history behind the controversy (among fans) over how the franchise has dealt with LGBT people, and why. <span style="font-size: 70%"><i>(This comment added by 199.17.94.37 <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 19:28, 2005 May 21 (UTC))</i></span></li>
