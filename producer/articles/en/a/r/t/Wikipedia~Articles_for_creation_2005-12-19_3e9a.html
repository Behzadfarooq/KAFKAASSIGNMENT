Package labeling describes it as a digestive and carminative herb-mint tablet to correct indigestion, liver disorder, dyspepsia and constipation. The tablet is meant to be chewed or sucked on and has a distinctive bitter-spicy taste. This acquired taste is what has kept this medicine so popular over its history.</p>

<p>"Hey Now!" is a <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanders_Show_d745.html" title="Larry Sanders Show">Larry Sanders Show</a> saying, which has been adopted as a greeting by <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> and his fans.</p>
<p>In its original Larry Sanders Show incarnation, it was spoken by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Kingsley_4788.html" title="Hank Kingsley">Hank Kingsley</a> (played by Jeffrey Tambour) and was directly derided as an affectation. Its adoption by Stern and fans is a direct and humorous tribute to the Larry Sanders Show, and has very much evolved into a part of the Howard Stern experience.</p>
<p>During Howard Stern's final <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrestrial.html" title="Terrestrial">terrestrial</a>/<a href="../../../w/x/r/WXRK_a8f5.html" title="WXRK">WXRK</a> broadcast on December 16th 2005, he whipped his live audience into a frenzy by greeting them with "Can I get a Hey Now!" and pointing the microphone at the crowd.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Howard Stern plays clips of the original Larry Sanders discussion of "Hey Now!" as an affectation.</p>
<p>"Hey Now!" can be heard frequently as a greeting, in locations ranging from Stern greeting a caller on the air to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Depot_19e8.html" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a> paging systems: "Hey Now! Can I get a lumber associate to the panel saw? That's lumber associate to the panel saw. Thank you." The use of this greeting is usually indicative of a Howard Stern fan.</p>

An interviewer (formerly <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuttering_John_8172.html" title="Stuttering John">Stuttering John</a>) would ask homeless people basic questions, and the show regulars (and, usually, call-in guests) would place bets on whether or not the homeless people could answer these simple questions.</p>

<p>The Programmer's Package Manager (PPM), formerly known as the Perl Package Manager, is ActiveState's value-added package manager that provides a command line interface for downloading and installing pre-compiled versions of most CPAN modules. PPM can access package repositories (collections of packages) through the Internet. It is also used to update previously installed packages with the latest versions and to remove unused packages from your system.</p>

<p>This is the most elite unit of both the military and police special forces. This unit would be equivalent to the american green berrets or Delta Force. They are the most secretive of all special forces two. They fall under the ministry of defence and although they are supposed to be directed by the army chief of staff comand they pretty much are organized by themselves and can even be considered its own military branch. Althogh not that big in numbers they are considered the cream of the crop of every armed unit. They are very rarely called into action. Their most known acts are the retrivement of the black box of the nato F-117 that crashed in Kosovo, the help in the january 9 of the drowning refuges in the adriatic sea, the training of KLA(Kosovo liberation army) special forces, and help in other heavy natural causes. The unit has just about every specialist that can do any type of mission, Including: reconnaisance, demolition, paraschuting, rock climbing, diving, amphibious assault, snipers, sharpshooters, etc. A very small portion of this unit is even trained in the US for solo missions. This are the men who are often called Rambos, as their jobs and missions are the same as depicted in the holliwood movie.</p>

<p>The Church of Christ in Thailand was founded in 1934 as the "Church in Siam" with the express intent of forming a single ecumenical denomination to include all Protestant churches in Thailand. Other than a small number of American Baptist and British Churches of Christ congregations, all of the original member churches were originally Presbyterian congregations. The C.C.T. originally had seven districts, six geographical and one ethnic Chinese. Except for a brief period during World War II, Presbyterian missionary influence remained predominant in the C.C.T. until the late 1970s. Since 1990, the denomination has experience a major demographic shift. Tribal churches, mostly Baptist in origin, now account for about one-half of its total number of roughly 100,000 communicant members. The C.C.T. is a member of the World Council of Churches and the Christian Conference of Asia and is generally recognized to be a "mainline," ecumenical denomination. Its church government is a relatively centralized mixture of Presbyterian, Disciples, and Baptist polities.</p>

<p>A slang expression, normally used as a noun, to express the feeling of extreme anger.</p>
<p>The literal definition is of feeling like 'an ape during a thunderstorm', and is used to describe someone who is violently angry and irritated. In some ways this word can be seen as a similie, reflecting the behavior of a angry ape during bad weather onto the subject. It is also believed that it could be an ellision of the slang nouns 'ape-shit' and 'shit-storm'. However, many feel this is a sort of back-ronym of the word, and not its original genesis. Common uses of the noun appear in informal conversation. Examples include "He threw such a terrible apestorm when he found out" or "There's going to be an apestorm when they get back".</p>
<p>Apestorm is an emerging word used increasingly by younger speakers, especially in the South of England. It is also regarded as non-vulgar and socially acceptable.</p>
<p><br />
A more concise definition can be found on the Urban Dictionary website.</p>

<p>Also known as Zordax, Skrale, Skraller, Lawler, Gayface... etc.</p>
<p>Born in 1988, Lawler became involved in various heavy metal acts at a young age. After being kicked out of "that crap band, SteelLined" for his "extra curricular activities", such as his involvement in better music, such as acid techno, braindance and the like.</p>
<p>Along with Jix, their outlandish musical styles and off-stage behaviour have earned the two the recognition they do not quite deserve. The off-tempo beats and dance-fuelled synths have somehow merged with the style of fellow DJ, Jix to become what is today known as "that Delta IX sound."</p>
<p>[b]Early Daze[/b]</p>
<p>Delta IX's first real exposure to the Irish dance scene was a decent party at Johnny Taylor's house circa 2005. After their "set", which consisted of them playing their own original material, some obscure AFX, and a pinch of Cylob, people kept hassling them for more tunes. After this warm welcome to the scene, they produced more original material, and are currently in the beta stage of releasing a dozen song demo.</p>

<p>The young Hungarian composer TÃ­mea Dragony was born in 1976 in NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za, Hungary. She visited the ZoltÃ¡n KodÃ¡ly Elementary School of music and was a member of the famous Cantemus children choir, which travelled all over the world to give concerts and participate in competitions. After this she went to the secondary schools of music in NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za and Debrecen to study the piano, musical theory and composition. In Debrecen she continued her studies at the College of Music where she added choir conducting to her curriculum. At the age of 20 she moved to Budapest and was accepted at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music to study composition with GyÃ¶rgy OrbÃ¡n. Also she attended master classes with: Gyula Fekete, Michael Jarell, Johannes Kretz and Marco Stroppa in Hungary. Cristobal Hallfter, Manfred Trojan, Mauricio Sotello and Tomas Marco in Spain and Noel Lee in France.</p>
<p>Her works were performed in many different countries. Her âCapriccioâ for flute had its premiere in Rome and her flute piece âExtremas Emocionesâ was performed in Budapest, Frankfurt, Madrid and Leipzig. For her final exam at the Liszt Ferenc Academy she composed her âViolinconcertoâ and the âOrchestral Songs based on Sonnets of William Shakespeareâ, for this she graduated with Honours. Nowadays she regularly tours Europe with an international group of musicians, dedicated to promoting her music, with which she is able to perform her new compositions.</p>
<p>Her career is supported by the AcadÃ©mie Musicale de Villecroze. 195.121.163.147 15:15, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Hood to Coast Relay is a 197.2 mile road race in Oregon for running teams of all abilities. The race starts at the Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon (about 6000' above sea level) and finishes at the Pacific Ocean in the town of Seaside, Oregon. Teams are generally comprised of 12 runners, each member running 3 legs of the course. The course is divided into 36 legs, each leg being between 3.8 and 7.9 miles in length. Teams generally use one or two vans to shuffle their runner's to each leg.</p>
<p>The race, founded by Bob Foote in 1982, attracts over a thousand teams each year, mostly running enthusiasts looking for a fun running road trip and adventure, but there are many elite teams as well consisting of some of the world's best runners - <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Salazar_4ee5.html" title="Alberto Salazar">Alberto Salazar</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venuste_Niyongabo_7217.html" title="Venuste Niyongabo">Venuste Niyongabo</a> have both run the relay for example.</p>

<p>A prior art reference anticipates a patent claim if it expressly or inherenty describes all of the elements in that claim. The doctrine of inherent anticipation is court-created and is somewhat inconsistent. It is counterbalance by a doctrine sometimes known as "accidental" anticipation.</p>
<p>In order to be anticipatory a reference must be enabling. Additionally the inherent element must be necessarily present in the prior in order for it to be found inherent. In other words, if practicing the prior art does not always result in the claimed element, then it is not inherent in the reference.</p>

<p>This is a proposal for a cryptographic system that would allow anyone to use the same password across different servers and not worry about one server using their password to login to their account on another server. I am going to demonstrate this with an example. Assume the two servers in question are AOL and Earthlink (ISP's).</p>
<p><br />
Lets define some words for this demonstration.</p>
<p><br />
RA1 = A random, long string that varies randomly among servers. It is publically known to everyone, never needs to change, is built into the software, and is determined by the server. RA1 denotes AOL's random string and is the same among all AOL software.</p>
<p><br />
RA2 = Another random string for AOL, same properties as above, randomly different than RA1.</p>
<p><br />
RA3 = Same as above (yet another, different string)</p>
<p><br />
RE1 = Another random string, this one for Earthlink, determined by Earthlink, built into the Earthlink software, has the same properties as above.</p>
<p><br />
RE2 = Same pattern</p>
<p><br />
RE3 = Same pattern</p>
<p><br />
Alice has Earthlink and AOL and wants to use the same password for both ISP's and yet not worry about anyone from one ISP stealing her password and using it to sign into the other ISP. So Alice picks the password, Bobisajerk. She types this into her AOL software. This Password then gets Hashed with a long Checksum (larger than 256 bits) and then the checksum gets Encrypted with RA1 to form ChecksumA1. ChecksumA1 then gets hashed with another checksum (256 bits) and then that checksum gets encrypted with RA2. RA2 acts as a private key (private key A1) and forms public Key A1 and Public key A1 gets encrtyped with RA3 to form Private key A2 (the procedure to form Private key A2 may vary, the idea here is that given Private key A2, no one should be able to easily determine Alice's password without performing a cryptographic attack and they shouldn't have enogh information to be able to use it to log into Earthlink even though Alice used the same password for both AOL and Earthlink. Private key A2 is never sent to the ISP, but it may be stored on Alice's computer. It does, however, give enough information to login to Alice's AOL account. Note, Public key A1 is not really a public key and the only information that may be stored on Alice's computer is Private key A2. None of the other information mentioned above, especially Alice's password, may be stored on Alice's computer. Alice does not have to store Private key A2 on her computer if she wishes, this is just so that she doesn't have to type in her password each time she logs in. Alice also doesn't have to worry about generating private key A2, all of this is done by the software, the only thing Alice has to worry about is typing in her password and if she wishes to save her password, the software will save Private key A2 and not her password. No other password Alice chooses should be able to create an identical Private key A2).</p>
<p><br />
When Alice first chooses her password (to form Private key A2), Private key A2 acts as a private key to form Public Key A2. Public key A2 then acts as a private key to form Public key A3. Public Key A3 gets sent to the server and is stored on the AOL server. Public key A2 is never stored on the AOL server, but is sent to the server each time Alice logs in to confirm Alice's identity (since Public key A2 can be used to generate public key A3 and then the server can confirm that Public key A2 and Public key A3 are a key pair. However, given public key A3 it would be difficult to solve for Public key A2).</p>
<p><br />
When Alice chooses her passwords for Earthlink, the same procedure happens as above, the only difference is, instead of RA1, RA2 and RA3 being used, the Earthlink software will use RE1, RE2, and RE3. Alice's password for Earthlink is the same password as her password for AOL.</p>
<p>Why is all this stuff useful? Allow me to demonstrate with some examples.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Eve works for AOL. She has enough access to access AOL's database where all the Public key A3's are stored. She steals Alice's public key A3. She still doesn't have enough information to login to Alice's AOL account (she needs public key A2 to login to Alice's account and Publiic key A2 would require a cryptographic attack to compute). Eve also doesn't have enough information to determine Alice's password or to login to Alice's Earthlink account (again, without a cryptographic attack).</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Steve Case has much higher access than Eve. Steve Case has enough access to watch Alice when she logs in with Public key A2 and steal Public key A2 from Alice as Alice logs in. Now Steve case has enough information to login to Alice's AOL account; however, he doesn't have enough information to determine Alice's password or to login to her Earthlink account (again, without a cryptographic attack).</p>
<p>Also, if Alice were on a public, unencrypted Wifi with a laptop and someone stole Public key A2 (idealy you probably want to use ssl) that person would still not be able to determine Alice's password and he won't be able to login to Alice's Earthlink account.</p>
<p><br />
Example 3:</p>
<p>Alice has two computers, computer 1 located in Washington, computer 2 located in Texas. She uses her AOL account on computer 1 and her Earthlink account on computer 2. She is currently in Texas on Earthlink and she has Private key A2 stored on computer 1 in Washington. Bob wants to get even with Alice for something so he breaks into Alice's house in Washington and steals Private key A2. Now Bob has enough information to login to Alice's AOL account; however, he does not have enough information to determine Alice's password or login to her Earthlink account (not without a cryptographic attack).</p>

<p>Brandon Bochenski, #10 (born April 4, 1982) rookie ice hockey player with the Ottawa Senators of the NHL.</p>
<p>Born in Blaine, Minnisota he was Ottawa's second draft pick in the seventh round of the 2001 entry draft(223rd overall), 26th overall. He currently plays the right wing on a line with Bryan Smolinski and Peter Schaefer.</p>
<p>Bochenski led the USHL in goals and was second in points in the 2000-01 season. That June, he was drafted by the Senators. He may have been drafted sooner, had he and a friend not been accused of producing counterfeit money.</p>
<p>He went on to play for the University of North Dekota, where he finished second in the nation in scoring with 60 points (27 goals, 33 assists), and was named WCHA rookie of the year. In his final season at UND, Bochenski was named Sports Illustrated's "On Campus Player of the Year." He led North Dakota in goals, assists, points, power-play goals, short-handed goals and was named first-team All American.</p>
<p>Bochenski joined the Binghamton Senators of the AHL in 2004-05 after leaving the University of North Dakota a year early. He played on a line with playmaking center Jason Spezza, who complemented his game immensely. He enjoyed a successful rookie season with the Binghamton in 2004-05 being named to the AHL All-Rookie Team and leading all first-year players with 70 points (34 goals, 36 assists) in 75 games.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 2005-2006 season of the NHL, Bochenski had great success in training camp and in eight pre-season games, playing on a line with former linemate Jason Spezza and star scorer Dany Heatley. However, the pressure of being on the top line of one of the top teams in the league apparently effected Bochenski once the regular season began, and despite the maintained success of Spezza and Heatley, Bochenski failed to live up to expectations, producing only one goal and three assists in ten games. He was sent back to Binghamton to retrieve his game.</p>
<p>However, because of an injury to Martin Havlat, Bochenski was called back up to play in Ottawa. Without the pressure of playing on the top line, Bochenski flourished. To date, has 13 points in 17 games (6 goals, 7 assists), including a hat trick against the Florida Panthers.</p>

<p>3. 1831 Rickmer Clasen Rickmers (a member of the fraternity Corps Slesvico Holsatia) and his wife leave Helgoland, by that time an Danish Island. They get married and settle in Bremerhaven. Here, R.C. Rickmers founds what is to become a highly successful dynasty of shipowners. 1834 a first shipyard is founded.1836 R.C. Rickmers builds his first own ship Catharina and 1842 acquires a stake in two further small vessels, the "Weser" and the "Athene". From the 1848 on his ships fly his own Flag derived from the Helgoland Flag (Green, Red, White) with an R for Rickmers on it. 1859 the shipping line is set up. 1872 he buys a stake in a rice mill completing the name resold in 1901. Since then they operate in the shipping business.</p>

<p>Yashar Keramati offers a few suggestions which may shine a light on the moral status of some terrorist attacks. First, he explains that terrorism is a matter of perception; what may seem to be a terrorist to one group is in reality a hero or freedom fighter to another. He goes on to add that most terrorists are products of poor countries with facing immense interstate and civil disputes. Especially in the case of interstate conflicts, as mentioned before, the country which the terrorists are fighting for are often quite weak. Keramati says "Take for example the case of moderately powerful, American backed, undeclared nuclear power which is Israel and Palestine; a country with a weak economy and even weaker government". Keramati maintains that regardless of wither on sympathizes with Israel or Palestine, one fact remains the same: in this armed conflict, one has modern military power and the other not. What this leads to is two armies, one being the organized modern one, the other one being of a much less organized, civilian based militia. Say one was to assume that both states were equally just or equally wrong in the conflict, come fighting time, both will eject their forces against the other. Since the Palestinians do not have modern weaponry or an army nearly as powerful as the Israeli's, they fight in a different way.</p>
<p>Keramati explains then that the Palestinians fight in a way as to not destroy the Army of Israel, but to destroy the governmental policies of Israel which are the root of the damage towards Palestine. Keramati then explains a remarkable theory in which he states that one reason for terrorist attacks against civilians (car bombs, bombs and shootings in public places etc.) is to scare the public of their enemy state into forcing their own government to give the terrorist what they want. The way that this would work for example is that Israeli's after having their country attacked will want Israel and Palestine to reach an understanding on whatever terms necessary so they could be freed from their fears of worrying about their loved ones going into public places or engaging in everyday life without fear of death. Thus, although it is often seen as immoral to kill civilians in times of war, the saying "all is fair in love and war" seems quite appropriate here according to Keramati. Yashar Keramati sums up his point on the subject by saying that the only way one can determine is terrorism is moral or immoral is to look at the reasons for the initial conflict, see who is justified in the stance regarding the dispute, and the figuring out if the state which is valid in its dispositions have any other efficient ways to reach their goals. Sadly, the answer often seems to be no, thus "terrorist" take arms as they have nothing more to lose and seemingly more to gain.</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>ULi made its debut as a fabless IC design house in 2002. Although young in history, ULi has quickly made its way to become one of industry's leading solutions provider of core logic chipsets, multimedia, PC-host peripherals, embedded and IPC controllers.</p>
<p>Taking its leadership role in advancing technology, ULi's strong background and expertise in the PC core logic arena enables ULi to evolve with the fast paced technology to deliver long line of comprehensive leading-edge</p>
<p>solutions to the emerging digital consumer electronic market. Headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, ULi's global culture and proximity advantage assures extensive manufacturing infrastructure which brings even greater value to ULi's customers around the globe ensuring customers of world-class products and world-class support.</p>
<p><b>Chipsets</b></p>
<p>It has a lot of component level products which attracted a number of major partners in Taiwan to implement mainboards based on them. One of such is the ULi M1689. Although this AMD based AGP 8x chipset did not seem to outshine the rest of the competitors, it proved that ULi is able to make good chipsets with good quality. It was adapted on board from ABIT, ALBATRON, ASROCK, GIGABYTE.</p>
<p>ULi M1695 is the milestone for ULi Electronics. Together with ASrock, they made a success with the Asrock 939Dual-SATA2. It is a board that supports both native AGP 8x and PCIe. The first ever board that supports TGI or Triple Graphics Interface.</p>
<p>With the ULi M1695, users were able to overclock it to insane speeds like 400HTT. That would have surprised many especially those paying doubled the price for a DFI NF4 chipset mainboard.</p>
<p>This chipset also spurred lots of discussions on renown website OCWORKBENCH's forum at <a href="http://www.ocworkbench.com/asrock" class="external free" title="http://www.ocworkbench.com/asrock" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocworkbench.com/asrock</a>. The community is very unique there with ULi supporters gathered.</p>
<p>ULi 1697 is their next weapon to grab more market share. It single chipset ULi M1697 is a chipset that is cheaper than its competitors and yet offers better performance at almost half the price. OCWORKBENCH was first to review it followed by Anandtech which also praises the quality of the chipset in terms of performance.</p>
<p>On December 13, NVIDIA announced that it will acquire ULi Electornics.</p>

<p>Showcase showdown (The Price Is Right) is a feature of the long-running <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> game show <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_Is_Right_9c0f.html" title="The Price Is Right">The Price Is Right</a>. It was introduced in 1975 when the show expanded to an hour. It is used to determine which contestants go on to the Showcase round at the end of the show. In the show's 30-minute format, the top two on-stage winners (determined by their amount of winnings from their on-stage game and the One-Bid rounds combined) would go to the Showcase. The Showcase Showdown's set consists of the Big Wheel, which has money amounts ranging from 5Â¢ all the way up to $1.00 (in increments of 5Â¢).</p>
<p>RULES</p>
<ul>
<li>After the third pricing game, the three on-stage contestants play the Showcase Showdown to determine who wins and goes on to the Showcase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To determine the spinning order, they go by the contestants' total winnings (determined by adding what they won in the One-Bid and what they won in their pricing game). The player with the highest winnings spins last; the player with the lowest winnings spins first.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The object of the game is to get as close to $1.00 as possible in one spin or a combination of two spins without going over. Going over $1.00 automatically eliminates a player from the game. If the first two spinners go over a dollar, the third spinner automatically wins and gets one spin in order to try to get $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Getting $1.00 in one spin or a combination of two spins (e.g. 75Â¢ plus 25Â¢) earns the player a $1,000 bonus and a bonus spin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a contestant spins an amount which is less than the leader's total amount, they must spin again to see if they can get a higher total (even though they can go over $1.00).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The wheel is required to make at least one revolution in order for a spin to count.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the bonus spin, landing on one of the green sections (the 5Â¢ space under the $1.00 or the 15Â¢ space above the $1.00) will earn the player an additional $5,000 (for a total bonus of $6,000). Landing on the $1.00 space will earn the player an extra $10,000 (for a total bonus of $11,000). In the nighttime Military Specials from 2002, the $10,000 bonus is replaced by a $100,000 bonus; in the nighttime Million Dollar Spectacular specials, the $10,000 bonus is replaced by a $1,000,000 bonus. From the fourth Million Dollar Spectacular onward, if neither Showcase Showdown sees somebody win a $1,000 bonus, the winner of the Showcase will get one spin for $1,000,000 (the $5,000 bonus is not in effect in this case); if there is a double overbid, the emcee will randomly draw the name of an audience member who will get to spin for $1,000,000 (this person does not lose his eligibility to be a contestant).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the bonus spin, the wheel must make at least one complete revolution. If the player fails to get the wheel all the way around, the spin will not count, and the player will not get to spin again.</li>
</ul>
<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>During the week of September 8-12, 1975, CBS aired a special week of hour-long episodes. The wheel used during this time was completely different from the familiar Big Wheel. The original wheel (nicknamed the "Rainbow Wheel" due to its color scheme) was spun horizontally, like the Star Wheel on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a> and the <i>Melody Roulette</i> wheel on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Name_That_Tune_ae3f.html" title="Name That Tune">Name That Tune</a>. The $1,000 rule was in effect, but there was no bonus spin.</p>
<p>When TPIR made the full-time expansion to one hour on November 3, 1975, the "Rainbow Wheel" was replaced with the current Big Wheel. However, there were no green sections, and there was no bonus spin; these features were not added until December of 1978. Since then, there have been a few cosmetic additions and enhancements to the wheel and the Showcase Showdown set.</p>
