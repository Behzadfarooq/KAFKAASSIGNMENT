<li><b>Keep</b> I know this might seem like I'm just being awkward, but I don't think this can be written off as a hoax so quickly. The link to the "nation's" site is an interesting read.

<dd>I have no axe to grind over this, I have no particular interest in micronations. But I think we need to consider what makes a micronation worthy enough to warrant a Wiki entry. For example, the Aerican Empire, which apparently recognises the Dominion of British West Florida, has existed, apparently, for 19 years. This would seem to catagorise these micronations as being similar to RPG games, which have numerous entries here <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 13:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would work for me as long as it was covered by a reliable source. Did you review the link to the Aerican Empire Afd? One alternative is to delete the article, but give the group an entry in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> article. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 14:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would make sense, but the only problem I can see is that Sealand is both a micronation and a genuinely worthy article. This entry could slot into the micronation article fine. I think common sense shows that Sealand is worthy of an article, though. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 14:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Sealand is notable, having been covered by many reliable news outlets. Unless I've missed something, this one isn't, but micronations such as these may have exceptions. The Dominion appears to have had coins made by the Central Bank of the Grand Duchy of Westarctica. Can this be verified? According to the AfD for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_His_Majesty%2C_Richard_lake%2C_King_of_The_Sakonta_Tribe_b40b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/His Majesty, Richard lake, King of The Sakonta Tribe">Richard lake, King of The Sakonta Tribe</a>, there was a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.ownnation17jul17,1,6122849.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true" class="external text" title="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.ownnation17jul17,1,6122849.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true" rel="nofollow">Baltimore Sun</a> article.

<li><b>Keep</b> If other micronations accept the claim of the Dominion of British West Florida as a valid micronation, I see no reason this can not have an article just like the other micronations in Wikipedia. I agree the historical claim is weak and downright ridiculous but separatists groups in Hawaii, Texas, and Alaska use some of the same weak arguments relating to illegal annexations in the 19th century and these groups are treated seriously by Wikipedia and not treated as hoaxes. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryQ_2d28.html" title="User:LarryQ">LarryQ</a> 14:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Note that the "Aerican Empire" article was deleted. Entities like Sealand, and the Republic of Texas separatists have appeared in newspapers, clashed with law enforcement, etc. Is there a reference anywhere in any legitimate news format (not counting their own website, and that blog, which is just someone commenting on the website) to the "Dominion of British West Florida"? There has to be a minimum notability requirement for "micronations". Otherwise anyone could make one up and get their own Wikipedia article.
