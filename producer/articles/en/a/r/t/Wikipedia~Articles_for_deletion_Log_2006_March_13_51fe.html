<p>Delete. I am sceptical there exists such a thing as the "Richmond Emerging Church Movement". No hits on Google. Visiting several of the supposed member websites I find no mention of any such movement, nor any indication they consider themselves <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerging_church.html" title="Emerging church">emergent churches</a>, nor even any awareness of each other. A random mishmash of unrelated church organizations in Virginia is what this looks like to me. Perhaps a gentle hoax? I'll leave a note for the originator &amp; ask him to chime in with any evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 00:03, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Looks awfully questionable. Interesting to see if the author can provide something. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> It might be a sort of gentle hoax, as Technopilgrim suggests, or it could just be a badly written article attaching a label to a phenomenon which isn't really a movement. I could be persuaded by some external evidence that such a movement had been identified, and was actually noteworthy, but so far there's no such evidence. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 02:00, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looks like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <b>Delete</b> unless it can be shown that verifiable external sources have noted that the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergent_church.html" title="Emergent church">emergent church</a> movement in and around Richmond has the claimed distinct features. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:35, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this isn't a movement. It's just some observations made by an editor about certain churches in Richmond. Borders on original research. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 02:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I personally agree that most schools (this one included) aren't notable enough to deserve Wikipedia articles, AFD consensus has fairly consistently gone against my view.

<li><b>Delete</b> its already clear that there are some people who feel that the debat on schools is closed and the result is that every school is notable.

<li>It is not an inane policy, because, well, it's not policy yet. It's still at the proposed policy level, which is where anything starts in that field. It's an <i>active</i> policy proposal, meaning its being fixed, debated and utilized, which is better then the failed policies that pop up every now and then, but I could put up a policy proposal page stating anything I want and try to get it accepted. Doesn't mean it's binding till it reaches the accepted policy stage. -<a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> 19:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I was proofreading some 1911 articles, I came across this (which I had imported a few weeks back); I then followed some of the links and discovered that each member of the family mentioned in the 1911 article has a separate article in Wikipedia (usually with an image as well). I think we should delete this article since its the same information as in the separate articles (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frans_van_Mieris%2C_Sr._0319.html" title="Frans van Mieris, Sr.">Frans van Mieris, Sr.</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willem_van_Mieris_d0e9.html" title="Willem van Mieris">Willem van Mieris</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frans_van_Mieris_jr._d08b.html" title="Frans van Mieris jr.">Frans van Mieris jr.</a>.

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: More than anything, that seems to be a commentary on the fact that something <i>non-</i>notable can be quietly put all over Wikipedia, rather than the other way around. But I suppose that depends on your point of view. Regardless, if "above all" is that other articles linked to it in the encyclopedia anyone can edit... then it ain't above much: if existing in Wikipedia were a sign of notability, you could never delete anything. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 22:38, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small>Seems to me that the external links section of articles (where Political Friendster is showing up throughout Wikipedia) is fair space for any POV, especially those that may not be "suitable" to be referenced directly in the actual article body. On the other hand, some editors have decided themselves that the Political Friendster is totally invalid, has no notability at all (playing down its large membership and Yahoo designation), and have decided to censor it completely out of the encyclopedia. I'm sorry, but how free is this encyclopedia when a website can only be added "loudly" to external links of relevant articles. This whole Afd is subjective and politically driven. How about altering the Political Friendster article to address your concerns about its validity (a reason why the article was created in the first place), instead of just trying to delete every reference to it? --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 23:41, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small>You should read the conversation about Political Friendster that went on at <a href="../../../d/i/c/Talk%7EDick_Cheney_8cfc.html" title="Talk:Dick Cheney">Talk:Dick Cheney</a> for reasons why it's an inappropriate external link. And I think it's a fair bar above which external links must rise to say that, yes, you should be able to "loudly" add an external link to Wikipedia. You should be able to go onto the talk page and declare, "I am adding such and such a web site, the content of which is such and such" and there shouldn't be a violent backlash. I'm not saying you should <i>have</i> to do that, but you definitely should be able to. How is this AfD politically driven, exactly? And if I don't think Political Friendster is relevant, how is my altering the language of the article going to help that? <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 23:51, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><small>Comment: Re JDoorjam's comments, if anything non-notable can be put on Wikipedia in the first place, then it has no place restricting more non-notable sources to comment on the earlier non-notable sources. As for the Dick Cheney talk page, that seems POV driven (and non-notable POVs at that) dislike to the humorous approach taken as opposed to whether its content is factual. Compare how many Wikipedia pages link to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a> article, which is 100% parody news, yet very notable. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPro-Lick_c6f2.html" title="User talk:Pro-Lick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pro-Lick_c441.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pro-Lick">contribs</a>) .</small></small>
<ul>
<li><small>I don't understand your first sentence. Non-notable things should not be put on Wikipedia. As Rhobite pointed out in <a href="../../../d/i/c/Talk%7EDick_Cheney_8cfc.html" title="Talk:Dick Cheney">Talk:Dick Cheney</a>, the material is <i>not</i> factual. You'll have to give me some specific examples about articles linking to the Onion for me to comment on that statement. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 00:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</small><br /></li>
<li><small>After reviewing the conversation at Talk:Dick Cheney, I see that only you and Rhobite are strongly opposed to the use of Political Friendster as an external link (which clearly explains this Afd). Don't you think it's pretty unfair for both of you to personally decide what is legit or not for inclusion in a <b>free</b> encyclopedia? You make it seem like content needs to be expressed "loudly" and get your clearance or it is not relevant. If not, than why this Afd? You, yourself even know that is not correct. Furthermore, Pro-Lick is absolutely correct. If you have beef with Political Friendster that can be proven beyond your subjective POV (which has yet to be materialized), add it to the article about the website (noting the restrictions on <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>). This is totally the wrong way to go about it. Regards --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 01:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small>Actually, my opposition to its use is only tangentially related to this AfD: I was unaware of its existence until someone tried to link to it from <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>. For instance, I could oppose the use of an article from the Drudge Report on Hillary Clinton's page, but would not ever suggest deleting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Drudge_Report_181f.html" title="The Drudge Report">The Drudge Report</a>. Political Friendster has the dual distinction of being hopelessly inaccurate <i>and</i> not notable enough to warrant its own article. As I very clearly stated in my comment, <b>"I'm not saying you should <i>have to (state it loudly), but you should definitely be able to."</i></b> <i>So, no, I don't think everything needs to be run by me, or anyone. With that said, no, I don't think it's unfair for anyone to personally decide what is legit or not. That's the whole point of the Wiki model. And I'm still not clear how adding "some people do not believe that Political Friendster is notable enough for Wikipedia" to the article about Political Friendster is going to fix anything (leaving aside its obvious violation of [[WP:No self references|Wikipedia's self-reference policy). Now, could you explain what you mean about my "subjective POV (which has yet to be materialized"? <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 00:40, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</i></small></li>

<li><b>Comment from closing administrator:</b> JDoorj hits the mark. Wikipedia is not "free" in the sense that you can add anything to it. In any case, it is not free because you agree to collaborate with others and subject yourself to policies, which have to be applied by fallible human beings, and yes, subjectively. How else? On the issue of notability: something has to be notable in some way to appear in Wikipedia, but the converse should not be considered when discussing the notability of something in e. g. AfD. That is, Wikipedia is not a valid reference for demonstrating the notability of something. The "keep" opinions have been taken into account, but the core of the matter seems to be disagreement on policies and on "delete" voters' opinions; those things should be taken to the relevant talk pages, not to an AfD debate. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Keep</b> The only legitimate reason I see for deletion amoung your comments is the last entry. "Whether its tasteful or not is irrelevant...No indication the word's in any kind of general use." I understand this.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, the rest of you pseudo intellectuals should be ashamed of yourselves. Telling me I need to undergo testosterone reduction therapy, that this isn't an "urban" encyclopedia, and that wikipedia is not a locker room is totally obscene.</dd>
<dd>Shame on you! As keepers of Wikipedia you should not launch personal attacks on people who submit articles. You should judge each entry on its own merit as opposed to whether you think the user is a jerk. I read the comments and I think what a shame it is that you call yourselves intellectuals. Get over yourselves people!</dd>
<dd>Now, I do not like being vulgar here, but just listen to a few of the entries I have found. And now look at your petty comments and see if you still believe my entry is "locker room" status. Shame!</dd>
<dd>From Wikipedia (again I apologize...these are from your dictionary)
<dl>
<dd>Fuck, Pussy (yes the slang term), Cunt, asshole, motherfucker, fingering (sexual act), Anal Fingering (do u believe this is in there???).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And get this one:
<dl>
<dd>-A footjob (often shortened to "FJ") is also called a "toejob," "solejob" and "heeljob." Regardless of what part of the foot is used, it is often referred to as a footjob. The most common example of this involves someone placing both of their feet on their male partner's penis and stroking it continuously until he ejaculates on their feet, although they can also perform a footjob with only one foot. Multiple people can also perform a footjob on the same male. For example, if two people are performing a footjob on one man, they are giving a "double-footjob." A footjob done by three people on the same man is called a "triple-footjob."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Barry Ace here, and it seems some of you are a little in the dark or just don't know much about wrestling. You see, 75% of wrestling fans would much rather watch local wrestling than WWE and that is a fact. As far as this article being for vanity, even though I'm just local, I actually have fans in different parts of the world: some here in NE, some in New Jersey, some in Virginia, some in Florida, even some in Europe. And this article was created for them so why don't you try backing up your "vanity" claim and explain how it's vanity. As far as Google only returning my personal website, search engines are not mind readers, they only retrieve links with the words you put in the field. If you just put "Barry Ace" in the box you'll even get NWA results from the 80's that had BARRY Windham and Johnny ACE on the card. If you want sites that I'm on, just put some of the nicknames I've had in the past like "Too Hot For TV", "The Modern Day Icon", "The 4:20 Pimp", or even "Sebastion" in your search as well, you might even want to put in the word "wrestling" in it as well.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryace_b296.html" title="User:Barryace">barryace</a> 07:13, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> WAW is very popular, gets regular press coverage, they have fans across the United States and even in other countries due to a popular weekly downloadable internet show. I'm not offended, because the people demanding its deletion are completely ignorant to the product. The Wikipedia article does nothing to promote, as it doesn't advertise the website, doesn't make mention of their free, weekly downloads (only that it has a popular multimedia website for information purposes), and it doesn't advertise the one local aspect of it which would be saying where, when, and how people can attend live shows. It just says where they are, not when or how to get tickets. wawwrestling.com does a well enough job of all those things. All the article does is the one thing wawwrestling.com doesn't do, and that's explain the history of the promotion, which people obviouslly want to know because that's the full extent of the media coverage. To the people that don't think it's notable, it's existed since 1998 and has been quite successful, especially in recent years, and it's one of many independant wrestling companies that are the primary competition for WWE and TNA, and the starting point of future wrestlers. To the one who said "vanity," back up your claim and explain how this article is "vanity." There's an official website and a myspace site for "vanity." This article is purely informative, the information has been demanded, and now it's been delivered. JAPW and ROH aren't the only notable wrestling promotions on the east coast, WAW, CPW, WFA, and CW are all "notable." --User:Samx3i 05:29, 14 March, 2006

<li>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that, for my points to be valid, I had to edit more things. Fair enough. I'll go write an informative article about bias towards certain types of entertainment and then maybe you can actually take the time to read what I wrote above and consider it. You know what though? I don't want to be a part of any club that wouldn't have me as a member (Groucho Marx). You people have nothing better to do than to submit for deletion informative articles because they're not relevant to YOU but are otherwise in demand and are notable whether or not you like it. You make claims of "vanity" you can't back up and then dismiss my entire arguement because I'm new to this website and haven't done anything but edit the page in question and this one (yeah, this one, like I wasn't supposed to defend my own article). Maybe I haven't done more because I got laid off last Monday and looking for a job was more of a concern of mine that writing an article on Count Chockula Cereal. Honest, get over yourselfs, stop taking this so seriously, it's a website that collects informative articles written by its members. That's all I was doing. Why don't you spend your time writing something people want to read about instead of crying about waw. Or like I said, just delete it, I don't care anymore. This is all really pathetic. --User:Samx3i 05:29, 14 March, 2006</li>

Now nowhere does it say copelation or relevent facts or mass content of important information. All subjects listed are fact based infomative articles, WAW CPW and BX are all existing entities. I also submit to you that if a local wrestling federation is to be deleted then why not delete all the Radio station? I crated the CPW page because i noticed other small wrestling federations on Wiki and decided that CPW was just as notable to relevent information as any other. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundergod9_3847.html" title="User:Sundergod9">Sundergod9</a> 04:25, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Crystal ball. About a week ago I prod'ed another alleged movie for a Cartoon Network show (Aqua Teen Hunger Force). Like this one, it vaguely predicted a movie, with no timetable, no sources. That article was deleted without objection when the 5 days after the Prod passed.

<p>It is my one and only comment but I have recently registered here to attempt to save this article. I hope to participate more in the Wikipedia moderating process but this article must be saved! Not only is this a growing phenomena, it is hilarious and must be spread because it is such an intergral part of the cumrauderie i experience being a proud member of many sports teams in the local Boston area. I implore users of wikipedia to vote to keep this article since it is a true occurence and must be documented. I thank you for the time and hope my efforts will change your minds regarding this articles pending deletion. Thank you.</p>

<li>Folks, the writer of the article states this is a "fictitious storm from the film The Perfect Storm", so I don't think asking for evidence that it existed is actually germane. I would suggest that someone familiar with the movie check to see that indeed one of the storms <i>in the movie</i> is named that way, and if so, <b>Merge</b> with Article <i>The Perfect Storm (Movie)</i>. I don't see either vandalism or hoax here, but I don't see why this should be under the tropical cyclone category, as this tropical storm is not part of our world in any case. I'd call the categorization a good faith error.<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a>

<li>I would suggest that, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">the verifiability policy</a>, "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a></li>

<p><b>Comments and questions</b>. As the creator of the article, I cannot agree with the above comment, "excellent rewrite". All the person doing the revising did was delete 1 sentence in the introduction and about 5 sentences under the Hemobag entry itself! The rest of my work remains <i>as is</i>. The person also included a few more links to wikipedia pages, which I would have done myself - this was only a first draft.</p>
<p>About the entry being <i>blatant advertising</i> I disagree. Look at what was said about the Hemobag in the original. It's one of 3 methodologies used to for intraoperative blood salvage, specifically a new type of technology using an ultrafiltration reservoir; studies to date have shown it to be safe but studies using clinical trials are neede to show if it really is effective and safe. The rest of the entry was background material to show why blood salvage devices are needed and why they need to be improved. Moreover the scientific links to published research that I added (4 of which remain) are quite critical of blood salvage technology in general and present a balanced perspective.</p>
<p>Frankly, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonetics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonetics" rel="nofollow">Haemonetics</a> entry is pure advertising with absolutely no redeeming scientific or education value! The Hemobag article was the opposite.</p>
<p>A general question - this article was written as an entry for the Hemobag and now has been changed into an entry for <i>Intraoperative blood salvage</i>. As the creator of an article that has been revised but is substantially the same as originally written (except for deletion of about 6 sentences), should I choose to (and it's only a maybe at this time), do I not have the right to delete the article? Not saying I would but am curious about wikipedia policy. ~~Blut~~</p>

<li><b>Reply</b>: Your original material was otherwise OK, but the paragraph specifically about the Hemobag® read like advertising. The way the article is now, including both your work and the rewriter's, is encyclopedic enough to keep in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Creator's Reply</b>:Thanks but the rewriter deleted 6 sentences - the rest (there's a lot of work there) is mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>About interpreting the Hemobag portion as advertising, here's the 5 sentences I wrote:</p>
<hr />
<p><i>The Hemobag® is a new type of ultrafiltration reservoir designed to overcome the limitations of RBC-savers and direct retransfusion in cardiac, vascular, and other types of surgery through hemofiltration. The methodology of blood salvaging with the Hemobag® in the operating room is depicted in this video</i>.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Being a new ultrafiltration method, the Hemobag® was not included in earlier papers and studies. Studies to date have shown the Hemobag® to quickly and safely recover substantial proteins, clotting factors, and red cell concentrates (References 5-7). While the Hemobag® shows promise, randomized clinical studies of the Hemobag® are needed to more fully assess patient outcomes and to measure reduction of allogeneic blood products.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>The Hemobag statements are backed by references. There's a link to a video; it shows the new technology in action. Believe me promotional copy reads quite differently, and does not have links to studies that question the entire process of cell salvaging!</p>
<p>Contrast with the Haemonetics entry (only a few extracted - the entire entry is an advertisement!):</p>
<p><i>It has offices worldwide... Haemonetics has been a global leader in blood processing technology. The Company has two families of products:....Haemonetics is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker HAE.....</i></p>
<p>Give me a break! User blut</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> after looking at the web site this quote caught my eye <b>More than 15,000 soldiers and civilian employees and 9,500 family members make up the JMTC.'</b> - Of course this has nothing really to do with DOS Forward, other than DOS Forward is located in JMTC, but the training center itself is VERY notable. Graf/Hohenfels training areas have been used by the US Army going back to the end of WWII to present day, I would venture to say that over 100K soldiers have gone through there at some point in their miliary career. <a href="../../../o/a/r/User%7EOarias_0935.html" title="User:Oarias">Oscar Arias</a> 06:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, 401 google hits for "willingham" and "clockwork storybook" together (492 for "clockwork storybook" alone, 166,000 for "bill willingham" alone) seems to be sufficient for notability. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<dd>I also want to make the point that while I provided this reference, <i>I was under no obligation to do so.</i> We assume good faith and the recourse to using external sources is a step taken after a dispute over the material is documented.

For people who would passively rely upon the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream_media.html" title="Mainstream media">mainstream media</a> to bring the stories of Jessen and other survivors of abortion to their attention, she and others like her will be maintained plausibly <i>non-notable</i> by pretending they do not exist.

Best idea would probably be to keep individual pages for winners and/or those who have gone on to do something notable in their professional careers (for example Jennifer Hudson, a former contestant, who is playing the lead, Effie, in the film version of "Dreamgirls" starring Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles) and merge the rest into a single page.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> American Idol is the top rated show in the nation currently. Millions of viewers have voted to keep him in the final twelve and he is an active and current participant, one of only a dozen right now. If he is dropped from the show in the next two weeks, before the final 10 are set which go on tour through the summer, I would reconsider. But he is very much a popular and current topic right now--User:MitchBell 12:15, 13 March 2006 (UTC)<small>Note: This is not actually a registerred user, but an IP.

<li><b>Keep</b> American Idol is a pop culture icon. There is no reason to let snobbery and elitism determine the education and informational material that exists out 'there' in the world. If snobbery and elitism are the yardsticks of determining what is valid or invalid informational media...well, the world would still be flat.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.247.52.76 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.247.52.76.html" title="User talk:24.247.52.76">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.247.52.76_070c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.247.52.76">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Becoming an <i>American Idol</i> top-twelve finalist brings sufficient notability. Even if he's the first of the twelve to be eliminated, he's made it this far which means he's received thousands of votes...and perhaps more importantly, he's automatically slated to go on the <i>Idol</i> tour and be on whatever <i>Idol</i> compilation albums they release. The top twelve overall get significantly more attention than the eliminated semi-finalists, so it's an easy line to draw. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Daniel Matthews is a real person, but due to his extreme privacy you have not turned up any google references. I thought there was some degree of open mindedness and discussion on Wikipedia, obviouly not. Being a prude over the sex industry does not mean information should not be spread about this man.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b> This article is strange and somewhat confusing: it has a wealth of good pictures but very little text describing exactly what it is and how it relates to other similar devices. This describes a very large commercial device, but I've seen the "set n forget" label applied to normal small countertop cookers as well, the sort one might find in a home kitchen. Are those part of the same brand line, or has the term become generic? This article could use a great deal of clearification, but I think it's a good start toward describing a notable type of product. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:28, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Firstly, all the pictures are legal. They have been donated by the company and also fall under the promotional material fair usage policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The product is not an ordinary deep fryer with a hand-held basket. This was a unique automatic deep fryer that tried to eliminate some perceived drawbacks of traditional deep fryer systems. Unfortunatly the product design never reached sales expectations and went out of production in the mid-to-late 1970's.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it is an important time capsule on the history of deep fryers. I have added a background section to clarify its importance. I can't prove 100% another automatic deep fryer existed before this one, however, if the article is maintained it doesn't stop another person disputing another one was in existence before this one. A patented was pending... as it states on one of the brochures, however, the patent application would have eventually be cancelled once the company ceased production of the deep fryers. Ashleyjoyce 06:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Changing my vote based on 1) article has been expanded and improved, 2) Creator of article seems to be a dedicated good-faith editor and I do not want to discourage her, 3) arguments that the product represents a valid innovation in a commercial process are may have some validity. Also, article does not seem to be spam, However, I do have reservations and would like to see the material used instead to expand the "commercial frying" (or whatever we have) article and/or the article on the inventor... I do not like to vote Merge as a rule, I'm kind of on the border so I vote Keep but weakly. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:43, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, articles on "Commercial Deep Frying" or Commercial Deep Fryer do not exist. I did add a redirection from the keword search "automated deep frying".</li>
</ul>
<p>This innovation really should have its own class anyway, its not generic. It can't be class as a standard deep fryer that uses hand-held baskets or like the home deep fryers that use tongs to handle the fried food. Its a machine that automates the deep frying process. I was hoping that over time people might expand further on the topic of automated deep fryers. Is there any other like this being actively marketed?? Were other similar products ever sold prior to the 1970's etc. It adds some trivia to the field of deep frying. 210.8.99.100 07:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd certainly agree with you about merging semi-finalists, but I think becoming an <i>American Idol</i> top-twelve finalist brings sufficient notability. Even if he's the first of the twelve to be eliminated, he's made it this far which means he's received thousands of votes...and perhaps more importantly, he's automatically slated to go on the <i>Idol</i> tour and be on whatever <i>Idol</i> compilation albums they release. The top twelve overall get significantly more attention than the eliminated semi-finalists, so it's an easy line to draw. The finalist list article should be redirected to the season article. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:10, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete and Redirect</b>. I considered relisting this, but it's had 14 days already and I think on strength of argument (particularly regarding the page's status as a POV fork) there is a consensus to redirect it. I've taken "redirect" to mean in this context "delete and redirect", given that there's no point in just replacing a contentous POV fork with a soft redirect that can be undone with a couple of mouse clicks. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:53, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Unlike other parts of Kurdistan Syria's Kurdistan is a small region so the region maybe is unknown for some people. But in fact the article is on the part of Kurdistan which is within borders of the Arabic country of Syria. The article is different from the article 'Kurds in Syria' as the second one explains the Kurds and their situation in Syria who a large number of them even do not live in this region. The article still is a stub and can explain more sides of the history of the region which by itself has its own long story. I see no POV fork here.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I see no compelling reason to weaken our coverage of fictional planets nor has the nom even attempted to provide one.

That may be true in an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_universe.html" title="Alternate universe">alternate universe</a> or in a fictional article located in a fictional wiki on a fictional planet. Perhaps that is where the nom verified this info before adding his prod to the article. However, back in the real world, in a real wiki, known as wikipedia, in a real article known as <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_Science_Fiction_a9e7.html" title="Planets in Science Fiction">Planets in Science Fiction</a>- none of these planets are covered. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:19, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, most of these planets can be reached through the PiSF article.

<p>this is a vanity article. a quick search on discogs.com and juno.co.uk gives no results for this group, and there's no way they can be pioneers of gabber if they formed in 2005. "Danger Trance Incorporated" gives a paltry 13 hits on google, and their label "TranceFusion Records" gives only 68 results. sorry to those who have put effort into cleaning the article up but i'm putting this up for afd. compare with nu style gabber/darkcore label <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme_records.html" title="Enzyme records">enzyme records</a> which gives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22enzyme+records%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22enzyme+records%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">72,600 results</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilkMiruku_5586.html" title="User:MilkMiruku">MilkMiruku</a> 18:34, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the site well-known? Is there a better-known Ukrainian webcomic site?

<dd>Is the comic independent of the syndication site?

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this page seems to be so controversial, I feel I should say a few words on why I started this page. I have a bachelors degree in history, so my interest is mainly historical. Over the week-end I was watching a show on the history channel that referred to Joe Kennedy’s pro-nazi stance. I remembered Lindbergh and the Duke of Windsor from previous studies on this subject. I think it is important from an historical point of view to be aware of how deeply imbedded racism and anti-semitism are in our culture. I am sure the families of these individuals would prefer to white-wash their biographical information of these now political incorrect sentiments, but I don’t think that is in the best interests of history. Note also that I included the word “alleged” in the article.</li>

<p>- This year, more than 3000 people will celebrate National Corndog Day with 80 parties in 28 states (www.corndogday.com/parties) that anyone can join and host.</p>
<ul>
<li>- This is not a flash in the pan -- it has been celebrated for several decades, with the formal national effort starting again in 1998. It has also been celebrated in 6 foreign countries.</li>
<li>- Several independent press reports have been written in the past about NCD, including:</li>
<li>-- The Oregonian: "Every Corndog Has Its Day", published on March 16, 2002. Now only available in paid archives, but findable in <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/search/oregonian/" class="external text" title="http://www.oregonlive.com/search/oregonian/" rel="nofollow">the Oregonian Search</a></li>
<li>-- Boulder Dirt: "Ladies and gentlemen, start your corndogs", published on March 17, 2005.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://boulderdirt.com/features/article.cfm/2230" class="external autonumber" title="http://boulderdirt.com/features/article.cfm/2230" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>-- UVa Law Weekly: "The Dirty Side of Corndogging", published March 25, 2005 <a href="http://www.lawweekly.org/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=647&amp;edition_id=1&amp;format=html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawweekly.org/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=647&amp;edition_id=1&amp;format=html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></li>
<li>-- Several radio shows -- including one of Chicago's main Sports Radio stations -- of which I cannot find archived footage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know what other information would be helpful in making this determination. (Full disclosure: I am a 7-time participant in NCD and a big fan.) --Gnellie 00:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. National Corndog Day events will be hosted at over 50 different locations throughout the nation in 2006. The event has recieved extensive media coverage, and is attended by enthusaists, media commentators and politicians (as a reporter for a national publication, I am flying to San Francisco to attend a NCD event this weekend.) To delete the entry because it is an emerging, rather than mature, national celebration would be to deprive the wikipedia community of an important insight. And given the extensive pages of esperanto (an essentially unused language) and flash mobs (a 'movement' created by an editor from Harper's Magazine that is now dead and at its height involved less than 200 people), an entry about NCD is not out of place. -- Duhigg

<li>Mikka: It is kind of mean to call Duhigg 'no such user' isn't it? I mean, lets look at the facts: Duhigg has posted to this entry, suggesting that if he isn't a user, he has mad user skills, huh? Also, Duhigg has taken the time to write about National Corndog Day. Now, I will grant you: Duhigg does not devote his entire day to trying to suck the joy out of people's lives by nominating wikipedia entries for deletion. Instead, he does things like go to brunch with his friends, hang out with his wife, and wonder why other people get so worked up over the status of newly created holidays (which, I will note, was not only profiled on WGN radio, but which also was enjoyed by hundreds of people on March 18, 2006.) This suggests that he is real, and although may not rise to the level of a "wikipedia user," my guess is that he has real feelings, real hopes and dreams, a real yen for corndogs. -- Duhigg</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If a "national" day involves only 3000 people out of 250 million, it doesn't sound very national. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 01:05, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>The correctness of the event's name has nothing to do with its validity as a wikipedia article, or whether the article is verifiable.</li>
<li>As far as the google test is concerned, the event's site is the top ranked google for "corn dog" and second for "corndog".</li>
<li>I would guess (please don't make me check them all!) that many of the entries on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fictional_holidays" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fictional_holidays" rel="nofollow">Fictional Holidays Category</a> list are about as unverifiable and unpopular on google as NCD.</li>
<li>Number of google hits is not a valid criteria for deleting an article or determining verifiability.</li>
<li>I'm not sure what makes this celebration 'nonnotable'. Please provide some specifics on this.</li>

<p>This article is about a tunnel connecting two university buildings, and is likely to be fiction — a recent edit to the article suggests it is an elaborate hoax. I had wondered about the authenticity of the tunnel previously, since the only references to it seemed to be for the student supporters group. To be honest, even if the tunnel does exist I don't really think a tunnel connecting two university buildings is sufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article, and its existence certainly seems to be in some doubt. <sub>└</sub> <sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 22:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well obviously the tunnel doesnt exist...thats the whole point! To cut the story short the rumour about the tunnel was started by the Chaplain and it became very popular so now there is a Boldrewood Tunnel soc. however to be recognised as one of the university's clubs it needs to have "genuinely serious aims and objectives". Therefore it has been decided that our aim is to make life better on our campuses. This will be achieved by doing ‘nice things’ called Temporal Unifying No-specific Nactions of Evil-less Love (or T.U.N.N.E.L.S.) Performing a TUNNEL is going to be known as DIGging (or Direct Instigation of Goodness). Looking for somewhere to DIG a TUNNEL is going to be known as SURVEYING (or specific urban reaction… etc etc etc...</p>

<p>This Club is the greatest society any univrsity has ever spawned. It is growing at a very very fast rate, and is and international society, with members across the globe. The tunnel itself is a very usful untaped resourse for the university, 17 students a year are currently run over on burgess road, and quite frankly the university needs international pressure to reopen said tunnel. As for obviously not existing, well that's rubbish, we have evidence and so on, see the main article for our web address. The Idea of DIGging a TUNNEL is simply and extension of our aims, that help the Students union affiliation process go a little more smoothly.</p>

This club is unique and is currently the fastest growing on campus. The club has even spread beyond the knowledge of Southampton and is revered in other Universities all around the country (woo England!) and getting rid of it would be an offence to all who have heard of it!</p>

This is the most totally awesome club ever - I am a member and don't even go to Southampton uni! That just goes to show how far the society gas united peoples of all calling and from all areas of the globe, not just those students of Southampton, but is strongly developing inter-uni links across the country, and as such is a more valuable resource than possibly comprehendable.</p>

<p>There is a viable reason for the society. 17 ppl are run over PER YEAR. Opening the tunnel might help the situation. And I as a student at southampton would find the tunnel very useful.</p>

<p>The boldrewood tunnel is not so much a myth as a legend. Inspired by the new university chaplain, this club is now the fastest growing at the university of Southampton - and equally popular amongst current students as past students not even living there anymore - such as myself!</p>
<p>DON'T DELETE&#160;!!!! - Jon. 15 march 2006</p>
<p>Boldrewood Tunnel, a myth though it is, is really a somewhat quirky and successful social experiment that has spawned a society. The mere fact that a society exists demonstrates that people are prepared to associate with utter nonsense. What does this say about trends in society? In the light of potential deletion of this article, it would probably remove a case study that demonstrates new trends, in a similar light to Flash Mobs and other such phenomenon. Urban myths, as this clearly is, need to be recognised. I would not recommend deleting this article, but renaming it 'Boldrewood Tunnel Society'.</p>
<p>DON'T DELETE&#160;!!!! - Rob H 15th March 2006</p>
<p>Corrected spellings, but that's not the point - this wiki should exist to inform people of the tunnel (which has not been disproved).</p>

<p>DON'T DELETE!!!!!--Seb Maybe the entry for boldrewood tunnel should be slightly changed. The aim of the boldrewood tunnel society is no longer the reopening of the tunnel, we have developed into an international society with members from countries as distant as Germany and France. Thus we are actively puttting foward good relations between different cultures and different nations. The TUNNEL is just the symbol that brings us together, it is a mere idea we can all identify with and which we can relate to- i.e. the idea to do good in the world. Please take this into consideration.</p>

<p>Our society is so unique, special and in it's formative years atm. The reaction we have received on campus cannot be undermined, with new recruits every week, who previously slammed our soc.

<p>To those at the top of ths page who want to delete this article, i wish to pose a question, or perhaps two. It would be nice to recive an answer. Firstly perhaps the article should be renamed rather than deleted as you propose, to "Boldrewood Tunnel Society" as the society most certainly does exist and noone can honestly deny that, even those fools who pretend the tunnel is a fake. Secondly i would like to contend the point made "I don't really think a tunnel connecting two university buildings is sufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article". The whole purpose of an encyclopædia is to document EVERYTHING, thats what the name means, saying something is unworthy an entry is daft, an could lead to all sorts of pages being cited as insufficiently "notable to merit an encyclopedia [sic] article" Elijah78.84 21:47, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Despite your first sentence, you failed to pose any question, merely to make two points. In response, I would say that a university society, or a tunnel connecting two university buildings <b>is not</b> sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. The purpose of Wikipedia is not to "document everything" — see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. You seem to ridicule the notion that saying something unworthy of inclusion is daft and that this could lead to "all sorts of pages being cited as insufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article" yet that is precisely what does happen. I suggest you read through <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> where you will find plenty of nominations for deletions of articles deemed insufficently notable to merit inclusion.</dd>
<dd>As a side issue, I notice you feel the need to append <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a> to the spelling of encyclopedia without an <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">a</a> or <a href="../../../%C3%A6/_/_/%C3%86.html" title="Æ">æ</a>. This is a perfectly well accepted spelling (see <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>) although admittedly more American than British in origins.</dd>
<dd>To the anonymous contributors to this page please read the warning notice above and realise that this is not a simple voting process. No-one is objecting to the article purely because of a lack of references, or suggesting that your club is gaining popularity. It is just not sufficiently notable to merit inclusion here (otherwise <i>every</i> club in <i>every</i> university around the world would want an article).</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> nonsensical neologism—"the theory of when something evolves ,but more than it has to, so it can fight the problem rather than just adapting to survive with it." It looks like someone simply got confused by natural selection. The article was prodded and tagged for verification; the author removed both tags and only responded by adding the link to a subscription only source as "backing up" the "theory." As a sign of how carelessly this posting was made, the link was described as "J. P.

<p>The <i>proposed</i> articles (99% of them don't even exist yet!) on this "disambiguation" page do not follow any known Wikipedia format.

<dd>This term has come to use due to an as-yet uncatalouged niche in the music scene, both localy and internationally. The term "alternative rock" is currently being used to describe a wide plethora of music styles which show no similarity. Hence it should not be deleted because it is in reality defining a part of a very ambigous style of music.

<li><b>Keep.</b> as per Il magistrat. Strampop is a relatively new term and has only just shown up on the Internet. It's obvious that Google returns no results! The term 'Strampop' is commonly used among us locals, therefore Google can not be used as an accurate measure. Many words in the Maltese Language will not return any results on Google. Would someone like to say that they don't exist? The 'Google Excuse' is no valid reason to delete the Strampop Article. Quite a stupid reason if you ask me. AlanPulis 10:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Strampop is part of the ever expanding Maltese culture, and is steadily becoming ingrained into University life. I have heard people talking about strampop, and others saying they would normally turn to wikipedia for clarification.

<li>Request: Please refrain from twisting words and citing only part of the argument. The origin of any term is to describe an <i>"as-yet un defined niche"</i>. This page is an attempt at cataloguing a neologism which has now gained usage in the community. With regards to the merit of classification, one must accept that genres are very fluid concepts, and that music follows no science. Your failure to see the connection with the afore mentioned bands is not something which I can judge, but nor should it be the basis for <i>the strongest delete of all time, ever</i>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilbosh_c595.html" title="User:Kilbosh">Kilbosh</a> 15:32, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Assuming that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> is an expert in musicology and a good connoisseur of these aforementioned bands I do believe that the article does need revision since it did not explain clearly enough the concept of Strampop still I think it should be kept.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have heard Noise Pollution perform several times and I have to agree that their style is hard to pin down yet i can associate it with the afore-mentioned bands. The beauty of the english language is that it is an ever-changing language and constantly borrows words and phrases from other languages(albeit Maltese not one of them till now) so if one is finding it hard to define this new genre in current english, why not find a word to define it? 212.135.170.82 17:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC) Vazetto</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Yes this term DOES exist and has been used for quite a while. It is part of our maltese culture and I am glad that after god nows how many searches I managed to find it hear. I think that the world should know about this new maltese genre and its attributions. Like it or not this exist amd including it should strengthen and not weaken wikipedia - after all it's the 'from the people to the people' that wikipedia is so known about, and its what makes it so updated and fresh. Off course I agree to some degree of control but in this case this genre does exist and we as 'the people' feel that this should be included, since its part of our culture. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by Richardpull (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichardpull_b13d.html" title="User talk:Richardpull">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Richardpull_eafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Richardpull">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>I voted "KEEP", because the term is frequently used to describe the music of quite a number of bands locally. It is a term which is getting more and more popular. Maltese bands are still new to the internet so for this reason I would retain. Its a valid contribution.

<li><b>How very funny!!..Not!.. The gist of the phrase above is that the term "strampop" is, perhaps, a colloquialism and, as such, one would not expect it to appear on any Maltese site. Google is hardly deific!! The article should not be deleted on the grounds that the term's usage is informal, because even highly respected dictionaries incorporate colloquialisms. Although my earlier comment was my first contribution to wikipedia, it should not be considered less valid. I use wikipedia from time to time in my research but have never contributed an article. I inadvertently came across the strampop article, while taking a look at what information the site had to offer about Malta.

<li>The indentation seems to suggest that the IP is referring to my comment. However, I don't know which "phrase above" is discussed; anyway, I would expect any real-world colloquialism of the late 20th or 21st century to turn up in web pages, and the question of whether or not "strampop" (if the word even exists) is colloquial is beside the point. It's true that dictionaries incorporate colloquialisms; this too is beside the point as en.Wikipedia is not a dictionary (of English, let alone of Maltese). The use of <b>bold</b> doesn't make any argument any more persuasive, and merely makes it seem as if you are shouting.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems as though some people missed the point. Strampop is a neologism. It is a neologism which has been created in Malta a while ago because of the lack of a suitable genre to describe a certain class of music some people continue to call "Alternative Rock". The whole point is not whether this is a neologism but whether it meets wikipedia's "notability standards" which in actual fact have a lot to say about bands and grammy awards but say nothing about the inclusion of Music Genres. You may not want to accept this fact but strampop does exist. And you may not want to accept this fact but I still believe that it is and will be included in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not a sock puppet - Name Charles Cassar, Adress 62, Salina Street, Marsaskala, Malta. Come over for a chat if you want to assess my bodily seperation from the other proponents of the term strampop. I am sure the other proponents will equally glad to treat you to tea and crumpets. You can google my name to confirm my existence, since google seems to be the measure of all things. Also please do respect the definition of 'idiolect' given by wikipedia itself; 'An idiolect (sometimes spelled ideolect) is a variety of a language unique to an individual. It is manifested by patterns of word selection and grammar, or words, phrases or idioms that are unique to that individual'. Any one who suggests that my patterns of word selection are equivalent to Killbosh's or Il magistrat's has serious problems. There is, you will be amazed to discover, more than one individual in these islands who can string together five coherent sentences, and the fact that all the proponents of 'strampop' actually possess this ability does not imply that they are one and the same person. Please bring reasoned arguments against the inclusion of strampop not this sockpuppetry cop-out.

<li><b>Neutral</b>, well the band exists quite notable in Malta. But whether its notable enough to be on wikipedia is questionable. Its through they coined the word strampop, which is apparently quite widely used in the local scene. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 22:04, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is obvious vanity and is well demonstrated when Kilbosh, the lead singer of the band, made this edit:
<blockquote>
<p>The band have the questionable accolade of having been refuted access to the KSU Students' Fest line-up two years running. When questioned on whether they're thinking of turning it into a hat-trick, the members say "Daqs dan", and the remark is ominously followed by slapping noises.</p>

<p>OK. I have ceased all work on this page. I think the comparison would show what markets will be covered by each of the new networks in a single table. In fact, it would be valuable to have a single table for all TV markets that would show all networks and which stations are affliated with them. <a href="../../../m/n/w/User%7EMnw2000_d6d1.html" title="User:Mnw2000">mnw2000</a></p>

<dd>I agree that a unified article with a table of each market down the side and a list of the major TV networks on the top would be a cool article. However I would encourage you to wait on this for a few more months until the majority of stations are announced that will be affiliates of CW and MNTV.

<li><b>Comment</b>I'll gleefully clean it up and add notability references, but I'm afraid I'm new to this, what kind of notability reference should I be looking for to refer to it? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlam_00_1901.html" title="User:Charlam 00">Charlam 00</a> 02:55, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Preferably reliable, independant sources. See <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> for more info.

<li>Thanks Drat, it appears this one doesn't have near the notability Illegal Danish&#160;:Super Snacks does, at least from the research I can do. Though it's funny, I'd have to say someone else will have to defend it's notability <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlam_00_1901.html" title="User:Charlam 00">Charlam 00</a> 04:44, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
