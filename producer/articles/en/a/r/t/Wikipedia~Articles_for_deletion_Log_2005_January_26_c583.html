<dd>I have changed the material and have reorganized it and taken out the material. Would like to change the title again to "Cultural imprinting on politics". Furthermore, I think it deserves a seperate page just to concentrate on the political side of things. This is important for Classical studies! People need this. Is this okay by wikipedian standards. I hope I made enough changes to suit everybody and it looks good. I am not an expert at this--I just know the idea and concept well enough--I don't have access, due to my poverty, of going to a university library. I am doing all this with relative meager resources.

<dd>My philosophical basis for this work: Greeks are realists; we are lovers of nature. As Socrates says in the Republic. We must see things as they really are not as we wish them to be. Greek philosophy is based on seeing nature as is. As much as my detractors hate this material, it must be presented. Communists socialist, liberals et al., want to change reality according to their ideology. Greek thought is different. We accept reality as is and don't attempt to change it. We accept. We don't see reality through ideological lenses of political correctness. There is a big difference here. I am a Greek--- an ancient Greek. I see reality as is not the way I think it ought to be as so many others do. They butcher reality to fit their ideology. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:59, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>All titles are definitions. A dog is a dog. There is no NPOV or POV title of dog. A thing is a thing. Democracy is Democracy. The word encapsulates the character, essense, style, concept of what makes up the idea of democracy and it differentiates itself from other things. Maybe this will help: <a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWHEELER_Principles_of_Definition_dfbc.html" title="User talk:WHEELER/Principles of Definition">User Talk:WHEELER/Principles of Definition</a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:27, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li>"Culture defines politics" is a statement. "Dog" is not a statement. Do you know of any other article titles within Wikipedia that take the form of a sentence? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 16:18, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Dog is a statement. For when someone says the word "Dog" we think, "Okay, four legged animal that barks and waves its tail." The word "Dog" incorporates in a single word that one large sentence. In the German language, Germans also coin words for concepts that us in English have to describe using a full sentence or even a paragraph. The German word Weltshangshuch (or however it is spelled) is an example of this. In English, this is not possible. Ask your self, a title of anything must incorporate the essence of the subject at hand. For right now, until something better has come across, I am stumped for a good title that <i>captures</i> the essence of the subject material. Have some patience.</li>

<p>Wheeler, you and I have different understandings of the word "statement." I will try to clarify. It has nothing to do with concept or idea or representation in general. Nor does the German language having anything to do with it, because we're working here in English. My trouble is with the sentence form and the word "is", which makes your title read as a statement of fact. Do you know of any similar examples within Wikipedia? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 18:02, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, not right off hand. The subject material is about a process. The type of government is determined by the culture. So, the subject (or concept) includes two nouns and a verb.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore on title name. I have no doubts that some doughty old classical professor in some ivy covered dank hall coined a word for this subject and there is a title for it in Latin or Greek.

<p>Is this the proper venue for these thoughts? Also, a minor point, there is no need to exclaim so dramatically, if the new information is credible for the purposes of demonstrating encyclopedicity, I am confident that it will be considered and accounted for by proponents of deletion here. Yes, society is comprised by its constituents, and these constituents combined to form society – many thinkres have written extensively on these areas, but I do not see how these passages (nor the talk page where <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>'s criticism is especially poignant) elucidate encyclopedicity. It is an original research synthesis that draws its own heavily-slanted (towards idealism) conclusions, it is is poorly referenced, and it treats Gramsci (the only person mentioned in the opening paragraph) in a questionable manner which demonstrate a lack of familiarity with his works. I realize people voting keep wish to encourage this editor with his work and reserach, but they are doing so at the expense of the most basic encyclopedic conventions.</p>
<p>Again, there have been many debates and various concepts accorded to such polemics as the article highlights, but it is not the role of the editor to synthesize these together – the role of the editor is to note how others synthesized pertinent thinkers, debates, concepts, etc., in a notable fashion. This, however, is absent from this article. If the editor in question arrives at a notable concept, etc., they need to outline how it has been approached by others and who they included within the realm of such discussions; it is not the editor's role to <i>pick and choose</i> how to phrase such a concept nor most definitely which notable thinkers qualify to appear in it. Lastly, there is the slant of the debate: if this was an encyclopedic concept and if the thinkers appearing in it were not added merely at the discretion/whim of the editor, in a debate involving the intellectual rivalry between epistemological materialism and idealism, the article still needs to promote NPOV, but in fact, it promotes only one side (which I suspect is the view held by the editor): idealism. Similarly, an encyclopedic article that centres on the presentation of epist. materialism should not promote that approach, rather it should highlight the pertinent arguments and counterarguments in an objective, NPOV way. All of these factors are crucial in whether an article is deemed credible and encyclopedic, which this one falls very shot from, I'm afraid.

<dd>What El C wants from me, is a complete and finished article. This is not Wikipedian policy. Hundreds of articles have started out as stubs. Wikipedia is a "collabrative" encyclopeadia. What El C is doing is making me having to have a full fledged article. If I don't have a full fledged article, he deletes. I am not expected to know everything completely but this is the standard El C is putting on me because he doesn't like the subject material. He changes the rules to suit himself. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Paul Shorey relates that these concepts and ideas "are identified with Buckle's name". I quoted from two modern men Spencer and Mill. Read the talk page Mr. El.C, Fr. Malachi Martin knows very well Antonio Gramsci and as a Jesuit priest I trust him better than I do you. Mr. MacAlveny, William Griggs, and Father Malachi Martin know Antonio Gramsci better than I do. What about their credentials? You dismiss my sources? <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do they call –it– <i>culture defines politics</i>? Do they call it <i>cultural political process?</i> I could care less about credentials, I care about –notability– (as such, user:WHEELER, as such). Also, why do you call me Mister? Since when did I reveal to you whether I am male or female? And if I am female, I certainly could not be a Jesuit priest (and inherently not recieve the same level of trust from you – "credentials" which therefore cannot be attained by merit alone; but that is entirely an aside to all this). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a></dd>

<dd>El C is putting standards on me, that are not required of other articles and stubs. So sex acts and how to do sex acts are accepted all the time on Wikipedia, What professional Encyclopeadia ever included that in their topics? Noone. Mr. El C. Irregardless of the psychobable, Fr. Malachi Martin is pretty clear and concise. So is John Dziak. Wikipedia is a <b>collabrative</b> encyclopaedia. It's a stub to grow on.

<dd>I understand that this is your opinion, but it contradicts established policy: a collaboration in the article name space must possess an encyclopedic origin. I place the same standards on your work as I do anyone's. Again, it has nothing to do with it being a stab, it has to do with it being original research (all the other criticisms I mentioned, which I think are important and you should approach constructively rather than defensively, are really an aside to my argument of original reserach).

<li>There is no time-based rule regarding the deletion of articles, and an article doesn't become any more encyclopedic if it happens to stay alive in the Wikipedia for any length of time. The reasons expressed here for its deletion appear to be valid. So instead of complaining about book burning, how about addressing the concerns?

<li>Policy bullshits! I am asking you to show me an active poll where the active wikipedians have voted and they still keep valid a decision that says that original research is prohibited from wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>.

<ul>
<li>I see. We have to find the reasons why the administration cabal insist of keeping such a principal. Is this founding principal by chance? Is it because administration's plans are to create the best encyclopedia in the world and sell it somewhere someday, and they want us to create articles in their encyclopedia for free, but of course without beeing able to tranform their encyclopedia to something else because this is against their business plans? I cant find another reason but maybe you can help me a little to find one, and I am in good faith to believe it. Of course there is also the possibility that this is NOT a founding principal as you claim. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 10:00, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that they could do as you suggest, because of the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> Wikipedia uses (see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>). It is normal for an encyclopedia to contain no original research, as it is a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. There is, however, a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork_%28software%29.html" title="Fork (software)">fork</a> called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">wikinfo</a> that apparently does allow orignal research. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>
<ul>
<li>What is going on here? Original research is always considered to be a reason to delete an article in Vfd! Why nobody proposes to move original research articles to wikinfo, and everybody here proposes for every original research article to be deleted? This is another proof that the deletionist gang band has overcome wikipedia. If the owner of wikipedia is not a cabal member, he must uproot deletionist cancer gang band from wikipedia's heart, and he must do it as soon as possible. <b>And dont mention to me undelete policy bullshits.

<ul>
<li>Aha!..ok then...as I can see wikinfo and secondary_source are sister projects of wikipedia and they welcome original research articles. Thats good! So I propose as a policy, all proposed for deletion original research articles to be moved there insteed of deleted. Then if voted for undeletion, they should return back to wikipedia. And of course if somenoe asks wikipedia about a deleted original research article, wikipedia should point to its sister projects with a warning that this was an ostracized article. If you want to convince me that you are not a deletionist gang band that want to overcome wikipedia and turn a supposed edited by anyone encyclopedia to an encyclopedia that supports your deletionist gang band POV, you HAVE to support as a policy what I am proposing you. If you dont, this proves that you are a deletionist gang band, and every rational human person can understand this. I am not supporting the average rule article right now, I am supporting all the past articles you have already deleted, and the future you are going to. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 11:49, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>And what about secondary_source? I consider your answer as an acceptance that you are a deletionist gang band that wants to turn wikipedia to an encyclopedia that , although supposed to be edited by anyone and support NPOV, contains articles that are compatible only with the POV of your deletionist gang band.

I've transwikied one article there myself and intend to do more, but it's far better if the author does it, and the copying is automated and very easy provided you do it before they are deleted here. So I hope to see you and your theories there. But be aware that most of the policies of Wikinfo are based on Wikipedia, and your behaviour here would not go down well there either. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 12:24, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>And I am saying to you that, for now on, I am going to cast peculiar votes in all proposed for deletion articles. It is finnaly clear to me that your Vfd policy is against NPOV, and as long as I am a strong advocate of NPOV I want to destroy anything that is against it. Be prepared, my peculiar votes are going to flood your POV Vfd policy and procedure, until an administrator bans me. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 12:36, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that nobody of them have ever asked the article to be deleted, means that <b>those 10 persons at least have cast a keep or abstain vote</b>. Not to mention also the other people in this 6 month period who read the article and did not propose it for deletion. All those people obviously are a keep or abstain vote for the article.

<li>What you mean your rules? You mean the rules that your deletionist gang band have created and imposed to all the others? Where is the poll that shows that current deletion policy is voted by all active wikipedia voters, and also all active wikipedia voters still keep their vote alive in your current deletion policy? You cannot point to that poll, simply because deletion policy has been created by 10-20 people and an administrator cabal, in order to destroy the work of the others, any work that is against gang band's belief or against its plans. This is clear to me, and I am not going to bother with your gang band anymore. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 10:11, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I was personally intending to nominate Average rule for deletion myself—only after I had gotten replies to a query I sent to some of the other editors of the article, precisely because I was interested in the fact that so many people had looked at it over a period of six months without themselves nominating it. I asked:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm thinking of nominating Average rule for deletion on the grounds that it is a neologism and original research. This article has existed since August 2004 without anyone questioning it or proposing it for deletion. Do you think it's legitimate? Do you know of any reasons I shouldn't nominate it for deletion?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So far I've gotten <s>two</s> three replies.
<dl>
<dd>Michael Hardy replied: "I don't know much about politicial philosophy, but my gut reaction is to suspect you're right." Stevietheman replied "Well, I didn't know whether or not it was legitimate, but I did some work at some point to clean it up. I think the original author of this article also created other works and contributions to articles I've been unsure of (like to Majoritarianism). I don't see why you shouldn't submit Average rule for deletion."</dd>
<dd>Jmartinezot says "I edited that article just to remove a blank before a comma, so I will agree with the final decision about deletion or not."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Generally, the other editors were wikifying, correcting text, editing for clarity. I don't think any of them were making content judgements. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My edits were only to clean up the article, and do in no way whatsoever endorse the content as encyclopedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism, original research, no citations presented. The strongest argument is made in the article itself: "Average rule has never been tried as a political regime in human history, but also not even a single community has ever tried to implement it." The kindest interpretation I can make of Iasson's conduct is that he has constructed some novel and complex systems for group decision-making, which may or may not have real theoretical merit as a way of extracting a judgement from a group of people, but which are too utterly impractical to merit serious consideration... and that he was hoping that he could convince Wikipedia to adopt these methods. This material could go on Iasson's user page—assuming, as I do, that he is the author—but it is not suitable for the main encyclopedia namespace. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Sirs,</p>
<p>Korea is currently partitioned into two nations: both republics.</p>
<p>HIH the Crown Prince Yi Seok is indeed heir to the throne, and there is extensive documentation to that IN KOREAN. However he is obviously an ordinary citizen, with no more or less rights than any other citizen of the Republic of Korea, although a most interesting past and a desire to uphold traditions, and maintain an interest in Korean history: much as any person of age would want to do in a country which has had supreme difficulties in the 20th century.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In principle, I would think this person is marginally notable -- but then I find people with "noble" lineages living in the lost grandeur of their families to be rather fascinating, if somewhat pathetic. If you read the WSJ and Washington Times articles about this man, his career as lounge singer, Beverly Hills pool-man, California liquor store owner, and now pretender to the Korean throne is interesting, to say the least. However, I find that such articles are very hard to keep NPOV, since the forces driving them towards being POV poppycock are often stronger and more single-minded than the forces trying to keep them neutral and accurate. My effort to clean this up and remove the POV nonsense has already been reverted once by the anon original author. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:45, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is a false characterisation based upon a false assertion. "HIH" <i>is not</i> a <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title.html" title="Title">title</a>. It is a <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_%28manner_of_address%29.html" title="Style (manner of address)">style</a>. Wikipedia has <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">a clear policy on royal styles &amp; titles</a>, and it is <i>not</i> one of "removing royal titles" as you assert it to be. It is one of removing the styles and retaining the titles. As such, the Wikipedia article name would be Yi Seok, Crown Prince of Korea. <i>However</i>, <a href="../../../y/i/_/Yi_Seok_7e0f.html" title="Yi Seok">Yi Seok</a> <i>does not actually have</i> the title "Crown Prince", given that neither North Korea nor South Korea are actually monarchies any more.

All the complicated "His Royal Highness" type of titles would be included in the first paragraph of the article, while a relatively simple title (the most common form?) is used as the article title. Maybe something similar for this article, such as Yi Seok, Crown Prince would be better? --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:11, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem is that since 1947, when all of these titles were legally abolished, there is no legal forum in which disputes about them can be resolved. The only court in which the claims can be argued is the court of public opinion. Yi Seok claims to be the "Crown Prince", but that claim is not accepted even within the dynastic family. In Korean royalty, titles passed down to the male heirs, but the seniority of a son's mother amongst the wife and concubines of the King determined succession order. Yi Seok's grandmother was low in this ranking order, and even though his father was older, an uncle became the "Crown Prince/Head of the Royal House", and now his son claims that title. Yi Seok's claims are based on the fact that his cousin was born in Japan with a Japanese princess as his mother, and many Koreans are not prepared to consider someone with a Japanese passport, who lives in Tokyo, to be head of the royal house. Wikipedia should not go into the business of validating claims of nobility. We have at least one other case that I know of where Wikipedia articles have been written by claimants to noble titles as a way of winning in the court of public opinion. I don't think we should cooperate with this. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:58, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Based on the evidence presented so far, I am inclined to vote weak delete. I am conflicted, however. He is probably more notable than many of the subjects of articles nominated to this page. The current article is reasonably neutral. The article is about the right size so I would not call it a stub. The redirect to the neutral article title was definitely the right choice. The reason I still vote for a weak delete is that I've come to believe that we should raise the bar for the inclusion of biographies of living persons. The difficulties in maintaining this page and preserving it from bias outweigh the small value that I see in the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 21:27, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

In the end, I vote to delete the redirects and the <a href="../../../y/i/_/Yi_Seok_7e0f.html" title="Yi Seok">Yi Seok</a> article, even though I have been trying to clean up the latter. I think the case for notability is borderline but, as I mentioned above, the article is probably going to end up being an edit see-saw as Yi Seok partisans try to turn it into a puffy press release. This is happening even with the VfD spotlight still on the article. He isn't notable enough for it to be worth the hassle of keeping the article neutral and encyclopedic (or, for that matter, written in grammatical English.) --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:14, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is simply no reason not to have quality information about this topic. It does not suit my personal POV to have this article, but nevertheless I support its existence for inclusionist reasons. It makes no sense that we have detailed articles on every Pokemon and Digimon character, associated video game and TV show, but we can't have detailed Ashlee articles. What's the problem here? Nominate an article on a Pokemon character and the people who work on those articles will furiously campaign for it to be kept—and I would too, of course. But nominate an Ashlee article, and who's going to campaign? It's really just me who works on them. Now, surely we should vote based on general principles, not based on whether a topic is popular or not among present-day Wikipedians. There is a problem when information is being removed from Wikipedia for such a reason. A very big problem, I'd say. Articles far less notable than this would be kept by nearly unanimous votes. So why can't we be consistent? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 17:40, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You may not have noticed but both 23skidoo and myself voted <i>merge</i>, not <i>delete</i>. Yes, this incident is slightly noteworthy, but it's really just a footnote in the story of Ashlee Simpson. You're right, it makes no sense that we have detailed articles on every Pokemon, but I'm not about to take it upon myself to merge every single one into a larger Pokemon article or two, though I would fully support such an action. My opposition to this as a separate artcile is not because Ashlee Simpson isn't currently popular enough, it's more because she's <i>too</i> popular right now, and very minor incidents like this are blown out of proportion and made into full scandals. I think it should be covered more as what it is, not "Acid-refluxgate" but as a small technical problem that occurred on a TV show. This will soon be forgotten, but Wikipedia will keep a record of it for posterity, where it belongs: in the Ashlee Simpson article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:26, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In October 2004, at the start of pop singer Ashlee Simpsons's second musical performance, an error involving pre-recorded backing tracks caused the singer to walk off the stage. The network attempted to hide the flub by remixing the show's sound for the West coast audience making the pre-recorded track inaudible, which only confused West Coast viewers by making it appear as if Simpson walked off stage for no reason.</dd>

<dd>The foibles of live television were exposed in October 2004 when at the start of singer Ashlee Simpson's second musical performance of the show, a pre-recorded backing track for the wrong song was accidentally played. Simpson's father (her manager) had decided to use a vocal guide track because her voice had been weak in rehearsal. During the performance the vocal track was shut off but the musical track continued and Simpson walked off the stage. She subsequently apologized for the error during the show's closing—the incident served to highlight the always precarious nature of live television, as noted by the night's host, Jude Law. It appeared viewers that Simpson had been lip synching and the incident received wide-spread coverage in the news. The following week the incident was the subject of several skits.</dd>

<dd>Coincidentally, a team of reporters from the CBS news program 60 Minutes led by Lesley Stahl had been taping and interviewing during the production cycle, and recorded both the rehearsals and the immediate reactions by Lorne Michaels and others. Michaels said immediately afterwords that he had never been asked about using a vocal track, and would not have allowed it. However, since then the production practices of SNL have been scrutinized by reporters and Michaels has admitted that backing tracks are sometimes used. The 60 Minutes report also revealed the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, the involvement of the guest hosts in developing and choosing their skits, and the rule that all skit dialog is performed as-written, with no improvisation allowed on camera.</dd>

<p>Albeit the last paragraph is mostly about 60 minutes it highlights the fact as to how this incident has grown into an edit war in the SNL article.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a>]'s claims, I am not trying to keep either Simpson or SNL from "looking bad", I couldn't care much less. Willmcw has subsequently added it back to the SNL article and tightened it up nicely, it looks much better now HOWEVER it will only be re-edited by <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> at the earliest opportunity and we'll be back where we were.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is the question of whether the details of this incident belong in the SNL article or in the Ashlee Simpson article. I think a fair compromise that can cut out a lot of unnecessary detail in both articles is to keep this one and we wiki-link to this article from both. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_schiller_6670.html" title="User:Jeff schiller">Jeff schiller</a> 19:55, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That isn't a reasonable "compromise". A lot of people don't want excruciatingly long Ashlee Simpson-related articles popping up like weeds all over the damn Wikipedia. I can see why Willmcw didn't want the article on SNL to be swallowed by Ashlee Simpson, but the compromise would have been to keep the description of the incident short and refer people to the Ashlee Simpson article for the boring (I mean, uh, fascinating) details. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:58, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

My preference is: merge into <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> as a section, and add a link from the Saturday Night Live article to that section. 1) The <i>information</i> in these detailed and well-written paragraphs should be kept because it seems to be of high quality. It's not of much importance where. 2) I would have voted against a <i>stub</i> on this topic, but there is now enough information to make it acceptable as article. 3) Nobody is going to find it by typing in the title; it will be found by search or by following a link. Therefore <i>if</i> the content is merged, <i>then</i> the article should be deleted, as I don't think it's of any use as a redirect. 4) The event is of far more significance in relation to the career of Ashlee Simpson than to the history of <i>Saturday Night Live.</i> (My apologies to the sysop who has to decide how this vote should be counted.

<li>Chuq said he hadn't seen or heard of the show. What's that got to do with whether it aired or not? Personally, I haven't seen or heard of it either, and I'd hazard a guess that it aired on cable television, to which subscriptions are a lot less common in Australia than the U.S. Most successful cable shows eventually make it to free-to-air (and thus, a wider audience) but <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i> hasn't done that yet. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 04:02, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

That in itself means it deserves its own article. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrevaner_7815.html" title="User:Crevaner">Crevaner</a> 17:43, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Slightly off-topic but I felt like looking it up. As of late January 2005, what is Ashlee Simpson best known for? To find out, I did a search on the New York Times for the exact phrase "Ashlee Simpson" and got about twenty hits (i.e. the New York Times has mentioned her name about twenty times in the years 2000 through the present." In reverse chronological order, and omitting some utterly irrelevant ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>An article about another topic says "'It's possible," Juror No. 8 insists.' Sure. And maybe Ashlee Simpson will develop some talent this week."</li>
<li>One is an article about voice-training software that ends with the remark "Of course, being on key is not a prerequisite for fame. Just ask Ashlee Simpson."</li>
<li>An end-of-2004 overview says "ASHLEE SIMPSON, just a tip:/Singing's more than moving lips,/And an artist understands/It's bad form to blame the band."</li>
<li>A long piece begins "ASHLEE SIMPSON got caught with her microphone down on 'Saturday Night Live' in October, and five weeks later, on Dec. 5, 'Good Morning America,' which had been especially gleeful in its post-mortem of the debacle, presented Lindsay Lohan in a 'live singing debut'-- lip-syncing just like Ms. Simpson." The article goes on to argue that lip-syncing goes back to 1929, there's nothing wrong with it, it's not essentially different from a singer using a microphone in the first place.</li>
<li>A December 26th piece, "TV's Best Live Moments" of 2004 (Janet Jackson, etc.) comments that "Before Ashlee Simpson blamed the band, and the norms of contemporary live performance, she tried to save her "Saturday Night Live" blunder with a humble-pie two-step and sort of did: the pure panic in that dance is something modern choreographers should study."</li>
<li>An article, and an earlier event calendar, list "Destiny's Child, Gwen Stefani, Good Charlotte, Kelly Clarkson and Ashlee Simpson" as performers at a radio station WHTZ-FM (Z100) concert</li>
<li>An article on tofu at a Japanese pub says "Yuba arguably has more character than plain tofu, which is like saying that Britney Spears lip-synchs less transparently than Ashlee Simpson."</li>
<li>A movie is mentioned with the words "Her third album, 1973's "Hard to Stop," is reissued this week: it had no breakout hits, but give her a break -- it was released when she was 20 years old, the same age Ashlee Simpson is today"</li>
<li>A letter to the editor says "I'm sure Ashlee Simpson is a talented young woman, but the real talent behind her success lies with the writers, musicians, engineers and producers who have crafted enjoyable pop tunes for her to dance to and occasionally sing along with. My only problem with this situation is that the Ashlees of the industry are sold to the public as artists."</li>
<li>An article on "Rockism" opens "BAD news travels fast, and an embarrassing video travels even faster. By last Sunday morning, one of the Internet's most popular downloads was the hours-old 60-second .wmv file of Ashlee Simpson on 'Saturday Night Live.' As she and her band stood onstage, her own prerecorded vocals -- from the wrong song -- came blaring through the speakers, and it was too late to start mouthing the words. So she performed a now-infamous little jig, then skulked offstage, while the band (were a few members smirking?) played on."</li>
<li>"Ailing Singer Needed Lip-Sync, Father Says"</li>
<li>"Saturday Night Slip-Up"</li>
<li>"A Girl Singing Group Aims for the Stars" "The girls recorded two songs for a special Christmas CD that will be released next month at Wal-Mart and FYE stores and on which they share billing with Raven and Ashlee Simpson."</li>
<li>"Who Wants to Be a New Simpson?" "JOE SIMPSON is suffering from a peculiar strain of empty-nest syndrome. After years of struggle, Mr. Simpson, a formerly penniless Baptist minister who these days wears a chunky diamond stud in his left ear, has guided his two daughters, Jessica and Ashlee, to success as MTV reality-show stars and platinum-selling pop singers. But now, just as he's established himself as a pop-culture Midas, Mr. Simpson is fresh out of children...."</li>
<li>A review of the HP version of the Apple iPod says "Hewlett-Packard has also created stickers called HP Printable Tattoos that can be affixed to the iPod to personalize and protect the player's surface....But never fear: if you suddenly tire of that Ashlee Simpson wraparound, it comes off."</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "Dropping into second place, as it had when "Now" was issued at the start of August, was Ashlee Simpson's "Autobiography," which retook first place two weeks ago."</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "For three weeks Ashlee Simpson's "Autobiography" (Geffen), below, and Volume 16 of the pop compilation series "Now That's What I Call Music!" (Universal/EMI/Sony Music/Zomba) have occupied the top two slots"</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "POP CHARTS: ASHLEE ON TOP -- Sales of Ashlee Simpson's debut album "Autobiography" (Geffen) rose last week after the season finale of her reality television series, "The Ashlee Simpson Show" on MTV, pushing the album back to the No. 1 slot on Billboard's pop charts"</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "Ashlee Simpson's run atop the Billboard 200 chart of best-selling albums ended after a week when her debut, "Autobiography," with sales of 270,000 copies, slipped to second place behind the 16th installment of the compilation series "Now That's What I Call Music!," left."</li>
<li>"Dave Chapelle, Paris Hilton, Lenny Kravitz, Ludacris, LL Cool J, Jon Stewart, Ashlee Simpson and Sean Combs have joined the lineup of celebrities who are to appear when the MTV 2004 Video Music Awards are broadcast on Aug. 29 ..."</li>
<li>LONG INTERVIEW: "Ashlee Simpson: Platinum Brunette." It opens "HOW quickly they grow up. Ashlee Simpson was an ingenue three weeks ago; now she's a superstar. A million copies of 'Autobiography,' her charming debut album, have been shipped since its release on July 20. Her reality series on MTV, "The Ashlee Simpson Show," has become a 3.4 million-viewer-a-week hit.... VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN -- You just shipped a million albums. How do you feel? ASHLEE SIMPSON -- Amazing. Oh my gosh. I'm freaking out. Everything is so exciting. Oh it's so cool. It's got the album cover on it and it says one million! I was like, this is insane. When I saw it, I started crying. Isn't that insane? Just to have an album in stores. It's the coolest."</li>
<li>Arts briefing: "SISTER ACT -- Ashlee Simpson, the kid sister of Jessica Simpson, is standing tall atop the Billboard Top 200 chart today."</li>
<li>Article on Simpson: "Raunchy or Sweet Reflections Of Adolescent Self-Esteem" "There is some actual talent as well as show-business ambition in the Simpson family. Ashlee Simpson, 19, is the younger sister of the famously ditsy pop singer Jessica Simpson, and she has her own television acting career (as a character in 'Seventh Heaven') as well as her own MTV reality show, 'The Ashlee Simpson Show,' which followed the making of her debut album, 'Autobiography' With songs by Ms. Simpson and some very experienced collaborators, the album is a thoroughly calculated package..."</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, these are in reverse chronological order. In my judgement, and by my count, as of late January 2005, Ashlee Simpson is about <i>equally</i> well known as a highly successful pop wunderkind with, it is acknowledged, "some actual talent as well as show-business ambition," and as the subject of the embarrassing incident on SNL. But notice that <i>after</i> the SNL incident, <i>all</i> references seem to treat her as a joke. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:32, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Man, that's a lot of research you did. Why don't you see what you can contribute to some of the articles?

<dd>I probably will, but I'm certainly not going to rush into it. So much of what would need to be said would involve reporting contemporary value judgements in an NPOV way. How much of the animus against her following the SNL incident was really related to lip-syncing, and how much was that this nineteen-year-old revealed herself to be "not a trooper," i.e. an inexperienced performer who was not able to handle a bad situation gracefully? Other questions that puzzle me: has she been pushed to sing too many public performances, with inadequate voice training, to the detriment of her vocal health? The whole story of the SNL incident at least raises this question. I haven't yet found any handy on-line video of her Orange Bowl performance, but if she sang far worse in public than in recordings, this suggests either lack of attention to her vocal health, or flattering studio enhancement of her recorded performances. The latter wouldn't bother me at all; nobody complains that <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> (or <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whispering_Jack_Smith_73f2.html" title="Whispering Jack Smith">Whispering Jack Smith</a>!) couldn't project like an opera singer and needed to use a mike. The former would be disturbing. Speaking of wunderkinds suddenly projected into the spotlight whose welfare I wonder about... how's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Church_4c54.html" title="Charlotte Church">Charlotte Church</a> doing these days? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:49, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You must certainly NOT put your material into the existing A.S. articles. It is a well-established Wikipedia policy that each bit of information about A.S. goes into a separate article.

<dd>Or, you could say, "This article is already long enough for the subject. Lets find something to remove or condense so there is room for this new information". What a concept! You seem to think that A.S. is a great artist; since she is only 20 or so, she has many years of her career ahead of her. What are you planning -- that by the time she is 40, Wikipedia should have a few hundred articles on Ashlee Simpson? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:41, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. New groups can be notable from scratch, of course, provided that at least one of the members is previously notable.

<li>The Band contains James Collard who has been in many successful bands before and is known around Stockport for his excellent bass playing skills.

<li>Has he indeed? Well, firstly, that wasn't mentioned when I voted delete, and secondly - prove it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Attempt to use Wikipedia as a blog site, possibly innocently, by an IP with no previous contributions. Yes, there's a little that could be merged if anyone cares to take the trouble, but IMO it's not sufficient reason for a redirect otherwise.

"Waiting", a slower song, was also released as a single but was less successful than "Warning" and "Minority". "Macy's Day Parade" is another slower song from the album." That's it. Of course, that's unrecognizably rewritten, uses Green Day- Warning for a few points of (public domain) information alone, and integrates <i>additional</i> information (that "Minority" was also a single).

<li>Erik seems a nice enough young singer, but his article's indication that he is "planning an audition for American Idol" and would appreciate a talent agency getting in touch with him indicate to me that he has not yet achieved sufficient prominence to warrant an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 20:25, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would say that Erik is rather enough an achievement, because it says in the article that Erik has worked with Elias Coblentz, of whom is a title of Wikipedia and that could be a reasonable enough excuse. 12.215.116.201 (from talk page. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 20:33, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC))

<li>I don't understand your comment -- Elias Coblentz does not have an article here (though an article was written about him and deleted several months ago -- apparently Elias is an 18 year old musician who at least one person believes talented -- the article was fairly glowing about his musical achievement -- but there are only 11 google hits on his name, and his band, "Butt Love Titties", is not familiar to any musician I am acquainted with).

<p>Based on the disconnect between the article <i>title</i> and its <i>content</i>, this appears to be a disingenuous attempt to sneak link-spam into Wikipedia. I don't know enuf about the subject to know what companies in Ukraine might be notable enuf for articles (and a google search of Wikipedia didn't uncover any existing articles), but it doesn't seem to be this one, with only 400 hits. Also, given that it was created by User:ApriorIT, it is probably self-promotion.

<li>Reluctant <b>delete</b>. It's not possible to have articles for every murder victim in the US; they'd outnumber existing pages. If anything permanent was changed in the LAPD or in Westwood as a result of her death, perhaps <b>merge</b> relevent information into the relevent articles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:57, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I concur with 23skidoo. I was the person who originally added the mention of Karen Toshima's murder to the Westwood article, but I think she is worth mentioning in Wikipedia only insofar as her death is relevant to the history of Westwood as a whole. I didn't add that link or that page and I don't know who did. While her death is tragic, I concur with JoaoRicardo that Wikipedia is not a memorial. There are simply too many people in the world (and too many tragic deaths in Los Angeles) for Wikipedia to have a full article on each and every one; that's what the Web as a whole, blogs, the Internet Archive, and Google are for.</li>
