<b>Delete</b> As far as I can tell, this article describes original research by Bowers that has never appeared in print. I do think that this is worthwhile mathematical research performed by trained mathematicians, but I don't see that it fits the mission and policies of Wikipedia. Bowers' web page is an appropriate place to share this research with the world (and by setting up their own installation of mediawiki, the authors could transfer these page to UniformPolytopeWiki without much difficulty).</p>
<p>Here is my assessment of the literature. I was unable to find Bowers' name on mathscinet. I was able to find some papers by Norman in the 1960s on uniform polytopes. There is a vague promise at <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html" class="external free" title="http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html" rel="nofollow">http://hometown.aol.com/polycell/uniform.html</a> that a book by Norman on uniform polytopes will be published by Cambridge press, but Google returns no other information on the book. There is no indication that the terminology here will appear in the book. That page claims it is currently “<i>the only place in the world where you can find this information!</i>” which supports the claim that the work on uniform polytope classification falls into the wikipedia original research category.</p>

<li><b>Strong oppose</b> (I de-prodded and I'm not Bowers). First a little history about this article. As part of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyhedron.html" title="Polyhedron">Polyhedron</a> pages we developed a set of templates to allow the same information to be repeated in various pages to eliminate mistakes with the many technical data on the polyhedra. For these templates we needed a short key to represent each of the polyhedra. Originally I devised my own system but another user <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomruen_a194.html" title="User:Tomruen">User:Tomruen</a> suggested that we use Bowers acronyms instead, which were a considerably more established system. So the templates were created and it seem natural to include the Bowers names in the various templates, for a while there was a lot of red links until I finally got round to creating the page. The names themselves probably have more relavance to 4D polyhedra or polyclora. Bowers has worked with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Polychora_Project_a915.html" title="Uniform Polychora Project">Uniform Polychora Project</a> which also included <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Johnson_d5c1.html" title="Norman Johnson">Norman Johnson</a> perhaphs the most significant figure in recient work on polyhedra. Bowers himself has discovered most of the know Uniform Polychora. His names offer significant advantages over long form names which become very cumbersome when 4D polytopes are considered. As an example of the spread of these names a couple of new Polychora have been discovered by <a href="http://www.geocities.com/stonemason89/scaliform.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/stonemason89/scaliform.html" rel="nofollow">Mason Green</a> and he has used Bowers system for his names. In effect Bowers names are becoming the defacto standard for 4D uniform polytopes, also as discoverer of the polytopes I guess Bowers gets the right to name them. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 18:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>???? I'm not sure what four-dimensional polychora have to do with anything. The question is: do you have some good, verifiable source citations meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that shows that <i>sirco,</i> <i>girco,</i> and <i>snic</i> are in reasonably widespread current use today? Do current geometry textbooks that discuss the uniform polyhedra use them now? Why does Google Books, which at the moment is heavily weighted toward recent books, have 39 hits on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snub+cube%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snub+cube%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"snub cube" polyhedra</a>, while a search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snic%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22snic%22+polyhedra&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"snic" polyhedra</a> returns only the query "Did you mean: 'sonic' polyhedra?" The question that needs to be answered is not whether Bowers is a notable mathematician, nor whether Bowers <i>deserves</i> to have his nicknames accepted, nor whether they are good nicknames, nor whether they are likely to be accepted in the future: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<li>I don't know what to make of this debate. The acronyms are ACTIVELY used verbally as much as in writing by members of a (nonpublic access) polyhedron email list started by Magnus Wenninger to promote collaboration in polytope research.</li>
<li>Bowers "invented" the names for the purpose of faster communication and a critical mass of active researchers, amateur and professional have supported the clarity of the notation. Certainly it would be good for a print published source for these abbreviations, and it ought not to be the place of Wikipedia to defend or promote these names any more than any others.</li>
<li>Myself I find them a little cryptic, and for polyhedra, prefer a numeric <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertex_configuration.html" title="Vertex configuration">vertex configuration</a>, and I wrote up an article on this notation, taken from a singular book "Geometric Foundations of Nature". It could be equally questionable to defend any specific notation over any other.</li>
<li>Others support the <b>Wythoff symbol</b> which demonstrates the symmetry and truncation form of a polyhedron. They're ALL helpful in different contexts.</li>
<li>For ME, my purpose is to be HELPFUL and do my best to cross-reference names, notations, indices, so these beautiful shapes can be appreciated (As I tried to do in the table <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_uniform_polyhedra.html" title="List of uniform polyhedra">list of uniform polyhedra</a>.) Someone like Bowers, who has spend YEARS of his life carefully documenting these uniform polytopes, deserves recognition, even if a book is never published.</li>

<dd>But consider for an instance, subject to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, that the whole world of polyhedra is not one where a lot of traditional publication goes on. People write software to visulise the polyhedra, distrubute the code and maybe write a manual, people write copious webpages on the subject, Hart mentioned in citations for one. People exhibit the polyhedra at various colaqula. They make a lot of discoveries and the word gets out. Probably the most extensivce bibliography is at <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/references.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/references.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> much of the published work is old, or rehashing old material. Anyway Bowers does have one publication is a so called relaible source: <a href="http://www.sckans.edu/~bridges/2000%20Bridges%20Report.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sckans.edu/~bridges/2000%20Bridges%20Report.htm" rel="nofollow">Bridges Conference: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music, and Science</a> Bowers presents a paper.

<dd>I believe the criteria that many would apply to these articles is that of mathematics, where publication ususally <i>does</i> occur. This criteria improves wikipedia's quality, especially in mathematics. The charter of wikipedia does not include publicizing new research. I cannot see why some believe that wikipedia is the correct forum to share the research on polytopes, rather than an independent wiki or a journal. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 15:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criterion <b>I</b> apply is the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. If "the whole world of polyhedra is not one where a lot of traditional publication goes on" than I'm sorry, but it is not a world whose knowledge is ready to go into Wikipedia. It is not infrequently argued that a certain article should not be subject to the verifiability policy because it is a subject area about which little has been published, but I see nothing in the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy that makes exceptions for such topic areas. If I'm wrong, please point me to the place that says this.</dd>
