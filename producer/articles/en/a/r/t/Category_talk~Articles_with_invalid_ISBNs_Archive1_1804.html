The ISBN originally given in WP was 91-571-3151-2, which is invalid. It seems most likely to be a copying error, rather than published invalid. (Can't be sure without seeing a physical copy of the book). I updated the WP article with the correct ISBN, 0-915713-15-2.</p>

Haven't seen a physical copy of this book. But at least one edition must have been published invalid because it was entered that way in the Library of Congress. It now gives me great ironic pleasure to show this link to an online bookstore, where both editions (Tokyo and New York) are shown in the same listing, one with the bad ISBN and one with the good! <a href="http://www.campusi.com/author_Takeo,_Arishima.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campusi.com/author_Takeo,_Arishima.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Rose: A color of darkness, by <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amon_Liner_ae4d.html" title="Amon Liner">Amon Liner</a>. Published with the invalid <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-932112-09-2</a> printed in the book.

<p>A Google search for the phrase 'Cancelled ISBN' also comes up with this hit: <a href="http://ead.nb.admin.ch/web/swissinfodesk/cult-en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ead.nb.admin.ch/web/swissinfodesk/cult-en.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which cites the book Andrew Wilton, 'Journey through the Alps', with 'cancelled ISBN' 3856347756. This book is found in the LOC but with no ISBN listed.</p>
<p>I had previously surmised that the Library of Congress was actually attempting to track good and bad ISBNs for the same book, using the terminology 'cancelled ISBN', but the records I have kept are not good enough to document any actual cases. Certainly the LOC do not seem to filter out bad ISBNs when you search, and in some cases they still deliver book records under their original bad ISBN, which is something that booksinprint.com and abebooks.com admirably refuse to do. Those libraries and services that overtly flag bad ISBNs are truly the most customer-friendly long-term, because not knowing you have a bad ISBN is just storing up trouble for the future. Unfortunately worldcat.org won't flag a bad ISBN and just tells you the book is not found. You still need to use isbn.org/converterpub.asp in case of doubt. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC) (Transferred from my talk page <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 12:53 <a href="../../../1/4/_/14_December_2637.html" title="14 December">14 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).)</p>

<dd>I find nothing "admirable" about refusing to return information for an invalid ISBN. When a publisher prints an invalid ISBN they are doing an inadvertent disservice, but for a library to refuse to look up based on known information is to be deliberately unreasonable -- hardly customer-friendly. An invalid number is nearly as likely to be unique as a valid number, and thus quite unlikely to return a false positive. I agree that flagging them is the right thing to do -- and understand that some databases want to avoid storing invalid numbers at any cost. However, by storing them and flagging them as invalid they meet the needs of both the librarian and the customer. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 00:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Note: I'm taking this to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Talk%7EInternational_Standard_Book_Number_31b8.html#Testing_of_invalid_ISBNs_within_the_publishing_industry" title="Talk:International Standard Book Number">Talk:International Standard Book Number#Testing of invalid ISBNs within the publishing industry</a>. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 00:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Unfortunatly, its wrong. Marked by a bot as wrong, and any tools I've tried online say the checkdigit is wrong (and should be 1 if anything) but 81-7738-000-1 is a different book. (see <a href="http://worldcat.org/oclc/46779269" class="external text" title="http://worldcat.org/oclc/46779269" rel="nofollow">this in worldcat</a>) Everywhere I've found specifies this broken ISBN.

<p>81-7738-009-3 perhaps. Or maybe they just increment the last digit! (<a href="https://www.vedamsbooks.com/tigerbks.htm" class="external text" title="https://www.vedamsbooks.com/tigerbks.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> lists both the numbers/books you give.) Again, the only way of fully resolving is to contact the publisher or ISBN agency. A vexed question indeed. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 10:52 <a href="../../../1/3/_/13_September_27bc.html" title="13 September">13 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</p>

<dd>I searched for this in www.worldcat.org and found it right away! (pure luck). That entry shows an ISBN that's different in one digit, 0-510-26250-3. I'd suggest you update your article based on the Worldcat information. When updating, it is good to include the publisher (Benn) in the citation. Also in the case of books that might be hard to find like this one, it would be helpful to our readers if you include the actual first names of the authors. That would aid in any future library searching. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've just discovered this category. Invalid ISBNs are completely useless, so I'm puzzled as to why they are not simply deleted, as per any other incorrect information in Wikipedia. Why not have other categories of "articles with mistakes in them"? Or am I missing something? Otherwise I am minded to go through Wikipedia deleting all the wrong ISBNs, and see what happens. After all, there are plenty of other references to books without any mention of an ISBN.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira</a> 17:45, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>My sense is that this is a listing of entries that are mostly correct, but there is a problem with the ISBN as displayed (often a typo). Rather than delete all information pertaining to the reference, the information is kept in hopes that folks that care about the article with the error will fix it. Perhaps the best solution when an ISBN cannot be clarified/corrected is to delete the ISBN, leaving the other information that points to the reference. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 18:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>An editor who sees an invalid ISBN and is patient will succeed in replacing it with a good ISBN more than 90% of the time. In those cases where the book was either (a) published with an invalid number, or (b) so obscure that you can't find a good ISBN elsewhere, you can delete the ISBN and, provided a library holds the book, replace the ISBN with an <a href="../../../o/c/l/OCLC_c9d6.html" title="OCLC">OCLC</a> number. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">User:JesseW</a> has created a convenient <a href="../../../o/c/l/Template%7EOCLC_c116.html" title="Template:OCLC">Template:OCLC</a> for adding these numbers. If all else fails, I believe that deleting the bad ISBN completely is the right thing to do. I don't agree with <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira's</a> suggestion of just removing the bad ISBNs without fixing them, because that loses information, and it could cause more hostility from the editor who added the reference in the first place. People are receptive when you fix their ISBNs who might not like it if you just delete them. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:48, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You would be suprised how much I got shouted at in the early days for labelling them as invalid! There are cases when the book can be found with the invalid ISBN, and sometimes if page numbers (or the exact edition) are important a mis-typed ISBN will enable you to find the right one - usually a missing digit, or transposed digits. As Ed says, if you can't find a valid one at all, then probably worht deleting with a note. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 22:34 <a href="../../../1/4/_/14_December_2637.html" title="14 December">14 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</dd>

<p>Fair enough. I'll happily fix a few when I get some time, but that won't be soon. Of course in a few days' time they'll all be invalid – sort of.

<dd>That's why I invented {{<a href="../../../a/u/t/Template%7EAuto_isbn_2608.html" title="Template:Auto isbn">Template:auto isbn</a>}}.

<li>When an ISBN shows up invalid, we only know that an error happened; we don't know which error. More than 90% of the time a correct ISBN for the given book exists somewhere in the world, but finding it takes work. So when the ISBN-13 standard arrives, it will never be safe to merely convert invalid ISBN-10s to ISBN-13s by formula. Rich's records of the bad ISBNs will still be pointing to problems that can only be fixed by research, done by our crack team of 'ISBN-fixers' or ideally by the editor who created the reference in the first place.</li>

<li>There is no need to convert our ISBNs to 13 digits any faster than the libraries of the world do. Any guesses how fast the Library of Congress, or the British Library, will do it? We just need to be able to *accept* ISBN-13s that are entered in reference lists, and handle them correctly in places like Special:booksources. Curiously, the latter doesn't work yet for ISBN-13.

The problem seems to be with isbn-check.de rather than Booksources itself. Is there an alternative to isbn-check.de that we could use? The German WP uses the same isbn-check.de that we do, and notes that it is only for checking ISBN-10s.

<dd>Update. The U.S. Library of Congress provides an ISBN-converter, accepting either 10 or 13 digits, that also verifies the check digit! (It's at <a href="http://pcn.loc.gov/isbncnvt.html" class="external free" title="http://pcn.loc.gov/isbncnvt.html" rel="nofollow">http://pcn.loc.gov/isbncnvt.html</a>). Unfortunately it accepts ISBNs starting with 6, so it must not be checking the valid ranges the way isbn.org's tool does. But isbn-check.de is equally bad, because it also takes numbers starting with 6. The only converter that does everything is the one at isbn.org. To call it from Booksources, we would need to create a URL containing the ISBN to be checked, and I don't know if that site will accept such a URL. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>OK, looks like the book wrld is getting it's act together. Amazon now shows 13 and 10 digit ISBNs. BL are requesting 13 digit in all documentation according to <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">User:Rodw</a>. I've done a short test run, so let me know if there's any pages worth prioritising, or where you can check the conversion. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 10:52 <a href="../../../2/3/_/23_December_b25a.html" title="23 December">23 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</p>

<dd>Rich, I've been grabbing 13 digits anytime I find them. Is Wiki going to have heartburn over doing that? I've been using Amazon for over a week now with Abebooks as my search back-up and have just started using the full title "ISBN-13 and the number" to replace any corrections. I feel like it is a waste of time to just plug in another 10 digit replacement.<a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 18:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rich, I am done with the "B's" and off to the C row. I have begun to hate the people who have buried their isbn's under reference. It really is time consuming to read all of the text just to pull out a buried isbn.

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The Smackbot robot changed the 10 digit ISBNs to 13 digit ISBNs in <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Dispersion_Modelling_Bureau_1e02.html" title="UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau">UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau</a> and in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unit_Operations_of_Chemical_Engineering_854f.html" title="Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering">Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering</a>. As a result, one could no longer click on the ISBNs and then look them up in the Library of Congress or other libraries ... whereas one could do that with the 10 digit ISBNs. I don't know how many other articles have had the same change made by the robot. (I reverted the changes made in the above two articles).
<p>That defeats the purpose of including the ISBNs in the book citation template. Please ask User:Rich Farmbrough to stop the robot from changing to the 13 digit ISBN's until a solution is found to this problem.

<p>See the original discussion for the parts of Rich's analysis that I omitted. As you can see from my comments (higher up on the present Talk page) I don't see the urgency of converting Wikipedia's ISBNs now, so I am very comfortable with his Option 1. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even as I agree with EdJ I ask myself, what will these users do when they are faced with their own, distinct ISBN-13 number with no 10 digit to *rely* on? Why are they not asking these questions of the LoC and other libraries? Having delt with procedures with LoC in the past, I have found them to be very difficult to deal with. The impression I have always gotten has been "Our way or the highway". The keepers of ISBN's structure have created a huge flaw by not using a "Grandfathering" procedure. It is very much like the incident where Rich changed 6 novel ISBN's for books that have been in publication for 25 years because ISBN-13's new rules prohibited these books from using the assigned numbers. And just how will these books be cataloged in the future with sellers and buyers? And then there is the barcode issue whereby the whole ISBN structure may go away or the fact that some people are already looking at a 14 digit system. I would give some strong consideration before bowing to a *unofficial* cease and desist request.<a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 17:11, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

You can search on either of the two ISBNs, and provided you remove the single hyphen that they show in the ISBN-13, it will find it. Curiously, you can observe that their ISBN-13 search is actually doing a conversion to ISBN-10 before doing the lookup. (Look at the URL of the page that you find). When you give Amazon a hyphenated ISBN-10 it appears to remove the hyphens before doing the search, which should be easy to do, so I hope they fix their ISBN-13 behavior soon.</p>
<p>Abebooks.com will search on ISBN-13 and doesn't care about hyphens, but it shows only the ISBN-10 in a book entry.</p>

<dd>Hi Ed, HNY. I have been using Amazon as one of my sources and for awhile started using 13 digit ISBNs. Then Rich started getting flack and I just said "Geesh" (or words to that effect) and now all I am using is 10 digit. I figure it will be easier, all the way around to let a bot make the conversion. In many cases the title here has been bracketed. I have found that Amazon also ignores the brackets. Smart engine they have over there. As for hyphens, I gave up on them a long time ago. I do not see any value in using them. A straight number works all the time. LoC also didn't like hyphens awhile back. Coffee at my side, back to fixing stuff.<a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 17:54, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rich, EdJ. I have just received a note from a contact in Hong Kong as to the errant isbn for that subject page. He drew a big blank in searching his direct Hong Kong Library sources. The "book" in question is only 23 pages long. It strikes me as being more like a thesis paper then a book. Recommend that the faulty ISBN be struck and leave the ref. data for others.

<p>Why is the "Articles with invalid ISBNs" category in the article-space? This is meta-data (information about the article, not about the subject of the article) which is what the talk pages were created for.

<dd>Not sure about this. The ISBNs represent content that is actually *IN* the article. It's not a matter of opinion, like 'Articles that need better referencing'. That would in fact be a Talk page issue. Editors who prefer to keep invalid ISBNs in their article should be aware of the fact that they are actually presenting such ISBNs to the world. The category is a way of drawing that to their attention, and also letting readers know, since they may prefer to avoid such ISBNs. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:36, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maclean25 is right in principle, and I agree in principle. However.... Firstly most cleanup templates and categories go on article space. Secondly the template that introduces the category is located next to the dubious ISBN, thus identifing it clearly. Thirdly, as Ed points out, it does affect content. Fourthly to conform to the ideal I would need to comment out the dubious ISBN with an approprite note then add a section to the talk page, (which could be archived), which would need an extension of <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a> to be written, and then when the article was being fixed two operations would be needed. Moreover the talk page and articles would get out of sync as editing, merges and splits occurred. What I would like to see is invisible categories for self refs. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 23:26 <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_January_666e.html" title="12 January">12 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</dd>

<dd>Not sure I understand this point, Rich. Why is he fixing the ISBN and leaving the template? I have been able to fix most comics and games. I did run into a large (JP) comic version that I had to flag and leave. The data was too skimpy to locate, but a *expert* would have been able to do better. I have a very strong appreciation now for "full title, Full author's name and even for publisher's name". I have seen many titles that were incorrect and that has slowed down my ability to locate the correct information. WorldCat confuses me a bit. Sometimes they will have 3-4 ISBN's to sort through. 13 digit stands out, but I see little value in listing hardback AND paperback. Let the person viewing the page go search that out if that is an issue with them. I think it is much more important to give them the correct data to search by. I would side with using OCLC but my wife has explained that OCLC is a VERY expensive tool (20K+) to acquire and only large organizations can afford the subscription. Thanks for the head-up on all these stats gathers. <a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 17:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think, either he didn't understand the template, or didin't see it.

<dd>On the point of Worldcat being expensive, we use the free version, and I assume that all our readers can use that as well. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 19:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Huh??? I said that OCLC is very expensive. It is a subscription service that major libraries and research firms use. OCLC is more of a research tool rather then a cataloging tool. <a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 20:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, OCLC "catalogs" in respect to inter-library loans. WorldCat is a division of the OCLC central product line. <a href="../../../e/k/o/User%7EEkotkie_083c.html" title="User:Ekotkie">Ekotkie</a> 17:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
