<li><b>Comments</b> - I think that the "only 6 songs made into music videos" needs to be removed. What is with <i>only</i>? 6 seems like a lot. It's biased criteria of notability. Surely similarily famous bands have lest. This song as a chart topper should be kept. Lordi has two internationally notable songs: Hard Rock Hallelujah, and Devil is a Loser (their widely used response to Satanist criticisms).--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 02:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Not entirely so. While the Notability of Songs proposal is no longer active, making the top 20 in a "large or medium sized country" was part of that proposal. I'd argue that Finland is large enough or medium sized enough to qualify. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that proposal was rejected by the community, so it's a moot point. As <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> stands, multiple third party <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7Ereliable_sources_0c71.html" title="WP:reliable sources">WP:reliable sources</a> are needed that discuss the song as their primary topic.

<ul>
<li>It probably would be a good idea to discuss primary topics, since not a single one of those links mentions the song in more than one sentence. Several are blogs, as well, which would not count for notability even if they were primarily about the song. And the top 40 charts! What is the point of bringing this up again? Tens of thousands of songs make top charts! That doesn't mean those songs get to have articles. The german site you came up with for one of the other songs was good, although for that song there's still a need for at least one other reliable source to make it "multiple". That's the sort of coverage we're looking for here. Isn't there anything comparable for this song? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In short, no, there doesn't appear (at least to me) to be anything comparable, which I find interesting. As far as the blogs are concerned, I'll repeat my comments in the other AfD where we've exchanged views, which are that where no other references exist, blogs are all we have. Given that we're talking about singles, which tend not to get reviewed in the music press short of a mention that X has released Y as a single, the fact that this particular single has attracted <i>any</i> mention at all would appear to be an argument for its notability. In terms of the charts issue, in this case my response is two-pronged. Firstly, I'll repeat my question of what else a song can do other than reaching number 1. Yes, lots of songs do this, but it's a considerable achievement to do so regardless of how many do it. Thus, if a song verifiably reached number 1, which this one did, why does that not count either way? Secondly, given that this song appeared not only in the Finnish charts but also those of three other countries, surely that must count for something as well, or does it simply suffer from appearing in the charts of the wrong countries? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What else can a song do besides reach number 1? See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagine_%28song%29.html" title="Imagine (song)">Imagine (song)</a> for an example. It can be the topic of media coverage. It can be a subject of artistic criticism. It can be deconstructed. There's a great deal that can happen to make a song repeatedly notable, besides simply being a chart topper and then fading away and apparently never being written about. I wish we could discuss this without making insinuations about geography. I don't care what country it was number 1 in. I've only said repeatedly that number 1 anywhere doesn't matter. Since I have clearly said that, why would you assume that I don't mean it? Why does this have to be about geography? As for blogs, well, the fact simply is that you can't write a verifiable article with blogs. Blogs don't have editorial oversight, so they aren't reliable sources. It may be that many songs' claims to notability comes from blogs. This should be taken as an indication that these songs are not notable enough to have their own article here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, other things can happen to a song in certain situations. However, not all songs happen to be written by people who are venerated as deities of the songwriter's art. Neither are they necessarily going to be deconstructed and so on just a year after they were released. The fact remains, however, that this particular song has already achieved some kind of notability by reaching number 1 in one country and charting elsewhere. Precedent has been that a song released by a notable band and reaching number 1 is notable of itself, and currently I'm leaning towards the view that the argument to delete is based on a needlessly restrictive reappraisal of notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Means very little. The number of songs that have been chart toppers is huge, and this alone doesn't make it possible to write an article about them. The point of asking for multiple independent reliable sources is that without such articles, there's no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> content that can ever be added to the article. If the article can't be verified with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, then the article can't be written on Wikipedia.

<li>Your reply to Jules above is fallacious. I would also advise you that challenging every vote you disagree with by repeating or citing the same point repeatedly is not very useful.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. A No. 1 hit single in a significant country is unquestionably notable. The nominator appears to be setting an absurdly high bar for song notability, one that would sweep <i>most</i> existing song articles out of Wikipedia if applied consistently. As for having articles about every other single that topped the charts in a significant country, I have to ask "why not" - as Wikipedia is not paper, the primary limitation is the number of editors who are willing to write such articles and enjoy doing so. A few years ago in Wikipedia, only unknown songs by unknown bands were nominated for deletion. Is Wikipedia now so pushed for space that we have to start deleting <i>Number 1 singles</i> by significant bands? Is this <i>really</i> what the AfD/VfD process was created for? <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, AFD <i>really</i> was created fro getting rid of articles that shouldn't exist. There's nothing that can be written about this song beyond a stub, because there are no sources of notabilty and thus verifiability. If an article can never expand beyond a stub, then it must be merged. There's nothing absurdly high about these criteria. I am only asking for what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is asking for: "<i>the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</i>" And nobody is presenting those. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:54, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe articles about major hit singles by notable artists absolutely <i>should</i> exist on Wikipedia. You have used a strict and subjective interpretation of the WP:N guidelines in judging that the subject is non-notable. Imposing notability criteria which exclude no.1 hit singles by major artists <i>is</i> setting an absurdly high bar for song notability. As per Cpt. Morgan, I do not understand why you feel the need to reply to and individually disparage each "keep" comment. You are entitled to your opinion just as the "keep" contributors are entitled to theirs. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 18:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Reply to and individually disparage?" This isn't simply about opinions that aren't to be challenged. We're not talking about tastes in music here. This is a discussion worth having and I intend to give every argument its hearing. I don't think there's anything wrong with letting someone know why I disagree with their argument and trying to engage them further. If I didn't respect anyone's arguments then I wouldn't bother. (I also wouldn't bother if it was clear I was wrong, but I don't see that yet. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 21:55, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Lordi surely is a notable band and because this song is part of what makes Lordi fullfill the notability criteria for music ("Has had a charted hit on any national music chart."), see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, the song itself should also have its own article. And one <b>comment</b>: please stop defending this nomination so vigorously with replies to each and every keep vote. People are allowed their opinions and these will all be weighted in by the closing admin, you do not have to explain to the closing admin why <i>you</i> do not agree with some of the votes.

<li>I am not explaining anything to the closing admin. I am trying to get other&#160;!voters to engage in discussion beyond their initial comment. There's nothing wrong with that and I won't be intimidated into stopping. I have every right to ask for further discussion.
