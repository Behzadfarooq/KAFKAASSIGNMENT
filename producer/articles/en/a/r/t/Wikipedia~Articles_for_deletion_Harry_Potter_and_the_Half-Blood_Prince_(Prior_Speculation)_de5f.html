<p>As was mentioned before, the article is too much about speculation (even the title says so), and although it is "prior to the release," it is still speculation. However, this could be moved into the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://harrypotter.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter Wiki</a>, where it would be very welcome.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, useless - utterly useless. <i>This is an encyclopedia</i>. Not a historical record of speculation by fans for <i>a</i> book. I know Potter is a highly successful and popular book series, but that doesn't excuse it.

<li><b>Very strong delete</b>. This <i>is</i> speculation all the same, whether it was confirmed or unconfirmed, it is still. Especially the parts that were <i>not</i> confirmed.

<li>What is your definition of speculation? Speculation is where people guess what will happen. Confirmed information is where JK Rowling says "this will be in it". <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonic_Mew_47a9.html" title="User talk:Sonic Mew">talk to me</a> 20:41, July 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So tell me. What's this confirmed information doing in it's own article titled "Prior Speculation"? If it's confirmed, notable, and encyclopedic then it should be noted on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> - not on its own article. This makes absolutely no sense. Merge what is notable and delete. I don't understand why so many people wish to keep (regardless of a VFD recently concluding).

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> (obviously). I'd have moved it to somewhere else instead of "prior speculation", except what would you call it? "Prior revelations"? "prior hints"? Just because "speculation" has evil scary anti-wiki connotations doesn't mean it shouldn't be used where it is appropriate, and seeing as it survived VfD, I don't see how the new title suddenly makes it turn nonencyclopedic in a puff of magic smoke. I mean, could I have in theory completely reversed the original decision into a consensus to delete had I renamed it Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (List of Original Vain Fancrufty Speculative Research Links)? Wicked awesome, I'll keep that trick in mind next time I want to get rid of a page. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 04:57, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>.

<li><b>Merge the important bits and delete</b>. I agree that the material here is interesting and relevant for showing, say twenty years from now, some history of this book's impact on Harry Potter fans (and a witness to how strong a hold the book series had on some). It should first be put as it is in the main article (so that people can use the history to see that revision when this article is deleted). Immediately after, a revision should be made so that the main article contains a section of a few paragraphs concerning the speculation the book generated. — <a href="../../../o/l/a/User%7EOlathe_6582.html" title="User:Olathe">Olathe</a> 06:33, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Harry Potter phenomenon has become so large these days that it is fascinating to look at the amount of spin-off it generates- including predictions, hoax 'insider' info etc. Predictions were a very real part of life in the run-up to to the book and as such deserve to be immortalised. 192.250.97.6 10:02, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have just taken my own advice and browsed some pages regarding the deletion process. Turns out that "Merge", "Redirect" etc. are actually considered variants of "Keep" (though obviously if there is a reasonable amount of calls to Merge, Redirect, Rename or any such action the admin might decide it to constitute a rough consensus and the result will differ accordingly). I can see the logic behind this in the sense that somebody voting to merge, if the vote depended on them, would probably rather have the content stay at its own page than deleted altogether. Of course many voters are aware that their votes are subject to interpretation and therefore clarify their priorities (e.g. a merge vote of the sort you described would be something to the extent of "<b>Merge</b>, failing that <b>Delete</b>.") --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 13:41, July 31, 2005 (UTC)
